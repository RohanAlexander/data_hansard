2,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,".Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) 1""3.21 - I moveTliat the Houso nt its rising adjourn until ] 1 a.m. tomorrow. As honourable members are aware, it is at present contemplated that Parliament shall rise at the end of the present week over the period of the visit of the American Fleet, and as thore is a considerable amount of business to be got through, it will, I think, suit the convenience of honourable members generally to meet tomorrow at 11 a.m.",12
3,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [ 8 . 8 ] - I do not desire to raise any opposition to the motion, but I question whether it is necessary for the House to meet at 11 o'clock tomorrow, since, if the procedure adopted last night is continued, it will be quite an easy matter for the Government to get the. whole of its business through by to-night. I do not know-how much business the Government desires to go on with, but it might clear the sheet if it so desired. I hope that the Prime M i nister, in asking tlint the House shall meet at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning, in tends to indicate that lie is prepared to permit during the committee stage the intelligent discussion of the Immigration Bill , the second reading debate on which was closured last evening. re- Question resolved in the affirmative. ORDER OF BUSINESS .",12
4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) \ 3 A \ - I move That Government business take precedence of private members' business on tbo next clay of sitting. To-morrow is private members' day, and, in view of the proposed three weeks' adjournment and the necessity of getting through a certain amount of legislation now on the notice-paper, the Government desires the opportunity of proceeding with its own business.'",12
5,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The Prime Minister might say - whether the Government has a long list of important measures which it desires to get through.,13
6,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"There are certain measures, and, in particular, the Immigration Bill, with which the Government desires to deal, but the list is not long. I I wish to give the fullest possible opportunity for the discussion of that measure in committee. The motion will afford greater opportunity for its discussion, and has been submitted mainly for that reason. Question resolved in the affirmative. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS. PAIRS. Mr J. FRANCIS - I wish to make a personal explanation. My name does not appear in the division lists, nor does it appear in the lists of pairs in connection with the divisions taken last evening on the second-reading debate on the Immigration Bill. I spoke on the measure and indicated very definitely that I supported the measure. During the week the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) approached me, and asked me for a pair. I agreed to pair with him on the bill from after the dinner adjournment last evening. I regret to say that that pair was not honoured by ihe honourable member.  the "" gag "" was moved. Mr J. FRANCIS - Three divisions took place last night, and my name does not appear in any of the division lists, or in any of the lists of pairs. In each of these divisions the honourable member for Capricornia voted. I regret to have to make this explanation, and I regret more particularly the circumstances that make it necessary.",13
7,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I wish to make a. personal explanation in reference to that just made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr J. Francis). It is true, as the honourable member has said, that he and I agreed to pair on the Immigration Bill ; but I should like to explain special circumstances under which pair was not observed. The honourable member for Moreton, in my presence, asked the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) to grant him a pair. The honourable member, for Gwydir agreed to do so, but as he had not spoken on the bill, I agreed to pair with the honourable member for Moreton, because I had already expressed my views in opposition to the bill. When the honourable member for Gwydir rose to speak last night on the second reading of the bill and to give his views against the measure, the "" gag "" was moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce). I was reminded by my leader and by the whip of the party on this side, that when the "" gag "" is moved all pairs are disregarded. The Prime Minister severely criticized honourable members on this side for refraining from speaking on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply; that is, for not wasting time on that motion. We then asked the Government to bring down their measures so that we could discuss them. A very important measure was under consideration last evening, and several honourable members on this side, including the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), the honourable member for Grey (Mr. Lacey), and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), wished to state their views upon it , but they were deprived of the opportunity to do so. This party has decided that when the gag is moved all pairs go by the board. I regret that circumstances arose which caused the breaking of my pair with the honourable member for Moreton. When I agreed to pair with him I had every intention of observing that agreement, but, understanding that when the "" gag "" is moved pairs are off, and being reminded of that by my leader and the Whip, I decided that the pair should not stand. The Government put up the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) to make out a fictitious case, and then, by moving the ""gag,"" prevented honourable members on this side from replying to it. I regret the circumstances which prevented my observance of the pair.",13
8,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire, also, to make a personal explanation. the Yesterday I arranged a pair with the the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews). I was here, and able to vote, if: I . chose tot da so, bait, as the honourable! memberte Melbouriie; Ports had gone* home, I . honoured ray, pair, and refrained: from voting. SHIPPING DISPUTE, FORMAE MOTION OF ADJOURNMENT.",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"E f . Hon. W. A. Watt). - I have received an intimation from the honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chariton-)* that hedesires to move theadjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely , "" The necessity for the Prime Minister toconvene, at asnference of the partiesto the shipping dispute."" Five, honourable members having risen i'« their pteres,. Question proposed..",14
10,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Humter) [8.13J Tho present positi-oofe im regard to the 1 shipping dispute is. very serious. It is-, fchereiare\ necessary that everything possible should be done, topreven-t an industrial upheaval, in Australia which is likely to disrupt commerce and industry, and to* bring in its train suffering and in j u r y to thousands' of people. It is not my»wish to impart any party; feelingi n to this, debate. This matter is. above party, and. therefore in the best interests of the Commonwealth all party feeling should be sunk. I wish to placeon secocd the happenings which have led up to this dispute- I shall say nothing, I hope, to reflect on. the pasties, to it,, or towiden the breach, between (-hem. I . want,, if possible,, to bring those parties, together, so that, in the best inr terests of the. Gommonweal'th,. the troublecan be amicably settled. The disputeoriginated some time ago, in connection with, trouble between the seamen and the ship-owners. As a result-, an application waa made to. the Arbitratio n Court by the Attorney-General and the C'om> monwealth Steamship Owners Association, for the deregistration of the Segment's Union of Australia. Judgment was given by Mi .. Justice Powers on the 6th February, 1925, and was reported in t V newspapers as follows : His Honour pointed out that the present was the first time the application for deregistration had been made'. He eould not understand the Government aekiing. for the unAon'sdeiegistea,tion wilile. work was going, on. If the unionwere, deregistered when the men were, at work that would cause the worse industrial war that ever Happened ib Australia. Certain men had. done things - for whiehthey could be prosecuted. If. the men had not worked under the award he had the papers ready to sign for the union's deregistration. Did' counsel think it was> in the interests of the publicthat another unionsliould be formed-it would, be termed an employees' union-and that an industrial war should be co-used? There is great wisdom in Judge. Powers' statement.. Every man who> is. interested 1 in industrial matters, knows that in dustrial, warfare will ultimately be the outcome of deregjatration. However^, 1 His Honour at that time refused to degi'ster the union. Then,, on the 1st May,, I925-, another application was made f o the Arbitration Court by the Commonwealth Shipping. Board', and the CommonwealthSteamship Owners' Association. I want honourable members to bear in mind that in the first, instance the Attor1 ney-General, and in the second instance the Comsmonwearth ShippingB'oardi, made application to the court; so that in both instances the CommonweaMh, with the ship-owners of this country, was a party to the application for deregistration.. The second' application was heard before Mr Deputy President 1 Webb, in* Melbourne^ on the 21'sfi May.. 1925. I do not intend to quote his judgment, But the judge ordered the Seamen's Union to put the Wromamga and (he DBga into commission. The union refused ,, and, tliejudge ordered that the award should cease after the 5th June. 1925: The award accordingly ceased to operate, and the present dispute arose. On the 3Q.th June a deputation waited on the Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce).. It was. composed o i representatives of the transport unions in New South Wales and, I ' think, Victoria. They were Mr J.. S'. Gursdeu, secretary of the Sydney Ti-adesi and Labour Council; Alderman B . Mullens,, organizer of the Sydney branch of the Waterside. Workers' Federation; andMessrs.. C, Crofts, president, and Ma'.. E . J.. Holloway,. secretary of theMelbourne Trades H all Industrial Disputes Committee. At that interview it was pointed outf, to> the, Plriime Minister by Mir. Croftsi that they had come, tesee M m i a the-- hopeo-fi agreeing u?ea> soanp means by which industrial disputes,, and' paa-ticularly the seaimen's difficulty,, couilid! ho taifeen ini. hand bef ome they had caused mdnstirial tUTmoil'. Mu. Holloway said that he thoiught it quite reasomable for' the: seanmtnito want soanae guarantee in 'their articles that tihe conditions agreed upoii under arbitration should be observed. Mr Garden was reported in the press as follows""The transport group proposed that, in the event of a dispute 'occurring, instead of a ship Jjeing held up .during ;tihe period of 'her articles representatives - of the seamen and a'epresentatives of the shipping companies .sliould meet at a round table conference. If a settlement were not arrived at the States Disputes Committee would be brought into play. Failing settlement by that committee, it was suggested that .the matter be .dealt with by .a proposed Commonwealth Disputes Committee. Meanwliile the 'articles would toe observed, and the - sMp's <bhne-table continued. Mr Mullens saidThe seamen, an asking for an agreement, claimed that each man Should be protected iirndcr Ihis articles. The gob .control business was to be cult out, and ithe sship would proceed according to the .scheduled time-table - ships The Prime Minister, in reply, said I i 'had ibeen suggested 'by the deputation that job control WAS going - to be dealt with and got rid of. .Job control had been a breach of the award, and .tlic awoi-d in that respect had .been flagrantly disregarded. He said .also that he believed in constitutional action in regaaxl to (disputes, bu.t the job control was .the .most important matter to .be dealt with at this stage. However, fte JPriine Minister did not intervene in. .the .dispute, and took no action. Subsequent to the Prime Minister's refusal to intervene, Mr Lang, the LabonaPnemier of New South Wales, was interviewed on the matter. He took action with the result that he was able *o bring - about a settlement so far as the 'Commonwealth ShippingBoard was concerned. It is remarkable - that a state premier could come to such - an arrangement with our own Shipping - Board when the Prime Minister had done northing. In consequence of that settlement, the seamen continued to work. The newspaper rejior't of the matter reads as follows: The memorandums of the agreement were drawn up cliicfly through, the agency of the - Premier of New Souflk Wales (Mr Lang). These - wienie signed on behalf of the Australian Commonwealth .Shipping JBoard by Admiral Sir W. Clarkson and Mr R. Farquhar, directors, and Mr W. Lewis, secretary, while the unions represented among the signatories were:-Fede rated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen, prasident G-. E. Moate.; secretary .New South Wales branch, B. J. Heffron; general secretary, A. H . Moate; Federated'Ships' Painters - and 'Dockers, J. MACDonaM; Marine Cooks, Butchers, and Bakers Association of Australia, J. Tudehope, secretary; Waterside Workers Federation, W. H. Seale, secretary; Sydney Coal Lumpers Union, F. A. Hale, secretary, A. E. O'Brien president; Federated Shipwrights - Union, S. Shearer, secretary. That is a formidable list of representatives of the ""waterside and transport workers' unions. The report prooeedsThe unions' memorandum of agreement pledged the signatories to guarantee the fulfilment of the conditions of employment as contained in the federated seamen's award in operation on the 4th Jnne, 1925, to be attatflied to .ships' articles under which members of the Seamen's Union .sign on. Tliey further agreed not to countenance any action of members of the said union that would - be calculated to either delay or hold up the sailing ol any .step during the cunrency of the ship's arlacles. .Should the Seamen's Union flout the agreement under which, they have signed on any vessel, and persist in preventing the sailing of or exercise job control, the group promised to bring all the pressure it could to bear on that union to observe the conditions aforesaid, and if the union continued in its attitude it would be isolated from the group. In the event of tliose measures not being successful, ithe transport group agreed it would not oppose any measures affecting the manning of .shipB to permit of their continued running. The Australian Shipping Board undertook on its part - to endorse the ships' articles, and attacli thereto the wages and conditions of era-ployment under which the members of .the Federated Seamen's Union were employed on the 4th day of June, 1925, as the wages and conditions to govern the employment of the .said members of the Seamen's Union during - the currency of the ships' articles on which - they signed. Under elate 6 th July, Bear-Admiral Olarkson wrote to the Premier of New South Wales (Mr Lang), as follows:Clause we propose to endorse on articles will rcead:- These articles, as far as bosun, able seamen, lamp trimmers, storekeepers, donkeymen, greasers, firemen, trimmers, ordinary seamen and crews' attendants are concerned, .arc subject to the wages and conditions as set out in ""the seamen's award prior to its cancellation by the Deputy President of the Arbitration Court on the 4th June last. . . . You will notice that we do not propose any machinery for dealing with disputes. We will sincerely observe the conditions' - of the late award,, and if the .seamen do the same there s'hould be no dispute. We 'fihink that the wording, as suggested previously by the Seamen's Union, would invite disputes. I regret that - at the moment I am unable to give you any assurance that the Steamship Owners Federation will agree to any clause giving the late award a place in the articles. My board wishes to thank you very sincerely for the action you have taken to bring about a settlement of this difficult situation, and trusts th.it your efforts will be the means of bringing in a new era of industrial peace. Mr Lang rendered the community good service by his intervention, but a State Premier has not the same standing in the community as the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. While he has some influence in state affairs, he has not very much in Commonwealth matters. ' After Mr Lang's successful intervention in so far as the Shipping Board was concerned, a delegation consisting of Mr J. S. Garden, secretary of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council; Mr A . H . Moate, of the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen; and Mr J. Tudehope, secretary of the Marine Cooks, Butchers, and Bakers Association of Australia, came to Melbourne to interview the ship-owners, with a view to securing their signature to the agreement. ' I do not think it - necessary to quote the press reports of the deputation's actions. It is sufficient to say that certain conditions that were acceptable to the Commonwealth Shipping Board were not acceptable to the Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association, which desired to settle the question of job control once and for all. Although the deputation was unable to effect a settlement of the dispute with the shipowners, I wish honourable members to understand definitely that up to the time it left Melbourne to return to Sydney the door of negotiation was still open. No doubt, after the men's representatives returned to Sydney an endeavour would have been made to submit to the shipowners some definite proposal in. regard to job control, but, unfortunately, the ultimatum which was issued yesterday brought about the withdrawal of the men from the ships. That, undoubtedly, accentuated the difficulties of the position. I have drawn attention to these salientpoints in the dispute so that honourable members may focus their minds upon them. At the moment I am saying nothing whatever as to the merits of the dispute. The fact that we have to face is that a dispute has occurred between two parties, both of whom may be wrong in some degree, and neither of whom is, I expect, entirely right. The time has arrived, in my opinion, when some definite action should be taken by the Prime Minister. I say that in all earnestness, andwithout any party feeling whatever, ff these were the last words that I uttered I should say that there is no party feeling in this at all, as far as I am concerned. Mr Charlton. I have had a lifetime of experience in these matters. I can recall many of tha serious disputes of the past. I know what they mean to the community. I know the suffering that they entail on women . and children, to say nothing whatever about the men. I know how necessary it is to keep the wheels of industry moving. For these reasons I wish that the Prime . Minister may intervene without delay. I can carry niy.mind back a few years io the time of the greatest upheavals that the coal trade in Australia has ever known. I approached the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who was then Prime Minister, and urged him to intervene. He did so and the contending parties were brought together. A settlement of the dispute followed, and there has been no trouble in the coal trade since then. It was a magnificent piece of work in the interests of Australia. The ex-Prime Minister realized the importance of his.position, stepped into the breach, and brought about a settlement of that great dispute. No one can say how much that has meant to the prosperity of our country. But I can also carry my mind back a little further, to the time when there was another upheaval in the mining industry of New South Wales. The then Premier (Mr Wade) had what is known as the Coercion Act passed, and many of the miners' leaders were imprisoned. But that did not heal the breach. It aggravated the trouble. It cannot be said that I was not ready to intervene at that time. I did so, notwithstanding that I wa3 then seeking election to this Parliament for the first time. .1 risked defeat at that election, but I felt that it was my duty to do everything I could to bring about a settlement of the dispute. I was in contact with both parties and talked with them for many hours day after day in order to find some ground on which a settlement could be made. Surely those two experiences have some message for us at this juncture. I believe very strongly that the Prime Minister should intervene. I am not making these statements in a threatening way. I believe from the j bottom of my heart that the Government ought to exhaust every possible means lo settle a dispute of this magnitude. We should endeavour to get the parties together. I cannot divulge what I have been doing, but before the Immigration Bill was introduced I was working quietly on this dispute. I have not been idle, and I have every reason to believe that if the Prime Minister will take steps to bring the parties together at a round-table conference, the dispute will be settled satisfactorily, and normal conditions quickly resumed. In dealing with this question, do not let us be blinded by prejudice, or pay too much regard to what any individual may have done. The question for lis to consider is, what should we do at this, the psychological moment for action?' If we do not act now we shall be too late, for the dispute has continued too long already. No .body of men, whether employers or employees, could refuse an invitation issued by the Prime Minister to meet in conference. The Prime Minister could sit as chairman, and hold the scales of justice evenly. I believe that nothing but good would result from such action, and the Prime Minister himself would achieve a triumph, for both parties are willing to settle the dispute if they can see how to do it. There is no means, except action by the Government, of getting the two parties to meet and discuss the dispute. The people of Australia during the next few weeks will be entertaining the officers and men of the American Fleet, and it is difficult to say what will happen if the strike continues for another week. When our guests arrive, they may find all the capital cities of Australia in darkness. In that event, what could we do with them? The admiral in command would certainly not allow his men. however well-behaved, to come ashore to a city that was in darkness, and where there was industrial turmoil. The continuance of the strike would prevent us from doing our duty by our guests. That aspect of the question, however, is trivial beside the larger question of the welfare of the Commonwealth. No honourable member . desires to see an industrial upheaval in this country at the present time. The wheels of industry should not be clogged, but they may be if every effort is not made to bring the parties together. Were I in the Prime Minister's place, I should not hesitate, and few men would. I do not think he will. If any individual has clone anything against the law of the land, he should be dealt with according to that law; but in considering this greatquestion, which affects every person in Australia, our views of certain individuals should not prevent action being taken for the common good. I am not making this request to the Government for party reasons. The dispute has got beyond the stage at which party capital might be made from it. All I can. see is that injury is being done to the Commonwealth. I again appeal to the Prime Minister to convene this conference. The conference could meet in about two days, and in two or three days after that a settlement would probably be reached. How much better would that be for the future prosperity and development of this Commonwealth than allowing the dispute to continue? Contrast the result of a settlement with what is likely to happen if the wheels of industry are stopped, if hunger stalks through the land, and if thousands of people in every state are thrown out of employment. Parliament,-if it does not take action, will sink in the estimatien of the people of this country. I implore the Prime Minister, with all the earnestness I can command, to act immediately, and I repeat again that if he takes steps to call a conference I believe a settlement will be reached within three or four days.",14
11,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.36] - The question raised by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) is of fundamental importance at the present moment to all the people of Australia. It should certainly be discussed by honourable members without any party feeling, and with the utmost restraint, because it is impossible to calculate the harm that could be done by imprudent utterances by responsible men at such a time as this. In reply to the honourable member, I purpose merely to explain the present position. Honourable members are familiar' with recent events in connection with the dispute, but they should also inform themselves of what happened earlier, for upon those happenings they must decide whether it is practicable to bring about the desired settlement. The question of the de-registration of the Seamen's Union arose early in the present year, but there had been for a considerable time previously a large amount of friction with the union. A practice loosely known, as "" job control "" had grown up, and had led to innumerable difficulties in the shipping industry, with stoppages of vessels and consequent greatloss, suffering, and distress to the whole, community. The dispute: about jobcontrol is hot new, for as far back as February, 1921, an agreement . was entered into between the Seamen's Dindon and the. owners, in which it was, specificallylaid, down that the policy of securing' alterations by the adoption of so-called "" job' control"" is hereby waived. Tinder that agreenien*, the policy of job control was completely repudiated, and the union undertook that it would not be continued; but, unfortunately, it was continued. In March, 19-23, after much friction, the Arbitration Court made an award, in which job control was specifically forbidden. That award define? ""jobcontrol"" as follows:""Job control"" includes any attempt by members of the organization, or any ef them, to enforce industrial conditions: other than those prescribed or recognized by the Court or by the Navigation Act. or any competent authority thereunder, either by refusing to offer for or accept work on any particular vessel or vessels, by refusing or failing to carry out. the work on any particular vessel or vessels, or by any methods other than those provided by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, or by the. methods of ordinary negotiation. Still the practice continued, and the whole community recognized that the policy of job control was doing injury to the seamen and to the whole community. But, unfortunately, owing to the views heldby certain members of the union, neither the undertaking in the original agreement nor the terms of the Arbitration Court'saward was observed. Joh control was persisted in, and the position was so acute at the beginning of thei present year that it. became necessary, unless the. authority of the Arbitration Court, which was created by this Parliament, was to be flouted and the court itself brought into contempt, that some action should be taken against the union. The ILeader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton} mentioned that the Commonwealth Government made the first application for the deregistration of the union. It is oneof the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government, Mr Bruce. party may; be in power,, to uphold the authority of the, Arbitration Court, so lon/r as, it exists under a statute of this Parliament. The application for deregistration was dealt with by the court, and early in January there appeared some prospect of a settlement. The seamen appeared to have realized; the disastrous results that were flowing from their tactics, audi an undertaking was actually given by their leader that job control would be. discontinued. But, notwithstanding Mr Walsh's undertaking, job control was still pursued, and it became necessary latter in the year for the President, of the. Arbitration Court, to take definite and drastic action. Mr Justice Powers, addressing Mr Walsh, had saidThenas, to toe othei< mattess. that may be hi dispute, he undertakes,, on hehalf of the union, that they will be settled by a conference, and that they will continue to carry on until those matters are settled by the conference,, or, in the event of the-, conference failing to settle, by the court. Mr Walsh - That is correct. Honourable members will see that Mr. Walsh subscribed to that undertaking in January of this year. Yet the union was againii» court m March,, when Mr Justice Powers referred to the fact that job control was still beingpractised, and that the undertaking given earlier' in the year was not being honoured!. The position was such that, unless the court was to be held in contempt by ship-owners, members of unions, and the public generally, action had to be taken. Accordingly, in June, the Seamen's Union was deregistered. Everybody must recognize that, while the union was under the protection of the Arbitration Court,, better conditions were secured in the Australian mercantile marine than obtain in any other shipping service in the world, and it. is lamentable that the seamen hav& left the shelter of the court. I am perfectly certaintbat that view is shared by every honourable member in this House. We have no desire to criticize the seamen, for most of us feel that they have been misled^ It is a great misfortune to them and the community that they have been placed in their present position, but. itisi necessary to bear in mind the facts' I have related, because the pos^ sibilityof a settlement of the dispute whatever depends, largely upon the value to be placed' upon any undertaking that may be given by the seamen's union. The. deregistration of - the unioam and the cancellation of the Arbitration. Court's atwa-rd operated from the 1st June of this year. The leader of the union suggested in court that the seamen had been singled out for hostile treatment, and had been almost persecuted. The facts do not support that allegation. When that suggestion was made during, the deregistration proceedings, Mr Deputy President Webb said It is not open to doubt that this union is acting in defiance of the? principles of arbitration. It has, however,, endeavoured to excuse itself by suggesting, that the applicants' in this case have endeavoured to. evade the award' of the court. It has not attempted to prove this, in any way, and it is difficult on the face of thefactsto understand how such a contention could be substantiated . These respondents, arc bound; by a large number of', awards of this court. These awards are made at the instance of toe Merchant Service Guild,, the Australian Institute of Marine and"" Power Engineers-, the Waterside Workers, the Marine Cooks, Butchersand Bakers, the Federated Ship's' PaintersandDockers; the Federated Shipwrights, Ship Contractors and Boat Builders, the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, the Radio Telegraphists' Institute, the Federated Engine Drivers, and Firemen's Association, the Australian Clerical Association (tally clerks)', the Amalgamated Engineering Union,, the Australian Society of Engineers, the Federated Society of Boilermakers and Iron Shipbuildersof Australia. All those organizations, are associated with and work, side; by side with the members of the seamen's union in the shipping industry. They find' it possible to remain within the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court,, and follow their occupations without constant disputes such as arise in connection with the seamen's union. We are* therefore, forced to the conclusion that there, are: peculiar influences in that union which are causing the constant friction between its members, and the employers. Following, the derregistration of the seamen's union,, other industrial organizations recognized that a serious position had developed, and they endeavoured to bring about a settlement of thedispute. A deputation from the transport unions waitedupon me and urged that I should convene a conference which would give to the seamen's union practically every advantage which it had emjoyed under the Arbitration Court award. I pointed m t that as' head of the' Government which was responsible fox upholding the authority of the court,. I could not take the action suggested. The. seamen had defied the court, and they had no right to ask that another tribunal, should be set up for their advantage; I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the coalminers to whom he referred were not acting in open defiance of the court as the seamen are. I could not possibly intervene at the stagewhen a deputation waited upon me. and I suggested that there should bo further negotiations between the ship-owners and the seamen. Since that date an arrangement has. been entered into between the seamen and the Commonwealth Shipping Line. The private ship-owners were invited to subscribe to the same arrangement. I under1 stand that they signified their readiness Co consider the suggestion, but they doubted whether the transport organization had the power to: discipline the seamen's union as they undertook to do. They pointed out that the court had never been able to discipline the seamen-, and we have evidence that at the very time when other unions were offering an undertaking to the ship-owners^ Mr Walsh was writing, newspaper articles in whichhestill advocated job control. The representatives of the shipping companies said that if the other unions could show that they had power to discipline the seamen an amicable settlement would be possible. That settlement could not, however, be upon the basis of the agreement with the Commonwealth Shipping Line, to which the. seamen's union was not a party; it was necessary that that union should be a signatory to any arrangement that might be entered into for the settlement of this dispute. An agreement could not be made with other unions^ and the seamen's union: allowed tostand, aloof from it. I think that possibly the seamen's union can be induced to sign an agreement,, but the attitude of the owners was that until the other unions gave evidence cf their ability to discipline, the seamen the agreement would be worthnothing. They said, also-,, that they could not continue to negotiate with men who had issued athreat that on the 14th July they would strike and hold the country toransom unless everything, for which they asked was conceded before that date, The delegates from the transport unions returned to Sydney, and I regret that they were not able to discipline the seamen and ensure that the threatened strike would not occur. I think it is still possible for something to be done to bring these men to their senses. If the seamen persist in holdingup the community, I think that, with the assistance of other unions, and the discipline which-1 believe they can bring to bear, it will still be possible to settle this matter. I suggest that at this stage it would be very ill advised to debate the matter here. The Leader of the Opposition has put his case at length, and has made his suggestions. It is my responsibility to determine what my action shall be. I can assure honourable members opposite that I am as desirous as they can be of seeing the present lamentable state of affairs ended, aud an arrangement come to uuder which the ships will again be in commission, and what has been a menace to the whole industrial movement of Australia, and indeed to the whole of its people, during the last few years will be removed. I ask for the present that honourable members should leave the inatter where it is. It would be very undesirable to have a. discussion of the matter in this Parliament as a result of which at any moment passions might be inflamed and a great deal of harm might be done.",17

13,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Have statements been made by Air ViceMarshal Sir Sefton Brancker, Director of Civil Aviation, and Commander Burney, M.P., that air-ships would probablv make a flight to Australia in 1927? 2. Will arrangements be made with the British Government that Australian aviators and mechanics who may from time to time be sent to England may receive the necessary instruction in air-ship handling, in order to render them fit to replace air-ship ratings should the occasion so arise on the arrival of the airship in Australia? 3. Has the erection of mooring masts at Darwin, Melbourne, and Sydney, with the necessary fuel supplies, and also air-ship hangars at Melbourne and Sydney, yet been considered?",20
14,Mr BRUCE,Unknown," - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:]. The Government has no knowledge of a definite statement being made .to the effect that, air-ships will probably fly to Australia in 1927. It is understood that B.33, now under repair, will be used for experimental flying in Egypt, and that two 'new air-ships now being manufactured in England (one by the Imperial Government, the other by Commander Bnrney's company) will be completed in 1927, and that a service will then be established between England and India. The matter of an extension of the service to Australia will bo one for discussion between the Commonwealth and Imperial Governments. 2-. The only air-craft pilots and mechanics now employed by the Commonwealth Government are those trained in the operation of heavier-than-aiicraft. The operation of lighter-than-air craft calls for special training, which could not be made use of at the moment; .but as lighter-than-air craft will, no doubt, at sonic future date be used in connection with air defence, any opportunity ior instructing personnel in the handling of this craft will be made use of. . 3. The form of the Government's co-operation in the air-ship development programme has not yet been considered in detail. POSTMASTER - GENERAL 'S DEPARTMENT. MILITAUVDUTY OF OFFICERS.",20

If an area officer reduces a full day's drill to la half-day's drill, is the officer of the Postmaster-General's Department credited with a full day's drill, or must he make up his hours of drill?",20
16,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. Area officers have been instructed by the Defence Department to interview postmasters at the smaller offices to make special arrangements, so that the work of the office will not he unduly affected by the absence of the oflicer. WQiere this has. not been done, the postmaster is authorized to get into touch with the' area officer for the same purpose, - but this authority has rarely been exercised. 3. The officer is credited wit h a half-day's d r ill . The department would, however, grant leave on another occasion required to make up the other half. ENTEETAINMENTS TAX. COST or COLLECTION. Mr J.

19,Mr BEUCE,Unknown," The answers to the honourable members questions are as follow:1. The Royal Commission on the Assessment of War Service Disabilities did recommend, inter alia,- that n permanent pension in some degree be paid where tuberculosis has resulted from war service. 2. The recommendations contained in the report of that commission are at present receiving the consideration of the Government, and it .is proposed, at an early date, to make a full statement to the House'on the subject. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. POSITIO-Sor DR. HOLMES.",21
20,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. What is the precise position, with relation to the Defence Department, of Dr Holmes, expert in military sanitation and bacteriology? 2. Has he been required by the Defence Department to sit for an examination to qualify for the rank of major as a condition of his retaining the office of Director of Hygiene? If so, does the Minister approve of such condition? 3. How was the office of Director of Hygieneestablished, and what are the qualifications?",21
21,Mr BRUCE,Unknown," The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Dr Holmes was appointed Director of Hygiene, Australian Army Medical Corps, at Army Head-quarters, on the 1st September, 1921, with the rank of captain, which was the rank held by him in the Australian Imperial Force. He was granted the temporary rank of major whilst holding such appointment. On the 1st May, 1924, he was promoted to the provisional rank of major. He still holds that provisional rank. The Defence Aet provides that, before promotion, an officer is required to pass the examination which is prescribed for officers of his corps, but permits promotion to be made provisionally, subject to that examination being passed within the prescribed time.' The time prescribed is eighteen months, and a syllabus of examination is authorized for members of the Australian Army Medical Corps. Should the examination not be passed within the prescribed time, the provisional appointment is terminated and the oflicer reverts to his lower substantive rank. 2. He has not been required to qualify for the rank of major as a condition of his retaining his appointment of Director of Hygiene. 3. The office of Director of Hygiene forms part of the post-war organization of the Australian Army Medical Service. In order to carry out the duties, the qualifications necessary are a knowledge of military organization, administration, and training, and it is essential that the officer holding the appointment should hold the Diploma of Health.

In view of her admittedly lengthly absence, and as there was doubt as to her Australian birth, she was refused admission. She was landed under writ of habeas corpus, and charged before a police court with being a prohibited immigrant.

46,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.10] - Fro m time to time the Government receives, from other Governments, information regarding undesirable persons. I shall give two illustrations to show how the clause will operate. An undesirable person may leave Great Britain at a time when the British Government has little information about him. Possibly, before, he reaches Australia, that Government has: obtained information to his detriment, and the Australian Government is accordingly notified of his departure for these shores.",26
47,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,How could he arrive here without a passport ?,26
48,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"He may have obtained a passport at the time when the British Government had little information about him. Again, when the British Government through its diplomatic or consular services obtains information that an undesirable person is sailing for Australia from any part of the world, the information is sent to the British foreign office, and, in turn, transmitted to Australia. It-is very necessary that this clause should be included in the bill.",26

54,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.16] The Prime Minister has said that an undesirable person may leave Great Britain for Australia at a time when the British Government had not sufficient information in hand to prevent his departure. It seems a weak argument, because such a person could be detained or his passport refused until full information had been obtained. A person whose character the British Government is doubtful of is undesirable from our point of view. In any case it would be an injustice to. allow him to come here and then, because of some information received from Great Britain, to compel him to return.",26
55,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.18] - The suggestion of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) - that we should take every precaution to prevent undesirable persons, from coming to Australia has our utmost sympathy, but I remind him that it would be quite impossible to maintain in Britain the staff necessary to examine every one who desires to leave for Australia. The British Government, working in conjunction with the officials of Australia House, now supplies us with a certain amount of information regarding migrants. Under the clause, we shall also have the assistance of the British consular and diplomatic service in obtaining information respecting persons comi ng from countries other than Great Britain and the Dominions. I assure the honourable member that in Great Britain and in Australia we are doing our best to prevent undesirables from coming here.

62,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [4.23] In my second-reading speech I said that I considered this clause inadequate. s t ill hold that opinion, but I do not propose to move an amendment. The clause is inadequate, for it does not providequotas, for immigrants. entirely to the. Government, which mayissue - proclamations on the matter from time, to time. The Prime Minister has said that the Government has taken action to l i m it the influx of migrants, and that the number that may be admitted from some countries has been reduced to 100. But when he attended the I m perial Conference in 1923 he agreed with the Maltese Government that the number of Maltese immigrants to Australia should be increased from 600 to 1,200 per annum. Subsequently the number was still further increased to 1,440, at which figure it now stands. I strongly object to the Government continuing, to admit hundred's of aliens into Australia every few weeks when it knows very well that thousandsof our own people are unemployed . 1 between the peoples of various countries and impose restrictions where it so desires'. In some cases-, no restriction at all is imposed. There is nothing to prevent the Italian Government from sending hundreds of Italians to Australia. I have no objection to Europeans coming here when we can absorb them, but we cannot do so at present. Our first duty is to our own people. While so many of them are unemployed we ought not to be bringing foreigners here. The Prime Minister did not indicate in his second-reading speech that the Government had any intention to alter its. policy, sen w& may expect, tha influx of these aliens to. continue. In No r t h Queensland, where so many of our own people are. unemployed, some slight disturbances have occurred between trial or other conditions, existing in the Commonwealth; Britishers, Australians, and foreign immigrants. Although we do not desire that, proclamation are in his opinion I do not see that we can expect anything unsuitable for admission into the else, seeingthat 7:5 per cent, of foreigners Commonwealth; or and only 25 per cent, of British and become readily assimilated or to Australian born, people are employed at assume the duties nnd responsi- some, of th© sugar mills. The Prime bilities of Australian citizenship Minister has told us that only a. small within a reasonable time after their entry. proportion' of our population is foreign. If that is so, it is altogether out of proportion that 75 per cent, of the' employees at some sugar mills should be aliens. Notwithstanding the existence of this state of affairs, no honourable member supporting the Government has protested against it . It has been said that I Italians must have £4'0 or a guarantee of employment by some one in Australia before they can come here. The report of the Commissioner in Queensland That is left who inquired into this matter recently made it very clear that many of them who were supposed to have £&0 really had - nothing. They were advanced the money before t'hey arrived here and paid it back immediately afterwards. The guarantee of employment is also a uselessprovision. The Royal Commissioner proved that some of the persons who have guaranteed employment for Italians in. Australia were at the time themselves unemployed.",27
63,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"We now have an arrangement with, the Italian Government by which only landed proprietors may nominate Italian immigrants'.",27
64,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Do the nominating landed proprietors guarantee to provide work for the immigrants when they It has power to discriminate' arrive. ?,27
65,Mr BHUCB,Unknown,"Th © arrangement is that the nomination form, shall be endorsed by, the' Italian Consul, and that theItalian Government shall not issue a passport to any immigrant unless the form is so endorsed.",27
66,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The arrangement is all riglit from that point of view, but what is the use of bringing immigrants here if they are not to be provided with work ? If the nominator does not guarantee that, the position is entirely unsatisfactory.",28
67,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,Intendin g immigrants must use the ordinary nominating forms.,28
68,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,My complaint is that the whole system is defective. If a landed proprietor desires to bring his countrymen here he should be responsible for providing them with work.,28
69,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,And we ought to know something about the class of work that he intends to provide for them.,28
70,Mr QHARLTON,Unknown,That is so. What right have I to cause a dozen persons to come to Australia if I cannot provide them with work?,28
71,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"The honourable member would not nominate immigrants unless he had work, for them to do.",28
72,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"There is no obligation to provide it . If I , or the able member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) or anybody else were responsible for immigrants coming here, we should also be responsible for providing them with work.",28
73,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman forgets that all nominations are made through the State Governments under the ordinary nomination system. nomination reaches the state authorities it is forwarded to the Commonwealth Government, whose responsibility it is to bring the nominated immigrant here.",28
74,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I understand the nominating system well. Under it a person who desired to bring one of his relatives to Australia could nominate him, and even secure an assisted passage for him. The method which the Government is using now is quite different. It permits unemployed persons in Australia to nominate their countrymen to come here to swell the ranks of the unemployed.",28
75,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,That is a matter for the. State Governments to watch.,28
76,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,It seems to be the desire of some honourable members to saddle .the State Governments with all responsibility. Surely it cannot be argued I i that our responsibility as a Commonwealth Parliament ceases when we land immigrants in the country.,28
77,Mr MANX,Unknown,Settlemen t is a state responsibility .,28
78,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Thing s are' in a sorry plight if it is not possible for the various State Governments to> agree with the Commonwealth Government as to the number of immigrants who shall be brought into the country. Do' honourable members opposite contend that we are entitled to bring as many people here as we choose, and then leave it to the State Governments to provide them with employment ?",28
79,Mr GABB,Unknown,The Commonwealth gains revenue through the Customs from all these people.,28
80,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so, and it leaves to the states the responsibility of providing for them. I do not think the Commonwealth Government is justified in so acting.",28
81,Mr MANN,Unknown,I do not think that it is doing so.,28
82,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) honor- seems to think that it would be right to'do that. The Commonwealth Government should have consulted the states before it entered into the agreement with the British authorities in regard to providing money for immigration purposes.,28
83,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"That agreement cannot operate unless the - states (make requisitions for money. Not a single immiWhen a grant will be brought to Australia under it , unless some state is a party to a definite arrangement.",28
84,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Why did the Government enter into the agreement before it consulted the states to ascertain their view ?,28
85,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,The states were consulted.,28
86,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,But not until after the agreement was signed.,28
87,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"No , they met us before the agreement was signed. We discussed the matter, and they stated their views. As a result of that conference alterations were made in the .agreement.",28
88,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"A f t e r the agreement was signed Mr Gillies, Premier of Queensland, stated that his Government had not agreed to it .",28
89,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,That is quite right.,28
90,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"And the Governments of New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania also did not agree to it .",29
91,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Government, after entering into an agreement with the Britisli Government, has to make agreements with the State Governments, which are at liberty to say "" Yes "" or "" No "" to the proposal.",29
92,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I contend thatbefore entering into an agreement' with the British Government ste23s should have been taken to ascertain the views of the states. Before apjn-oaching the British Government, the Commonwealth Government should have known what the State Governments were prepared to do. and how many migrants they could absorb in a given period.",29
93,Mr MANN,Unknown,The relevant point is that the states need not take any migrants under the agreement unless they are willing to do so.,29
94,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so, but I am stating what sliould have been done to conduct the negotiations in a business like way. The clause deals with aliens, and I think it will be generally admitted that more aliens are coming into Australia than we can absorb. I have no objection to migrants if we can absorb them.",29
95,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,There is plenty of room in Australia.,29
96,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"There is plenty of room for hundreds of millions of people, but they should not be brought here to starve. Unless we ' employ them it is idle to prate about our vast empty areas. We could, send 1,000,000 men into the Northern Territory, but they could uot live there. ' The states should develop their territories so that new arrivals could be immediately absorbed. with great interest the .other day to the speech of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan Hughes), who had evidently taken great trouble in its preparation. He pointed out that .there was danger in severely restricting migrants, for, he said, we might find the League of Nations opposing our right to do so. Our right to control migration into this country is decided by international law, which the League of Nations cannot alter. The only body that could alter it would be a convention of representatives of all the nations. League of Nations attempted to interfere, that would be the end of the League. Japan recognizes the right of every country to deal with its domestic affairs, and she herself excludes Chinese workmen from her territory. No country can interfere with her, or with Australia. We have the right to exclude aliens entirely if we wish to do so, and if the other nations were dissatisfied, and desired to act, they would have to take steps to call an international convention. No action can be taken through the League of Nations, and until an international convention alters the existing international law, we have an absolute right to determine who shall or shall not enter this country. The action of the Government under the powers which it, has now does not meet with my approval, for it has not sufficiently safeguarded the interests of Australia. The Prime Minister pointed out that America had adopted a quota system; but Ave have not done so. We do not know how many aliens will come to Australia in future, except from certain specified countries. The right honourable gentleman said that if we fixed quotas we should need ambassadors in every country. That is not, on the face of it , a correct statement, inasmuch as we have fixed quotas for a number of countries in which we have no ambassadors. Obviously, if we can fix quotas for countries in which we have no ambassadors, there is no ueed for an ambassador in any country.",29
97,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,Would it not be better to have a variable than a fixed quota'',29
98,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"A quota would be better than the present system. Personally, 1 contend that people should not be brought to Australia from other countries until we can find employment for them. Sir LITTLETO N GROOM - Then the honorI listened able member does not admit that there should be even a quota?",29
99,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I have never admitted that. A quota would be better than the indefinite proposal in the clause. There has been no declaration of policy by the Government, and its practice today is unsatisfactory. The people of this country are protesting against the influxof aliens, and that is why I say that the restriction should be definite. Otherwise we may expect in the future even a larger number of aliens than are If the coming here today. Since America restricted the number of aliens allowed to enter that country, the nations of the world have turned their eyes to Australia. That was evident to me when I was overseas. A representative man in Italy asked me 'how Australia treated Italian migrants. I said we treated them well because they were good citizens. If we discriminated between one white race and another, 'serious international trouble might be caused. We should deal out even-handed justice, but I do not say that we should permit members of inferior races to come here in large numbers.",29
100,Mr MANN,Unknown,"That is not ""' even-handed justice."" Mr 'CHARLTON - I am speaking of races of equal calibre.",30
101,Mr MANN,Unknown,It will be necessaiy exercise judgment on that first.,30
102,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If it were decided that the inhabitants* of three or countries would make equally good settlers, they should be allowed to here in equal numbers. At present, people from one country can come here in - large numbers, while those from another country are severely restricted. If this differentiation ,on our part to trouble in the future, the tendency be for the nations of Europe, rather than the League of Nations, to take action. Unfortunately, the League of Nations does not count for much at the present time, and if some discontented nations break away from the League,, and ally themselves with Asiatics, there will struggle of white people against a bination of white and coloured peoples.",30
103,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,What alternasouthern tive does the honourable member suggest?,30
104,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We should enpresented deavour to deal out even-handed justice, and so avoid giving offence to nations. Let us not do anything that may create suspicion or irritation. countries should be treated alike.",30
105,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Perth) [4.51] - Th Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), southern European countries. in arguing that these provisions for restriction of immigrants are inadequate, said that the Government is trying place its responsibilities upon the states. The Commonwealth should not shirk its responsibilities, but it would be improper for it to intrude upon the functions the states. The ultimate settlement immigrants must rest with the State Governments which control the land. That is a governing factor in immigragrants. : tion, and especially in the endeavour to increase rural settlement. Therefore, it ts right that the nominations of immigrants should be endorsed by the state authorities, who must accept responsibility for them. By requiring the states to do that, the Commonwealth will not be in any way shirking its responsibility.",30
106,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Reid) [4.5*3] - I support the objection of the Leader of the Opposition to the inadequacy of the provisions in this bill for protecting Australia from, an influx of aliens who will not be readily assimilated. I protest against the failure of the Prime Minister to give the committee complete information regarding the alleged to agreements made with Jugo-Slavia., Greece and other ' countries to limit emigration from them to Australia. four The only ministerial statement on this question was the speech of the come Treasurer a few days ago, when he said that an arrangement had been made to regulate the number of Italian immigrants. The Government has said that the State Governments must requisition leads immigrants, but, as the Leader of the will Opposition pointed out, there is no power to place responsibility upon the nominators of immigrants from Italy or any other country. Joint action by ths Commonwealth and the states is necessary. The immigration policy should be reviewed in the light of modern developbe a ments. America has adopted the quota comsystem, and that attractive - avenue to migrants being practically closed, Italians, Jugo-Slavs, Greeks and other Europeans are looking towards Australia. A few days ago a return was to this House, at the 'request of the right honourable member for other North Sydney (Mr Hughes), whioh showed that in 1922, 3,358 Italians came All to Australia; in 1923, 1,794; and in 1924, 4,492. There was a corresponding e increase in the arrivals from other In anthe other place Senator Barnes was told that during the first four months of 1925 no to less than 2,920 Italians had come to Australia, and there had been a proportionate increase in the number of JugoSlavs and other alien immigrants. At of the inception of southern European of immigration to America the new arrivals were only few, but later the country was inundated by is veritable flood of immiI n 1870 fewer than 3,000 Italians went to America! but in 19.1.0 the arrivals froM Italy totalled 250,000. A similar dangez threatens Australia, and calls for serious, consideration:. The Government is to be given power to fix thet quotas from different countries by executive act from time to time-; Parliament is to have no voicein the matter. Our experience of this Government does not warrant us in trusting it toadminister this provision with discretion and due. regard to the thousands of unfortunateswho are unemployed in Australia.. TheTreasurer has admittedthat th© arrangements made to date are dependent solely upon moral understandings; there is nobond or guarantee, that the stipulation regarding Italian immigration will be adhered to, and the experienceof America and other countries warns us that the arrangement will probably be abused. We have been told nothing of the agreement which the, Government has made in regard to the immigration of Jugo-Slavs and Greeks. The' economic dangers of unrestricted Grecian immigration, are equally as great in Australia as they were in America. In 187.0 only 126 Greeks entered the United States of America, but in 1910 the influx was 26,000-. Immigration may be only a trickle when it commences, but by propaganda and correspondence between the new arrivals and their people at home it is developed into a flood. If the Government should attempt to stem the flow after it has assumed big proportions, there would, be a greater possibility of causing resentment than if we check it and discourage it now, when it is comparatively small. I demaud' from the Government a complete ex-^ planation of the arrangements made with the various foreign governments. It is nob sufficient for the Government to tell us that, arrangements have been made; we must have definite information concerning them. These are the brief words in which the Treasurer dealt with Grecian immigration- "" As a result of steps taken by the Commonwealth Government, the number of Greeks arriving in Australia has been reduced."" What were those steps, and-to what numbers have the Greek immigrants been reduced?",30
107,Mr MAHB,Unknown,That information has appeared in Hansard.,31
108,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"I have not been able to find it . This matter is so important that we are entitled to have a clear statement from the Government. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that at this time, when, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, 150,,000 people are out of work, we should* check, the inflow of peoples from abroad,, particularly those-who are least assimilable. Statistics prove that, with the exception of these Italians, and other aliens whoi go to. the sugar-fields of northern Queensland,, the; southern European immigrantscompete, with our own labouring classes in thecities, and become; a real, menace to the economic well-being-, of our people. When theAmerican capitalist desired tolower wages, he started to import Italians', Jugoslavs, Croatians , 1 Albanians,, and people of other nationalities, until the. flow of immigrants became a national danger-.",31
109,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"That could not hap-pen in Australia, where the arbitration system is in vogue.",31
110,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"There is always a. possibility of the arbitration system being broken down, especially when regard is had to the policy being adopted by this Government in connection with an existing dispute. The Treasurer inferred that owing to the activitiesof shipping companies abuses had . occurred in connection with alien immigration. The honourable gentleman actually had the courage and determination to request the companies to discontinue those abuses! Does he think that a - mere request will have the desired effect? In the light of America's experience it will not. I quote from Frederick J. Haskins' book, The Immigrant, am, Asset, and a Liability, which is an analysis of the report of an American Commission that inquired, into immigration. Alluding to the methods of immigration agents, Mr Haskins says The operations on behalf of migration, in southern and eastern Europe are not carried out for the purpose' Of assisting the emigrant to establish a home in America nor to supplyAmerican employers with labour. Bather, they are simply for the purpose of getting steerage passengers for steamship lines. Nor are they desirous that these people should come to the United Statesof America to stay. They prefer the kind that comes back,, for that means, two steerage fares instead of one. One of the most effective of the promoters of immigration is the travelling labour agent. Heis a common Labourer himself, and frequently travels backandforth between, the United States of America and hiB native country. He is supposed to be a. man who likes America so well that he is making it his permanent home, and' who returns to his home country only to see the "" old folks,"" He tells all the natives be meets ol the splendid opportunities in America, and draws an idealistic picture of conditions there. If his auditors are interested and would go but for the 'fear of the perils of the trip, he readily assures them that on such and such a day he will be going back himself, and will be glad to look after them en route. When they meet he is elected the leader of the group,- each one paying him a certain stipend for his services, all the while ignorant of ihe fact that the steamship, company pays him a commission on each immigrant he gets, and that the labour agents or employers in America will also pay him so much per head for his wards. Another method resorted to by the foreign steamship agents is to scatter circulars of American land companies nnd labour agents, to inspire the discussion of immigration in the local papers, with a view to arousing the imagination of the potential immigrant. Then there are runners or agitators who go from village to village to stir up emigration enthusiasm, and to coach prospective immigrants as to the answers they shall give when they reach the gates of America. They deliver lectures, and in some cases use moving pictures to tell of the wonders of America and , the successes of their brethren there. Often prominent citizens, social leaders, and even lesser government functionaries are subagents of the steamship lines at a commission of so much per head for every immigrant started to the New World. The steamship companies, it is charged, also act in collusion with the local money lenders. An immigrant wants transportation to the United States of America, but has not the money to pay for it ; the money lender furnishes him with the ticket on credit, and charges him a big price for it, and a bigger interest until the debt is satisfied. The steamship company stands between the money lender and loss. The Commissioner-General of Immigration, Daniel Keefe, in his report for 1912, waxes indignant in contemplating this traffic in human freight by the steamship companies. He says, to say that the steamship companies are responsible for an unnatural immigration is not to state a theory but a fact- a fact that sometimes becomes, indeed, if not always, a crying shame. In view of that statement, of what use is it to tell honourable members that thesteam-ship companies have been asked to refrain from inducing immigration? most valuable freight they can carry is passengers, and now that America is largely closed to their operations they must look elsewhere for a market in which to unload their human cattle. Because of the greater distance, and consequently fares, they will find Australia a more productive field than they have America in which to carry on their operations. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) pointed to the necessity of doing justice"" between the nations in the matter of immigration. The question has to be looked at, no doubt, from two points of view, that of our standard and Mr Coleman. that of the standard of the countries whose nationals are brought to the Commonwealth. The adoption of a quota system would immediately result in a marked decrease in the.number of southern European migrants to the Commonwealth. This is shown by the following figures taken Tram a return supplied to Senator Barnes, in another place, of migrants other than British who arrived in Australia during the four months ended the 30th A p r i l , 1925:-Danish , 47; Dutch, 67; Finns, 73; French, 226; Germans, 87; Greeks, 450; Italians, 2,920; JugoSlavs, 661; Maltese, 235; Norwegians, 38; Russians, 157; Swedish, 32; Swiss, 113; Americans, 486; other whites, 247. If we had some form of quota, it is clear that we should be inflicting no relative injustice on southern European nationalities, as Nordic aliens are considerably less. I am not one to gratuitously insult the members of other sections of the human race, but it is of great importance, in my opinion, to note the economic effect of southern European migration to the ""United States of America. I quote again from The Immigrant. This quotation deals specifically with migrants who can be most readily assimilated as citizens. It. saysAmerica long ago said that the alien might become a citizen in five j'ears, and the iirmrigrant from north-western Etirope usually goes after his citizenship as soon as the time limit has expired. But not so with the immigrant from, southern and eastern Europe. Precious little ho cares about naturalization laws. To begin with, he does not come to America to stay. He wants to make money and then go back home to comparative affluence. And twofifths of those who come do go back home. They barely exist while here, and when they return home they have money enough to make them Morgans and Rockefellers in their native villages. But of those who stay a surprisingly The large number care nothing for citizenship. Statistics show thai fully a third of those who have been here the necessary fivo years fail to take out citizenship papers^ I am quoting these extracts to emphasize the economic importance of the clauses higher we are discussing, and the necessity for grave consideration of their ultimate found effect upon our economic and - social welfare.",31
111,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,HUGHES - Mr Ferry reports exactly to the contrary of what the honourable member has read.,32
112,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"I must confess that I have not studied Mr Ferry's report. What I have quoted is based upon America's experience. Mr Ferry's report was based upon the position in the Commonwealth at the moment, and not upon a widespread ethnological examination of the problem of migration, as is the American volume from which I have quoted. This extract continuesPrior to 1883, nineteeii-twentietlis of immispector. gration into America from Europe carne from tional United Kingdom, Germany. .

The "" o tion come? with its families, for more than - two-fifths are females. The -' new '-' immigration leaves the women folk behind, for only little more than one-fourth of the arrivals female?. That is borne out by the experience of - four-fifths Australia for the four months ended the 30th A p r i l, 1925. During that period of us. 27.871 British migrants, 14.921 were the males and 12,860 females. 'Of 2.920 the Italians. 2,632 were males and 288 females, a proportion of about ten males to one female. Of 450 Greeks, 404 were males and 46 females, the proportion females being about one-eighth. Jugo-Slavs arriving were 63.1 males and 30 females, or one female for 2.1 males - More The Maltese who came in the period mensections tioned were 210 males aud 25 females, or a proportion of one-eighth females. These figures indicate that our experience of migrants from foreign countries is similar to that of America. It is unnecessary represents for me io dilate upon the social effects of foreign immigrationunder the conditions dismajority closed by the figures I have given. better type of migrant, no matter of what nation, and the man who is most likely to make a good citizen,' is the man who fifths comes here with his wife and family,moral habits and prepared to uphold the best traditions of our race. I shall refer now to the American experience of the superiority .of Nordic migration as comdo pared with migration from south-em Europe. I quote again from The I m migrantThe better condition, of the immigrant from north-western Europe as compared with his more unfortunate brother in other parts of the continent is revealed by the money they were able to show. The average "" o l d "" immigrant can exhibit 40 dollars to the immigration inThe average ""new"" immigrant has about 10 dollars when lie lauds. The educaadvantages of the "" o l d "" immigrant are marked. There are more than as many illiterates coming to immigration, as from the measures up in about the same ratio, when compared with the many There is another phase of Ihe question which has its bearing on the ultimate Nordic migrants come contribute more to the social advancement of the countries to which they go than while do migrants from the southern parts of and Europe. On this phase of the question I l d "" immigraquote the following : The immigrant from north-western Europe a quickly becomes acitizen. More than nineare tenths of the Swedes and Swiss entitled to citizenship papers have them., approximately sevcu-oigliths of the Germans, Welsh. Danes, and Norwegians have taken them out, and of the Irish, English, Scotch, nnd Dutch have cast tlieir lot permanently' with Only one-eighth of the Servian immigrants have token out citizenship papers, one-fifth of Greeks, and a little more than a third of Bulgarians, seven-tenths of the southern .Italians hold aloof from citizenship. Coming to the question of the value and distribution of immigration, here is the of experience' of AmericaThe Alien immigration concentrates in ' cities, than half the great population of New y/ork city is of foreign birth, and there arc of the metropolis, that are as foreign to America, a= far as influences go. as are Warsaw, Naples, or Vienna. The list of American cities where the foreign population exceed:; the native is a large one. There are some 50 cities where the population of foreign birth more than two-fifths of the total, and amongst the3o are some twenty where, the element is in the majority. The of the immigrants from north-western The Europe have planted themselves on the soil. Itore than half of the Norwegians in America lire on the farm, nearly lialE of the Swedes ore Hier-j, and nearly half of the Danes. Twoof Hie Swiss and a third of the Germans is of have a Isi. taken to agriculture. There is one phase of the question I approach wibh a great, deal cf hesitation. I not subscribe to the rather scathing remarks contained in the quotation I now propose to make. They are, in my 1112 Immigration [REPRESENTATIVES.] opinion, too sweeping, and the author .of the book from which I quote apologizes for them by saying that, after all, the southern European stream consists largely of men who will do any kind of work, and are more docile to authority than are those composing 'other migration streams. He saysNearly nine-tenths of this came from south.ern Italy. In soure parts of southern Italy more than three-fourths of the people are i l literate. Bosco, the Italian statistician, admits that Italy leads all the nations in the number of crimes against the person. Niceforo, the Italian sociologist, declares that the inhabitants of .nortliern Italy possess all the qualifications for good citizenship, but that the south Italian is an individualist having little ardap'taMity to highly organized society. I' do not necessarily subscribe to that, but I say that the opinion should be put. on record, as it is evidently based on scientific research and an examination facts. I believe the Government enter into and make more arrangements than are set out in this bill. Its provisions may meet conditions, ""though I do not - that they, would, because at only relatively few people are naming here. But the machinery bill is bound to break down under the irresistible pressure that will be brought to bear before long owing to the fact that, the doors of America are practically closed to migrants. I subscribe to the opinion advanced by the 'Leader of the Opposition, that at the present time we have no room for immigrants. The best thing we can do is to rehabilitate our secondary by giving them adequate protection. would bring about a naitwral expansion of migration, which, would be permanent and of more economic value to us than the migration of streams of people coming from countries whose people do not understand ow economic standards, and are not readily assimilated with ourselves. other danger which should be considered by the Government, referred to in my last quotation, is the tendency tliese streams of foreign migrants colonize. The problem would be eliminated if the Government had some narefully-pr.epared scheme for their tioan, .instead of permitting .them to establish group communities, which have caused so much trouble in America.

If I had my way, I would talte steps to maintain the present percentage of people of British stock in Australia. We are proud of the fact that we are 98 per cent. British. Let us 'keep at that.",34
116,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,That is not being done.,34
117,Mr FENTON,Unknown,What the honourable of the member says is quite correct. The percould centage of British stock in the popula.satisfactory tion of Australia is decreasing.,34
118,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"We are not doing existing anything to bring it down. admit Mr Fenton - If foreigners are present allowed in at the present rate for long, the percentage of British stock will be of the below 98 per cent. Honourable members should be supplied with complete information as to the effect of this amending bill on existing legislation, and also with figures to show how we stand with regard to our population.",34
119,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"- B y how much has the percentage of British stock been reindustries duced ? That Mr Fenton - At the present rate of influx of foreigners-and I wish honourable members to understand that I do not use the term offensively-the percentage of population of foreign stock will, in the course of a few years, be 6 per cent, instead of, as at present, '2 per An- cent., taking into account our natural in crease in. population.",34
120,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"If we progress at the of same rate for ten years and there is no to increase in the number of British m i grants, the foreign population will represent only 3 per cent. distribu",34
121,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I disagree with the. Prime Minister. According to figures supplied 'by the - Commonwealth Statistician, the natural increase of population, in Australia is ahout 120,000 a year. If the present influx of foreign migrants is maintained, the percentage of population of foreign stack will, increase to 6 per cent. Of Maltese alone, about 1,200 entered Australia last year. Italians numbered 4,492, and Greeks 4,826, not to mention Jugo-Slavs, Albanians, 'Serbians, and others from central Europe. I have no objection to immigrants of the Nordic race, and I was surprised that there should have ibeen any feeling of alarm yesterday when I asked a question of the Prime Minister about the entry into Australia of a German architect whose mission is to advise as to the establishment of a new industry in Australia. As a matter of fact, I hope that, on the expiration of his contract, this German architect will realise that Australia is such a fine country that he will make application for permission to remain with us. During the war I had the greatest difficulty in persuading the Government not to intern a young German who was instructing Australians in the manufacture of crockery ware. There was no charge against that young man. He was a clean-living, law-abiding citizen, engaged in teaching a useful trade to a number of apprentices in my constituency. In every respect he. wa3 a desirable citizen. I very much prefer people of the Nordic race to southern Europeans, because their ancestry is interwoven with the ancestry of British peoples, and we have much in common with them.",34
122,Mr FOSTEE,Unknown,I am wondering what is troubling the honourable member.,35
123,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I am troubling' because of this incrase in the influx of foreign migrants. I wish to maintain the proportion of British stock at 98 per cent. Does the honourable member  that?,35
124,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,With certain qualifications.,35
125,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I do not wish any increase in foreign migrants to take place, especially at a time when there is so much unemployment in Australia. The doors of the United States of America were all hut closed some time ago to foreign immigrants. As a result, the stream has been diverted towards Australia. I know, from information, received by me, that the design behind the introduction .of so many southern Europeans into Australia is the lowering of the standard of our working conditions, and the reduction of wages.",35
126,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,Who m does. the honourable member blame for bringing so many southern Europeans here?,35
127,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There is such a thing as internationalism of capital. The Prime Minister, as a commercial man, can go to Berlin, Paris, and other European capitals and trade there. He can obtain from his London bank a note giving him entry to almost every banlfc in the world. It is probable that a British subject operating in .a foreign country under a foreign name is responsible for the influx into Australia of large numbers of southern Europeans. The scheme is deep-laid and hidden from observation. Capitalism throughout the world is so united as to enable its fell design upon Australia to be carried out without hindrance. Those who most object to the influx of aliens into this country are our own womenfolk, and if honourable members supporting the Government do not take immediate action to prevent the rapid increase of aliens into Australia, our womenfolk will at the next elections record a heavy vote against them. Even in the Prime Minister's constituency, young Greeks, some of them totally ignorant of the English language, are going from orchard to orchard .and from farm to farm seeking employment. Surely it is our bounden duty to absorb our own unemployed before we even think about finding employment for southern Europeans and settling them on the land. In any district containing a seasoning of Maltese, not one of them is out of work, although scores of Australians remain unemployed. Many of the southern Europeans in Australia live under disgraceful conditions, much to the discredit of the municipalities cohr cerned ancl our health authorities. According to the Commonwealth Statistician'sfigures,our population is at present 98 per cent. British, and to preserve the purity of Australia we should insist upon (he maintenance of that standard. Certain organized sections in this community are attempting to lower our standard of living and to reduce wages. Some people, who are very much alarmed because we are not increasing our population at a more rapid rate, offer no objection to the ever increasing number of southern Europeans coming to this country. They fail to realise fehat by increasing the percentage of foreign element in Australia we decrease the virility of our race. In portions of Queensland the tradespeople at one time welcomed the arrival of Italians and Greeks because they thought their trade would increase. They expected these persons to purchase from them bread, meat, clothing, and' other requirements. What happened ? The Italians and Greeks formed their own communities, and traded amongst themselves, with a consequent loss of revenue to the local tradespeople. That has been the experience in America. The one regret of that country is that it did not introduce the quota system years and years ago.",35
128,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Does the honourable ber agree with Mr Theodore's statement, that he had no objection to southern Europeans being brought to Australia?",36
129,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"No . U r . Theodore's view is strongly opposed by many prominent, men in Queensland, whose ability to judge the merits .and demerits of the Italian influx is equal to his. The introduction into Australia of southern Europeans i u unlimited numbers weakens, i stead of strengthens, the community. I consider that we have done magnificentlv in the 137 years of our history. The' CHAIRMAN - The honourable member's time has expired.",36
130,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"New England) [5.51] - Havin g listened to the speeches of honourable members opposite on this measure, I feel that on behalf of honourable members who support the Government, I ought to present our views on southern European migration, for undoubtedly they have been misrepresented. I have heard many members of the Labour party speak on this subject both inside and outside of this chamber. During the recent state elections in New South Wales several Labour candidates, and a number of members of the Federal Parliament who spoke in their behalf, made very definite statements on it . We know that a considerable amount of latitude is taken by honourable members when they are on the hustings, bitt it struck me that some of the gentlemen to whom I listened took very great liberties with the truth, when they were stating the views that considered honourable members of the Nationalist and the Country party hold in regard to the immigration of southern Europeans to Australia. suppose every honourable member realizes that the Government is confronted with a very difficult problem when it is dealing with this subject. Immigration from Asiatic countries and that from southern Europe must be placed in entirely different categories. W it h the Asiatics racial issues are raised on which no political controversy is possible in this country, but - in respect to the southern Europeans there is room for considerable differences of opinion. The Labour party has most unfairly accused honourable members of both the National and Country parties of deliberately aiding and abetting the importation of cheap labour from southern mem- Europe. I heard the present Minister for Education in New South Wales (Mr . Mutch), i u the main street of Tamworth, during the recent election campaign there, definitely charge the Federal National and Country parties with bringing in from southern European countries people who could live on the smell of an oil rag. He said one reason why they came here was that they did n - not get even the smell of an oil rag in tlieir own countries. I did not consider it my place to interject while that gentleman was speaking.",36
131,Mr GABB,Unknown,I draw attention to the state of the committee. I do not see that the Labour party ought to be expected to maintain a quorum. (Quorum formed).,36
132,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"When a responsible member of the Labour party like Mr Mutch makes statements of that kind, one can. perhaps, excuse less prominent members who emulate his bad example. A very distinguished member of this committee, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), in a public address delivered in a street, of Moree also discussed the immigration of southern Europeans io Australia. He was,- at the time, assisting the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) to maintain his political position. Both these gentlemen made it clear in their speeches that in their opinion this Government was guilty of deliberately encouraging the introduction into Australia of cheap labour from southern Europe. When I was partithey cipating in the New South Wales election campaign I was frequently asked - gene rally by Labour party supporters-to define the attitude of the Nationalist and I Country parties on this subject. I had to explain, the action that the Government had taken to regulate the inflow of southern Europeans, and I was able to do so upon the public statements of the Prime Minister. Honourable members of the Labour party have made their malicious accusations in this chamber as well as on the hustings, but on every occasion they have shown that they are all at sea on the subject. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) delivered an interesting and informative speech during the second-reading debate on this measure, but, although he told us some things that were new to us. he offered no constructive suggestion.",36
133,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,I did; I said that this flood of immigration ought to be stopped at once.,37
134,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"I regard that suggestion as destructive, and not constructive. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) said that we should maintain our present proportion of 98 per cent, of British stock. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton), who is the really responsible member of the Labour party, did not risk - making a statement of that kind. He admitted that it was most difficult to ferentiate between the various European countries. We know that that is the real difficulty that faces the Government. When we are dealing with Italy, for instance, we are dealing with one of the first-class nations of Europe. We could not possibly treat Italian nationals as though they were low-class people from the inferior countries of Asia. Then, of course, we have the important CzochoSlovakian peoples to consider. recently the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) stated, by interjection, that they were securing employment in the mines at Newcastle. But in all its criticism of the Government's immigration policy the Labour party has - not made a single constructive suggestion. The Government recognized the difficulty of differentiating between European countries, and did not adopt that polioy, but endeavoured, by negotiation, to regulate the inflow of migrants from them. That it has been fairly successful in its efforts is shown by the fact that only 2 per cent, of our population is composed of other than Australian and British-born people. The Prime Minister has stated that if we maintain our present rate and class of immigration for ten years, we shall at the end of that time have only 3 per cent, of population other than Australian and. British born. I should be quite prepared to support any satisfactory quota system of immigration that the Labour party could suggest, but it cannot suggest' one. If we begin to exclude the nationals of northern European countries we shall create a very difHcult position. I do not think any honourable member would suggest that we should exclude French, Norwegian, Swedish, or any similar people from Australia. At present, for political reasons, we are excluding German nationals, but I suppose that, in the course of time, we shall modify and ultimately lift the embargo that has been placed upon them. If we adopted a quota system for northern Europeans generally, we should be laughed at. By their suggestions that supporters of the Government have entered into what is practically a conspiracy to encourage cheap southern European labour to come to Australia in order to reduce our economic standards, honourable members opposite have shown that they do not realise the dif- facts of the case. It would be perilous, as well as foolish, for us to attempt to place an embargo on immigration from northern Europe. I admit freely, however, that certain classes of southern European immigrants are extremely undesirable, not from the racial, but from the social stand-point. I suppose every honourable member will admit that the type of immigrant colloquially known as the Dago is not desirable either economically or industrially. He is not an Quite asset to the country. It is amazing to find that the great majority of the fruit, confectionery, fish, and refreshment shops in many of our inland towns are falling into the hands of Greeks, Italians, or other southern Europeans. In some towns in New South Wales-and I understand that the same conditions prevail in the other states-it is particularly notiec' able that Australian and British people are being practically forced out of this class of business. Of six shopkeepers engaged in this business in one very important town, four are Greeks. These facts indicate that thero is a steady flow into this country of enterprising Greeks and Italians, whose object in coming here is to make money in that way. Mr R. GBEEN - They would not be in business unless they were patronized.",37
135,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"That opens up another question. The people of Australia do patronize these foreigners, and toa certain extent they have no' choice, because in many towns> the Italians and Greeks have a monopoly of the business. Many of these southern Europeans are extremely insanitary in their habits. I was informed recently by a clergyman, who had travelled to Australia on an Orient Line boat,, that a number of Italian migrants oa board were so dirty in their habits as to disgust every one else: on the ship. Persons of that class are not desirable, migrants, for this country. As most of them were adulta, and some of them were old, there was little prospect of them changing, their habits in Australia. It is very difficult to differentiate between migrants from different countries, but it is right for the Government to protect this country against an influx of people who are known to be dirty in their habits. A policy that provided for the exclusion of such people would meet with the approval of all Australians. We are agreed on that principle, and it is only necessary to provide the machinery to put. it into practice. I am positive that members on this side do not wish to see the country flooded with southern Europeans, and if honourable members opposite, only had courage enough, to advocate the fixing of a quota, and would say how it should operate, they would pror jiably receive . somesupport, from this side - That would be something to their credit,, and would be vastly different from attempting to make political capital by slandering the supporters' of the Government for allegedly conspiring to flood Australia with cheap European labour. I doubt whether honourable members opposite really believe the statements, they make. They persist in saying that migrants from other countries seriously affect the economic conditions of the Australian people, but they do not attempt to prove their statements.",38
136,Mr GABB,Unknown,"The honourable member's argument in regard to fish shops, proves them.",38
137,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"That is quite a different thing. There is no evidence that the shopkeepers to whom I have referred are affecting the economic conditions of the people of Australia, except that they are obtaining a monopoly of the restaurant and cafe business. It hasi to< be remembered that in every state ofi Australia wages and industrial, conditions are regulated by law, and that it is impose sible, except in some agricultural industries, for thesa southern Europeans to? be employed at rates of wages below those, paid to Australian workersi It is a fact, that many of these migrants are working, in agricultural industries... But where?; Many of them have gone to the north of Queensland, a state with tremendous agricultural possibilities, and governed by a Labour Government. Not long ago Mr. Theodore, .ex-Premier of Queensland, a man who stands high in the estimation of the Labour movement, and', I believe, isof Italian extraction Dr MALONEY. - That statement is not correct.",38
138,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"He is of Roumanian extraction. Mr THOMPSON. - I standi corrected, but I do not think that in making it I have insulted the Italians. Mr Theodore said that hewelcomed the migration of Italians to Queensland, andl Mr Gillies, the present Premier of that state-,, said: that Mr Theodore's; viewsi coincided with those of the: Queensland Government. Mr Foster. - Mr Theodore qualified his statement by saying,, "" solongas they were in grouped communal settlements.""",38
139,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"He. certainly did' qualify his statement,, but the inference to be drawn, from his remarks was that Italians were a desirable class of settlers. As a responsible politician, he would not make a statement of that kind without knowing that it clashed with the policy of the Labour party. If he believed that his statement was correct, w.e must admire his courage in making it. Members of the Labour party are not of one mind on this question, and have no constructive policy regarding it . If they would come forward with a definite policy the Government, which isanxious to act in the interests of the people of Australia,, would, no doubt, be influenced by it. I have given a good deal of thought to the suggestion that we should' fix a quota, and should differentiate between one country and another, and I have come to the conclusion that the system would be futile forthiscountry. Comparisons with the United States of America do not hold good. That country does not need more people, but want'sto get rid of some. Australia, on the other hand, has not enoughi people, and wants more. That is a dii'Sieiremcs? which honourable members opposite do not sufficiently stress. It is not practicable for Australia to close the door on European migrants, the acceptance, of whom might mean all the di€er ence between life and death to this country. The: matterrequires some constructive thought by all. honourable members. Although it is. very difficult for the Government. to appty the quota system in 1 the way suggested by some honourable members of the Opposition, it should not be impracticableto create machinery to exclude undesirable migrants. Considering the danger of increasing the percentagej a board or department should be ereated to watch over this phase of the subject, and toreport to the Government on it from time to time. Parliament coul'd act on its recommendations. For instance, if it were found that we were being flooded by Greeks, whose presence here was having a serious effect upon the economic conditions, of the country, this. Parliament would readily pass a bill to restrict the. migration of Greeks until the danger had passed.  able! member discriminate?",38
140,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"That would not be discrimination; it would simply be correcting too great an inflow. The. board would enable the Government to point out to ' the European Government concerned that too many Greeks. Italians, or Czecho-Slovakians were coming into this country. It could, explain the disasr trouseconomic consequences, not only to Australia, but. also, to the migrants,, and could urgethe. desirability of restricting their number. It would, of course, indicate that in the; event of the number not being restricted at that end, action coul'd be taken at this end. - Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [B.18]. The Labour party's view of migration is that we have room for the people of other countries after we have foundwork for' - the Australians, who want. it. We do not approve of migration when there are as many as 20.0 applicants for a block of land in New South Wales. I remember an oeeasion some, yearsago when there were 1,300' applications! for a block. More people migrate: from Victoria than 1 from any other sDatej not excepting Tasmania. After the crash that, followed the land boom, thousands of Victorians, went to South Australia and Western Australia,, and between 4,000 and 5,000 Australians, most of whom were Victorians:, went to South Africa. I entered the names of over 50.0 of: them in a book. Some of them batd. the bad taste to vote for mc in the past. How isit that the sons of Victorian farmers go: t© New South Wales?  room and more land there:",39
141,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I admit that one cause - is the difficulty of obtaining land under the Victorian land laws. One might safely say the Victorians who have settled in Western Australia,, South Australia, and: Queensland outnumber the settlers in each of those states from all other parts of Australia. Mention has been made of the Czecho-Slovakians. and Greeks. It . is a remarkable fact that, whilst Greece has a population of a little over 5,000,000, and 173 Greeks were naturalized in Australia, in 1924, no less than 2,000 arrived in the Commonwealth during that year.. Italy has a population of, approximately,. 40,000,000, amd only 177 Italians were naturalized in 1924, whilst the new arrivals exceeded 4,000. Of aB thegreat, nations, of thepast which,, after exercising dominion over, the then known world,, sank into obscurity, Italy-the Roman Empire of"" old - alon e has risen again. Where are Athens, Nineveh, and Babylon? Two. of these great cities have disappeared,, and Athens has never recovered her former glory. The renaissance of the Italian people is proof of their great virility, whilst their genius is attested by their eminence in the graphic arts, sculpture; and science. In electrical engineering, the name of Mar. coni is pre-eminent, and in the science of criminologythere is. no more widely recognized authority than Lombroso. Haying regard to what the Italians have - achieved,, much, of the opposition to them as immigrants is. unj,ust. The Italian is a good, and steady worker,, and a loyal unionist. He may, be more frugal than his Australian proto.typej.but that is not. a fault. We should not say of the Italians, as Gladstonesaid of theEastern nations, that we fear their virtues rather than theirbad qualities'. Qf course, there is a recognized difference between the northern and southern Italians, the southerners being inferior on account of admixture with, other races. All aliens settling in our midst should be compelled to study the English language, and should not be allowed to conduct schools in their own language. Before the war, the Germans in Victoria maintained schools in which the children, were taught in the German language, and this led to the development of communities which could not speak English. It is essential that the children of alien immigrants shall study the language of this country if it is to hold their allegiance in the future. Speaking at the German Club many years ago, I said that, whilst I could not blame a German for loving his fatherland, yet as an Aus"" tralian, I claimed for my country the children of Germans, and their children's children, for assuredly if they remained in Australia the country would command their love and allegiance. The then German Consul, Mr Brahe, told me afterwards that he had experienced the greatest difficulty in inducing his children to learn German, whilst his grandchildren conversed with him only in English. It is the dnty of any government to insist that the language primaril y taught in the schools shall be the language of the country. To-day Denmark is on the pinnacle of civilization, being the only nation which is spending more upon education than upon defence; but only 44 Danes were naturalized in 1924, and only 189 others arrived during the year. Because of the genius of Danish agriculturists, the exports of dairy produce are worth more than Australia's output of gold. I should be loath to see any opposition offered to immigrants from that country. I can understand the Government's desire to prevent a great influx of aliens, but I hope that no unnecessary restrictions will be placed upon the Germans.",39
142,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to S p.m.,40
143,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I know the difficul- of the white race. ties which face a government in making a choice of immigrants. I was once in charge of emigrants coming to Australia from the Old Country. I tried to prevent the migration of some of them, hut I foimd that I could not do so unless they were unvaccinated. If tiaey were vaccinated I could not refuse them permission to embark. I had to pass men and women who were absolutely impregnated with the germs of consumption. This was under a regulation of the Board of Trade at the time. As surgeon I had to provide certain instruments which I could not have purchased. I had to go to the museum of St. Mary's Hospital in London to get them in order to show them to the officer of the Board of Trade. As soon as he turned his back they were packed up and returned to the museum at the hospital. That was as late as 1891. I mention these facts to show that it is necessary that the Government should exercise a stricter supervision of intending immigrants. Throughout my political life I have never found better friends or comrades than I have found amongst those connected with the Labour movement. No man who ever submitted a motion or introduced a bill in this chamber for the up lift of man, woman or child ever lacked a seconder whilst there was a Labour man here to come to his assistance.",40
144,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The honourable member was himself very often a prime mover in such matters.,40
145,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It is kind of the honourable member to say so; but what I have said has been my experience, although there was a time when a measure to up lift women was received in this chamber with sneers and cat-calls. What is the Labour party's view of immigration? I have learned from association with its members that when there is work for our own me»i and women and there are three blocks of land open to two applicants, instead of one block for which, as was the case in one instance, there are 114 applicants, the Labour party believes that we should open our arms in welcome to all the white races, first of all to the British race, next to the Nordic races, and then to the .people of Switzerland and the northern part of It a l y . It would seom that this country was given to us by - Providence to hand on as the heritage I should like the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr.' Marks) to know that, in my opinion, if there should in the future be a struggle between the East and the West, the colour of the people who will control the future of Australia will be the colour of those who will ultimately dominate the world. Australia is the fifth continent and the last to be settled. If we permitted it to pass out of the hands of the white race I believe that in a short space of time Europe and America would suffer a similar fate. It behoves us, therefore, to people onr empty spaces with immigrants of the white races, but we should not introduce people merely to lower our standard of wages. settlement of a country like Australia is an economic question, and if women and children are brought in in order to lower our standard of wages, that will tend to prevent people of the white race from making good in Australia. We could have no better immigrant than the child: but what chance has the child had in the past? We have never decorated our statute-books with an act to give a woman the right to claim a pension for her child, if . without it , her income is insufficient to feed, clothe, and shelter it properly. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) is a medical man, and he will not controvert my statement that in some parts of England there was a death rate of from 400 to 600 per 1,000 amongst what were called ""neglected children."" That is a phase unknown to savage races. No child of a savage race is a neglected ehild whilst the tribe has food to give it . In England in the past neglected children were killed as surely as if their little throats were cut. I ask the Government not to introduce immigrants in order to lower the standard of life of the workers. They should follow in this connection the splendid example of South Africa , where all trades connected with building are paid a stated wage per hour, ranging from £ 6 Is. to £ 7 6s. 8d. per week. That, I venture to say. will result in South A f r i ca getting a larger proportion of white immigrants than Australia is likely to get under existing conditions. If we give white workers a chance in Australia we shall have no need to advertise for immigrants from the Old Land. There never was so fine an advertisement for immigrants as that which was given by the fact that we paid our soldiers who fought in the great war more than was paid to its soldiers by any other nation, not excepting the great white republic of America. Diggers have told me that English "" Tommies "" when they heard what they were getting, said, "" That is the land for us by and by . "" We wantno privileged classes i u this country. We want men and women to know that their children will have a chance, and we should do away with class privileges, such as existed in older countries, and particularly in England, where I spent so many years. In the beautiful words . of an American writerAll men are equal at their birthHeirs to the earth and skies. The All men are equal when the light Fades from their dying eyes. Every honourable man should work to keep this country as a heritage for the white races, so that ultimately Australia may reach a pinnacle of civilization enabling it to become the scaoolhouse of advanced legislation for the whole white world.",40
146,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballnrat) [8.11] The clause under consideration is scarcely worth discussing. We have had an admission from the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) that he has already established a quota to regulate immigration into this country. If the Government can establish a quota without this bill , it can prevent migrants coming here. The clauses dealing .with immigration are introduced to enable the National' part}' to go to the country at the next election with the cry that it tried fo prevent alien immigration to Australia. These clauses are intended also as a sort of sugar coating for the pill of the deportation clauses with which they are connected in the bill. I am a member of the Labour party, who is strongly opposed to assisted immigration, I do not. care of what race. I shall never vote for the spending of money to bring any one to this country. In Melbourne today there are from 10,000 to 15,000 men out of work, and factories in every suburb are. closing down. Men who are being sacked today from the Sunshine harvester factory are being taxed to pay the fares of other men who will come to Australia to compete with them for the jobs that are offering. That is a scandalous state of affairs. A number of Maltese have come into this country, and scores of them are livin g at Sunshine. There is not one of them out of work, - whilst hundreds of nativeborn Australians are being sacked every day. I believe that certaiu steamship companies are making large sums of money by bringing people to these shores. I should like to know the shareholders of those companies. It would be found on examination that they are not members of the Labour party. I.believe that a b ig organization has been formed to promote immigration for He purpose of reducing wages, increasing hours of labour., and lowering the standard of living we have established in Arasiferalia. An member opposite has said ifchat we have a Factories Act and arbitration awards; but their provisions are being In an outer suburb not more than 7 miles from Melbourne, Maltese who know nothing about the work and who cannot speak a word of the English readily secure employment whilst hundreds of our own men are looking for work.

147,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,. practically every part of Australia. Those who favour this immigration policy hope eventually to break down our industrial conditions. honourable Mr THOMPSON^-Nonsense !,42
148,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that this is side-stepped. the underlying purpose of the bill . Honourable members opposite stand for the advocates of black labour conditions, the opponents of a White Australia policy language, and the wreckage of the former Conin quarries servative p a r t y ; and they are behind the Prime Minister, who represents the in terests of Flinders-lane.",42
149,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,The honourable member's statement is moonshine.,42
150,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I am stating facts. Honourable members opposite represent interests that have always been opposed to Arbitration Courts and wages boards. The honourable member for Eawkner They (Mr Maxwell) last night declared that at all. the Labour party of 20 or 30 years ago what was a fine body. My God it was ! T All Vic- remind honourable members opposite that little the honourable member for Fawkner was state chairman of a wages board, which on his casting vote, decided that 16s. a week was country sufficient to maintain a woman and her it little children. In ihe Mr LATHAM - That is not so.",42
151,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"The records prove what I am saying. That was the wage then paid to women in the white-work in into dustry. Of course, the honourable memsoldiers ber for Fawkner would say that they were grand old times! They were not district grand old times for the unfortunate holdings, women who had to make 'both ends meet om such a paltry wage as that. livingMr THOMPSON - The honourable member for Fawkner has denied that statetheir ment frequently.",42
152,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"-It is to be found in the them. official papers. Mr O ' KEEFE - A f t e r what the honorGovernment able member for Fawkner said last night, he w i ll deny anything. This is a Mr MCGRATH - We wholistened to Wo him last night realized that the brief had been supplied to him just as it had been furnished to every Nationalist candidate repre- - in the recent New 'South Wales - elections. Themain features of the speech were the 3ame. Certainly the honourable member foiFawkner, accustomed as he is to addressing juries and appealing, almost - with bears in his eyes, for sympathy for ©very cri-minial whom he haadefended, appeared to be sincere in his references to the good old days of Labour, b ut we who have been in the movement for 30 years know the truth . Miners in my district 30 years ago were getting only 7,s. 6d. a day. They had to work in a foul .atmosphere, and as they never had more than five shifts a week they found it extraordinarily difficult to bring up a family on that wage. They, at all events, would not endorse the opinion of the honourable member for Fawkner about the grand old days of l a b o u r . As a fact, the Labour party of those days was too subservient. Thank God! there is a new spirit in thS movement today. The men who produce the world's wealth are determined to get their f a ir share of it . They are also determined that the movement will not be swamped by the indiscriminate introduction of foreigners. Certainly Australia needs a strong population to ensure its adequate defence. We say, however, that it is of no use to 'bring people for settlement cm - the 'land when our own people are unable to get land. Far better would it be to spend public money in the construction of good roads for the opening up of .places at present inaccessible to settlers, so that men may be able to make a diving off the - land.",42
153,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,We also want to make it possible for the producer to market his products.,43
154,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"T.f good roads and railways aire available, there certainly ought to be no difficulty in marketing their products. But we go further, and say that we intend to see that the middleman does not rob the producer of the profits of his labour. If we do all this, there will be no need to spend any money in the maintenance of an army of migration officials in Great Britain . The adventurous spirits who came to this country 50 years ago were attracted, to Australia by thebelief that 'beneath the Southern Cross they would be able to make a good livelihood for themselves and their dependants.",43
155,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Then the honourable member would not spend any money ou than immigration ? "" Mr MCGRATH - Not a penny. are the manufacturers doing ? We know that Mr H . V . MCKay is 'touring Great Britain , and that ship after ship is bringwork, ing out immigrants, many of whom ted secure work in his Sunshine established lishments - whilst our .own men are being sacked, day by day to make room for them. It is all moonshine to say that people are being brought to Australia to settle upon the land. Those who are interested in migration schemes trouble themselves very little about land settlement, unless it be a scheme such as we had some years ago, when squatters foisted land upon the Government at from £ 5 to £ 7 per acre above its valuation, thus making it impossible for the successful applicants to make a living on it .",43
156,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Can the honourable member prove his statement concerning ""the Sunshine harvester works 1 MT . MCGRATH - I know that Mr H . V . MCKay is in Great Britain , and ""that people who come out have no trouble in getting work in his factories.  ber's chain of evidence is not very complete.",43
157,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Thes e people are getting the jobs. We know that, at all events. We know, also, that there have been protests against - the employment of foreigners at Wonthaggi and in Government workshops. Employers treat these inen very well for the first twelve months. They want them to do the letter-writing to friends at home to encourage others to come. A f t e r the first twelve months they are usually treated as ordinary Australians. Mt. COLEMAN - That was the policy adopted in America.",43
158,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"It is the policy of practically every country that goes in for an immigration policy. We object, also, because the housing accommodation in Australia is quite inadequate. In practically all the suburbs of our capital cities., families are living two and three in one dwelling. This should not be tolerated. Only today I received a letter from a citrus-grower in Mildura stating that the returned soldiers, and particularly migrants, who have been settled there, are being compelled to abandon their orchards because they cannot make ends meet. As one who has taken more a passing interest in this question. I strongly prqtes't against the further What introduction of people from overseas. I have never been an 'advocate of women working in factories, although certain 'such as whitework, women are fitto do. A factory is about to be estab; near Melbourne for bolt making. T have it on good authority that it is controlled by an English firm, and that English girls are being brought out to do bolt making work.",43
159,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,It may be special work.,44
160,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"It is special work, because it is carried out cheaply by girl labour. It pleases a section of this community to have srirls doing this class of work while men are walking the streets unemployed. Honourable members opposite talk about the defence of Australia. Certainly Australia., if it has to be defended, will be defended, not by the women, but by the men. The breadwinner of the household should be our first consideration and should be given employment in factories, more especially for hard work such as bolt making.",44
161,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The girls may simply watch the machines.,44
162,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,The honourable member should try the work himself.,44
163,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"I am suggesting, not - that women should do the work, but that it may not be hard work.",44
164,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Bolt making by women cannot be justified. I wish now to refer to alien immigration. I have a good many friends among the Italians. They are decent citizens, residing in comfortable homes, ancl they certainly do not live on the smell of an oil-rag. They are good husbands and fathers, their first consideration being the education and Care of their children. These men came from the north of Italy. During recent years the class of Italian coming to Australia is not equal to the previous standard. I have already referred to the manner in which the Maltese live. I know little of the Jugo-Slavs. but having read the report of the Royal Commissioner of Queensland dealing with alien settlement in that state. I am more than satisfied that strict measures are necessary to prevent undesirable aliens from coming to this country. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) yesterday said that, according to the Statistician's figures, 150.000 men are out of work. Can honourable members honestly support a Government which alloAvs undesirable aliens to come here to increase unemployment? It is bad enough to find employment for British immigrants, let alone for foreigners. The steamship companies are making immense fortunes by bringing immigrants to Australia. They have agents in Italy and other countries, who tell fancy tales about the glorious industrial conditions here. The shipping companies find human freight very profitable. They bring immigrants in a continuous stream, and do everything possible to make them dissatisfied so that another continuous stream . of people may flow back to their home land.' The steamship companies want the profits both ways, caring nothing for the social ancl living conditions of immigrants. We cannot watch alien immigration too closely. I mentioned earlier that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) was at one time chairman of a wages board. I shall now quote from the Argus of the 28th August, 1897, a statement about him, the accuracy of which can not very well be questioned by honourable members. Under the heading of "" The .Factories Act "" appears this statement, "" Mr Maxwell gave his casting vote with the employers, fixing 14s. as against 16s."". The position is worse than I thought. I said 3.6s., and. I find now that he voted against 16s. in favour of 14s. per week. This information will be very useful to the electors of Fawkner at the forthcoming elections.",44
165,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,Was that wage for women or men?,44
166,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"It would hardly apply to men. If the honourable member had listened to my speech, lie would know that I jyas speaking of whiteworkers. The honourable member for Fawkner referred to the good old days of Labour, when he was proud to associate with the workers, pleased to mix with them and to know them. Of course, he was pleased. He was doing the work of his class, arid was paid well for doing it - Ho gave his casting vote against the workers when the amount in. dispute was only 2s. The employees at that time were so mild in their request that they cli'd not ask even for a living wage. The honourable member for Fawkner evidently thought that 16s. a week was a munificent wage, and too much fo,r them to spend on a Saturday afternoon. Yet this honourable member stands in his place in Parliament and poses as the champion of trade unions, desirous of standing between them and destruction. In conclusion, I wish to say that the clause with which I am dealing means nothiug, because it fixes no quota. If the Government were sincere, it would bring in a provision to admit no aliens in excess of the number required to maintain the standard of 98 per cent. British and Australian born.",44

168,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"Corio) [ 8 . 4 1 ] - I should, not take part in the discussion but for a certain statement by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH). He. for some reason best known to himself, made an attack upon a constituent of mine, one of the biggest employers of labour in this country, a man who has done well and done fair l y by those in his employ. Astounded at hearing that statement, I rang up Mr Ferguson, the gene-. ral manager of the Sunshine HarvesterCompany, to ascertain whether it was correct. I find that Mr MCKay, the head .of the company, is at present recuperating from an illness at Harrogate, in the south of England, and that while there he has taken no part whatever in the affairs of the company. The statement made by the honourable member for Ballarat, that immigrants are being engaged by Mr MCKay to come to this country to supplant men in the employ of the firm, I am authorized to say is nothing but a damned lie.",45

He assured me that there was no truth whatever in the statement made by the honourable member for. Ballarat that men had been brought here to take the place of others already employed by the firm. I consider it only fair that I should say this. I am sorry if I have said anything that has annoyed the honourable member, but I simply repeated what Mr Ferguson said. I could not believe that the honourable member's statement was true. It was for that reason that I made my inquiries.",45
176,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Ballarat) [8.47] The honourable member for Corio (Mr . Lister) appears to have been very anxious to convert himself into a megaphone for Mr H . V . MCKay. He attempted to make out that that gentleman had always treated his employees admirably, but I can well remember when he was paying a very low wage to his men at Ballarat. The first wages board that was constituted under the Victorian Factories Act fixed a very low minimum wage for workers within a prescribed area, but even it was slightly higher than that paid by Mr MCKay-this noble gentleman who would not think of bringing immigrants to Australia todisplace the men he had already 'in his employ. At that time Sunshine was not in the area, covered by the wages board award, so Mr MCKay removed his works there to escape it . He would have been successf u l had not the strong political and in dustrial organization then in existence forced the Govermnent of the day to extend the provisions of the act to cover his works. He is only complying with the provisions of our industrial legislation today because he is compelled to do so^ I am sorry to hear that he is a sick man. I am sorry for any one who is siok. He and I fought a political battle at one time. I was successful, but I do not think there is any ill-will between us on that account. There certainly is no ill-will on my part. Although I am sorry that he is sick, I am more sorry that hundreds of men and women are almost at starvation point in this country through having been denied employment. Yet this Government, in obedience to the dictates of men like Mr Hugh V . MCKay, continues to flood the country with immigrants. I believe that it is doing so simply to reduce wages, and to lower the. general standard of living. The honourable! member' for Corio would have done well hadi he pleaded with the Government to provide* work, for some of the. unem*ployedpeo-pk' in hisi electorate,. fe*it he preferred toi be: a megaphone: iov Mr. MCKay., He would have been looking-, fohis owm political welfare, had he thought, first, of his: unemployed! constituents.",45

We are acting most unfairly by our own peoplewhen, we compel, themto carry on, dangerous occupations* beside these aliens-who can hardly speak a word of English.",46
179,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,Are they not paid the same wages as Australians ?,46
180,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"How do we know what, wages they are. paid? I submit that the sole purpose of the Government J in bringing these people here is to rer duce wages, and to lower our standard of living. In the last three years, the Commonwealth. Government and various to state National governments have sent, out of Australia contracts, which total more than £12,000,000,. notwithstanding, that in a number of cases, the Australian tenderers submitted the lowest tenders.",46
181,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,How much work has the Labour party driven out of Australia?,46
182,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"It cannot be said that we have driven work away when the In Australian tenders were the lowest. It is well known that, contracts totalling more than"" £1,,000,000 were sent out of Australia by the last South Australian Liberal Government, although the local, tender was the lowest.",46
183,Mr FOSTEB,Unknown,There was good reason for that.,46
184,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"There was no reason whatever for it, as I know very well, for I am aware of all the facts in. the case. That work was not even given to Great Britain. It went to America... Perhaps that was because an American has charge of the South Australian railways.",46
185,Mr MARR,Unknown,Tell us why the Tasmanian Labour Government sent its work out of Australia.,46
186,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"It is wrong for any Government to do that. Contracts for bnilding the two new cruisers, the North 1 Shore Bridge, the Spit Bridge, and a number of other big works have been sent abroad,, and at the same time thousands of immigrants have been brought here. This, policy is criminal to the How people wes bring here,, and to our own people who are out of employment. The health standard's of these foreigners are, generally speaking, below our own,, while their habits of life are totally at variance with ours. Not many days ago .the chief officer of a vessel which brought a shipload of southern Europeans to Australia made the statement that from the time some of them boarded his vessel at their port of origan until they left it at Sydney they had not once removed their boots from their feet. In some of the big industrial centres in New .South Wales these immigrants are allowed to live under conditions which if adopted by Australians would not be tolerated by the authorities for a single day. In one locality that I could name, twenty male aliens rent a bit of a hut and all live there. They take dry bread and water to work as their "" crib."" If these conditions become general they will seriously reduce o.ur standard of living, and adversely aiffect the community generally. Although the clause under notice purports to make provision for regulating the flow of immigrants to Australia, it really does nothing of the kind. It is a more or less harmless introductory clause. The sting of the bill is in its tail. Why does the Government not administer the education test? We were told that by that test an undesirable migrant, from any country could be rejected. If there is need for this legislation, the assumption is that the existing legislation is ineffective. It would be infinitely better .to retain the education test. It has been said that 98 per cent, of our migrants should be British. If we are to have migrants, let us by all means get them from within the Empire. But I agree with those who say that the 150,000 men and women who are unemployed in this country today should be provided for before we talk of encouraging people to come from any other land. To attract people to this country we need only create employment here.",46
187,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,How can we do that with half the population of the country in the six capital cities?,47
188,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"It was not the Labour Governments of this country, but the land-jobbers and city agents, that laid out the railway systems of - New South Wales and Victoria. They were mainly responsible for the 'centralization that exists today. There is not only too much centralization, but also too much government, in Australia. With only one central government we could open up more country, unify the laws, provide .for local government and counteract - centralization. To place orders for government work abroad, and at the same time to briai-g large numbers of migrants to this country from other parts \>f the world, can only have one objectto lower the wages and standard of living of the people of this country. More unemployment must mean the lowering of the conditions of living. One object of the bill is to regulate immigration, .but the people of this country will never know whether immigration is regulated. All they will know will be that from time to .time ship-loads of undesirables will be landed in this country. If we make the conditions in this country comfortable there will be no need to spend the taxpayers' money to assist migrants from abroad.",47
189,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [9.8] - In speaking on the second reading of the bill I said that if it was necessary for this country to have migrants in considerable numbers for its industrial prosperity and progress, and particularly for its defence, we should have them on two conditions-first , that the industries of this country should be able to absorb them without displacing Australians; and, secondly, that they should be desirable people, who could be merged with our own population and depended upon to observe the standards we have been .setting up in Australia for many years past. Some interesting quotations have been made during the debate on this bill, and the honourable member for Beid (Mr Coleman) this afternoon quoted extensively from a book which I should like every supporter of immigration to read. It is entitled, The Immigrant: An Asset and a Liability, by Frederick J. Haskins, and it deals with this question as it affects another country. I am very glad that extracts from that book will be reprinted in Hansard, where they can be . read by all who care to read them. I am opposed determinedly to this clause, because I believe Australia cannot absorb migrants of some nationalities. This country is not ready for assisted immigrants of any kind, having regard to the enormous number of Australians who - are unemployed. It is a national crime to spend the hard-earned money of the workers to meet the cost of bringing from the other side of the world people whose presence here deprives the workers of employment. My objection applies whether the migrants come from Great Britain or elsewhere. Why are there so many thousands of people out of employment in Australia? Although members op2D0site talk of the necessity for migrants, in the next breath they have to admit that unemployment is worse than it has been for many years past. It cannot be said too often that if we make conditions comfortable for those who are here they will send for their friends and provide openings for them. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) administered to-night a welldeserved castigation to the honourable. member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), who last night, with a customary show of sincerity, tried to belabour honourable members on this side. He said we were supporting communism, to which this clause refers, for it provides that the Government may reject any undesirable migrant. The honourable member for Fawkner, in what was ostensibly a sincere speech, though really less sincere than any other speech ever made in this Parliament, and quite unworthy of his position and abilities",47
190,Mr GKEGOBY,Unknown,"But we all thought a lot of it . Mr O ' KEEFE - Every honourable member ou the Ministerial side knows perfectly well that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) WAS saying what he knew to be untrue, and they sooled - him on because of a pre-arrangement rhat he should be the last speaker from that side, and that honourable members ou this side should have no opportunity to reply to his vituperatiou and untruths. Mr Tiiowi'sox - He spoke on his own initiative.",48
191,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Whether he spoke on his own initiative or in accordance with an arrangement made in the party room, his utterances were unworthy of his position and his abilities. It is well that some industrious members have been able to look up the record of the honourable member in order to show what a splendid supporter of the ideals of trade unionism he was a few years ago. Australia should be warned by the experience of other countries which today are troubled-with an excess of alien immigrants. If we are not careful as to the number and calibre of the immigrants whom we .admit into Australia, we may have cause to be sorry a few years hence. I shall quote a passage from Alien I m m i g r at i o n : Should Restrictions be Imposed?, in which the honourable case for restriction is put by Frederick Bradshaw, and the case for the i m m igrant by Charles Emanuel. This book relates to alien immigration into Great Britain , and Frederick Bradshaw in his introductory note says' One of the most perplexing problems of the present clay is, without doubt, the influx into Great Britain of thu -'destitute aliens."" Many people object to the adjective, but they can only maintain their objection by affixing an arbitrary limit to destitution. They point out that, although the alien may not possess wealth when he hinds, yet he quickly becomes self-supporting. The alien, they say, is moral, sober, law abiding, and thrifty The very same arguments are used by those in Australia who advocate an in flux of aliens in order to reduce wages aud lower the standard of l i v in ghe soon leaves the slumsj and by increasing his own wealth he increases that of the nation. They point to new industries, which they claim are his creation, nnd they sing the praises of cheap clothes and boots, as though the cost lit which this cheapness is possible were only the actual money paid, to the alien, who makes them in the sweater's den. They never look below the surface, nor have they seen close at liiind the immediate results of this cheapness, both on the alien and on the man he has ""dispossessed - The ""two nations"" of Disraeli were never more separate than today in London, and the weaker nation-England' s puor-and face to Eaee with a third nation, whose rivalry threatens to deprive them of the results of 50 years of struggle for humane conditions of labour. Of what avail are Factoi-v Acts when the workmen know nothing of tlieni, or if they do, feel that their living depends upon tiieir assisting the sweater to evade tliomV Parliament may pass Health Acts and borough councils adopt by-laws, but the Augean stable of Alien Town ean never be cleansed by such moans. We are told to trust to the civilizing influences of British surroundings to raise the moral and civil home of the ghetto-dweller from East Europe, but there is a limit to the power of absorption possessed by any one community, nor can a cistern run drywhen the conduit can pour in more water than the drain can take away. It is useless to trustto ordinary methods of treatment when dealing with the questiou of alien immigration. ""Alone among the nations of the world we allow the scum of the - earth to enter our laud, and, naturally, taking the line of least resistance, they come to us in ever-increasing numbers, since the rest of the world is closed to them. Some system of restriction must be adopted or we shall lose the undoubted benefits which accrue to a nation from immigration, and retain only the evil consequences. But mcTe assertions curry no weight, and I intend to adduce evidence that, taken as a whole, the alien immigrant is tiiot a desirable addition to our population on account of his origin, habits, economic value (?) and general want of those principles of morality which we consider necessary in a British subject. I desire to place in .Hansard another quotation, which will he instructive to those who may read this discussion. The following extract is from Eace or Mongrel, by Alfred P. Schultz, and was written, about twelve years, ago, ou the"" subject of immigration into America :The statement is made that the native American does not do manual labour. Is it because he does not want to work? No; it is because he cannot work for the wages that Slavs and Latins work for. That is what we who speak on behalf of the workers wish to impress upon the - Govermnent and its supporters, who apparently are not averse from a considerable influx of southern Europeans. Hon- orable members opposite profess to believe in maintaining Australiau standards of livin g and wages, and they would do well to profit by the experience of America, which wants no more alien immigrants. In every part of this book by Schultz one can find irrefutable evidence that it is an unsound policy to allow the immigration of large numbers of southern Europeans. The passage I was reading continuesAlthough he has already learned, in the big cities, to live with his family in a hole in the wall and call it his home,' ho has not yet learned to live upon rotten fruits and decayed vegetables, with mouldy 'bread and putrid meat as an occasional delicacy. Those of us who have seen the conditions under which southern Europeans live in Australia know that that statement .is no exaggerationHe has not yet learned that the filth and vice of many tenement-house districts are the American economic ideal, because the cheap 'labour there assures an enormous trade balance in America's favour. In short, he has not yet recognized that he is a cur No one will maintain that the United States, with a population of more than 80,000,000, cannot supply her own labour force. As the present immigration consists of people who do work, but who do not make work, its effect is a displacement of the native workers toy the immigrant. There are but few states, in the union that want immigrants, and these do not want the immigrants that are now coming. Most of tliese states have emphatically declared that they do not want settlers from the immigrant quarters of the eastern cities. But Australia has been get-ting those people. The south wants as immigrants men of iei-poiisibilitv. farmers and agriculturists, men of brain and hands. In other words,' the south wants immigrants that she cannot have: men who have sense enough to stay at home; men who know that they can elsewhere succeed better than in the United States, where competition with the cheapest of European labourers t-annot but have a detrimental effect. Tliese are the economic effects of the present immigration. The direct competition of the immigrant with the native labourer lowers wages, which, in turn, lowers the standard of living and degrades civilization. The low standard of living of many of the immigrants makes competition with them for the native impossible, and he is crowded out. Immigration, therefore, increases the army of the unemployed and again lowers the standard of living, degrades civilization, and causes discontent and crime. When wages are low, the workmen strike in (.lie effort to .better tlieir conditions. The immigrant is always there fo take the striker's place. That suits some honourable .members opposite. If Australian workmen should strike in future, the immigrants may be hereto take their place. Immigration, therefore, causes strike; to assume the proportions of civil war. and usually the defeat of the strikers. Immigration prevents wages from rising. (Wages have in the United States actually fallen when compared with the cost of living.) In Northern Europe wages are now higher than formerly, not only absolutely, tout also relatively. Immigration forces the native to accept the low wages, for he is frequently placed before the alternative, "" work or starve."" Broe trade in labour forces him down to the low standard of the immigrant; the country, in others words, by suffering the competition, makes the workmen helots'. Why is there such a cry for the immigration of more people when it is admitted that so many are out of employment in Australia? There can be no doubt that some honourable members opposite desire that large numbers of men should be in troduced in order that they may be here to take the place of men put out of their employment when there is industrialtrouble. Surely honourable members opposite will not contend that it will add to the prosperity of the Commonwealth to bring people here to swell the ranks of the unemployed.",48
192,Mr COOK,Unknown,"Mr Theodore and Mr. Gillies are in favour of the immigration of Italians. Mr O^KEEPE - Honourable members on this side are not responsible for Mr . Theodore's view of Italians. I understand that what that gentleman said was that he does not mind migrants from northern Italy coming here if they can be absorbed in Australia. I wonder whether honourable, members opposite have ever tried to follow up the hundreds of migrants who are brought to this country in oversea boats, to. find out what becomes of them, and how many are absorbed in a natural way. I suppose it would not - worry them much if they knew that a very large percentage of these immigrants merely help to flood the already overfilled labourmarket in Australia.",49
193,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Eigh t out of every ten of them stay in the cities. Mr O ' KEEFE , - Is that the sort of immigration that honourable members opposite want?",50
194,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"No . Mr OKEEFE, - Then why are they supporting this bill? If eight out of every ten of these immigrants remain in the cities, they are absorbed only by displacing; Australians', because they are prepared to accepta lower standard of living and lowerwages. Only the other day I quoted the case of a splendid type of Englishman who was unable to find employment. We should be proud to see many like him coming to Australia if employment could be found for them. He had a sorry tale to tell of the experience of many migrants from* Great B r it a in within the. last, two or three years. Even more sorry tales are told of the experiences of migrants from southern Europe. It is because we know thati Australia is not at present able to absorb these immigrants that we are opposed to these clauses. I say that we do not want southern Europeans to come here-,, even if they come a(S their own expense.",50
195,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Is that the policy of the Labour p a r t v ' Mr O ' KEEFE - I do not know that it is, but it is certainly my policy. So long as Australians are out of work, I shall object to any assistance being given for the introduction' of immigrants. The reason why honourable members opposite support the introduction of large numbers of immigrants is that they expect that they will thus be able to obtain the service of cheap labour. It would be interesting to know how many recent immigrants have found work in occupations protected by wages board and arbitrationcourt awards: I know of a Greek, who has a fairly large business in an Australian city. Hedoes not employ many, but those he does employ have come from his' own country. The work is supposed to be covered by a wages board award, but it was recently discovered that his employees were not getting the wages provided for by the award. It was found that many of them could scarcely speak English, and they pretended that they did not know what wages they should get under the award.",50

197,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Darling, Downs*-Attorney-General) . [9.40} - Hon orable members opposite have covered a wide range in speaking, to this clause, but they seem to have quite forgotten what, it contains. They have opposed it . They say that they believe in a more drastic restriction of immigration, and they have, given reasons why, in their opinion, the restrictions upon alien immigration should be made more stringent. Let me remind the committee that honourable members opposite have occupied Ministerial positions. They administered the Immigration. Act during the. whole of the time they were in office, but they never attempted to introduce a clause of this character. Now that a clause is submitted which is intended to carry out the policy which they say they believe in , they are unanimously opposed, to it . We may well ask why this is so. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members, and also of those outside this chamber, to the object of the clause and its effect. The clause is intended to give the Government express power for the purpose of restricting alien immigration into Australia. It goes so far as to enable the Governor General by proclamation to absolutely prohibit the immigration of aliens. Reference to the clause will show that the proposed restrictions will operate where it. is deemed desirable(<i) on account of the economic industrial' UF other conditions existing in the Commonwealth; (b) because the persons specified in the proclamation are in his opinion unsuitable, for admissioninto the Commonwealth; or (c) because they are deemed unlikely to become readily assimilated or to assume the duties and responsibilities of Australian citizenship within a. reasonable time after their entry. These are the grounds on which the Government is seeking power either to absolutely prohibit alien immigration or to restrict - it. The. admission of immigrants of any specified nationality, race,, class, or occupation may be restricted under the clause on the grounds I have mentioned. Why are honourable members opposite opposing the bill? Mr E . RILEY - We want the quota system incorporated in the measure.",50
198,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"I understood that some honourable members opposite were entirely opposed to the. quota system, and, in fact, to any form of assisted imanigration whilst there is. unemployment in Australia.",51
199,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,There are only six Ministerialists present. We should have a quorum. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr Bayley) - There ; is a quorum present.,51
200,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"As a reason for their opposition to the bill honourable members opposite have declared that supporters of the measure desire to bring about a reduction in wages and a lowering of the standard of living. There is nofoundation in fact for that statement. W it h a population of less than 6,000,000 we are in possession of a continent, the potential wealth of which is unsurpassed in the world. Nations which feel the pressure of their population are asking themselves what we Australians are doing with this great country. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr . Penton-)- declared himself in favour of maintaining the proportion of British stock-at 98 per cent. We say that our policy will bring about that result. I m migration is now being treatedas an Empire question. The British Government has agreed with the dominions to seek a proper distribution of Empire population with in the Empireso that it maybe strengthened in all its parts. To this end the Empire Settlement A ct was passed by the British Parliament, and in furtherance of that policy, the Commonwealth Government made an agreement with the British Government with a view to absorbing a proportion of British migrants-. The British Ministry has adopted an entirely new policy in the history of m i gration. It is prepared to make, available large sums, of money on liberal terms to dominion governments in connection with expenditure on public works to open, up areas for settlement, and to provide employment for prospective settlers. Honourable members who represent country districts know what the fruits of such a policy wil l be. There are ample*opportunities in Queensland. That state, which has a population of about 800,000, could easily support 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 people. No country in the world is more adapted toclose settlement than the northern parts of Queensland. Y e t we are told by opponents of the. bill that this rich inheritance must remain idle.",51
201,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Can Australians get land there ?,51
202,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Mr Theod'ore, formerly Premier of Queensland, declared not long agothat the Burnett lands were not being taken up, and! he suggested that they might be made available for Italians. Western Australia is in exactly the same position asQueensland. The history of development in Queensland' indicates what we may expect from the expenditure of public money to open up further areas for settlement. As railways were pushed out to the unoccupied portions of Queensland, settlement took place, townships sprang up, and, as the larger estates were cut up, population further increased, and additional employment was provided in country towns as well as in the larger centres of population. Honourable members opposite painted a very gloomy picture of Australia. I say emphatically that no other country in the world can compare with Australia in many respects. It would be much better if honourable members stressed the opportunities available to all in Australia. Comparatively few of the nominated immigrants have failed. The records concerning, the boys who have been brought out under various schemes are alsomost encouraging. W it h few exceptions, the lads are full of hope for the future, and they are making good.",51
203,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Does the Minister know that, according to the Commonwealth Statistician, there are 150,000' adults out of work in Australia?",51
204,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"For the time being there may be a number of unemployed, but the cause is not far to seek. Industrial disturbances are to an extent responsible. Does the honourable member for Barton (Mr Coleman) know that some country works have lapsed for the simple reason that men cannot be induced to take up the contracts ? Does he know, also, that primary producers in some parts of Australia have had to restrict their enterprises owing to the difficulty of getting labour ? The bill , instead of producing the evils which honourable members opposite suggest will result from its passage, is expressly intended to supply the remedy. It will restrict unsuitable immigration. It is based upon the Canadian law, which has been in existence for some years, and has been exercised. Under the Canadian legislation a proclamation was issued prohibiting the introduction of certain classes of migrants. Bona fide agriculturists, farm labourers. female citizens of the United States, and British subjects who can satisfy the immigration authorities that they have ample means to maintain themselves are not affected by it . I ask the committee to pass the clause so that the Government may give effect to the policy which some honourable members opposite profess to believe in. Progress reported. DECLARATION OI? URGENCY.

The times allotted for the committee and final stages of the bill have been chosen to give an opportunity for discussion of its more important features in committee. But I remind honourable members that the measure is based on two broad principles, one relating to the restriction of immigration and the other to the power to deport. During the second reading debate some 43 or 44 speeches were made. Not the slightest restriction was placed on the discussion of Lister. J. H. the bill ; on the contrary every opportunity was given to debate its principles. But we cannot continue to discuss one measure week after week without reaching finality. For the proper conduct of public business we should recognize the necessity of allocating a reasonable time for the discussion of proposals for legislation. This involves no curtailment of the rights of free speech or of the p r i v i leges of Parliament. The business of the House of Commons is regularly conTellers: ducted by the allotment of time for the consideration of measures. It would be well for ,the conduct of public business and would be in the interest of honourable members themselves if we adopted the practice of allocating reasonable times for the discussion of all measures, because the exceptional application of the power to do so creates in the minds of honourable members the feeling that their rights are being restricted. I do not think any one could suggest that the fullest opportunity has not been given to honourable members to express the opinions regarding the principles underlying the bill.. The time allocated for the committee stages is ample for the further cussion of its various clauses, and that honourable members will discuss them and not the motion which I have moved to expedite the transaction of the business of the country.",52

In other words, the least important provision in the bill will be discussed until 12.30 tomorrow, when the closure will be applied.

214,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite, like dumb driven sheep, follow the wishes of those who represent certain interests in this country. The Government must be prepared to accept the responsibility of restricting to four hours the discussion on the most important clauses in the bill, affecting to a very great extent the liberty of the people of this country. The clause that we have been discussing all the afternoon is of sniaJl importance compared with those that remain. We are not entitled to rush legislation of this kind through Parliament. Notwithstanding that I am anxious to do everything possible suitably to welcome the American Fleet, I must say that this legislation is of much more importance to the community than the visit of the Americans, and we should take proper time to discuss it - If we cannot give proper time to it before the adjournment. is made for the fleet festivities, we should defer it for consideration later. The Prime Minister, in moving the second reading of the bill, said that there was no particular urgency about it . The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr. in- Cunningham) reminds me that the following sentence' occurred in that speech:While there is not any present cause for alarm, we have to recognize that in the future n position may arise which will present serious danger to our racial purity, and may lead to the standards which we have created during a long period of years being destroyed. If the measure is not urgent, why must we complete our discussion of these important provisions by 12.30 o'clock tomorrow? I enter an emphatic protest against treating important legislation in this way. Every measure which aims a blow at trade unionism is of the greatest importance to Australia. It has remembere'd that the provisions of this measure will not be exercised only in regard to the particular indust r i a l disputes that we are now passing through, but also in respect to every industrial dispute in the f u t u r e . I wish to say quite definitely, however, that if this measure is on the statute book when the Labour party comes into office, we shall repeal it , and every similar measure at the earliest possible moment. I would not think of allowing anything like this to remain in force. It is most extraordinary that while with one breath the members of the Government talk about the Empire's greatness and the necessity, in the interests of our security, for keeping it intact, in the very next breath they talk about deporting Britishborn people who have been resident here for twenty years or perhaps 30 years. Why are we never asked to deal in this way with measures which concern the wealthy classes of the community? An y legislation that, will apply to Sir Sydney Kidman and men like bim is to be given the fullest possible 'consideration, but whenever a bill is introduced which aims at assisting the wealthy classes to exploit the working man, it must be passed without delay - The Government desires the general public to understand that the object of this measure is to deport agitators, anarchists, and communists who have been in Australia only a very short time. I do not. know one leader of the industrial forces in Australia who has not been resident here for very many years.",53

The Prime Minister, of whom 1 was deeply suspicious as soon as I saw him enter the chamber, with a look of innocence which was incompatible with his intentions, has just given reasons, in his most conciliatory manner, not unlike the pompous attitude adopted by a shopwalker on a rainy day",54

It sounded very well in theory, but my first comment upon it is that it is the pleasant custom of the Prime Minister, following the bad example which was set by some of his predecessors, to allow Parliament to remain in recess for the greater part of the year, and then to call it together for as brief a period as possible to hustle business through without due consideration or discussion. Seeing the honourable member  minds me of a circumstance that occurred last session. He wished to ventilate in this chamber a most important mattera really absorbing subject-namely , butter. It is doubtless a most important subject to the primary producer and the housewife. I should like to inform him, and I do so with great humility, that he very much misunderstood my attitude, and that, of honourable members - on this side of the chamber, if he believed that certain technical objections which we took to his proceeding with the discussion on that occasion were taken because of any inherent prejudice against the delicate subject of butter, or him personally. Our attitude to both butter and the honourable member was entirely friendly. Our action was taken as a protest against the attempt of the Government arbitrarily to whittle away the rights of honourable members. I quite unconsciously and unintentionally raised a.laugh.in this chamber on one occasion by pointing out that Parliament is the place in which the paramount and, indeed, the only duty of honourable members is to talk and, of course, to think:, and to do as much as possible of both in the time available. Some honourable members opposite talk first and think, with moderation, afterwards. It is the duty of honourable members of Parliament to talk. Parliament is the place for discussion, and the length of time that we are permitted to meet here is not so great but that we should be free, - at now. least during that time, to bend our minds to the serious consideration of ' the guillotine, problems in hand, and make some honest attempt to solve them. I say, in all sinreal cerity, to the honourable member for Gippsland, therefore, that it very much pained me to have to appear to obstruct him on that occasion, but I warned the honourable gentleman, and others who for the moment sat behind the Government, with such commendable docility, that they might later on find themselves in the happy position that they would not permitted to air their grievances about butter, rabbits, wire netting, and other matters of great importance to their stituents. We shall not sit quietly under this indignity. We are here to beheard, shop-walkers if possible, and for as long as possible. My final word is to remind honourable members of the real need for urgency in dealing with this measure. I pointed'out in my second-reading speech that the clauses dealing with immigration in abstract were really immaterial.",54

Mr CUNNINGHAM [i""0.40] - Prio r to the very interesting diversion that has just occurred, the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) indulged in a few flamboyant utterances regarding this bill. under consideration gives to the Government a power which members of the Opposition say it already has, to prevent the influx of undesirable alien immigrants who may at any time menace th3 safety of this country. The Attorney General said that the Labour party, when it ' was in power, did not bring forward legislation to deal with the circumstances which, we say today, are menacing the well-being of a large number of workers. I point out to the Minister that it is ten years since there was a federal Labour administration, and that ten years ago there was not that pronounced flow of southern Europeans that has manifested itself in the last two years. What is the reason for this stream of migrants? The explanation is to be found largely in the restrictive legislation passed by the Congress of the United States of America. The shipping companies of the southern countries must carry cargoes, human or otherwise, and so they have carried out an intensive immigration campaign in the country districts of southern Europe, obtaining immigrants to come to Australia, since the door is closed in the United States of America. By that means they fil l their ships with human freight for Australia. It does* not matter to them whether .the passengers pre' permitted to land in this country, for if they NOES. are not, they are expected to cable to their homeland for money to take them> back. Thus the companies have freight for their ships to and f r o . They find their way back to their native country as best they can. These people formerly flocked to America in thousands, . because it offered better opportunities than were afforded in their own countries, and on arrival they were taken up by the employing class, who saw in people ignorant of the English language and PAIRS. local industrial conditions a new chance for commercial and industrial exploitation. Although the stream of immigration to Australia may not be very great J. today, I warn the workers that, if southern Europeans are allowed to enter in ever-increasing numbers, the conditions which obtain in the in (Gwydir) dustrial centres of America will develop here. In the United States of America, adjacent to big iron works, are colonies of Germans, Italians, Servians, Montenegrins, Russians, Poles, and other races The clause from central, southern, and eastern Europe. The different races are congregated in separate communities, which cannot speak the English language or converse with their neighbours. Employers even employ a different race on each shift, and agents are engaged to go amongst the workers and tell them that the men of other nationalities do better work and are held in higher esteem by the employers. In this way they seek to recreate upon American soil those racial hatreds and jealousies that are a curse to portions of Europe. We do not desire that condition of affairs to develop in Australia, and we should take now the necessary preventive measures. Our first duty is to Australia, regardless of what nation we offend.",55
225,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Americ a has not a system of wages boards and Arbitration Courts such as is in operation in AusEuropean Mr CUNNINGHAM - Because American labour has not adopted political action in order to regulate in dustrial conditions the employers have been able to exploit the system of manning their industries with warring elements, so preventing the co-operation of labour. . How can there be agreement between peoples who cannot speak to each other ? How can a Pole understand the mind of a Servian, a Greek, or a Montenegrin with whom he cannot converse? If a meeting of the workers in one big establishment were convened, at least half a dozen speakers or interpreters would be required in order to make the proceedings intelligible to the various races that would be represented. If we allow the influx of southern Europeans to continue, the Australian employers will soon follow the examples set by their American fellows. So long as I am in this Parliament, I shall endeavour to see that the workers are protected by preventing an influx of foreigners in such numbers as to menace the existing wages and conditions of living. honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH) and other honourable members have related how these immigrants are breaking down the industrial standards ir, the big centres. Australian workers who have been paying 30s. or £ 2 a week for houses have been forced out by foreigners who, by overcrowding several. families into one house, can afford to pay £ i a week in rent. I have been informed that sometimes the men coming off night shift tumble into the beds that have just been vacated by the men going on the day shift.",56
226,Mr GABH,Unknown,"A nurse in Port Pirie told us that the beds in one establishment never cold, because they are occupied by shift after shift.",57
227,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"We need no furthe r evidence to convince us of the necessity for taking some definite step at once. Travelling through New South Wales during the recess, I was reminded by people of all classes of the remarkable increase in the number of alien grants during the last couple of years. The people generally desire that some a radical restrictive policy be adopted.",57
228,Mr BKUCB,Unknown,"The new arrivals have been decreasing during the last few months, because of' the action that the Government has taken.",57
229,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Will action that the Government has taken, or intends to take, be effective? America is continuing its restrictions upon immian grants, and, therefore, the shipping compast panies seek in countries that have not plane as a merely political offence. passed such legislation an outlet for their immigrant passengers. An y decrease arrivals from southern Europe may' only temporary, and due to climatic conpolice. ditions, or the circumstances of seasonal occupations in Europe. The Prime M in ister said, when moving the. second reading of this bill, that the Government does not intend to impose these restrictions at once, notwithstanding that a big and in fluential body of publio opinion is genuinely alarmed by the present influx of aliens. The Prime Minister said, "" There is no present cause for alarm, but we have to recognize that in future a position may arise which will present serious danger to our racial purity."" The right honourable gentleman went on to say that the Government had brought forward this legisThe lation because it would be embarrassing and dangerous to introduce it at some future time, when the immigration from some countries had assumed large proportions. My opinion is that the Government does not intend to take any action in regard to alien immigrants, and that these provisions are inserted for the one purpose of camouflaging the later clauses relating to deportation. The Attorney General (Sir Littleton Groom) advanced reasons why people from abroad should, be allowed to enter Australia in great num-. bers. It is difficult for the layman to understand what is in the Government's are mind. At one moment Ministers speak in praise of aliens, and the next moment they dilate upon the unity of Empire and the keeping of British migrants within it . We pride ourselves on the fact that a natural-born or naturalized Britisher' can claim the protection of the Union Jack in any part of the world, but under this bill a person born in Britain , perhaps immiof one of the noble families, who having come to Australia, has became and engaged in an in dustrial dispute may, after a residence of 30 years in this country, be deported without even t r i a l by jury . What becomes of the protection afforded by the Union Jack? What becomes of the unity of Empire if a Britisher resident within the the Empire cannot claim t r i al by j u r y when charged with an industrial offence? Falling f o u l of the law in connection with industrial dispute has for a long time been regarded on practically the same I have been engaged in industrial disputes, in but was never imprisoned, probably bebe cause I was lucky enough to dodge the I remind the Prime Minister that men who have occupied positions as high as his own have been sent to jail for industrial offences, and a former Speaker of the Victorian Legislative. Assembly was not only an industrial rebe.', but revolted against constituted authority, and at one time a price of £500 was on his head.. But under the provisions of this bill, a Britisher-he may even be a distant relative of His Majesty the King, - the head of the British Empirefor, no doubt, there are many of them about the world-who has raised a family in Australia, may be deported without trial by jury, for no other reason than that 20, 30, or 40 years ago he participated in an ""industrial and was convicted, 1 assure honor^ able members opposite that the deportasioh of union leaders who were born outside Australia will not break up trade unionism; the only effect will be to place at the head of the unions native-born men, instead of men who came from Great Britain; and thus the Government's action will weaken the ties of Empirefor Britishers born out of Australia have no security under this bill-upon which they can place much reliance. The Attorney-General took members of the Labour party to task because they will not assent to immigration until our own peopleare provided for. I believe in charity - beginning at home. Whilst the people of Great Britain are content to retain their lords and dukes with their deer parks and their l»nd monopoly, and to crowd into the cities, where, we are informed, they must live on a haddock a day, we should not be expected to add to ©ur own burdens. The solution of Great Britain's unemployed problem is to be found in that country itself. While .the people there continue to bow to lords and dukes and land monopolists we should not be expected to add .thousands to our own unemployed. We, as well as the people of England, are told that millions of acres of land are available for settlement in Australia. The British Government sent a commission to Australia to inquire into the matter. Mr. .Thomas Wignall was a member of that commission. Honourable members who had the opportunity of meeting him will agree that he was a very fine type of English gentleman who would not be likely to make misstatements. When he returned to Great Britain he reported that he saw in Australia many thousands Mr Ctinninghnm. of acres of land suitablefor settlement, but it was all fenced in, and when he asked who owned it he was told it was owned by absentees, land companies, and squatters. He was - shown newspaper statements to the effect that, where bloeks of land were thrown open for settlement, there were many hundreds of applicants for them. For one block in the Nyngan district there were no less than 577 applicants. The land board eliminated 200 of these, and 377 men went to the ballot for the block. Of these, of course, 376 were disappointed. In my own district, near Inverell, there dispute were 329 applicants for three blocks that were thrown open. The land board eliminated about 100 of the applicants, and allowed 88 to go to the ballot. The chairman of the board said, ""We have reviewed these applicants, and a number of those. allowed to go to the ballot are, in our opinion, eminently desirable as settlers."" Still, 84 of them were disappointed, and could not get the land they wanted. What have honourable members opposite to say with regard to this?",57
230,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"The same thing happens in every state in the Commonwealth, including Queensland, yet there are millions of acres available. The trouble is that people want choice blocks.",58
231,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Honourable members on this side represent a greater area of the Commonwealth than is represented by the other two parties in this Parliament combined. The honourable member for Darling' represents the largest electorate in New. South Wales; I represent the second largest in the state; the honourable member for Kalgoorlie represents the largest electorate in Australia; the honourable members for Angas, Grey, Werriwa,- and Hume also represent very large electorates. We who represent these large country electorates can inform honourable, members who do not represent country districts that there are thousands of desirable men in this country ready to go on the land if honourable members opposite are prepared to do half as much for them, as they are prepared to do for the immigrant. I am asked what the New South Wales Labour Government has done in the matter. It has only just assumed office, and it must not be forgotten that there is in that state an absurd second legislativechamber to which members are appointed as couples are married, "" until death do us part."" That chamber is the great stumbling block to land settlement in New South Wales. My vote shall never be given to bring immigrants here whilst hundreds of our own people, many of them sons of farmers, are unable to secure land, and thousands of them are out of work. When this Parliament recently assembled, I asked the Prime M in ister whether he was aware that hundreds of men who had been lured to this country by specious immigration proraises were out of employment. Prime Minister denied my statement. The leader of one of the parties opposite, Mr Bruxner, Leader of the Progressive party, speaking at Goulburn, said, "" There is plenty of land for those who want it , and plenty of work."" A returned soldier stood up in the hall and said, "" I have walked 600 miles looking for work. If you say there is plenty of work, you are a liar."" He was taken out of the meeting and fined £ 2 for telling the truth . The honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) said he could find work for 500 men. If so, why does he not do so? Of course, I can understand that, some men are prepared to find work for others at their own price.",58
232,Mr MARR,Unknown,"Fiv e hundred men could find employment on the roads of the shires in Victoria alone, and at arbitration award rates.",59
233,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"It is strange that we should be told that the shires cannot get men to work when the B a i lway Construction Department in Victoria is inundated with applications from men who want work. I invite the Honorary Minister (Mr M a r r ) to tell us where the 500 men he speaks of can be employed. If he will do so, we will provide the men. I heard the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) say that he had several miles of fencing to be erected, but that for months past he had been unable to get men to do the work. The honourable member did not say what price he was prepared to p a y * He probably could not get men to do the work at £30 or £40 a mile. There are fences on my far m that cost £80 per mile to erect.",59

236,Mr HILL,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that he paid £80 a mile for the erection of a fence?,59
237,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Yes ; and the honourable gentleman, big man as he. is, could not upend some of the posts.",59
238,Mr HILL,Unknown,I could get the honourable The member any number of men to erect fences at £80 per mile.,59
239,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"The men who erected my fences have been years at the work, and they just made decent wages at the price paid them. We have been told that the Arbitration Courts were set up to ensure the peace, order, and good government of this country, but the M in ister for Works and Eailways (Mr Hill ) said he would overthrow the Arbitration Court.",59
240,Mr HILL,Unknown,When ?,59
241,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Like the mummy of K in g Tut, the honourable gentleman's words .are enshrined in a tomb- a tome of Hansard. On the 2nd A p r i l, 1924, which is not so long ago, the honourable gentleman said I would remove the sugar embargo. Which, of course, would mean the introduction of black-grown sugarI would do away with Arbitration Courts and high tariffs. Does the honourable gentleman mean that ?",59
242,Mr HILL,Unknown,I am no worse in that respect .than some of the seamen the honourable member supports. They do not want the Arbitration Court.,59
243,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I ask the honourable member for Parkes (Mr M a r r ) whether he will continue to sit in the same Cabinet with an honourable gentleman who would do those things which are being countenanced by the persons at whom the deportation clauses of this bill are aimed? The Minister for Works and Eailways adopts today an entirely different attitude from that which he adopted in 1924. We know that a composite ministry, because it is ruled by expediency, is an impossible instrument for the good government of a country. The first duty of a government is to look after the interests of its own people. A few days ago the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) nished honourable members with an inwho teresting statement of the progress made by Australia from the date of its original settlement. There is no necessity to do other than refer honourable bers to his very fine address. provisions of this bill if there were any convicts left they could be personally ducted back to their native land, if they had taken a hand in any industrial dispute, and had become objectionable the Government. The clause provides the issue of a proclamation "" prohibiting, either wholly or in excess of specified matter urgent. numerical limits, the immigration aliens of any specified nationality, account of economic or other conditions existing in the Commonwealth."" The right honourable the Prime appeared to doubt my word when I referred a few days ago to the plight certain men who had borrowed from friends or relatives in Britain order to pay their passage money to clcLUSG Australia. Many of these men are to be seen walking about country districts in so, Mr Chairman. New South Wales, looking for work, and some have been assisted financially by myself, and also by supporters Government. There is a on the part of those who are comfortable circumstances to ignore the plight of such men, many of whom, unhappily, are in an infinitely position than they were in before they left the - Mother Country. The continual iteration by the ex-Premier of New South Wales that there was no poverty in New South Wales, and that there was work for all, was to a large extent responsible for able member. the downfall of the Puller The same fate awaits this Government for ignoring that body of public opinion that is ashamed of the Commonwealth being dumping ground for Great Britain's employed. The people of the Mother Country must deal with their own probi lem. Sooner or later the British ment will have to close the door against any further influx of foreign who, by working long hours on piece-work, have forced the British worker on to the unemployed market. Australia not be expected to carry Britain's employed. We should endeavour maintain a decent standard here. My leader (Mr Charlton), he attended the League of Assembly last year, met the representahave Mr Cunningham. furtives of the workers in various countries, informed him that their conditions would improve if they could get land. That also is the problem in Australia. for me What is the reason for urgency ? The memGovernment has shown no desire for Under the urgency in bringing Kidman and Mayoh to book in connection with their shipping concontracts, or in asking Sir Sidney Kidman and Mr Edmund Jowett to pay the claims of the Taxation Department. to Yet, when it is a question of passing for legislation to deal with trade union leaders, the Government declares the  on I submit that the House has dealt with industrial the question of urgency, and we are now Minister in committee discussing clause 3 of the bill.",59
244,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, I shall be glad if the money honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunin ningham) will confine his remarks to the,60
245,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"I shall do I presume that the Government wishes the bill to be passed in order to issue a certain proclamation of the urgently. The Prime Minister's seconddisposition reading speech did not suggest the need in for urgency. Now that the member for Indi (Mr Cook) is in the chamber, I should like to remind him of his stateworse ment that hei could find work for 500 men in his district. Will the honourable remember furnish the labour exchange with particulars of that work ? In view of the hard facts that present themselves to me, I find it difficult to believe the honorThere are thousands of Government. men searching for employment. Surely Composite honourable members supporting the ' influential Government will not slander these men by saying that they are all loafers. Many made a have asked me if I could find even a unfew days' work for them. The Labour Government in New South Wales, since t assumed office, has provided employGovernment for 1,000 men in my state. migrants, Married men were the first to be employed. Benevolent societies in the vario u s states have done excellent work by disshould tributing clothes and food to men out of unwork, and to their wives and children, to and endeavouring to find employof living ment for them. The Government of New when South Wales at any rate has attempted Nations to relieve the unemployment problem. I tried all my l if e to improve the conditions of the industrial workers, and I know, from my experience, that it is utterly useless to bring immigrants liere when our own men cannot be settled on the land. Great Britain is prepared to lend to the Commonwealth and the states £34,000,000 at low interest charges to assist in the development of this country and the absorption of British migrants. Australia is a solvent nation, and needs no concessions from Great Britain . There should be no necessity to spoon feed immigrants who come here to deprive our own people of employment. Two years ago the Queensland Government was blackguarded from one end of Australia to the, other for floating a loan in America, yet today the Treasurer, if the newspaper reports are correct, is following the example set by that Labour Government. We have in the past attempted to place unsuitable men on the land. Sir Joseph Carruthers talked about providing 1,000,000 farms for 1,000,000 farmers, but we find very few inexperienced men settled on the land under the various state schemes make a success of farming it . Before being allowed to take up holdings immigrants should be employed for some time-som e say at least five years - as farm hands to gain a knowledge of local conditions. The Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) jeered at the Labour party for its failure to introduce legislation to restrict immigration. I remind him that ten years ago, when the Labour party was in power, there was no great influx of southern Europeans into Australia. These people have been diverted from America. The Government of the United States of America found it necessary to pass laws restricting the immigration of southern Europeans, because these people formed themselves into colonies of their own and became a menace to the welfare of that country. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN "" The honourable member's time has expired - It has been the custom ever since the Mr F. MCDONALD (Barton) [11.40]. - The clauses dealing with restrictive immigration are closely associated with the problem of unemployment, and a good deal of the debate has hinged on this subject. Although there has been much castigation of the Government, I for one have not forgotten that credit is'due to the Government for their efforts to find employment for some people-somewhere . I believe in the old saying. "" Give the devil his due."" The unemployment problem is not peculiar to Australia. In Europe unemployment is rife , due mainly to the aftermath of the war, but the war is hardly the cause of unemployment in Australia today. It is the duty of the Government to find employment for its unemployed, particularly, if it can be done, by helping to build up important industries. Now, there was an opportunity to build up the iron and steel industry in Australia by constructing here the two cruisers for which we have appropriated money, and thereby giving employment to thousands of our workmen. Instead of doing that, tenders have been let abroad, and employment given to people of other countries-Grea t Britain, and even France and Germany, because much of the material used will probably be made in those countries. That stands to the credit of the Government, surely!",60
246,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," I - must ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the subject of the prohibition of immigration by proclamation. Mr F . MCDONALD - That subject is closely associated with the subject of unemployment, sir, and I was endeavouring to point out that the Government was not. giving proper attention to our Australian industries. It will be remembered as the Government that did everything possible to assist industries overseas, but neglected our own. Let it not be forgotten, too, that with a real international outlook, this Government, while not reducing the number of unemployed here, has certainly helped to reduce the number in Italy , Greece, Czecho-Slovakia, and Jugo-Slavia.

248,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I suggest, for the consideration of the honourable member, that it wonld be more appropriate for him to discuss this matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House - ",62
249,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am not prepared to permit the business to reach that stage, sir. Honourable members of the Opposition are willing to continue the consideration of the bill before us. It would have been quite easy for the Minister in charge of the House to report progress at 11 o'clock or shortly afterwards. Then we could all have reached our homes in comfort. I wish to make it quite clear that whenever the Government applies the guillotine to important legislation I shall not ask for the House to be adjourned. It is not reasonable to expect me to do so, for if I did, I should make i sible for the Government, on the following day, to say that I was not prepared to continue consideration of the business. I trust that if we are kept here much longer, the customary practice of providing supper will be observed. That courtesy has already been overlooked once in this Parliament. On that occasion the sitting of 'the House continued until such a late sorry to have to say it . hour that a number of honourable memlast bers were obliged to walk home. It the first time that that had happened i the history of this Parliament. I should like to hear what the Prime Minister to say on this matter.

275,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have deemed it advisable, in view of the state of feeling in which I found honourable members when I resumed the chair, to allow this somewhat lax proceeding. Many of the remarks of the honourable members who have addressed the House were outside the terms of the motion. It is distinctly disorderly in the House to refer to proceedings in committee. I appeal to honourable members to assist me in giving effect to the Standing Orders.",64
276,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"Gwydir) [12.14 a.m.] - There is an idea in the minds of honourable members on this side that the Government is trying to take an unfair advantage of them. The Prime Minister has said that when he came into the House I was speaking. That is so. I was due to sit down at five minutes past 11, and I did so under direction from the Chair. But progress was not reported then, and to secure continuity in my remarks, I rose again, as I was entitled to do under the standing order. Honourable members on this side interpreted the in action of the Minister in charge of the House to mean that the Government desired to sit late. A time l i m it for the consideration of the bill had been fixed, and the Government apparently sought to force a member of the Opposition to ask that progress be reported. It would have been wrong for any honourable member of the Opposition to do that. I seek no concessions from the Prime Minister; he is in control of the House while he has a majority, as we hope a Labour Prime Minister will be after the next election If , at, say, 11.15, he had intimated to me by interjection that he wanted to adjourn, I should have resumed my seat.

The House has resolved that this bill shall be disposed of by 5.30 today, that is, Thursday. Honourable members will be placed in a very unfortunate position if , by the carrying of this motion, they are deprived of the opportunity of speaking again on the bill. Rather than do that. I would prefer that we should'proceed with the consideration of it in committee to-night.. .The deportation clauses are the most momentous proposals ever introduced into this Parliament, and yet there will be only about four and a quarter hours for their consideration when the committee sits again, if we adjourn to the hour fixed. Honourable members on the Government side will require all the time that is available to make clear their position in regard to the bill. The greater the time we have to discuss the deportation clauses and protest against an in justice to a great many people who were born in Great B r it a in and have made their homes in Australia, the better it will be for the prestige of this Parliament and honourable members opposite. I am quite prepared to sit all night, and, if the bill is as urgent aa the Government has declared it to be, honourable members should not begrudge one night's work to safeguard the in terests of the Australian people. Governments are often killed by their own acts. The Fuller Government, in New Soutli Wales, refused to take heed of the representations by members of the Labour party in the State Parliament, and at the - general election it was turned out of office. I have no sympathy with Sir George Puller and his party, but I have a lot of sympathy with the people who are suffering through the maladministration of governments which are antagonistic to the workers.

I do not complain of any discourtesy that the Government might choose to place upon members of the Opposition. I do not ask for courtesy from Ministers; I can find means of getting to my home at any hour of the night; but, in fairness to those who wish to discuss this measure, the consideration in committee should have been continued, at any rate, until the debate had progressed so far as to ensure that for the completion of the committee stage a reasonable time would be available at the next sitting. I am opposed to the reporting of progress now when the consideration of certain clauses must be completed in an hour and a half after re-assembling on Thursday. Honourable members on this side are ready to apply themselves to this measure, and if it is urgent, as the Government has declared it is, we should deal with it tonight. The Government wasted eight months in recess, and when Parliament belatedly met, the Prime Minister attacked the Opposition for not speaking on the Address-in-Reply, which meant nothing! But the Immigration Bill is important, not because of any good it may achieve, but because of the injury it may do to the Australian people, and we should have the fullest opportunity to discuss it. The Government has guillotined the bill because it wishes Parliament to adjourn for three weeks for a lot of junketing; for that reason this Parliament may not debate proposals that involve the flooding of the Commonwealth with immigrants at a time when there is unprecedented unemployment throughout Australia. Honourable members opposite are not prepared to allow honourable members on this side to ex-, press their views. I suggest that the House should return into committee on the Immigration Bill, so that honourable members who do represent some earnest thought) - regarding it may express the views - they hold. If honourable members who support the Government have said all they wish to say, we on this side of the House demand an opportunity to express the views of the people who sent us here.",65
283,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [12.28 a.m.] - I , too, prefer that the consideration of the bill in committee should be resumed immediately. Probably we shall have less than an hour to discuss the first portion of the measure at the next sitting. The Government having been so mean, I look to it for no.courtesy to-night. Parliament has been idle long enough; but, instead of passing legislation that would promote the best interests of the people, the Government is hurriedly forcing through the House a measure that will create turmoil and trouble. If that is the aim of the so-called statesmen who lead this Parliament, God help this country! The only decent thing we can do is to continue the committee discussion forthwith.",65
284,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [12.30 a.m.] - The clauses of the Immigration Bill dealing with the question of deportation have an important bearing on the welfare of a great number of people in this country. Honourable members on this side are vitally concerned in the matter because they have the interests of the great majority of the people of Australia at heart, and not those of the section who have no reason to worry about getting employment or about providing themselves with a livelihood. We are here primarily in the interests of the workers and the small farmers and producers of the Commonwealth. Instead of curtailing the discussion of the measure, the Government should give honourable members every opportunity to debate it at length. After months of a recess, during which Ministers were squandering the people's money in joy rides around the country, the Government proposes to close the House at the end of this week, when, no doubt, there will be a great deal of junketing for three weeks, at the expense of the country. Honourable members are sent here to do the work of the people. The members of the Opposition recognize that they are charged with a very responsible duty, and they are not prepared to shirk it because the time happens to be half-past 12 in the morning. Honourable members on the other side are acting in this matter at the dictation of the shipping combines outside.",66
285,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That has nothing to do with the motion before the House. The question is whether a committee of this House-shall have leave to sit again, and the honourable member will be good enough to confine himself henceforth to that question.",66
286,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I say that the committee should sit forthwith and carry out its duty. The measure under consideration is of great importance to the people of this country, as under it, in the next few weeks, the liberty of individuals in the Commonwealth may be placed in jeopardy, without a fair trial by a jury. I wish to do my duty to the people of my electorate, and I protest against being deprived of the opportunity to do it. Since this Parliament was elected at the end of 1922 it has done nothing of a practical nature to assist in' the development of the country, and my object - in speaking now is to induce the Government to reconsider its decision to give up its work to-night. There is no reason why we should not go on with the consideration of the Immigration Bill, after which honourable members opposite will have plenty of time to have a Turkish bath, get their hair cut; and make themselves ready generally for the festivities of next week. We have had enough procrastination; what we want now is action. I cannot help thinking at the moment that the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was right when he said that the Government is like a rudderless ship.",66
287,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The actions of the Government do not concern me; the principles of parliamentary debate do. The motion is for leave to a committee of the House to sit again. I ask the honourable member to confine himself to that.,66
288,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I say that we should not put off to a later hour what we can do now. We should go right on with our very important job. Honourable members on this side who wish to discuss the Immigration Bill should have ample time in which to do so. I can see that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) desires to say a few words, and I shall leave him to continue the debate, which is of the utmost importance in view of the issues involved.",66
289,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [12.37 a.m.] - May I ask you, sir, how long I am permitted under the Standing Orders to speak to the question?",66
290,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is permited to speak for. 65 minutes, if he can do so on the motion before the House.",66
291,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I shall endeavour to compress my observations into the time prescribed by the standing order, and I shall rely upon the good sense of the House to give me adequate time if I have not finished my remarks at the expiration of the 65 minutes allowed. By way of prologue to the main speech I propose to address to the question a little later on, may I be permitted to point out that in the concluding hours of yesterday I addressed a few words to the question whether or not the Immigration Bill should be considered an urgent matter. It will be remembered by honourable members who are still awake that I ventured to point out to the Government the dangers of introducing, at this early stage of the session, the drastic provisions of the guillotine. I suggested to the Leader of the Government that it was not so simple a matter as appeared at first sight. I quoted, in support of my argument, the immortal case of "" Gippsland and butter."" It does not become any person professing to be a Christian in a Christian country to say, "" I told you so,"" but as I am developing a healthy irascibility, appropriate to the hour and the circumstances, I say to the Government, "" I told you so."" I warned them that the method they proposed to adopt, though drastic, was not simple.",66
292,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot discuss the guillotine, which is provided for by a standing order of the House.",67
293,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I bow, sir, to your ruling We entertain a strong belief that the bill in respect of which the motion before the House has been tabled is one that should be adequately discussed. The motion, as I understand it , is that the committee have leave to sit again. At the time it was moved it was "" That the committee have leave to sit again tomorrow."" I understand that you, sir, have ruled it was not tomorrow, or if it was, that tomorrow was, for the purposes of the motion, to be deemed today, and, therefore, the motion now is, "" That the. committee have leave to sit at a later hour of today."" That means that we are to recommence the consideration of this measure at 11 o'clock today, and it is now a quarter to 1 in the morning. It is most unfair that the time allotted by the motion moved yesterday evening by the Prime Minister should be arbitrarily curtailed by the House rising now, thus depriving us of no less than ten hours of the time which would have been available for the discussion of the bill, even under the provisions of'the standing order which you have ruled I may not discuss in detail. I come now to the reasons why I should oppose, as I do, the motion that the committee should have leave to sit again at a later hour of this ;day. I have no objection' to the' committee having leave to sit again. The part of the motion to which I object is that it should have leave to sit at 11 o'clock today, when it should, at the present moment, be engaged in the consideration of the Immigration Bill . What are the reasons which move me to say this? They are contained in the bill itself. Further, I suggest that it is germane to the present motion that I should discuss the bill from its title to its appendix.",67
294,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member will not be allowed to do that.,67
295,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I move That the question be now put.,67
296,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I regret that I cannot accept the motion.,67
297,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) makes complications for himself. He gets him self into serious trouble with you, Mr . Speaker, in the matter of procedure n'v referring to a certain instrument which I am not allowed to mention.",67
298,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is not in order for the honourable member for Batman to discuss the honourable member for Swan either.,67
299,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,".1 accept your ruling, Mr Speaker.' As the hour is late, it is obvious that it would be unbecoming, as well as unsafe, for me to disagree with your ruling.  tention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.]",67
300,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I observe, Mr . Speaker, that certain honourable members are leaving the chamber. Their conduct, I suggest, is not complimentary to the Chair. I presume, however, that you have no control over the manners of honourable members beyond requiring the observance of - the Standing Orders. My contention is that every clause of the bill may be taken as a separate reason why we should reject the motion to resume consideration at a later hour this day, and proceed immediately with the consideration of the measure. Surely it was enough for us to have to suffer the arbitrary limitation of debate without having now to submit to this further humiliation. I remembei only too well urging for the acceptance of the House a view which I held strongly, that this measure is not, in legitimate sense, an immigration Mil at all, but a bill designed for a peculiarly, .punitive and vindictive purpose, and directed against certain individuals. I pointed out that those clauses which deal with the general principle of immigration are so much padding to cover up - the obvious and sinister intention of Government. The honourable member for  cynically grinning at the suggestion that honourable members on this side, realizing .their responsibility to the country and to the people who sent them here, are termined to fight the bill to the last ditch. The bill, we learn from its title, may be cited as the "" Immigration Act 1925.""",67
301,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The bill is not before the House. . Mr BRENNAN - I was under the .impression that your silence a moment or two ago betokened acquiescence in .my argument that every clause of the bill was a legitimate reason why we should deal with it now instead of several hours hence. ""We listened last evening to a speech by the honourable the Attorney General (Sir Littleton Groom), who stated that the Labour party would oppose immigration as long as there was a single unemployed person in this country; and I am expected now to wait until 11 o'clock this morning before I make a rejoinder.",68
302,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member may not now discuss the merits of the bill or the debate that has taken place upon it. The question before the Chair is whether the committee shall have leave to sit again at a certain time.,68
303,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,May I not discuss the bill?,68
304,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,No .,68
305,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,O r the principles of immigration?,68
306,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,No .,68
307,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Then , sir, I was wrong in assuming that by your silence you had accepted my view that I was at libertv to use every clause of the bill as an argument why we should deal with the measure now. Last night, the Prime Minister, with a belated air of conciliation, addressed honourable members in. reany gard to his attitude in this matter. Politeness is an admirable quality. I know of no one who possesses it in greater measure than you, sir. But it may be belated. . It may even appear ironical, and therefore out of place. So, when the Prime' Minister assured us that he would provide the necessary transport for the honourable members, he suggested that we were concerned with such details when in truth and in fact our concern was, and is, with the vital provisions of the bill. We all listened with marked attention to the eloquent and characteristic address de- delivered by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham). I endorse every word uttered by him .concerning the duty of my party towards the subject-matiter of the bill, the details of which I may not discuss. I may, however, make this passing reference: When the people of Australia realise that the measure has been placed upon the statute book by a process, introduced by the Government, which prevented us from discussing it, and if under it British subjects who have made their homes in our midst are arbitrarily thrown out of this country, those who voted for ministerial candidates will ask themselves why they put their trust in such false friends of this country and the Empire.",68
308,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is again discussing the merits of the bill.,68
309,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The merits of the bill, I contend, are the very reasons why we should deal with it in regular form, instead of placing you, at this late hour and after an arduous sitting, in the most invidious position of having to exercise extraordinary vigilance to see that honourable members keep within the narrow limits of the motion. After such a trying experience, we would like to relieve you of that duty.",68
310,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I do not see any signs of that yet. If the honourable member will debate the motion, I shall be obliged.",68
311,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I shall endeavour to do that. ""What,"" says the Attorney General, "" are we doing with this country?"" A very pertinent question. What are we doing with it?",68
312,Mr FOSTBK,Unknown,The honourable member is keeping people out of bed.,68
313,Mr BEENNAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wakefield may, if he wishes, resume his virtuous couch. I have no right to dispossess him. What, indeed, are we doing with this country?",69
314,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! That has nothing to do with the motion.,69
315,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Whateve r the honourable member is doing, he is doing it badly.",69
316,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,So is the honourable member for Bass.,69
317,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"I admit that, but the honourable member for Batman will not.",69
318,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Wit h difficulty I talk badly; the honourable member for Bass does it easily. Up to the present he has contributed nothing to the debate, and I hold him guiltless of having an original idea upon anything. In the limited time at my disposal I shall endeavour to keep within the terms of the motion. Consider for a moment what might have been the position had the destinies of this Government been in more capable hands. Honourable members would have been home in their beds, resting comfortably, 1 hope, and would have been prepared to resume consideration of this bill tomorrow at 11 o'clock. In the ordinary course of debate, the measure would have been passed tomorrow. That, I understand, was what the Prime Minister wanted. Having determined that this House should adjourn for three weeks to enable honourable members to take part in the festivities to welcome the American Fleet, he would have done very well indeed to have forced through this House a bill of such far-reaching importance immediately before the adjournment, but he has decided that it shall be passed by 5.45 p.m. today. Had the Government adopted a reasonable attitude, we should not now be si tting at an early hour of the morning. The Government cannot have it both ways. There is no clause, letter, or line of the bill which I am prepared to accept, whatever the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) may say to the contrary.",69
319,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"On a point of order, I ask whether the remarks of the honourable member for Batman are relevant to the motion before the House.",69
320,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I do not know whether the honourable member for Richmond is aware that I have reproved the honourable member for Batman on ten or twelve occasions, and was just about to again do so. He seems to have taken every liberty that my relaxing vigilance permits. I remind the honourable member for Batman that the strict order of debate must obtain, and that the motion before the House is clear.",69
321,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The honourable member for Richmond absents himself from the chamber.,69
322,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for Richmond is not within the terms of the motion.,69
323,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Whil e I haye been endeavouring to do my duty in this chamber, the honourable member for Richmond, owing to his absence, has not heard a single word of what you, sir, have said. We do not know where he has been, and would not care to inquire.",69
324,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to confine himself to the motion before the Chair.,69
325,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The Government has limited the time for the discussion upon this bill, because the arguments of the Labour party are being published in every Australian newspaper. The force and cogency of our contention is being felt.",69
326,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,The honourable member flatters himself.,69
327,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Yes . We flatter ourselves. Were I permitted to speak on the bill, every word of mine would be a nail in the political coffin of honourable gentlemen opposite.",69
328,Mr GARDNER,Unknown,The honourable member's speech is very tedious.,69
329,Mr BEENNAN,Unknown,It is very tedious and perhaps very painful to those who are unaccustomed to appreciating and assessing the value of truth.,69
330,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must speak to the motion. r,69
331,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,I regret very much I should be drawn aside by the disorderly interjections of those who wish to defeat the object of the Labour party respecting this bill. The Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) stated last evening thai the Imperial Government had passed an Empire Settlement Act which dealt with immigration.,69
332,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. I understand that the motion before the Chair is that progress be reported.,69
333,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,No such motion has ever been received in the House. The motion before the House is that the committee of the whole House have leave to sit again on the next day of sitting.,70
334,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"As the which is now taking place Mr MCGRATH , - I rise to a point of order.",70
335,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Richmond is now speaking. I shall hear any other points of order in .their proper sequence. M!r. R. .GREEN - Can the whole purpose and scope of the bill be discussed on the motion before the House ?,70

337,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I hope that the honourable member for Richmond is satisfied. Mr R GREEN , - I am not satisfied with the honourable member.",70
338,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Richmond has made use of an offensive remark, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",70
339,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I did not hear any word that could be regarded as unparliamentary. Of what remark does the honourable member complain t,70
340,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The honourable member for Richmond said that he was not satisfied with me.,70
341,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Quite a number of people are not satisfied with me, but I do not regard that as offensive.",70
342,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"When I was interrupted by the"" honourable member for Richmond, I was pointing out that the Attorney-General last evening said that there was on the statute-book of Great B r i tain a measure known as the Empire Settlement Act. I suggest that the honourable gentleman's imperial outlook, as distinct from his Australian outlook, is responsible for the deplorable laxity of the provisions of this measure, which are fraught with such drastic consequences lo this country.",70
343,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member knows that neither a British act of Parliament nor the attitude of the Government has anything to do with the matter before the Chair. I ask him to recollect that the motion concerns the leave of the committee to sit again.,70

347,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,If the honourable member objects to being called a flounder I will withdraw it .,70
348,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,I think that it The should be withdrawn without qualification.  speech which the honourable member for Batman is making deserves at least a quorum to hear it .,70
349,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Hume is entitled to call for a quorum, but not to make a speech in doing so. [Quorum formed.]",70
350,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,The few words uttered by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) in discussing this motion impressed me deeply. The honourable member has now retired from the chamber. Mr SPEAKER. The honourable member must confine his remarks to the motion.,70
351,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I was about to observe, sir, that in dealing with the motion the honourable member for Indi remarked, "" Yes, sit again any old day, so long as we pass the bill and get these nuisances out of the country,"" or some such words. That is a very graceful attitude. The Government desires that this bill shall be passed before we have to meet our American cousins, and enter upon the festivities which the Government has arranged, for then it can be deporting people while they are enjoying themselves. If we could continue the discussion of the bill now instead of at 11 o'clock a.m., every honourable member on this side of the chamber-and I refer to them particularly, for it seems that they only are alive to their duties-woul d have an opportunity to address himself to it .",70

361,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I rise to order. The interjection of the honourable member for Forrest reminds me of the strain that this debate imposes on the officers of the House, including yourself, Mr Speaker. In the past when the Government found it necessary to continue the sittings of the House after midnight for the dispatch of public business, it was considered right and humane to allow honourable ' members an opportunity to obtain refreshments.",72
362,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That surely is not a point of order.,72
363,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I raise the point as one of order, but if the matter is not' within your jurisdiction, Mr Speaker, I shall not press it.",72
364,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The question raised by the honourable member is strictly not one of order, but I have a great deal of sympathy with his suggestion. Several.of us will have to consider whether we can bear much longer the strain of this sitting.  dently the Prime Minister has had his supper, and is not concerned about others. If instead of meeting at 11 o'clock we were to resume the proceedings in committee at 3 a.m., we should have an opportunity to give to important legislative proposals 'the careful consideration that they require. It is desirable that these proposals should be disposed of before the arrival of our American visitors. It is remarkable that earlier in the session ministerial members should have taken us to task for not talking when there was nothing to talk about, whilst to-night, when we have before us one of the most far-reaching proposals ever submitted to this Parliament, our right of speech is curtailed (and we are hampered in every way. We should have had plenty of time for the' consideration of the Government's proposals if the Treasurer had used his influence to convene Parliament earlier instead of travelling round the world. Originally we were told that the trip was for the good of his health, but later the honourable gentleman .was said to be inquiring into, the dried fruits industry. Presumably the country paid the expenses of his trip.",72
365,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member must keep to the motion before the Chair.  understand that the curtailment of the opportunity of doing public business on account of the actions of a member of the Ministry is not relevant to the motion before the Chair ? I am showing that the time-wasting tactics of Ministers were responsible for the curtailment of our opportunities to consider the Government's legislative proposals. Mr ' SPEAKER - That argument has been tediously repeated during this discussion.  not advanced it before. If the House has not time to discuss the measures before it the faul t lies with the Government, and, therefore, our opportunities should not be further curtailed as the motion proposes. The hour I have suggested would be far more suitable to honourable members than that which the Prime Minister has proposed. last trains and trams have departed we are denied the opportunity of going to our homes.",73
366,Mr BHUCE,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that that is not so. I told the Leader of the Opposition at midnight that conveyances would be provided for honourable members.  the right honourable gentleman's statement that he gave that assurance. But if the discussion of the bill in committee were resumed at 3 o'clock even those honourable members who are now asleep would have an opportunity to put themselves right with their constituents, and there would be less curtailment of our privileges than if we met at 11 o'clock, and, following upon to-night's excitement and late hours, endeavoured to dispose of the measure in a very limited time. Why not finish the job now? I cannot understand why the Prime Minister should, endeavour to curtail debate on most contentious measures of far-reaching importance.",73

375,Mr LACEY,Unknown,"Grey) [3.10 a.m.]-The portion of. the bill dealing with immigration is really sham legislation designed to hide the' real purpose of the provisions relating to deportation; During the last recess, numerous deputations, representing responsible bodies in Australia, waited on the 'Federal1 Ministry and complained of the influx .of - aliens into Australia - The South Australian Government asked the - Commonwealth''''Government 'to curtail - alien immi'gra'tionj' and - received a reply from the Minister 'for' Home and Territories to the effect that the Ministry was full y seized of the seriousness of the position, and was taking steps to curtail the number of aliens arriving in Australia. Although the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) has stated that the bill dismakes provision for a further curtailment of alien immigration, yet honourable members supporting the Government have said that they favour the introduction of southern Europeans into Ausknow tralia. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) said that they were suitable citizens for this country, ancl to support his remarks he quoted a recent statement of Mr Theodore, the ex-Premier of Queensland. I have had Howconsiderable experience of southern Europeans, because many aliens of various nationalities have settled in my There is a considerable difference between the people from the north of Italy and those from other parts of southern Europe. The northern Italians are cultured to some extent and could readily be assimilated in Australia, but such immigrants as the Greeks will never make good Australian citizens. The standard of living in this country would be seriously lowered by a large influx of people of the Greek type. Generally speaking, they must remain unskilled labourers, for they are not suitable to put on the land, and certainly will never be of any service in developing our outback areas. In determining the real opinions of honourable members who support the Government, one has to have regard to the views generally expressed by the members of their parties. Sir Henry Barwell, the'conservative ex-Premier of South Australia, on one occasion shortly after the war told the workers in Adelaide that the ""trouble with Australian workers was that their standard of living was too good, and their wages too high. He said that they ought to accept a reduction of wages, and if they did not voluntarily agree to do so he would do his best to compel them. In my opinion, honourable members opposite who belong to the same party as Sir Henry Barwell believe what he was bold enough to say. If these people are allowed to come here in large numbers, the various trade, unions will lose control of the men engaged in industry, and a reduction ol wagesw ill . undoubtedly follow. The greatest - possible restriction should be imposed upon their entry to Australia, and 1 this Parliament will be acting in the best interests of the c o u n try if it makes definite provisio n for r e s t r i c t in g it greatly to be regretted that southern European m i g r a n t s are able to come to Australia with o u t s u b m it t in g themselves to proper medical examination. On that p o in t I quote the following Melbourn e telegram, w h i c h was published in the Adelaide press on 23rd J a n u a r y : ALIEN IMMIGRANTS . NA - Immigrants .from Southern Europe reeeive preferential treatment because they are not examined medically on embarkation for Australia. This fact was deduced from evidence by the Director-General of Health (Dr Cumpston) before the Federal Royal Commission on Health. He said intending immigrants in England were examined by the High Commissioner's Department. The High Commissioner was not a medical man, and did not supply the Health Department with the knowledge required. A senior intelligence officer of the Health Department should be stationed in London. Dr Cumpston told the Commission that a trip round the Pacifio showed that the islands were peopled now greatly with Asiatics. Apart from the political significance, this wa3 a serious health matter. Australia was liable to have introduced infections diseases common to Asia. In some of the island groups of the Pacific there was no attempt at public health. It is only fair to our own people that we should at least make certain that i m m i g r a n t s w h o come here are h e a l t h y . There should also be a language test. The conditions under w h i c h some of them are l i v ing in various Australian towns are deplorable, and in m a n y cases the i r d if f i culties have been accentuated because of the i r ignorance of our language. It is also u n fair to these people themselves that the y should be encouraged, as at present there is dire distress existing amongst the m in m a n y parts of Australia . The following is a B r o k e n Hill telegram, w h i c h was published in the Adelaide A d v e r t is e r on the 2 7 t h A u g u s t l as t : GREEKS ON THE BARRIER. INAPITIFULPLIGH T. Twenty-five Greeks asked the local police today to aid them in finding employment. They stated that they came to Australia from Greece expecting to find employment easily, but had failed in their quest. Some of the men came from America. They are living here under hard conditions, paying. 2s. for a room. They are without bedding, and owing to the cold are unable to sleep. Most of the men are married, witli wives in Greece. They came to the Outer Harbour andthen straight to Broken Hill . They were not subjected to any language test before - It is entering the Commonwealth. At Broken Hill their inability to speak English is a bar to their employment. The local police are communicating witli Sydney in connection with the plight of the foreigners. It is most u n fair that these m i g r a n t s should be placed in ' t h is u n for t u n at e position. The following press report , p u b lished on the 2 8 th J a n u a r y of t h is year, CONDEMNEU. speaks for itself : Melbourne, January 22. GREEK IMMIGRANTS. ON THE VEBGE OF STARVATION. A. sorry story is told of the plight of Greek Immigrants in Victoria, 200 if whom are said to be out of work and almosx starving. They cannot speak English. Melbourne, 27th January. Two hundred Greek immigrants who landed in Melbourne a few weeks ago with scanty capital, are now practically on the verge of starvation, and are unable to obtain employment. This, morning a letter was sent by the honorary Greek Consul (Mr A. V. Maniachi) to the Lord Mayor (Mr Brunton), directing attention to the plight of these men, and asking for assistance. In the letter it was stated the men had paid tlieir own fare to Melbourne, and unless something was done they would be absolutely penniless. They were, it was explained to the Lord Mayor, mostly of the peasant class, and did not look for charity. "" I ask that you use your influence to get these men on the land, or to assist in repatriating them,"" the letter concludes. Mr Maniachi stated today that in the last few days he had signed passports for 50 or 60 disappointed Greeks and Jugo-Slavs to return to tlieir country. The others could not go because they had no money. The plight of these men was desperate. The Greeks are living a sort of community life in Greek restaurants in Melbourne, and m-ny are receiving charity from their friends. Mr Maniachi explained that, unlike Italians, who were supported by rich Governments, GreeK immigrants here were not being assisted i u their blind search for employment by any paid Greek labour organizer who knew the country. "" Many of these men' have come to Australia because of encouraging letters received from friends here, and others have been deceived by agents in Italy , who have made money out of them,"" he added. ""Tliese agents advance them their fares, which are to be paid when they obBroken Hill , 26th August. tain work. If the fares are not repaid money is extracted from their relatives in Greece by something tantamount to terrorism. Then the men, who were mostly farmers in Greece, have been told that they can earn £ 3 or £4 a week here. They have been fighting for seven or eight years in the war, and are handicapped by not being able to speak English. One could quote newspaper reports of the deplorable p l i g h t of these people in all the c a p it a l cities of Australia . Their poverty, in some cases, is pitiable. last time. I was at my home in' Port Pirie, South Australia, I was informed that many southern European were in a most abject condition, and were being supported by other people. of their own countrymen, financially able to do so, were bearing the largest share of the burden. deniable that the private life ' of these southern Europeans is far below the standard of the private life of our people, and it is unfair that they should be permitted to come here to reduce our standard of living. Honourable members have frequently"" said that the Labour party is opposed to immigration. not correct. We are opposed to the introduction of large numbers of foreigners into Australia unless proper provision is made to employ them on their Migrants should not be brought here until the country can absorb them. believe that land should be made available first for landless Australians, afterwards for suitable It is hypocritical for the Government to express a desire for such a large number of immigrants while it adds to the unemployment in Australia by sending so much work abroad. If it were desirous of providing for immigrants, it would have as much work as possible clone here. action in sending orders for abroad is not consistent with its desire for immigrants. There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of people in my electorate who are trying to get land, but cannot obtain it. The Prime Minister has not honoured the promise he made to this House last year, when the member for Angas (Mr Gabb) and I advocated the removal of the embargo upon the entry of Germans. said that he would bring down proposals for amending the part of the act that deals with that matter. In his second reading speech on this bill the honourable member for Angas again dealt with that subject. I have a large number of - Germans in my electorate, and am in close touch with them, and recognize they are very desirable We have signed a peace with Germany, but the stigma we placed upon Germans still The German people in Australia this concession more than anything for they wish some, of their friends Mr Laeey. The Germany to j o in them. The right honourable the Prime Minister said that the embargo would be interpreted leniently, immigrants ancl that many Germans would still be allowed to come to this country. During Some the past year I bave referred to the who were Minister several requests connected with this matter, and I have discovered that It is un- the act is not being interpreted' leniently. I have received the following letter bearing on the point from one of my constituents:Dear Sir, opposite I am i u receipt of yours of 4th instant and note contents, for which I thank you. Herewith please find particulars of my That is brother as requested by you. My brother wishes to come out to Australia to settle on the land. He is willing to pay his ful l passage money, and does not desire to be assisted financially. I will undertake to see arrival. that lie has sufficient money until he is able to establish himself, and that he will not have to We rely on the Government in any way. He is willing to become naturalized as a British subject as soon after his arrival in the Comand monwealth as the law of the land will allow. immigrants. His occupation is a farm labourer. Age 31 on the 6th of October; 1924. His present address Danzig, Germany. l i e has been married since 1921, and has one child. He enjoys excellent health, and is prepared, if necessary, to procure a medical certificate. He is also willing to obtain credentials from the police and other sources as to his character. Its He was a fireman on a British ship oh the cruisers Outbreak of war, and was interned in England for the duration of the war on the arrival of his vessel in England. He has never had any military training owing to his eyesight. He has never fought against the British Sovereign or Empire.

If you desire to see the original I will He then forward it to you for your perusal and return to me. That is only one of many letters I have received. The man referred to should have been allowed to come to this country, in which event he would by now be a farmer in the Cleve district. We are every year receiving a larger quantity of that imports from Germany. The war has settlers. been over for seven years, and the embargo treaty should certainly be lift e d in accordance that with the Prime Minister's promise last remains. year. I mentioned last year that desire some of the best pioneers in my else, district were Germans; they are expert in farmers, and excellent settlers, and are equal in every way to Australian settlers. They are racially the nearest race to the British, and are entitled to some consideration. I do not wish it to be assumed that if this embargo is lifted there w a great influx of Germans. A.number of them, similar to the one I have mentioned, would come. The Germans who have made good on the land in Australia wish their friends to be with them. The man who wrote me that letter told me in another letter that his brother, believing the embargo would be lifted this year, had sold his home and prepared to come to Australia. I placed the letter before the department, but the man was prevented from coming to Australia. Where could we find a more desirable settler than that man ? If there is one class of labourer that we can absorb, it is the far m labourer. That man is already a far m labourer in Germany, and if he came to Australia he would take up farming with his brother, who has promised to assist him. I have made inquiries as to when a bill to amend this provision of the act will be brought down, but I have received no satisfaction.",74
376,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, The honourable member's time has expired.,77
377,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"Riverina) [3.40 a.m.]. - The attitude of members of the Opposition towards immigration is difficult to understand. They profess to be very fearfu l that the coming of a large number of migrants-to this country would interfere with Australian workers, but they do not seem to realise that the purpose of this clause is to prevent that from happening. The clause makes it very clear that migrants will not be allowed to interfere with Australian workers. If the economic conditions in Australia were such that immigrants were not required the clause would enable the Government to prevent ,them from coming here. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite oppose it . they should be satisfied with the safeguards it provides. They appear to speak with two voices. When I spoke on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply in the first session of this Parliament, I twitted them with being opposed to immigration, and there was a chorus, of dissent from them. They alleged that I had libelled them. I noticed during the debate on this bill that some of them said that they were opposed to immigration. Qthers have said they, were in favour of migrants being allowed to come here on certain condii l l be tions; but what were the conditions? The condition mentioned by most of thera was that there should beno immigration while unemployment existed in Australia. But there will always be some unemployment in this country. There is a large number of unemployables who will always be unemployed. To show the class of man who is unemployable I shall relate a true story. A lady who was honorary treasurer of a benevolent society used to give money to .needy people in the city. They came regularly to her, and among them was a large, strong young man, who had a wife and one or two children. The lady said to him, "" Why , do you need to come to me for money; why don't you get work ?"" He replied, "" I cannot get work, because there is none."" She said, "" I know there is work in the country; why not go there?"" He answered, "" I am a town man; you cannot expect me to go to the country."" That illustrates the attitude of a large number of men; work is obtainable in the country, but they refuse to leave the populous centres. It is futil e for honourable members opposite to say that they will support immigration when there are no unemployed in the Commonwealth. There will always be men who are unemployable, because they will not leave the cities to get work. Honourable members have said, that there is a conspiracy on the part of employers to introduce aliens in order to bring about a reduction of wages. There is no justification for that statement. I do not know of any instance in which aliens are paid less than the standard rate of wage, and I am not aware of any employer who desires to introduce cheap labour from other parts of the world. ' That ground of objection is purely imaginary. We are all Surely agreed that the Government should ensure that all immigrants are of the right class. We cannot hold Australia unless its population is considerably augmented. Provided that immigration is. not overdone, and the labour market is not flooded, the more people who come to our country and engage in production, the more employment there will be for our people. That has been the experience of other countries, notably the United States of America and Canada. Therefore, honourable members opposite, instead of opposing the bill, should welcome it .",77
378,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [3.50 a.m. | - The Government handled this bill in a business like way. The quota system should have been adopted, as it has been in America with very satisfactory results. H a d quotas been specified in the measure honourable members on this side would have been satisfied that the Government was earnestly desirous of prohibiting undesirable immigrants. The honourable member for Riverina stated that some members of the Labour party are opposed to all immigration. I have not heard any honourable member on this side make that statement. The attitude of the Labour party is that if large numbers of people already in Australia are unemployed because of a dearth of work, it is folly to permit people to come here from other countries to look for work. That attitude is not selfish or unfair. His labour is the worker's only capital, and in self-protection he must see that his daily job is assured. The man of means, who is not dependent on a master for a job, is not personally concerned when large numbers of people are unemployed, whilst a surplus of labour may be to the advantage of the employers. Immigrants from southern Europe, because they are more pliant, may be more acceptable to the capitalist, but the trade unionist regards them as persons who are likely to lower his standard of living. Such being his fear, he is justified in protecting his own livelihood, his home, and his family. Every man recognizes that Australia with 6,000,000 people is not sufficiently populated, and that if it is to become great it cannot depend upon the natural - increase of the present population.",78
379,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"Then why oppose gration ? Mr A . GREEN - I am not opposed to general immigration, but the powers that this southern clause seeks to give are too indefinite. bill provides for quotas to be fixed by proall clamation. I desire them to be specified i the bill. They need not necessarily based upon the American system. For i stance, I consider that the Dalmatian Slavs earlier are desirable immigrants, and the quota i respect of them should not be based upon the number of their countrymen already immigrants. resident in the Commonwealth. The quotas for all nationalities should be fixed in accordance with recommendations from the heads of the Immigration Department from time to time, but they should has not appear in black and white, and not be variable according to the passing whims or fancies of governments.",78
380,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"The honourable member's speech is sufficiently important to warrant a call for a quorum. [Quorum formed.'] - Mr A . GREEN - Our objections to immigration are purely economic. We desire to preserve employment for the workers already in Australia; and if the Government's proposals were more definite we should readily have accepted them, because we should have known that the restrictive machinery being created by the bill would actually operate. The Prime Minister stated that the United States of America introduced the quota system in order to ensure that the i m m igrants arriving there should be sueh as the country could assimilate, but the main objection in America to unrestricted immigration is based upon economic grounds, rather than upon the community's inability to assimilate some' races. Let me give a few quotations'from a work entitled Immigration and Labour, by Isaac Hourwich, a doctor of philosophy. He saysIt is recognized on all sides that the present movement for restriction of immigration has a purely economic object: the restriction of competition in the labour market. Organized labour demands the extension of the protectionist policy to the home market in which "" hands ""-the labourers' only commodity-ar e offered for sale. The advocates of restriction believe that every immigrant admitted to this country takes the place of some American working man. At the inception of the restrietionist movement in the 80's and the early 90's, they were avowedly opposed to immigration in general. The subsequent decline of immigration from the British Isles, Germany, immiand Scandinavia, and the increase of immigration from southern and eastern Europe have diverted the attack from immigration into ""' the new immigration"" from and eastern Europe, and the Asiatic The provinces of Turkey. Yet while the root of evil is now sought in the racial make-up of the new immigration, as contrasted with the n old, every objection to the immigrants from 1 be southern and eastern Europe is but an eelio n - of tMo complaints which were mado at an day against the then new immigration from Ireland, Germany, and even from Engn land. Three-quarters of a century ago, as today, the only good immigrants were the dead Eonorable members will see that the workers of the United States of America set their faces not merely against new immigrants from southern' - Europe, but also against the immigration of Germans, Irish, English, Scotch, and people from the northern parts of Europe.",78
381,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"To what time is the honourable member referring 1 Mr A . GREEN - The work from which I quote is a general survey of the immigration to the United States of America. The author explains that the objection in the old days was to immigration of people from the northern parts of Europe, and was just as strong as the objection which is urged today in the United States of America against immigration from southern Europe. today it is urged that the objection to the new' immigration from southern Europe is taken because the people from those countries cannot be assimilated by the existing population of the United States of America. W it h regard to this objection that these people cannot be readily assimilated, I may say that I have been in touch with numbers of Dalmatians on the gold-fields of Western Australia. Theywere employed in certain classes of work such as wood-cutting and what is called "" bogging out."" That is about the hardest work to be done in connection with mining, and those engaged in it receive the lowest pay. But for the people to whom I refer we might have been at a loss at times to find labour to carry out that class of work. It will be agreed that work in mines is very arduous, and is more destructive of health than perhaps any other occupation in which men can engage. I found the Dalmatians fine men physically and morally. They rarely got into a brawl, and were never a menace to what our friends opposite call "" good government."" I maintain that our experience of such people in Australia will be similar to the experience of the United States of America, and they would ultimately become assimilated. America up to the time of the introduction of the quota system there was unre, stricted immigration, and about 1,000,000 immigrants were admitted each year. Of late years the immigration was almost entirely from countries of southern Europe.. On the subject of the assimilation of migrants the author of Immigration and Labour states that Benjamin Franklin, as far back as 1753, wrote of the Germans of Pennsylvania, who are known in the United States of America as the Pennsylvania Dutch, in the following terms: Those who come hither are generally the most stupid of their own nation, and as ignorance is often attended with great credulity, when knavery would mislead it . . . it is almost impossible to remove any prejudice they may entertain. . . . Not being used to liberty they know not how to make modest use of it. . . . I remember when they modestly declined intermeddling with our elections, but now they come in droves, and carry all before them except in one or two counties. Honourable members are aware that a descendant of these people became President of the United States of America. I refer to President Theodore Roosevelt, Only who was one of the greatest driving forces in America. To continue my quotation: Benjamin Franklin further wrote- r Few of their children know English. They import only books from Germany; and of the six printing houses in the province, two are entirely German, two half German, half English, and but two are. entirely English. They have one German newspaper and one half German. Advertisements intended to be general are now printed in Dutch and English. The signs in our streets (Philadelphia) have inscriptions in .both languages, and in some places only in German. I quote that passage to show that at one period of its history the people of the United States of America, regarded Germans as a race that could not be assimilated. We know now that they have been assimilated, and that their descendants are amongst those who can be said to be the backbone of civilization in America. The author of Immigration and Labour says in another placeIt took three generations to raise "" the Celts and the Teutons "" to a place among "" the more desirable immigrants from northern and western Europe."" I make only these quotations because my time is limited. My one objection to the immigration of Slavs and southern Italians is that experience has shown In that here, as in America, men from those countries do not bring a large number of their womenkind with them. If the Government provided that for every male immigrant from the southern part of Europe there should be a female immigrant from the same part of Europe, I have no doubt that our experience would be similar to that of the United States of .America. We should not then have 50 per cent, of such immigrants, after making a certain amount of money, returning to their home land. That is one of the greatest problems we have to face in connection with southern European immigration. If immigrants, after accumulating wealth in Australia, leave this country and invest their wealth in the land from which they came, they cannot be regarded as assets to Australia, and this country will lose money by their return to. their homeland. If such people brought their women folk here, they would settle permanently in Australia, and, judging by the experience of America, their intermarriage with people of the Anglo-Saxon stock would give us Australians of, perhaps, a finer type than people of the one stock. It is generally agreed that a race in which for some time there has been inbreeding becomes, to a certain extent, effete, and I believe that the energy which we see manifested in the American people is due to the mixture of races of northern Europe with the Anglo-Saxon stock. I know that nothing is so easy to ivrouse as race prejudice, but, while I do not speak for the Labour party, I am personally of opinion, that, in Australia, a mixture of southern Europeans and northern Italians with people of the Anglo-Saxon stock would produce a finer type than people of entirely Anglo-Saxon parentage. One thing that it would do would be to put an end to the undesirable jingoism that looks always to Great Bri tain for a precedent for' what we should do next. The restriction of immigration by America has diverted the tide of emigration, not only to Australia, but to the Argentine Republic. Migrants Europe are welcomed in the Argentine. When a ship arrives with migrants at Buenos Ayres the Argentine newspapers contain paragraphs with great headlines referring to the arrival of the immigrants as adding wealth to the Argentine. is of no use to bring immigrants to this country unless we have a proper land policy, and, notwithstanding what has been said of the arrangement made with Great Britain, we have no proper land policy for the settlement of immigrants. I came from Western Australia to Adelaide some time ago on the Esperance Bay, and there were 800 immigrants of British stock on board that vessel. Some years ago, when I came across on the Medic with a number of immigrants Afr. A. Green. of British stock, there were many complaints of theft, indicating that, generally speaking, the immigrants were of an inferior type. Those on the Esperance Bay were totally different. I mixed with them freely, and had some of them as cabin mates. On one occasion I addressed 400 of them, and gave them a good deal of information concerning Australia. I am satisfied that, as the result of economic conditions in the Mother Country, we are getting the very bone and sinew of Britain. I believe that ultimately they will become fine Australian citizens.",79
382,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,Is that not a good thing for Australia ?,80
383,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Of course it is. Our objection to the bill is that a definite quota is not fixed for the introduction of immigrants from southern Europe. We do not believe in unrestricted immigration from those countries. Unemployment and its relation to immigration has been mentioned in the debate. I r-gret this, because in every country there is a certain amount, of unemployment, due, in many cases, topeople having become slaves to drink, and consequently being of little value as economic units in the community. I quite understand, too, the position of some operatives, to whom even only part-time employment in a factory is a better proposition than work on the land. The crux of the whole question is the absence of a land policy. Along our railway lines, in practically all parts of Australia, there are immense areas admirably suited for closer settlement. That land should be made available. Outside of. Western Australia and Queensland there is practicallv no opportunity for immigrants to from go on the land. The English scheme contemplates the settlement of one immigrant on the land for every £1.000 expended, but in New South Wales it costs £2,000 to settle a man on the land, the State Government being called upon It to spend another £1,000. In fairness to our own people we should provide them with land.",80
384,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,I presume the honourable member realizes that that is a matter for the State Parliaments?,80
385,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"The object can be achieved by taxation. We can sre any number of immigrants, employed as porters, clipping tickets at railwav gates, and working on our tramway systems. Over 75 per cent, of the employees in the new locomotive - sheds at Spencerstreet are immigrants.

With other honourable members, protest against the indiscriminate manner in which the Immigration Act has been administered in recent years, If , as was indicated by the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen), the purpose of the bill is to tighten up certain provisions of the act, why did the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) without reference to Parliament, make an agreement with certain countries concerning the introduction of their nationals to Australia? Other honourable members who have taken part in this debate, have retailed the undesirable conditions under which immigrants from southern Europe are living. The honourable member for Grey (Mr Lacey) shows clearly that their standard of living is immeasurably below that which we. demand for our own citizens. In many cases, these foreigners are unable to speak the English, language, and when employed in certain avocations, such as mining at Broken - Hill and elsewhere, or in quarrying, they are a grave menace to Australian fellow-workers. Our experience in South Australia has been rather unfortunate. The introduction of these undesirable migrants has resulted in a marked increase in the crime wave In a country town of South Australia, a few months ago, a brawl occurred between several Greeks. One of them was murdered, and the circumstance of his death was so ghastly and revolting as to shock the whole community. The foreign element in Adelaide was - also responsible for a serious riot which occurred in Hindley-street. threatened to disturb the peace and good order of the city, and special police were detailed to maintain order. The influx of southern Europeans into Australia seriously affects our economic conditions, and accentuates the unemployment problem. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr K ill e n ) stated that the introduction of these people would add to the welfare and progress of this - country. The influx of aliens, on the contrary, has the effect not only of lowering the standard of living, and reducing the wages of our workmen, but also, of striking a blow at the security of Australia as a nation. In many cases aliens who' have recently arrived obtain first preference for responsible positions which should be given to Australians of long service, good conduct, and splendid ability. I bear I no ill will towards those of our own k it h and k in who come here. They are far too often misinformed about Australian conditions, both in industry ancl in land settlement. We have not yet been able to settle our returned soldiers satisfactorily on the land, and many of them still require holdings, and cannot obtain them - The great land-owners of this country refuse to open up their lands for closer . settlement, and the State Nationalist Governments of the past have not been prepared to insist or> the subdivision of large estates. If wo cannot give to our returned soldiers an adequate livelihood, how can we expect to absorb migrants who wish to take up land ? No effort, is being made to absorb our unemployed in useful occupations, and u n t i l such time as we have a well ordered and regulated system of employment in operation, it is no use bringing people from overseas to take up any for m of occupation in Australia. Many migrants come here ignorant of Australian conditions. They imagine this land to be a paradise. They believe the exaggerated statements of agents abroad, and come here to find that they have to accept a standard of livelihood far below their anticipations. Most of them expect to be placed on the land immediately, there to lead a l if o of Arcadian delight, with the fostering and guiding hand of governmental providence ever at their service. Before we ask migrants to come here to share in Australia's prosperity, we should make It the home l if e of our country people more congenial and attractive by providing them with more ready communication and opportunities for recreation. We should place our house in order, and establish in Australia a well-contented community by providing employment for those already here. Under present conditions we should cease inviting these southern Europeans to come here. A continuation of the present unsound and harmful policy of the Government can only result in the impoverishment of our people. It is our duty to deal with unemployment in a scientific manner. The tens of thousands of men who are out of work in Australia could be employed on reproductive public work. It is really paradoxical to have unemployment in a country like Australia, but it seems that we shall have to elect a new Commonwealth Government before we shall be able to overcome it is essential, however, that we shall cope with it, for its solution is fundamental to progress in modern economic society. Although the evil has long been felt, even if not quite so acutely as atpresent, I feel sure that with a wise, prudent, statesmanlike, and sympathetic Government in power it can be banished. We should use all the labour available here to advance Australia, and develop it in every way. We are not claiming the impossible for our people, but we do urge that the unfortunate victims of many of the corrupt and sordid conditions associated with modern community life shall be relieved and. placed in circumstances in which virtue and honour will be rewarded. Mr A. GHEEN - I direct attention to the state of the committee. [Quorum formed.]",81
389,Mr COOK,Unknown,"Indi ) [4.52 a.m.] - Every right-thinking man must agree that it is necessary to limit the influx into Australia of such people as the Jugo Slavs, southern Italians, and Greeks. But it must also be admitted that if we are to retain Australia for the Empire we must increase our population. We have only 6,000,000 people occupying a territory as large as that which 115,000,000 occupy in America. It is inconceivable that that will be tolerated for any length of time by those nations of the world which need an outlet for their surplus population. It would be infinitely better to spend tens of thousands of pounds in opening up this country, building roads and railways, constructing division fence's, cutting up land, and doing other necessary work than to spend it on war, which may become necessary if we fail to populate the empty spaces of our great Commonwealth. The best means of defence' that we can have is millions of pairs of white arms. It is most unsatisfactory that more than half of our population resides in the various capital cities. Living con^ ditions are much better in the cities than in the country. Men receive higher pay, work shorter hours, and enjoy much better recreation facilities in the metropolitan areas than in the rural districts. I was taken to task some time ago by honourable members opposite for stating that certain shires that I am associated with could employ 500 men immediately on necessary public work if the men were available. Since making that speech I . It have had the opportunity to go through these districts, and I find that I understated the position. Considerably more than 500 men could be absorbed. Many shires have been unable to expend the money granted to them on the £ 1 for £ 1 basis by the Commonwealth Government. They have invited tenders for numerous works, and frequently not a single one has been received. An experience I had recently in respect to a property that I acquired in New South Wales revealed to me that it was almost impossible to get men to undertake tank-sinking. Ta.nksinkers are wanted in many parts of that state. A pound spent on public works in these days does not yield the return that an expenditure of 10s. gave about fifteen years ago, and the 2s. municipal rate of today is of less real value than the Is. rate of twenty years ago. The excessive cost of public work, as well as the difficulty in obtaining' men, has been a tremendous problem to various local governing bodies. The day-labour system has been responsible for a definite slowing down in output. I have had a lifetime of experience in farming, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that no farmer could adopt the day-labour system and work at a profit under award rates and prices received for most of his products. I have worked hard all my life, and in my younger days received only 10s. per week. I know pretty well all there is to know about roughing it . I have also had a good deal of experience while travelling through Australia as a member of the Public Works Committee. It is beyond question that one of the main hindrances to industrial and commercial progress today is that results are not obtained commensurate with the wages paid; but the same is unfortunately true of our great rural industries. Dairying is one of the most sweated industries' in Australia. Butter is sold today for considerably under half the cost of production, and our dairy farmers in many districts, notwithstanding that many live a life of absolute drudgery and work from daylight to dark, are unable to make a decent living. The unsatisfactory state of affairs in our country districts is causing many pf our best settlers to remove to the city. In view of the high cost of living and the artificial conditions prevailing in the towns, the wages paid to artisans are not more than sufficient to provide them with the necessaries of life. They could not reasonably be expected to live on less. It would be impossible to employ a considerable number of immigrants at Australian rates of wages in the cities, but in the country, under the conditions to which I , my family, and other settlers are subject, there is room for hundreds of thousands of them. I do not believe in preaching war-God forbid that we should have another-bu t I ask honourable members to consider the value of this great Australia of ours, its possibilities, its climate, its healthiness, and, above all, its dangerous emptiness. Would it not be wise for honourable members to sink party differences, to tackle this great problem in a comprehensive way, and to spend millions of pounds on profitable developmental enterprises? It would be better to spend money in that way than on arms and ammunition. The cost of - a war lasting a very short time would be more than would provide for the development of this country over a long period. We require roads and railways and other developmental works. I was pleased to hear the speech of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green), who struck a different note from that struck by many members of the Opposition. I agree with him, and the Premier of Western Australia, who has been to Europe, and knows what it is to be' Premier 'of a large, empty state, also agrees with him . Western Australia is second to no state in Australia, except - perhaps Queensland, and for the growing bf wheat and the production of sheep it will beat even Queensland. Premier knows of its great undeveloped resources; and that is why he says that a. well-directed scheme of m igration will do no . harm to this country, and that to increase our population will not necessarily increase unemployment. I agree with him. The more we develop the country the more the towns will prosper. The sum of £35,000,000 to be provided by Great Britain , is only an instalment. In view of possibilities in the future Great B r it a in is desirous of populating her dominions so that they may be able to face any situation that may arise. When that money has been spent judiciously, and settlement has been extended in accordance with the agreement, it will be a simple matter to approach the Mother Country with a view to a further loan of a similar amount. I am sick of hearing the cry of unemployment, which members of the Opposition continually raise. ' One would think that there was nothing left for these people but to lie down and die. What did the old pioneers do, and what are the people in the country doing now? A great deal has been said about the invasion of Nort h Queensland by Italians. One honourable member in this House champions the German migrant, but I back the Italian against any German I have ever seen. I have worked with the northern Italians. The Chiltern and Rutherglen mines employed many of them, and they developed into splendid, honourable citizens. They married, reared respectable families, and a number of them now possess substantial banking accounts. Such men are a credit to our country. The Italians on the sugar-fields have been largely responsible for the soundness of the sugar industry today. I give the governments of Australia credit for the assistance given to the industry in its early stages, but when we consider that there is a surplus of 200,000 tons of sugar to export, it is 'obvious that the industry is now being conducted on a big scale. Italians who have not been there very long have, to my knowledge, paid £10,000 cash on a £20,000 purchase of land mostly under cane. I have spoken to Britishers and Italians, and have conversed with policemen, storekeepers, and auctioneers in an endeavour to obtain all the information available about the in Its dustrial and other qualities of these people in the north of Queensland. The principal complaint made against them is that they work too hard. They are good unionists. At a union meeting at Cairns the question of the percentage of Italians to employed was discussed. An It a l i a n said that he and a number of other Italians had paid their union fees, and now it was proposed to prevent them from earning a livelihood. He made out a good case on his own behalf. The Italian., although he is a. good unionist, does not like day labour; he prefers piece-work, and takes it whenever he can get it . Five Italians went to an Australian grower in the north and asked for a job. He said he had no money, but plenty of work. They cleared his land, and came back later and harvested his crop. They took their pay after the harvesting, and were ""maintained in the meantime by the Italian Consul. That is the mettle that has developed Australia. Although I should like my family and others to enjoy every conceivable comfort, I have to recognize that it is impossible for them to do so. It appears to me that members of the Opposition would favour migrants coming here if they could have good jobs and sleep on feather beds, with everything spick and span and no unemployea in the country. If they wait for those conditions before endorsing policy of migration they will have to wait a very long time. Parts of this country are as unpopulated today as land in Melbourne was 80 years ago. We would all like to obtain good conditions for the migrant, as well as for ourselves, and the way to do it is to tackle the great developmental reproductive. works that need to be carried out. The northern Italians are not here long before they are looking for - land of thei r own, and they do not work merely eight hours a. day, but all the hours they can work. If any one despises them for that, I do not agree with him, because I have done the same myself. I want to populate Australia with Britishers, but if we cannot obtain enough of them, I am quite satisfied to give other people a trial. vice to my country is equal to his. I trust that the bill will realise our hopes . and prove the salvation of the country. It is more restrictive than the existing law. Although there is unemployment in the cities, there is work for hundreds of thousands of men under conditions such as I and my family enjoy in the country. Mr Cook.",82
390,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Reid) [5.15 a.m.] While I do not question the sincerity of the honourable member for Indi (Mr. be R. Cook), I am surprised that he should be so disloyal to his Government as to delay, the passage of this bill by contributing to the discussion - I feel some surprise at the mixed sentiments - to which he has given utterance, and his speech has left me, if I may be permitted to quote a Shakespearian phrase, "" as cold as a dead man's nose."" At the outset of his remarks he indulged in unqualified abuse - of the workers of the Commonwealth, whom he accused of leaning on the Government too much. The honourable' member's memory must be particularly short if he has forgotten that the section which he is alleged to represent in this Parliament has repeatedly requested assistance from the Government. I do not desire to malign the farmers, but there is a considerable body of the public who would give the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) the retort courteous by saying that the farmers also are leaning upon the Government. I do not make that charge against them, because the party with whom I am associated has repeatedly gone to the aid of the primary producers and other sections of the community in a order to mete out even-handed justice and cause greater prosperity in the community. The honourable member for Indi made many dogmatic statements which he did not support with facts. For instance, he said there was not sufficient labour to supply country requirements. I make bold to deny that assertion, and to say that if labour cannot be secured in some places in the country it is because of local circumstances-possibl y the faulty management of the Roads Board or municipal council-and not to any lack of desire on the part of idle workers to accept rural employment. The honourable member alsospoke of the priceless heritage we possess in this great Commonwealth. I yield nothing to him in patriotic fervour for my native land, for my record of serThe best way to serve one's' country is not to traduce its workmen, bu t to create prosperity and increased employment by the breaking up of large estates, thus bringing about conditions which will promote a natural flow of immigrants and their ready absorption. The honourable 2nember seemed to regard the migration agreement between the Commonwealth and Imperial Governments as a panacea for all our ills,, and he expressed the hope that further sums would be available from the British Government for similar purposes. Me omitted to mention that the agreement is governed by conditions which include a guarantee of work and land for the immigrants brought to Australia under the scheme. Having regard to the evidence already adduced that thousands of Australian farmers, and the sons of farmers, are unable to get the land they require, and that 150,000 of our people are unemployed, those conditions require the most careful consideration. The honourable member ridiculed the statement about unemployment, but for his benefit and that of others I shall place upon record official statistics. When the 1921 Census was taken there were in the Commonwealth 1,661,973 wage or salary earners, of whom 159,188 were out of work. The causes of unemployment were thus set out: Scarcity of employment, 74,843 ; illness, 39,350; accident, 4,802; industrial disputes, 4,539; old age, 2,139; other causes, 25,991; cause not stated, 7,524. Recently Mr Sutcliffe, of the Statistical Department, stated that 150,000 people in Australia were out of work now. That is a serious state of affairs - The figures usually quoted in regard to unemployment are somewhat misleading, because they are based upon the trade union membership only, and the unions, unfortunately, do. not include all wage and salary earners in the Commonwealth. The only way to secure accurate information is to ascertain the proportion of unemployed in all industries and occupations. I adhere to the assertion previously made that today 150,000 people in the Commonwealth are unemployed, and the policy of the Commonwealth Ministry and of other - Nationalist Governments has been a contributory factor. If more attention were paid to the breaking up of large estates, thus increasing the opportunities for employment, all our own people would find work, and the flow of immigrants would be stimulated. If the Government displayed the same degree of whole-hearted enthusiasm in meeting the requirements of our own citizens as they show in regard to the migration agreement, and raised money for the solution of many of the economic ills to which the body politic is subject, our difficulties would be less.",84
391,Mr GIBSON,Unknown,The honourable member will admit that that is a state responsibility.,85
392,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"The problems of unemployment and large estates call for joint action on the part of the Federal and State Governments. I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr . A. Green) that Australia requires more population, but the proper method of attracting population is to first solve the problem of unemployment and make land available for settlement. Then the immigration stream will flow naturally. I deny that Australia is exposed to danger because of its small population. Other countries almost as thinly populated have not been menaced by any foreign power, and I do not doubt the courage and ability of the Australian people to resist any attacks upon their national rights. We have heard a good deal about America, but that country has by no means solved the problem of immigration. The passport system whioh this Government relied upon as one effective method of checking undesirable immigration has not proved wholly satisfactory. I quote fro m the annual report of the Secretary for Labour of the United States of America, Mr J . J . Davis, for the fiscal year ended 30th June, 1924Not the least among the disturbing reports were those which indicated that certain foreign governments were pursuing towards America a policy of "" dumping "" of their' undesirible citizens and subjects. Pew people realise the iniquities of t h ; present passport system as a means nf crediting immigrants While immigrants must be vis6d by American consular"" officers to be recognized by the immigration officials at the ports of entry, the issuance of those passports are regulated by the government to which the alien owes allegiance. Passports are not issned as a matter of right, and there is no dispute of the fact that tliese documents are refused to many who apply. Under the present arrangements with these foreign powers passports amount to declarations as to certain facts by the government issuing them. A visa is nothing more than a statement by the consul to the effect that the document is recognized ns genuine. The whole system is ideally adapted for the furtherance of a policy of dumping such as has been suggested as existing. The number of alien immigrants who have already arrived in Australia is so great that the Government should consider the facts in the light of American experience with a view to a v o i d in g difficultie s that m i g h t possibly arise in the f u t u r e . Mr D a v is , in a letter to the President of the U n it e d A m e r i c a , p o in t e d out v a r i o u s fact s connected with the a l i e n i m m i g r at i o n p r o blem, and s a i dI propose !hat we establish strict but just tests of physical - and mental health and that we make those tests under the numerical restriction now placed by law on immigration. I would have those tests made abroad, in order ' that the applicant for admission may not have to spend the savings of a lifetime on a long sea voyage in order to find out whether he ean enter the United States. The C o m m o n w e a l t h Government p r o poses to examine m i g r a n t s at P r e m a n t l e , and there will be are p e t it i o n of the distressing occurrences in the U n it e d States of A m e r i c a d u r in g m a n y years. U p o n reachin g F r e m a n t l e , m a n y m i g r a be ordered back to the countries w h e n o » they came. To proceed with m y quotat i o n from Mr Davis's l e t t e r to the PresidentThe solicitor of the department is now inquiring into the possibility of moving our whole examining machinery to foreign countries under our present laws. nothing would strengthen our whole immigration policy so much as this move. One great result of moving our inspection machinery abroad to make selections amongst the applicants for admission would ho to end the heartrending scenes which every day confront our agents at Ellis Island and otherports of entry: Law enforcement is made particularly difficult when officials are faced with the sufferings and sorrows of the unfortunates who have travelled thousands of miles, leaving behind all that life has meant to them up to that time, only to And that under the law they are .barred from Americato them the promised land. Men bowed under years of oppression, women whose life .has been a continued struggle for existence, children who have known little or nothing of the joys of childhood, stand with appealing hands begging for admittance. Rejection for many of them means utter poverty, a long return sea voyage, and despair. But the law is inexorable. So long as under the law we admit foreigners to this country we oould end all of these horrors if we could make our selections on the other side and transform our immigrant stations at the ports into gateways of welcome, devoid of the harshness of official delays and pains, of sorrows, and America would then be the ideal land of the immigrant, as he has always fancied it. All bt the sorrow and despair at Ellis Island arise from the cases of those immigrants who come here despite the fact that the law prevents their admittance. If we halt these eases before they leave their native country we will end the troubles at our ports of entry. Mr Coleman. immigrant would be qualified to land in the United States of America immediately upon his. arrival. States of That deals with one phase of the quest i o n . A not h e r matter raised in the debate has reference to the causes which led to A m e r i c a a d o p t in g the quota system. The following quotation from Mr Davis's l e t t e r is very relevant to the debate and to the statements made about u n e m p l o yment in Australia:  dent, since you entered the White House. At that time, when the 3 per cent, restriction on immigration wns decided upon, you will remember that we had more than 5,000,000 of our working people idle, nnd that we faced what seemed almost certain industrial panic. Industries were closing because of lack of markets, wages scales were falling in many industries, industrial strife was spreading. Immigration restriction was one of the measures which helped to put an end to the inn t s will dustrial panic. We have come' a long way through wise administrative and legislative measures since then. To-day unemployment has been reduced to a minimum, wages everywhere are rising. During the past year, even during the past few months, there have been wage increases in practically all of the 43 industries reporting to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. They have been very general in the basic industries, and have ranged from 2 to I feel that 20 per cent. Recently the larger steel plants announced general wage increases of 11 per eent., which will undoubtedly be applied throughout the industry. In the past year industrial pay-rolls have increased approximately 25 per cent. Production in basic industries during January of this year reached a liigher level than at any time in history except in May, 1917. Expanding freight shipments likewise demonstrate the completeness of our industrial recovery. Under these conditions, with labour everywhere in demand, it is inevitable that there should be agitation among some for the lifting of immigration restrictions. It is unnecessary to point out the evil of throwing open the gates at a time of prosperity in order to flood the country with workers and non-workers, whose very presence would serve to bring prosperity to an end. It is a short sighted policy to seek cheap labour through immigration. F u r the r on he saysI have talked with employers who have taken on those men, and in every case they admit that an upstanding American workman would do two ancl a half times the work that is accomplished by the individual of this racial ' group. disappointments. He alludes to the economic value of h i g h wages and the effect created by the general prosperit y of the c o m m u n it y . M u c h has been said about the r e l at i v e l y slow progress that we have made in connection with i m m i g r at i o n , but the honourable The member for Indi (Mr Cook) belied his own statements on the subject when he said that 80 years ago this place was wild bush. As a matter of fact, compared with the United States of America, we have made marked progress in Australia. In 1820, when America had been colonized for about 200 years, it had a population of about 5,000,000. I want to put on record in Hansard the following figures, showing the rate of increase due to immigration to that country in yearly intervals from 1820: 8,386 1872 .. 404,806 9,127 1873 .. 459,803 6,91.1 1874 .. 313.339 6,354 1875 .. 227,498 7,912 1876 .. 169,986 10,199 1877 .. 141,857 10,837 1878 .. 138.469 18,875 1879 .. 177,826 27,382 18S0 .. 457,257 22,352 1881 .. 669,431 23,220 1882 .. 788,992 22,633 1 883 .. 603,322 60,482 -1884 .. 518,592 58,640 1885 .. 395,346 65,365 1886 .. 334.203 45.374 1887 .. 490,109 76,242 1888 546,889 79,340 1889 .. 444,427 38,914 1890 .. 455,302 68,069 1891 .. 560.319 84,066 1892 .. 579,663 80,289 1893 .. 439,730 104,565 1894 .. 285,631 52,496 1895 .. 258.536 78,615 1896 .. 343,267 114,371 1897 .. 230,832 154,416 1898 .. 229,299 234,968 1899 .. 311.715 226,527 1900 .. 448,572 297,024 1901 .. 487.918 369,980 1902 .. 048.743 379.466 1903 .. 857,046 371,603 1904 .. 812.870 368,645 1905 .. 1,026,499 427,833 1906 .. 1,100.735 200,877 1907 .. 1,285,349 200,436 1908 .. 782.870 251.306 1909 751.786 123,126 1910 .. 1,041.570 121,282 1911 . . 878,587 153,640 1912 .. 838,172 91.918 1913 .. 1,197,892 91,985 1914 .. 1.218.418 176,282 1915 . . 326,700 193.418 1916 . . 298.826 248,120 1.917 295.403 318.568 1918 .. 110,618 315,722 1919 . . 141,132 138,840 1920 .. 430,001 352,768 1921 .. 805.228 387,203 1922 .. 309,556 321,350 1923 .. 522,919 It may have been a little wearisome honourable members to have to listen to all those figures, but I think they should go on record. I should like to have also the relative proportion of Southern Europeans and the Nordic races. The total increase of population in the United States of America by the immigration, from 1820 to 1923, 'of different nationalities, is given in these tables: United Kingdom 8,430,777 France 550,917 Netherlands 231.294 German Umpire 5,568,702 Denmark 313,528 Norway 756,044 Sweden 1,149.950 Switzerland 274,345 Belgium 146,839 Other northern and western Europe 16,270 Total from northern and western Europe .. 17,428,405 Italy .. .. . . 4,505,133 Spain .. .. .. 163,231 Portugal .. ... 246.250 Austro-Hungary .. .. 4,199,527 Russian Empire and Finland .. . . 3,332,259 Poland . . .. .. 320,257 Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro .. .. .. 78,307 Greece .. .. .. 405,097 Rumania .. .. 133,479 Turkey in Europe .. 152.271 Turkey in Asia .. .. 201,786 Total from eastern and southern Europe .. 13,737,997 Britisli North American Possessions .. . . 2,209.403 Southern America .. 916,S21 China .. .. .. 360,739 Japan .. .. .. 262.584 India .. .. 8,619 Other specified countries . . 103,357 Countries not specified . . 254,008 These figures give a total increase of population by immigration amounting to 35,292,506. ' I want these figures put on record. I should have liked to include the whole table in Hansard, but it would take me nearly an hour to read it . I think that a very effective case has been made out by the Opposition. I am glad that it led to an eloquent contribution from the honourable member for Indi . It is satisfactory to know that the honourable member has awakened to a sense of his responsibility. Mr C. EILEY (Cook) [5.45 a.m.] for W it h other honourable members, I protest against the action of the Prime M in ister (Mr Bruce) in declaring this given measure urgent to prevent the free discussion of its provisions. My experience of the ""guillotine"" is, whilst a certain time may be set apart for the consideration of various stages of a measure, the whole of the time is occupied in the discussion of the' first clause, with the result that subsequent provisions are untouched in debate. It would have been more fitting if the Prime Minister had displayed the same eagerness to deal with industrial problems of an urgent character that call for immediate and sympathetic attention. On more than one occasion the attitude of the Labour party towards immigration has been clearly stated. I regret very much that the Ministry has failed to indicate the extent to which it is proposed to limit the introduction of aliens. Frequently British immigrants have difficulty in securing assisted passages to Australia, and are.. subjected to all manner of restrictions, but foreign migrants, on the other hand, have been allowed to come in practically unchecked. The manner in which the immigration policy has been handled is anything but statesmanlike. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) has declared that there is work in Australia for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. All I can say, in reply to that statement, is that if work is available, it is strange that there should be so much unemployment at the present time in Australia. Under cient administration there should be work for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Unhappily there is not. The Government proposals fall far short of what is required. There should be co-ordination in regard to land settlement schemes between the various state governments The Commonwealth migration officials who trip to and fro and are responsible in Great Britain for a publicity campaign which deludes a large number of people in the Mother Country. These people realise, when they reach Australia, that they have been totally misinformed about conditions in this country. The Labour party definitely objects to immigration - whilst there is unemployment in Australia. We believe that with sympathetic government control it should be possible to launch a comprehensive immigration scheme that would absorb all those of our kith and kin who might be attracted to our shores. Mr J. M. Murdoch, a Mr C. Riley. REPRESENTA TTV ES. 1 Bill. member of the Legislative Council of that New South Wales, while on a visit recently to Great Britain, advertised in Scotland for prospective immigrants to Australia, and was inundated with replies; showing clearly that there is a definite deaire on the part of British workers and agriculturists to* migrate to Australia. A newspaper report of his mission statesHe interviewed twelve of these, and states that they were first class men for a country like Australia, hard-working, independent, thrifty Scotsmen, and their homes, which he inspected, models of cleanliness and order. They were, he says, proof against the temptations of city life, of which they neither had, nor desired to have experience. They had capital ranging from about £100 to £200. Every one of these informed Mr Murdoch that they had tried hard to get to Australia ever since the war. Sir Joseph Cook, the Australian High Commissioner, told Mr Murdoch that he was entirely helpless in regard to such people, and he was ashamed of the apologies he had to make to such applicants for refusing their claims. Federal authorities blame the State Governments for this state of affairs. The states, in their turn, are equally positive that the fault lies with the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, thousands of Southern European foreigners-drifters-ar e flocking to Australia, . and it may well be asked, what is the reason for the present arrangement, and whose polioy is it? I understand that, since his return to Australia, Mr Murdoch has been endeavouring to ascertain who is responsible for this state of affairs, but up to the present effihe has not been successful. If the Government is determined to regulate the influx of southern Europeans, I suggest that preference should be given to those who are prepared to bring their wives and families with them. If we are to have immigration,' and with the present Government we must, I suppose, expect it, every encouragement should be given to migrants who are likely to make .their homes here, instead of returning to their native land after they have acquired a certain amount of money. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) referred to the embargo against Germans. That barrier should now be removed. The Germans make excellent colonists. In the past they have done a great deal towards the development of the Commonwealth, and notwithstanding the feeling engendered against them during the war, we should now encourage them. They are much to be preferred before migrants from southern Europe. But in any immigration scheme steps should be taker. to safeguard the conditious of the Australian worker. Honourable members on this side fear that the unsympathetic handling of alien migration by the Nationalist Government may result in a' lowering of the standard of living. the Government is determined to check the influx of aliens, it is to be hoped that the interests of the workers of Australia will be full y protected. Maltese, Italians, and Jugo-Slavs that have been attracted to these shores during the last few years have become a menace to Australian workmen. They group themselves in separate colonies, and secure work in mines and in other industrial activities, to the disadvantage of Australian workers. I am not disposed to give the Government a free hand in the control of alien migration. quota of alien migrants be clearly stated in the bill. must not forget that a few years ago Sir Henry Barwell, ex-Premier of South Australia, was an advocate of black labour in Australia, It is evident that some honourable members supporting the Government share to some extent his views by countenancing the wholesale importation of Greeks, Italians, and other aliens into Australia for employment in our industries under conditions considerably below those at present enjoyed by Australian workmen. I commend to the Government a scheme of child immigration, whereby British boys and girls could be brought to Australia to enjoy our free conditions. Under such a scheme 500,000' children could be brought here. Their minds and characters would be moulded by their new environment, and they would eventually become worthy citizens. Before any immigration scheme is entered into, the Government should take steps to absorb our own unemployed. It is vitally necessary that we should open up for closer settlement many of the large estates in Australia. South Wales a few months ago applications were invited for a block of land at Warren. Over 800 men, the majority of whom were sons of Australian farmers, applied for the block. This shows how land hungry are the sons of Australian farmers. Before any further migrants are introduced into Australia the Government should satisfy the wants of the 300 disappointed applicants. The. British Government has recently agreed to lend the Commonwealth and State Governments £34,000,000 to assist - in establishing developmental works for the absorption of British migrants. The vessels which come to our shores laden with immiIf grants return to the Old Country with enormous quantities of our raw materials. To absorb these migrants satisfactorily we must throw open suitable land for settlement, launch out on a comprehensive programme of public works, and establish secondary industries for the manufacture of our raw materials. I .regret that the Government is attempting to force this bill through without allowing sufficient time for the mature consideration of its provisions. I should be failing in my duty to my constituency, in which are large numbers of unemployed, if I did not opThe pose the first part of the bill. I shall at should a later stage resist strenuously the outWe rageous proposals respecting deportation.",85
393,Mr LACEY,Unknown,I call attention to '-he state of the committee. [Quorum formed.],89
394,Mr GARDNER,Unknown,"Robertson"") [6.10 a.m.] - The honourable member for Indi (Mr R. Cook) stated that although unemployment was fairl y prevalent in rhe cities, the position was not so acute i u the country. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman), in reply said that the honourable member for Indi did not give any concrete example to support his statement. I suggest to the honourable member for Reid that he erred in the same direction. He states that the number of unemployed in Australia was 150,000; but even he, with his logical brain, did not give any cause for this unemployment, although he certainly has thoroughly studied the subject. We all regret that there should be so much unemployment in om midst, but in fairness it should be stated that a certain section of people are unemployable. Although we rightly boast of the Arbitration Court In New and its beneficial effect on the conditions and wages of Australian workmen, yet we must admit that the tendency today is for people to live in the city with its attractions and higher rate of wages, rather than to seek employment in the couutry. That is one of the contributing causes of unemployment. The agreement which has been entered into between the Imperial and the Commonwealth and State Governments to provide £34,000,000 for developmental work in Australia should have a very beneficial effect upon Australian industries generally. I do not agree with the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) that the British agreement will adversely affect the average artisan in Australia.' The great bulk of Australian workers not be employed at a rate less than that fixed by the Arbitration Court. I agree with honourable members orposite, that, generally speaking, the Australian does work of a high standard. He has no need to fear competition from southern Europeans or British migrants. Like the honourable member for Indi (M Cook) I represent a rural constituency in which there is room for British migrants. I do not think that Arbitration Court awards can ever be made to apply to country centres to the same extent as to manufacturing and industrial centres. The conditions are so dissimilar. Although it is possible to absorb a reasonable number of immigrants in the various states, the chief responsibility in this connection must rest with the State Governments. T agree with the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), that a good deal of his huge electorate is land-locked; but the Commonwealth Government has practically nothing whatever to do with land settlement. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning), who has had experience in the New South Wales Parliament, will bear me out when I say that the various Liberal and National st Governments of that state have successf u l l y tackled the problem of land settlement there. The honourable mpmber for Gwydir spoke of the New South Wales Legislative Council as a House of "" old fossils,"" but I notice that the Labour Premier, Mr Lang, has followed the practice of the Labour party by augmenting its numbers considerably. I cannot recollect in recent years a single instance in which the New South Wales Upper House has refused to pass legislation sent to it by the Lower House when it has been satisfied that a fair majority of the people was behind it . I earnestly hope that the states will accept the immigration agreement, and endeavour to settle as many immigrants as possible on the land.",89
395,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) a.m.] - The Government has forced us to dismiss this measure at this most inditions opportune hour, but we do not intend to shirk our duty. If it does not see fit to permit the House to sit during reasonable hours, we must do our duty in the time that it will make available to us. It is ridiculous and unfair to apply the guillotine to clauses 3 to 6 by 12.30' o'clock today. Some honourable members, can- notably the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who did not know that the Government intended to adopt these tactics, desired to move amendments to certain of these clauses, and because they are not. here they will not be able to do so. The subject of immigration has very properly exerc'sed r . the minds of members of the Federal and' State Parliaments, as well as of otherprominent men in' this country, for a considerable time. The population of a country grows by the natural increase, or the excess of births overdeaths; and by immigration, or the excess of arrivals over departures. Naturally a country like Australia, with an area of 3,000,000 square nrles, and a population of approximately 6,000.000, expects in the next ten or fifteen years to increase its population considerably. Honourable members opposite have said that the Labour party does not believein immigration. I wish to say definitely that my interpretation of our policy is that we believe in a progressive and reasonable scheme of immigration. ",90
396,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"No ; in a practical and concrete way. We do not believe in bringing thousands of immigrants from the cities of the Old World to dump them indiscriminately in our capital cities to swell the rank of our unemployed army,, which already numbers 150,000. A large sum is spent annually in Australia in ration doles for the unemployed, aud I suppose that we shall always have a certain number of unemployed in our midst, but we ought not to multiply them unnecessarily. No doubt, the honourable mem others of his political i l k , would be willing to flood Australia with cheap labour. That is one of the principal objects that the Government had in introducing the bill. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Gardner) said that many young [6.20 men from the country were flocking into the cities because rates of pay and congenerally were better there. Although that statement has some truth in it, we sliould not despair of successfully settling a number of immigrants in Australia, nor of inducing the sons of farmers to remain on the land. - Mr Fenton - What about the possibility of the sugar industry absorbing immigrants 2",90
397,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"It is well known thai: in the early days of the sugar industry in Queensland thousands of Kanakas were introduced from the South Sea Islands to serve for a stipulated period at niggardly rates of pay. Owing chiefly to the attitude of the Labour party in the Federal and various State Governments black labour has now been abolished in Queensland, and the place of the Kanakas has been taken by Australians and by immigrants, principally from Great Britain, but also, in later years, from southern Europe.",91
398,Mr MACKAY,Unknown,The honourable member's memory is conveniently bad in respect to the Kanakas.,91
399,Mr FORDE,Unknown,That is not so. Kanakas wonld have been in Queensland still had it not been for the Labour party.  believed in deportation for the Kanakas.,91
400,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"They were not departed but restored to their own country, from which they were taken away against their will. The honourable member for For Guinea. I do not know whether he was with me as a member of the party whose motor car broke down one night when we were travelling from Kimadan to Kaevieang. If he was he should recollect that when the accident happened at 1 o'clock in the morning the party came upon a company of about 500 natives singing with great cheerfulness, altogether regardless of shipping strikes, lockouts or disturbances of that kind. They were contented and happy. So were the Kanakas until they were forced to go to Queensland to be driven like slaves. is natural that a state like Queensland, with some 670,000 square miles of country, and approximately 800,000 people, should, after absorbing her own landless and workless people, welcome immigrants of the right type; but not thousands of penniless people from the slum areas of the cities of the Old World . A properly regulated flow of immigrants under suitable conditions would be beneficial.  believes in securing moneyed men.",91
401,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I welcome men who will be able to look after themselves and create employment, but every opportunity should be given to poor men to make a start. It is no use dumping them down without assistance. It is often said that the Labour party has been responsible for keeping capital out of Australia, but that is not the case. We welcome capital here, and we hope that the time will come when we shall not have to send practically the whole of our raw material abroad, but-when, on the contrary, we shall manufacture it here. It is not true that the Labour party has no definite policy on immigration.",91
402,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,It s policy is not to - bring migrants to this country. That is definite enough.,91
403,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The Labour party proposes to attract migrants by improving the conditions here. If we were The manufacturing our' requirements in motor cars we could employ 25,000 additional men every year. We pay £1,000,000 a month to other countries for motor cars. While there are hundreds of hatters out of employment in Melbourne and Sydney, we buy 1,250,000 hats a year from one Italian hat factory. The wonderful strides made by the confectionery in dustry illustrate what can be done. From 1917 to 1919 there was a prohibition against the importation of confectionery, and as a result local industries have manufactured 90 per cent, of our requirements in confectionery, and thousands of people-man y of them migrants-ar e employed in the industry. That is how I would absorb migrants in this country. We cannot get migrants unless we offer them inducements to come here, but at all times our first duty is to the people who are here-the farmers' sons who wish to go on the land, and the young men and women who seek employment It in our secondary industries. The Labour party also stands for a bold, constructive, developmental policy, including cooperation with the State Governments to subdivide large holdings into smaller areas, so that instead of a few people earning £10,000 to £50,000 per annum each, there will be thousands of farmers making a reasonable living on the land. One thing we can do to settle people .on the land is to assist them in marketing their produce. We could, for instance, stabilize the marketing of dairy produce. On that subject, this party has very fixed ideas. If immigrants are to succeed on the land, we must provide them with a livin g wage. The manufacturers have the Customs Department and the Tariff Board, and the workers have the Arbitration Court to protect them, and frequently the unfortunate primary producers are crushed between those two sections. The primary producer has as much right as any one to protection, and Labour believes in helping him to make a living wage. migration scheme to settle people on the land can be a success, these problems must be solved. If we are to have a well-balanced scheme for the development aud progress of this country, the primary producer must get the same consideration as any other section of the people. Honourable members opposite say that the Labour party has no definite immigration policy. I shall read the policy of the party on immigration, which was defined at the last Federal Conference of the party in Melbourne, in October, 1924. The policy reads1. We believe that the present immigration . policy of the capitalist governments is directed to Hooding the Australian labour market, reducing Australian working-class standards, and the providing of cheap labour to sweating employers, and we are emphatic that public money should not be expended for these purposes. 2. We declare that Australia is capable, under good government, of supporting in happiness a much larger population; but to protect our fellow-workers from being deluded by false statements into leaving home and kindred merely to become tools of sweaters, we insist that land, housing accommodation^, and omployment be provided for overseas immigrants before they are invited to come to Australia. (a) That existing land monopoly""should be broken up/ and provision made for Australian land-seekers. (b) Work should be made available for Australian unemployed, or unemployment allowances provided.",91
404,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Plent y of work is available at present, but 2,000 seamen will not do it .",92
405,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The honourable member knows quite well that if all the vessels were running today we should still have a large army of' unemployed. The trade journals show that manufacturers are discharging workpeople every clay because they cannot get adequate protection from this Government. Thousands of people in the seasonal industries are unemployed at certain periods of every year. There are in Melbourne today approximately 10,000 people who are unemployed. To attribute all existing unemployment to the shipping strike is unfair. Men of the fiscal belief of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and the honor are largely responsible for the Government having no fixed policy on the subject of protection. The right honourable Before a member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) once said that the Government was like a rudderless ship. Those who come to this country from abroad must be employed in the cities or satisfactorily settled on the land. Provision should be made for ' them before they are dumped down here. Let me continue to read the policy of the Labour party(c) Adequate housing accommodation. (<i) Land should be ready, and employment available under Australian conditions for overseas settlers or workers when invited to come to Australia. (e) Effective medical examinations abroad of ' all intending immigrants to Australia. Provision must be made to absorb m i grants as well as our own population. Land must be available for them when necessary. They cannot be dumped in Melbourne and left there. It would be a good thing if they could, after arrival in this country, study conditions for a time at an agriculturalcollege before being sent out on the land. We cannot expect migrants from a London slum to make an immediate success of farming. They must be tutored in the initia l stages. Conditions. Mr JACKSON - The Burnett lands are not being rushed.",92
406,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"They will be taken up. in time. Railway lines are under construction; but at present many of the farmers in northern Burnett have to cart their produce 10, 15, or 20 miles to the railway line. People should not be expected to settle in places like that until a railway line has been constructed to a point within reasonable distance of them. That is one of the principal reasons why the northern Burnett blocks have no', all been taken up. The Labour party's policy on migration also provides for looking a f t e r the m i g r a n ts when they get here^ and for s e t t l in g the m on the l and , and also for assisting p r i m a r y producers gener all y . That p a r t of the policy reads- The promotion and extension of the agricultural and rural industries Dy the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture to cooperate with similar St-.te bodies with a view to organizing all those engaged in primary production into a unified body, so that they may be able to more effectively place their views before Governments, and"" to generally co-operate and assist in giving effect to the following policy :(1) The encouragement of co-operation among primary producers ih order to bring consumers and producers into direct communication. (2) The provision of more methods of marketing our. products, both locally and overseas. (3) The provision of a system of Research work for the betterment of rural production. (4) The extension of the functions of the Commonwealth Bank to provide for Rural Credit Branch for the purpose of assisting land settlement and development; the granting of relief to necessitous primary - producers against the ravages of drought, fire, flood, and pests, and the establishment of a grain and fodder reserve against periods of drought. (5) Co-operation between the Federal and State Governments to provide for an effective system under which land will be made available for frrmers' sons and those able and willing to use it. (6) The extension of tha Commonwealth Shipping L in e ' for the purpose of securing cheaper freights on-the carriage of our products, both interstate and overseas. (7) The establishment of Commonwealth agricultural implement factories for the purpose of providing primary producers with cheaper machinery. (8) A comprehensive system of water conservation and irrigation, with provision-in suitable areas-for the communal supply of water from artesian and sub-artesian bores and wells. (9) The encouragement of secondary industries and the provision of cheap light and power in country districts, where practicable. (10) The extension of the benefits of civil aviation and wireless communication to promote country districts. (11) The provision of better facilities for postal, telegraphic, and telephonic communication. (12) Assistance and encouragement in the construction of railways, main roads, and in the development of the nearest ports as a means of bringing producers in touch with their natural markets by the shortest and quickest routes.

I understand that that rate of immigration has been considerably exAustralia ceeded, showing that the Government has been lax in the administration",93
409,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,That is not so at all . The official records disprove the honourable member's statement.,94
410,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"The reports I have received from Queensland indicate that these aliens are entering the Commonwealth in greater numbers than ever before. The Government, by fixing monthly quotas for Jugo Slavs, Greeks, and Albanians, has shown that it has power to control immigration if it so desires. In my electorate some Germans are engaged in agriculture, and my experience of them is that they are very good settlers. Some of them arrived, in Central Queensland thirty or forty years ago, cleared scrub lands in the face of great difficulties, and are now amongst the state's most estimable farmers. I consider, therefore, that the Government should at an early date remove the embargo upon Germans desiring to enter the Commonwealth. The Italians in my electorate are not numerous, but those I have met are very fine settlers, and good workers. It is interesting to note that from 1861 to 1923, the natural increase of population in Australia wasmales, 1,619,383; females, 1,879,577; total, 3,498,960. The total net increase in that period was-males , 2,261,742; females, 2,342,480; total, 4,604,222.

The Commonwealth, being a comparatively young country and having adopted the policy of excluding Asiatics, is not confronted with racial problems such as have caused so much trouble to the people of the United States of America. We should learn a lesson from the experience of that count r y . The now cherished ideal of a White was first made popular by the Labour party, and should be supported by of the law. every good Australian.",94
411,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,Why is Walsh opposed to it ?,94
412,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I am not speaking for Mr Walsh, but for the political Labour party. Sir Henry Barwell also is opposed to it . Why? The Labour party throughout the Commonwealth believes in a White Australia policy, and but for the work of Labour men in and out of Parliament, this country would be cursed with black labour today. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - The honourable member knows that the White Australia policy was in practice fifty or sixty years before the Labour party came into existence.",94
413,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"It might have been talked of, but nothing was done. Practical effect was not given to that principle until the Labour party put it in the forefron t of its platform. In Queensland, our party had, as late as 1904, to fight against Sir Alfred Cowley and others who said that the sugar industry would be ruined if Kanaka labour was withdrawn. The people who stand for the White Australia policy know that had it not been for the work of the Labour party it would never have been given practical effect. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - The honourable member does a grave injustice to the late Sir Edmund Barton and others.",94
414,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"It was the Labour party that forced men like Sir Edmund Barton to accept the policy. One of the conditions under which the Labour party gave that genlleman support was that he should r i d Australia of Kanaka labour. The At torney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) knows that many of those with whom he is associated would wipe out the White Australia policy today if they had the power. The honourable gentleman knows that Sir Henry Barwell said, "" I have the courage of my convictions. There are thousands of Liberals and Nationalists in Australia today who think as I do in favour of black labour for the northern parts of Australia, but have not the courage to express their views."" I feel sure that there are some honourable members opposite who in their hearts do not approve of the White Australia policy. I have no doubt that the Attorney-General has had to put up strong arguments in support of it with those of hid own party. We have to consider whether we are to keep this country white or may 'permit the introduction of people of the coloured races. Sir Henry Barwell, who is one of the champions of Liberalism and Nationalism in Australia, strongly advocated the employment of coloured labour in the northern parts of Australia. Those who have been in the north of Queensland are well aware' that it is one of the healthiest parts of Australia. Immigrants who have come from Great Britain and other parts of Europe have made a good living there, ' under decent Australian conditions, and have brought up families that will compare favourably with those to be found in the more temperate parts of Australia. When we find men in the inner counsels of the National party advocating the introduction of black labour in that part of Queensland above the line just north of Rockhampton, we can only conclude that' they are unpatriotic and represent sweating employers who are prepared to employ black labour so long as they can obtain it cheaply.",94
415,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [7.5 a.m.] - I have been roused to enthusiasm by the stirring address of. the honourable member for Capricornia, and feel it incumbent on me to contribute to the debate. During the second-reading debate I did not comment upon the immigration clauses of the bill, but confined my remarks to its principal provisions. I believe, however, that the immigration clauses of the measure are worthy of being discussed when honourable members are better fitted than they can be now to realise their seriousness. We are at the present' time confronted with a very serious unemployment problem. This is a time when there should be the strictest supervision of immigration to this country. clause under discussion purports to provide for that, but it deals with only one phase of the question, and does not deal adequately with that. I think it was last year that I received an invitation from one of the government departments to inspect a filmprepared on behalf of the Government for display in Great B r i tain. The purpose of its exhibition was to attract immigrants to Australia. There was pictured on the film what was described as a typical example of the ex[51] perience of an immigrant from. Great Britain after his arrival, in Australia. The picture .showed hia arrival here withhis brother. It was ex 7 plained on the screen that they had £30 between them on their arrival; that they deposited the money in the savings bank and went, away to the country to work for 25s. a week. In a few years time, according to the film which is now being shown in Great Britain , they had taken up land, and added to what they originally took up, block by block, and section by section. According to the story, one of these men after, eight years in Australia had some thousands of acres of land, several thousand head of sheep, and stated that he was worth £14,000, all. of which was accumulated in Australia during the eight years. This was put forth as a typical example of the experience of a British immigrant. He said, and his words were shown on the screen, that he had been by no means, as fortunate as some others who had done twice as well as he had. That might have been a true story of the experience of a British immigrant, but it seemed to me to be a piece of fiction. Will honourable members opposite contend, that it was a fair example of the experience on the land in this country of an immigrant from Great Britain * .  !",95
416,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I am glad to have the honourable member's confirmation of my opinion that it was not a true picture of the experience of men on the land in Australia, and I ask why it was used to attract people to this country by false pretences. . That is the kind of thing to which honourable members on this side object. One of the worse things which the Government can possibly do is .to attract people to these shores by false advertisements and false pretences, and The have them stranded here on their arrival. The morning I left home to see the film to which I referred, I had at my place an immigrant who had been five months in this country and had been unable to obtain employment. I asked him, "" Were you not taken up by the Immigration Bureau after your arrival, and did not some one provide you with work when you landed."" He-said, "" Yes, I was provided with employment at 25s. a week out at the back of Swan Hill . The man who engaged' mekept me for six weeks, wid then discharged me."" I asked, "" Was it because you were considered unfit,"" and he replied. "" No. it was because >he job. job cut out."" I said. "" Were you not provided with another job."" He said was not. and that he had wended his way back to Melbourne, and was living in a room of a house in my electorate with his wife and two little children. The wife came along and showed me gramme. pawn tickets for some of her belongings, including her wedding ring. Before went to see the film I have spoken of contributed something to redeem the woman's wedding ring. It is a cruel thing to bring people from other parts of the world, aud leave them stranded in Australia. It is cruel to them, and cruel also to our own people .who are employed. I listened to the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) somement time last night. He put forward argument that we can solve the unemto ployed problem by importing people from other parts of the world. He said the more workers we have here the more work they will provide. If that argucrushed ment were well founded one would imports. imagine that there would, be no such thing as an unemployment problem in countries having a large population. would tliink also that the unemployed problem confronting Great Britain might be easily solved by that country keeping her population instead of lettiug them come out here as immigrants. We have an agreement between the British aud Commonwealth Governments under which the British Government is prepared advance money at a low rate of interest in order to relieve Great Britain of surplus labour, and get rid of its uneni- - tralian cruisers. ployed problem. The argument used by the honourable member for Riverina has been repeated again and again' by the advocates of immigration : but, if it is industries. sound, Great Britain should her own people, as the greater their number the more work they to would provide, and the less unemthat ployment there would be in that country. If a big population meant ample emthe ployment, there ought to be no unemployof ment problem in .countries like China and Japan. As a matter of fact, increase population will not of itself for solve unemployment difficulties. These may only be met by opening up the great resources of the country and developing Mr Senllin its secondary industries. It is here that this Government has fallen down on its It has failed to keep the wheels of industry going in our factories.

418,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"I contend that my remarks are neither wide of the clause nor irrelevant. The bill deals with the introduction of workers, to Australia, and unour immediate problem is to find employfor the people already in this the country. One of the most effective means this end is to develop our primary industries, and. by means of an effective thattariff, ensure the expansion of our secondary industries, which are being out of existence by the flood of  the l-esfcrietion, not the importation, of One. workers to Australia.",96
419,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"I am well aware of that, but my objection is that the bill does not restrict certain classes of workers effectively. Our great trouble is, that whilst we are being inundated with a flood of imports, the bill provides for the introduction of workers, and the to policy of the Government is to export work, as witness the contract given overits seas for the construction of two AusI f we are to ensure a big population for Australia we must develop our natural resources, and provide for the expansion of our secondary There seems to be an imkeep pression in some quarters that all that is necessary is to encourage immigrants settle on the land.

It is no use to encourage production unless we also find a market for much of our to products. We hold that the best market the Australiau primary producer is the local market. To advertise the opportunities in Australia, as was done in the picture film to which I have referred, is altogether misleading.  people on the land if primary producers were not burdened so heavily.",96
420,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The honourable mem reiterating his complaint about the so called burdens upon primary producers. They are more imaginary than real. The report of the Tariff Board showed that one alleged grievance was non-existent. In so far as the bill purports to restrict the influx of migrants it has my support. But it does not go far enough. We must regulate the influx, not only of alien immigrants, but also of those who come from Great Britain. Whilst we wish to 3ee Australia increase her population, and would prefer the people of our own kith and kin, we hold strongly that no one should be induced to come here under false pretences. I have seen groups of Australian unemployed watching immigrants landing from vessels in Melbourne, and I have heard their angry comments concerning the new-comers. In justification of their attitude they said to me that it was unfair for people to come here from overseas when there was not, sufficient employment for those already in Australia. I pointed out to them, however, that the immigrants were not to blame. The responsibility rested upon the migration authorities for having published misleading advertisements in Great Britain concerning the conditions in Australia. On every occasion when I have - been appealed to by these unfortunate immigrants, I have done my best to assist them. I resent the present policy. Why it is being pursued I can only conjecture. I do not like to impute motives, but it is strange that certain migrants can find employment almost as soon as they step off the ships that bring them here, whilst Australian workmen are unable to get work. Let there be no mistake about it. We have in Australia an unemployment problem that cannot be brushed aside with a wave of the hand. We had the statement from the Assistant Minister (Mr Marr) early in the debate, that there was any amount of work to be obtained in certain shires in his state. If the Minister will furnish me with particulars of that work I will undertake to provide all the men required within 24 hours. I have on my books from day to day a list of men who are out of work in my division. One of the most distressing duties that falls to my lot as a representative of a big industrial electorate is to meet men who are out of work, hear what they have to. say, and endeavour to do something for them. Only yesterday afternoon I interviewed a dozen young men in the Queen's Hall. They inquired if there was any prospect of securing work in Canberra, or even New Guinea, or the Northern Territory. Work may be available in certain parts of the country, but in the absence of effective organization to acquaint the workers, the opportunity to get it is frequently lost. If we had a national employment bureau, and rid the community of the private labour bureaux, which in the majority of cases are parasites, it should be possible to do something of a practical nature to meet oiir present difficulties.",97
421,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Why not encourage immigration to the Northern Territory ? Itshould be a paradise if properly developed.,97
422,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I sliould be glad of any practical suggestion from the honourable member. I submit, however, that there are thousands of square miles of first class land in proximity to railway lines; land with ample rainfall, and' of proved fertility, which should be made available before people should be expected to undertake the development of central Australia. Thousands of square miles of the best of our country is running ' sheep instead of maintaining thousands of successful agriculturists. Between 1910 and 19.13 I was the member for Corangamite in this House. Some years ago the Victorian Government placed settlers on 300-acre blocks in the Heytesbury aud Beech Forest areas, where some of the trees were 20 feet in diameter and 350 feet in height. The proposition was altogether too difficult. Just outside the fringe of those areas there were estates of 50,000 ancl 60,000 acres carrying about one sheep to 2 acres. The holders of those estates have made it impossible for us to develop the vast resources of this country. Men flock to the cities because of their inability to obtain land at reasonable prices. I understand that in New South Wales the cost of settling a man on the land is £2,000, and Iiow many people have so pound much money to invest? The cost of prosecute purchasing land adjacent to markets, docile; roads, and railways, and clearing, cultiunder vating, and stocking it would enable the average man to retire from work for life. Let us put our house in order, and make possible. land and work available, establish our factories, by scientific protection, and that means attract to Australia the very morning's Age:best settlers from every part of the world. That is the Labour party's policy, which I submit is sound.",97
423,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [7.31 a.m.] - When I was speaking yesterday afternoon, the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) interjected that the present system of immigration, if continued, would increase Vhe number of aliens compared with that of British stock by 1 per cent, in ten yeaTs. Looking at Khibbs's figures in the 1924 Year-Boole I was surprised to find that the population of British stock in Australia was 99 per cent. 'The Prime Minister showed that within a period of eighteen months the percentage had been reduced to 98 per cent. Yesterday I showed that if we allowed foreign people to come into Australia at the same rate as at present, instead of aliens remaining at 2 per cent., their numbers would increase to almost 6 per cent. This is a serious position. I am strongly in favour of maintaining the present proportions of population, and I hope in 50 years' time, when our population is, say, 60,000,00©, that 98 per cent, of it will be of British stock. I shall quote two extracts from this morning's Age to show how employers procure the cheapest form of labour' to conduct their business. The first paragraph is headed, ""South Africa's D r i ft to Colour,"" and deals with the report of a South African commission presided over by Professor W. Pittman. This commission says bluntly that it is unable to attribute the .decrease in the employment of whites to any cause other than a deliberate policy persistently pursued of displacing European in favour of cheap coloured labour. The paragraph readsThe commission shows that whereas the ratio of wnites to colouretls in 1911 was 1 to 7.7, in 1923 it was 1 to 10.1. The report emphasises the fact that native labour is more acceptable to the mines than white, because the native's standard of living is lower, and therefore his wages aTe lower; that the comsystem, the pass laws, and the - power to a native criminally for neglect of work tend to make a black labour force more and that the awards made to natives the Miners' Phthisis Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act are upon so much lower a scale that there is a direct incentive to avoid the use of white labour as much as by The following cable also appeared in this JAPANESE LABOUK. DISPLACES WHITES IN OBEOON. . New York; 14th July. Following on the protest from Tokio Governor Pierce, of Oregon, is investigating the action of the mob at Toledo in forcing a score of Japanese mill-workers to leave the town on 12th July. Citizens complained that the Pacific Spruce Corporation imported labourers, paying them 240 cents daily, while whites were previously paid 360 cents to 4 dollars for the same work - A.P.A . In that case the whites worked for the corporation for 15s. or 16s. a day, and the Japanese workmen undercut the wage, and did the work for about 10s. a day. I know that alien immigration does not include coloured labour, but I quote those extracts to show that the introduction into Australia of men who have been used to social conditions lower than those which we enjoy wilL. unless we are exceptionally careful in selecting the right class of migrant, tend to reduce the social, economic, and industrial conditions of our workers. Mi"". M . CAMERON - The object of the bill is to keep aliens out of this country.",98
424,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has admitted that under the bill there will be an increase in the number of aliens, and that within a few years the percentage, instead of 2 per cent., will oe 3 per cent. Dr Springthorpe, an eminent man in his profession, has been investigating the death-rate among Australian children, particularly the babies. He has emphatically stated that we lose 30,000 babies in Australia every year, and that the great proportion of those deaths could have been prevented. Mr Donald Mackinnon said that he believed in the maternity allowance, because the Australian baby was the finest immigrant we could obtain. The best type of immigrant is our Australian baby, and it is in the homes of the Australian workers that we find the largest families. The fear has been expressed that international complications would follow any attempt . by Australia to fix quotas, but I - do uot think that any honourable member, in - tendered cluding the right honourable the Prime an Minister (Mr Bruce), has a real fear of trouble in that respect. Those statewealth, ments were merely a puerile and foolish excuse for not proposing the quota sysgrams tem.

I mention that by way of introduction, because we have not yet come to special clauses regarding deportation, n connection with which that complaint I mention this with the knowledge that the bending under the weight has of argument addressed to it on this subject, has an amendment under consideration to create tribunals where hitherto it was intended that there should be none. it h those preliminary observations, I the consideration of the Attorney General (Sir Littleton Groom) to the section in the original act and the amend The clause deals with the general question of what constitutes a prohibited immigrant, . and how he ' may be treated when a.m. apprehended and charged with being a prohibited immigrant. It will be Bpen that in the original act, which we are by proposing to amend, there is a somewhat insertcommon, but very dangerous adoption of the principle, that the onus of proof is not on the Crown, which makes the averon the who has to defend himself. I base my first criticism of 'the evi- - clause on that ground, but not by any by means on that ground alone. That prindate ciple has been adopted in many statutes to the already passed by this Parliament. For the sake of simplicity of proof, and to secure conviction, we have impinged upon the very sacred principle that a man is to be assumed to be innocent u n t i l he has been proved to be guilty. It is set out in sub-section. 3 of section 5 of the original act, that in any prosecution under certain preceding sub-sections the averment of the prosecutor that the defendant is an immigrant who has evaded an officer, has entered the Commonwealth in certain circumstances, or has done one of a number of things, "" shall be deemed""-and these are the important words- "" to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary by the personal evidence of the defendant either with or without other evidence."" That is how the law stood when the bill was introduced. The act also states thatThe personal evidence of the defendant include a definite statement as to the date and place of his arrival in the Commonwealth, and the name of the vessel by which he travelled to Australia. The Government has struck that out, and by the clause proposes to insert in its placeProof to the contrary by the personal evidence of the defendant, within the meaning of the last preceding sub-section, shall not (unless it is proved that the defendant was born in Australia) be deemed to have been given unless the defendant in his personal evidence states truly the name of the vessel by which he travelled to Australia and the date and place of his arrival in the Commonwealth. At first glance that sub-section reads harmlessly, and in that connection. I point out that this Government has a very pleasant way, in the name of law and order, and with avowed respect for the courts of this country, about which it had much to say last evening, of constantly infringin g the prerogatives of the courts. In that way a case is predetermined in this Parliament to suit, the Government's political bent. meaning of the proposed new sub-section I have recited is that no matter what the magistrate may think who hears the evidence, no matter whether he is satisfied or not that the evidence is sufficient to acquit the person charged of the charge made against him, he must not accept that evidence if it does not comply with this technical requirement. is a vicious and improper principle. The clause continuesWhere the prosecutor applies to the court for an adjournment of the proceedings to obtain evidence in rebuttal of any evidence tenMr Brennan. dorcd by the defendant, the court shall grant an adjournment for such time as is necessary for that purpose. That refers to an application by the "" prosecutor "" for an adjournment. Why does this Government load the scales of justice against the defendant? Why should he not have equal rights with the prosecutpr ? Why should the Government or Parliament dictate to a court in its own jurisdiction- a court which has a special .knowledge whether it should grant the adjournment or not-and say that it shall grant an adjournment to a prosecutor, no matter what it may do with a similar application by the defendant? That is a very grave and even gross infringement of certain wellaccepted principles of British law, and shall I should like to hear the Attorney: General in explanation or extenuation of it . Members of the Government are, as usual, posing before the people of the country as the special champions of law and order, and the most biting passages of the criticism they have addressed to this side of the House are in support of the view that we are in 3cme way distantly associated with people who have no' respect for the courts of this country. If the Government has respect for the courts of this country, it should not load the scales of justice against one of the parties appearing before a court. The thir d proposed new sub-section is almost equally objectionable, for it saysOflicial documents of the Commonwealth, or of a state, or of a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, and telegrams and affidavits produced out of the official custody of the Commonwealth purporting to have been sent or taken by an officer, shall, if they contain information or statements upon matters relevant to the proceedings, 'be admissible in evidence. The That seems harmless, but what does it mean 2 As ' the law stands at present, telegrams, letters, and other documents are always admissible as evidence if they are proved to be genuine documents-that is tb say, if they are identified. There is nothing new in that, but what is the implication in the words I have read? It is that if a That, telegram in official custody is produced it shall be admissible as evidence. If the proposed new sub-section means any 1 tbing it means that such a telegram shall be taken on its face value. It is an in vitation to the court to say that - if a telegram purports to be sent from a certain person to a certain person it is actually - what it purports to be. What is wrong with the law which requires a telegram, if produced and put foward as a genuine document, - to be proved for what it is, and the identity of the person who purported to send it established? Here again is a distinct invitation to the court to disregard the. ordinary safeguards an accused person has when he is brought face to face Will documentary evidence. Are we so satisfied with our experience, of certain official records that we are prepared to say they should be accepted on their face value without examination? I say that we are not. The experience of members of this party is that a little investigation and probing into some of these so called official documents has revealed that they arc not what they appear on the surface to be. This Government has no right to tamper with the essential principles of justice. In the next following clause, which I mention for the purpose of grouping the subject, the Government proposes to dictate to the courts on the question of bail, although it has formany years been the accepted principle in every British court that the'court shall decide the bail, because it knows the facts, has heard all the evidence, has seen the parties, and takes the responsibility. But this Government, to suit its purpose, which, after all, is political-and I can say that without' offence, because the operations of all governments are political in a certain well known sense--of securing a conviction, says, "" Y o u are not to release the prisoner except on a bail which we fix in advance."" I object to all these things - because they are an invasion of well accepted principles of British justice. I am not so conservative as to say that courts of law are spotless administrators of justice, or that those charged with the administration of justice in the courts are impeccable or always highly capable; but I do say that as the result of centuries of experience there are certain stable principles which have been found vita] to the administration of justice. I suggest that the Government is interfering with a number of those principles in this bill, and that when one reads this clause, with a lively recollection of what is contained in the deportation clauses, one wonders whether the Government has decided to be at once legislator and judge in this country.",99
428,Sir LITTLETON GEOOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-Attorney-General ) [10.20 a.m.]. - The interpretation placed upon clause 4 by the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) was coloured by the word "" sinister,"" which he used at the commencement of his remarks. But there is absolutely nothing sinister in the bill ; its purpose is plain to everybody. The section of the act which is amended by clause 4 provides authority to deal inter aliawith any coloured immigrant who evades an officer, enters the Commonwealth at any place where no officer is stationed, obtains entranceor re-entrance to the Commonwealth by means of false documents, has been admitted temporarily into the Commonwealth and fails to observe the conditions of his admission, or has been admitted into the Commonwealth as an indentured labourer for service in the pearling industry, and is deemed by the Minister to be an undesirable person.",101
429,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Why does the Attorney-General speak of "" coloured "" immigrants? The act does not use that word.",101
430,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Sectio n 5 deals with certain classes of offences, and I speak with a knowledge of the department's, experiences. Proposed sub-section 3A casts upon the person charged with any one of those offences the onus of disproving the averment of the prosecutor. This is essentially necessary ""because knowledge of the facts are in the possession of the accused. He knows whether he has evaded an oflicer or obtained admission to the Commonwealth by the use of forged documents. The law in regard to cases of this kind is that if the averment is made it is deemed to be true u n t i l proof is adduced to the contrary. The existing sub-section 3A , which is. being repealed provides that the personal evidence of the defendant should include a definite statement as to the date and place of his arrival in the Commonwealth, and the name of the vessel by which he travelled to Australia. In an Adelaide case, which was taken to the High Court, Mr Justice Higgins said that the defendant had made a definite statement of the name of the vessel by which he'arrived. Such a statement mightbe uniiileiligible to the interpreter, as it was in the ease I have mentioned, but there, is nothing in the present law to require that such definite statement shall be either intelligible or correct. The intention of the act was that the defendant should be required to make a . truth f u l and intelligible statement, and the, only alteration which the substituted subisection makes is to require that proof itoi the contrary by the personal evidence of the defendant shall not be deemed to - be given unless the evidence states "" t r u l v "" the name of the vessel by which he travelled to Australia, and the date .and place of his arrival in the Commonwealth. Mr E . RILEY - A person may have forgotten those facts.",101
431,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Of course a person may make a mistake. essential, however, that the defendant shall state truly what he does know. Surely that is reasonable. If a person charged under section 5 states, that he arrived by a certain vessel on a given date his evidence can be tested by reference to the passenger list. I ask honourable members to recollect that these proposed sub-sections deal only with people who try to evade the laws and established policy of the Commonwealth, in order to gain admission to Australia or to remain here. The honourable member for Batman also criticized the proposal that the court, when requested so to do by the prosecutor, should grant an adjournment for such time as was considered necessary in order to enable the prosecutor to obtain evidence in rebuttal of that tendered by the defendant. That, the honourable, membersaid, was an interference with the court's discretionary power to grant adjournments. This provision, however, applies only in relation to evidence in. rebuttal. The coast line of Australia is, very extensive, and an undesirable immigrant may enter the Commonwealth at one point, and be found later hundreds of miles away. The experience of the department has been that, i h order to obtain evidence in rebuttal, it has been necessary to send to some outlying portion of the Commonwealth, such - as Darwin . The adjournments granted in such cases have not been for a sufficient length of time to enable the information to be produced. The clause merely requiresthat in such circumstances the court shall grant an adjournment for such time as is necessary.",102
432,Mr BEENNAN,Unknown,"The onus of pfcoof is placed on the defendant, and if. he. denies the charge, how can the further evidence called by the prosecution be called ©viidence in rebuttal?",102
433,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"When the defendant has given his; evidence the onus of proof is transferred to the prosecutor. Proposed sub-section 3c will enable the Crown to make inquiries by telegram from an outlying settlement like Darwin, and. any official documents or telegrams and affidavits sent in reply are,, by that sub-section, made admissible' in evidence. This provision will save delays and expense caused by bringing persons from remote parts of the Commonwealth in order that they may produce documents to be put in It is evidence-no t necessarily conclusive evidence. There is nothing inequitable in that proposal. In fact, I am perfectly certain that, but for the deportation clauses in this bill, the honourable member for Batman would not have professed to discover anything sinister in the measure. Honourable members know perfectly well how often complaints are made in the House about the admission of immigrants of a certain class* or in relation to their continued resi<dence here, in contravention of the law.

But I do not propose to allow the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) to "" gel away with it "" quite so easily as he would wish to do, judging by the speech he has just made. The honourable gentleman commenced his argument by referring to the class of person to whom the clause is said to apply. He spoke of persons who evad'e an officer or who enter the Commonwealth at a place where no officer is stationed. He mentioned other persons, and, incidentally, he said that' the clause relates to the entry of coloured aliens into the Commonwealth. There are two answers to the honourable gentleman's argument. The first is that it is a matter of principle I am discussing, and I am as much oon.fter.ned that the poorest - coloured alien who ever crawled on the soil of Australia should obtain justice, as that justice ishould be done to the most highlyplaced. Efix LITTLETON GEOOM - We all agree with .that. Mr BRENNAN , - As 1 unclerstood the honourable .gentleman, he that in keeping these sly .coloured persons out of .the country, we need not 'greatly cojpcerned .about applying (the) strict principles of the law which should be. applied in the case of white men.",102

The class of persons he may be - perfectly innocent, and able to establish their innocence. It is when they come before the court that I ask. that they should have applied to them the ordinary principles of British justice, as it is sometimes called. In addition the fact that the burden of proof will be on .the defendant, the amendment of the law proposed limits the discretion of the court as to what proof should satisfy it . It is not a matter of detail, but a principle, that I am considering. The broad matter of principle to be considered in this connection is whether this Parliament should dictate to the court what is or is not sufficient evidence in support of any particular charge.",103

For the moment I do not recall a single instance in - which, in a case of a criminal charge, or a quasi-criminal charge, against a defendant, the nature of the offence having been set out, this or any Other parliament has directed the court as to what shall be sufficient evidence to convict, beyond, of course, the ordinary rules of evidence, leaving to the judge or jury the final determination dn the matter with the special knowledge they have of each individual case.",103
438,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I think the honourable member is forgetting the Customs Act , which is particularly severe in this respect. Sir LITTLETON GROOM,-Parliamen t suggested fixes the onus of proof.",103
439,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"v-The onus of proof be is frequently loaded upon the defendant. We know that that was the favourite pastime of the late Government during the war. The scales were always weighted the accused. But it is not because during war time, under the influence of the hysterical emotions which characterized that period, when men who were suphe posed to be calm and judicial became partisans, that course was adopted, that we should repeat such supposed to be legislating in a calmer atmosphere, and when men's minds are no longer inflamed, except perhaps by mentions an all-night sitting. When I point out that the right of the court to give an adjournment should apply equally to the accused and the accuser, the Attorney General says ' ' Yes, but that only relates ' to an application by the Crown i u regard to to evidence in rebuttal.""",103
440,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,The clause does not take away the ordinary discretion of the court to grant an adjournment.,103
441,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Let us face the position fairly. The discretion is taken from the court by this Parliament under this clause. It is of no use for the Attorney General to argue as though he were a magistrate on the bench or a judge hearing evidence. He may some day be in that position-that is in the future, on the lap of the gods. My objection has really not been touched by the argument of the Attorney-General. The thir d point of objection ie as to the admissibility O'f certain documents in evidence. I admitted in my previous observation that I was not clear, and I am not clear now, as to the object of that provision. Ib seemed to me to serve no other than an objectionable purpose, and I therefore objected to it . If it can be shown, and the Attorney-General has not shown it , that the section, as amended, supplies some deficiency in the law which has been discovered in connection with the identification of documents I shall be satisfied. But I put it again to the honourable gentleman that under the law as it stands these documents have always been admissible, coming from the proper source, and have been regarded as what they purport to be, but only on satisfactory proof. Apparently an invitation is addressed - to the court by this clause to relax the law in regard to the identification of documents, and in so far as the law is relaxed injustice may be done. I thank the Attorney-General for the compliment paid to me, inasmuch as my remarks have been replied to by the chief law officer of the Crown, but my objections to the clause remain, and I am entitled to my own view of the intention of the legislature when I see the general effect of the bill. ' Mr WEST (East Sydney) [10.40 a.m.]. - I am satisfied, especially since I heard the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom), that there is a motive behind this clause. If the position is as the honourable gentleman has stated it , why was it not found out until the Government became anxious to prosecute certain persons in connection with a trouble which it is anticipated will take place? The argument of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is based upon his experience in the defence of persons unjustly accused. . The Attorney-General has not had that experience. He has been nearly all his life a Crown Law officer, and his knowledge of the intrigues of prosecutors is not as great as that of the honourable member for Batman. I regard my common sense as equal to legal training in a matter of this kind, and I say that in this legislation we are drifting away from the sound principles of the law under which the prosecutor must submit evidence of guilt, and it is not for the accused person to establish his innocence. That is a principle of British law which is regarded with admiration in other countries. It seems to me that it is proposed, under this clause, to make a telegram or document prima facie evidence against an accused, person. That may be a very serious matter if the Government lays itself out to prosecute any We should be exceedingly careful in legislation of this character. There appears to be an impression in some quarters that the clause, having been drafted by the Crown Law omcers, it is incapable of interpretation by laymen; but if one brings a little common sense to bear upon it, one may detect flaws that should be apparent to the legal mind. It should be our endeavour to frame all legislation of this nature on the sound principles of British justice, which preserve the liberty of the subject. The ' Attorney-General- (Sir Littleton Groom) has never contradicted the statement made in Sydney some time ago that there was no necessity for this measure at all. The bill, it is believed, will be directed against certain individuals associated with the trade union movement. If they have offended against the laws of this country, there is authority in the act to deal with them. It is practically certain that anomalies will occur in hasty legislation of this nature. Even at this late hour, the Government should lay the measure aside. I endorse the view expressed by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). The clause should be struck out. - Clause agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (Deportation of certain persons). Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.50 a.m.] - Histor y indicates clearly that we should be exceedingly careful as regards ' all legislation dealing with the deportation of individuals. It has been shown that there is power in the act to deport any persons who may be regarded as undesirables. Every government has an inherent right to deport persons likely to be a menace to the welfare of the country in which they live, or aliens who are likely to become a burden on the taxpayers. This bill goes much further than that. It is aimed at individuals who are taking a leading part in the trade-union movement. The Labour. party_ stands for the maintenance of constitutional government. Any statement to the .contrary is untrue. We are all responsible men. Most of us have families dependent upon us, and have our savings invested in this country. The bill affirms that any individual, being the one. leader of a trade union, who comes into conflict with constituted authority during a strike, may be regarded as undesirable and deported. I am not an Australian born. I came to this country, I hope, for its good. I have rearpd mv family here. All my interests are in the Commonwealth. I , too, have been a prominent figure in strikes. I am proud to know that I have done what I could to make the conditions of my fellow men better than they were. The last strike in which I . was engaged was the tram strike in Sydney, and I propose to show that, had this measure been in operation then, the government could have deported me.. . . The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN (Mr Bayley) - I suggest that the honourable member should discuss that matter on clause 7. Clause 6 merely proposes to omit sub-section 5 of section 8. Clause agreed to. Clause 7After section 8A of the principal act, the following sections are inserted:"" SAA - (1) If at any time the Governor-' General is of opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth, he may make a proclamation to that effect, which proclamation shall be and remain in force for the purposes of this section until it is revoked hy the Governor General. ""(2) When any such proclamation is in force, the Minister, if he is satisfied that any person not born in Australia has been concerned, in Australia in acts dire'cted towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the transport of goods, or the conveyance of passengers in relation to tradeor commerce with other countries or among the states, or the provision of services by any department or public authority of the' Commonwealth, and that the presence of that person in Australia will be injurious to the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth in relation to matters with respect to which the Parliament has power to make laws, may, by notice in writing, summon the person to appear before a board, at the time specified in the summons and in the manner prescribed, to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth. ""(3) Sub-sections (2), (3), and (4) of section SA of this act shall apply in relation to the board mentioned in the last preceding subsection, "" 8AII. Where any person who was not born in Australia has, at any time, been convicted in Australia of an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth relating to trade and commerce, or conciliation and arbitration, for the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes, and the Minister is satisfied that any of the acts constituting the offence were directed towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the production or transport of goods, or the conveyance of pas-, sengers, or the provision of necessary services, and that the presence of that person in Australia, will be injurious to the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth, the Minister may make an order for his deportation. '. 1",103
442,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter ) [11.0 a.m.]. - This clause is the most important provision in the bill. It deals with industrial matters, and if agreed to by this committee will be severe in its operation. The clause has special reference to in dustrial unions, and no honourable member has been able to prove otherwise, notwithstanding many attempts to make it appear thab it applies only to one or two individuals. I reiterate that this bill , when passed into law, will apply to every industrialist in Australia. Mr FOSTEE , - It will apply to every industrialist who is guilty.",105
443,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is the point that we have to discuss. .Who will be guilty if there is an industrial upheaval? It will be the officer of the particular union that is interfering with transport, and he will be liable to be dealt with under the provisions of this bill. If this law is on the statute-book it must be administered, and, therefore, it will apply to every in dustrial dispute that interferes in any way with the transport or commerce of this country.",105
444,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Not necessarily.,105
445,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member, if he reads the clause, will see that it applies to an industrial trouble ' which interferes in any way with the transport or other services of the states or Commonwealth, and that the officer or officers responsible for the unions are liable, if a proclamation is issued, and if they are other than Australian born, to be deported from this country.",105
446,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,The honourable member does ngt go far enough. Any person who interferes with the well-being of the community may be deported.,105
447,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Does not interference with trade and commerce affect the well-being of the community? I am surprised at the honourable member raising such a quibble. The present shipping trouble must interfere with . trade and commerce, and, therefore, acts against the interests of the community.",105
448,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Supposin g a shipping company were' found guilty ? .. Mr "",CHARLTON -^-Neither the shipping companies nor other employers will be found guilty. I mentioned in my second-reading speech that after years of close connection with ' arbitration-and T have conducted many cases in the A r b i tration Court- I have never known it to be proved, under the definition of strikes ttn«llookouts, that the employers were jreaking the law. It is unfortunate no honourable member on that side of the committee understands industrial matters; if it were otherwise they would not make so many mistakes. There has never been a lockout during the whole period of arbitration. Does the honourable member iior Fremantle not think that the ployers sometimes have done wrong ?",105
449,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I do.,106
450,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,There are faults on both sides.,106
451,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The board may decide that a shipping company is responsible for a dispute.,106
452,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No ; because under the definition of ""lockout"" wrong-doing by an employer cannot be proved, and has never been proved. In my time. I have known of at least 500 industrial disputes, but have never known, a lockout to be proved. There appear in the newspapers from time to time accounts of so-called miners' strikes, which are not miners' strikes at all, but disputes brought about through changes of conditions instituted by employers. It is impossible to prove a lockout.",106
453,Mr WATSON,Unknown,But the board has right to decide.,106
454,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The board has nothing to do with it. It has simply to deal with people sent to them"" by the Government.",106
455,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If a Labour government were in power, would it send an employer before the board?",106
456,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If the Labour party were in power, this class of legislation would not be on the statute-book. If Parlament passes this measure, it will be repealed on the first occasion that Labour obtains office. I firmly believe that, when the people of this country know the meaning of this legislation, they will return the Labour party at the next elections.",106
457,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,The honourable member will know more about that later on. - Mr Charlton - I am not afraid of the result.,106
458,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If a Labour government were in power and this law were on the statute-book, would the honourable member indict a shipping company for rausing trouble?",106
459,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No , I would rethat peal the legislaiaon. Tha honourable' . member has little knowledge: of industrial matters. Many honourable membersi are under the impression that arbitration is intended to prevent industrial disputes, but it was never so intended. The late Mr B. R. Wise, when introducing the emfirst Arbitration Bill, made, it quite clear that it was absolutely impossible: to prevent strikes and lockouts. All that arbitration does is to. minimize strikes.",106
460,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,What is the use of . providing for penalties in the Arbitration Act if they are not imposed ?,106
461,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The Government has to administer the law,, and the honourable member should lodge hiscomplaint with the Government. The fact that there is laxity in respect of our arbitration laws is no reason why we should pass this drastic legislation. An articleon this subject, written by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson);, recently appeared in the newspapers. It certainly shows that the honourable member has little knowledge of industrial matters. Among other things,, he stated!In his speech in Parliament against the. dethe portation provisions; Mr Charlton, the Labour leader, pointed out that if this law had been in operation 30 years ago men like W. M'. Hughes and Joseph Cook, both militant strike leaders in their day, would have been deported. No doubt if they had been, Australia would have managed to rub along all right. But' Mr. Charlton missed the real point. To-day. Australia has a magnificent system of compulsory arbitration, established at the. express desire of the trade unionism' of the country. When "" Bill y "" Hughes was a. strikefomenter we had no arbitration system,, and the strike was the only possiblemeansof offence which badly-used workers had at their command. First of all, the honourable member assumes that because arbitration exists there can be no strikes or lockouts, Then he says that at the time that Mr Hughes was connected with industrial troubles there was no arbitration. Let me tell the honourable member that there was. Mr. Hughes was at one time connected with the waterside workers, and he discussed with me in New South Wales the particulars of a strike. Surely the honourable member will not deny that, statement. I have a thorough knowledge of industrial matters, but the honourable member has lived in the busfy and knows nothing at all about them. It is all very well to write articles, but a lot of people sitting behind a pen know nothing of the subject on which they are writing, I have now something to say about the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) in connection with men being sent before the board after a proclamation has been issued and the Government taken action. There was a time when I listened to the honourable member, believing that he could throw some light on the subject with which he was dealing, but, having heard his speech the other night, I am bound to say that in it he did not touch on the bill, but dealt only - with communism.",106
462,Mr MAXAVELL,Unknown,"Every fact 1 stated was relevant to the bill. Mr Charlton.^-The honourable member is obsessed with communism. He has for some time past been addressing mothers' meetings in his electorate on the subject. This honourable gentleman in former times has stood up for trial by jury, and talked about all that Magna Charta conferred upon the people of this country. This honourable member, in his professional capacity, will accept a brief to defend the criminals of this country.",107
463,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) said that no honourable member had a right to call a man a criminal until he was proven one. I accept briefs to defend men who are charged with offences, not men who have been found guilty. The honourable member is talking nonsense.",107
464,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member is talking a lot of nonsense himself. He appeals to a jury with all the eloquence at his command to convince it that his client is innocent, and he has a perfect right to do so. But from industrial leaders and members of unions, who are endeavouring to do as much for the community as is the honourable member himself, he would take away the right to trial by a jury of their peers. Even the rights conferred by Magna Charta, he says, should not apply to of the kind them. Yet they are industrial unionists, the men whose labour' 'advances this country's welfare.",107
465,Mr MAXAVELL,Unknown,Every man wlm ischarged %vith an offence has not the right to trial by jury.. Mr CHAELTON. - Does the' honourable member contend that industrial leaders should not have the right to trial by jury?,107
466,Mr MAXWEWV,Unknown,I do.,107
467,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Then I must confess that I am more than surprised.,107
468,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,The class of offence provided for in the bill is. not suitable for trial by jury.,107
469,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The honourable member is obsessed with communism.,107
470,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,The leader of the Opposition should read what the Premier of New South Wales (Mr Lang) says about the subject.,107
471,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"And the honourable member for Fawkner should take his gruel like a man. When he was addressing the House the other night, the Speaker had to tell him to come more closely to the bill, but he did not do so. The only thing' he could speak about was communism. Every year since I was a boy I have marched in the Eight Hours procession, and because I did so this year the honourable' member for Fawkner endeavoured to make capital out of it . That is playing the game very low down. I do not mind fair criticism, but when an honourable memberwho occupies such a prominent position as the honourable member for Fawkner will stoop to that sort of thing in an endeavour to gain some political advantage for himself, and to injure me, he reflects upon himself, and not upon me. I think I am known throughout the country a little better than the honourable member for Fawkner, for I have travelled aboiit it a good deal.",107
472,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,This discussion is developing into more of a personal explanation than a discussion of the clause.,107
473,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"We got it all from the honourable member for Fawkner the other night, Mr Bayley, and we are trying to give a little back. The honourable member does not believe that indiistrial unionists should have the right to trial by jury",107
474,Mr MAXAVELL,Unknown,I did not say anything,107
475,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The honourable member said that an industrial unionist who was out on strike should not be tried by jury.,107
476,Mr MAXAVELL,Unknown,I said nothing of the kind. It is not an offence for any one to be out on strike.,107
477,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"But the honourable member desires to deport men for striknfe"".",108
478,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Stay I suggest to the honourable member (or Fawkner that, instead of placing his views before the committee by a series of interjections, he should take an opportunity later of discussing the clause in the ordinary way.",108
479,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable member "" has admitted that workers ' have the - right to strike, which is the very thing that have been contending for. But. although he admits that, he will not give them the right to trial by jury, but desires to compel them to appear before a board, constituted of one man of judicial experience and two laymen, which will have power to deport them. This board would sit in a 'time of great industrial excitement, when the public mind was inflamed, and when prejudice prevailed on every hand. Trade unionists who participate in a strike have done nothing to warrant deportation j and the only offence committed by union leaders, whose union is concerned in a - strike, is that they have led their union in trouble. If these men are to be tried at all, they ought to appear before a jury. I do not know what the British Government will think of legislation of this kind. We belong to the Empire, and yet this Government has the temerity to provide in this bill that men from other parts of the Empire, who xnay have come to Australia when they were two, three, four, or five years of age, and have resided here for thirty years, shall be denied the right to trial by jury on any charge that may be made against them in connection with an industrial dispute. Men who commit serious crimes against society are tried before a jury. Sometimes they are acquitted, and frequently they have only light sentences imposed upon them. Yet honourable members opposite attempt to justify the Government's proposal that trade union leaders who participate in a strike shall be deported. The fact of the matter is that they are acting in this way because they are being forced to do so by outside influences. Not having sufficient foresight, they imagine at this moment that this is the right thing to do. But they will wake up later and realise their mistake. If they agree to this clause, they will inflict grave injustice on the working men's organizations of Australia.",108
480,Mr FOSTEB,Unknown,They will make an effort to save them.,108
481,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If this is the way that they attempt to save, then truly they may say, "" Save us from our friends."" Surely the honourable member does not seriously suggest that it will be in the interests of trade union organizations for the Government to take steps which may result in the deportation of leaders in whom the men have the utmost confithe dence? The provisions of this clause will positively injure the working men's - orI ganizations, and will make great inroads upon the sense of security that our people feel. In making these remarks I have not any particular person in the community in my mind. I am dealing with the general principles that underlie the measure. Most honourable members opposite have attempted, by-interjection or innuendo, to suggest that the provisions of this measure are desired by the Government, in order that it may deport two or three individuals in the community. I say deliberately .that no Parliament can, or should attempt to, legislate to deal with particular individuals. We should consider the possible effect of all proposed legislation upon the community generally. Measures that we pass should be administered with strict impartiality to everybody. The provisions of this bill must apply to everybody, and, therefore, any trade union leader not born in Australia who participates in an industrial dispute concerning which the Government issues a proclamation is liable to be deported from the country. That is a degrading position  ties, for different offences. There is a law for murder; another for stealing; and this one proposes to cover industrial offences.",108
482,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"There is also a law for manslaughter, ancl that is what this measure will amount to, so far as. deported trade union leaders are concerned. I cannot understand how any honourable member opposite can support the bill or justify legislation of this description.  honourable member's own people believe in the provisions of this measure.",108
483,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No doubt, when the honourable member refers to my own people he alludes to supporters of the Labour party. I can inform him quite definitely that I do not know a single Labour leader who supports the bill. If the honourable member cares to hold a few meetings in . any constituency that he selects, he will soon find out what the .people thinkabout it .  later on. Mr Charlton"" - And I have not the slightest doubt about the result. should be 'willing to give the honourable member a picked audience of his own supporters and rely on their verdict, so confident am I . that they would not support the principle that underlies the bill.",108
484,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,There is no principle in it .,109
485,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Some honourable members opposite have suggested that the bill is not intended to apply to industrialists, but the proposed new sub-section SAA makes the position clear beyond doubt. It reads(.1) If at any time the Governor General is of opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth"", he may make a' Proclamation to that effect, which Proclamation shall be and remain in foree for the purposes of this section until it is revoked by the Governor General. (2) When any such Proclamation is in force, the Minister, if he is satisfied that any person not born in Australia has been concerned in Australia in acts directed towards hindering or obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in relation to trade ov commerce with other countries or among the States, or the provision of services by any department or publio authority of the Commonwealth, and that the presence of that person in Australia will be injurious to the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth in relation to matters with respect to which the Parliament has power to make laws, may, by notice in writing, summon the person to appear before a Hoard, at the time specified in the summons and in the manner prescribed; to show cause why he should not be deported from the Commonwealth. There can be ""no doubt whatever that that language has reference to trade unionists. The honourable member for Fawkner had a great deal to say about communists; but I can find no reference whatever in the bill to communists. He also endeavoured to create the impression that the Labour party stands for communism. As a matter of fact, - it is totally against it - communist candidates fought Labour cansition to say that. didates in the recent election in New South Wales.",109
486,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,The communists are the biggest asset the Composite party have.,109
487,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"- The honourable member for Fawkner and some other honourable members opposite have tried to make it appear that I "" am a revolutionary character, jbut everybody knows my views. I think it is despicable that an attempt I should have been made to gain political capital out of my action in marching in the Eight Hours procession. Honourable members who know me will admit that I have always advocated that the workers should adopt constitutional means to remedy their grievances and improve thenconditions. ",109
488,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The effort that has been made to cast the"" stigma of communism on me will ' fail .",109
489,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It certainly will .,109
490,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,When I go into a place where I am not known and deliver an address I am frequently 'told afterwards by. gentlemen whose minds had been poisoned against me that I am altogether a different man from what lhey had pictured.  that your good work stands.,109
491,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am really astounded that the honourable member for 'Fawkner should have endeavoured to malign this party through me because I walked in the Eight Hours procession; but I wish to inform him that I shall continue-to do so, on principle. The honourable member appears to have become quite a different man in the last two or three year9, and his latest effort to gam political capital at my expense is evidence of it . In one breath honourable members opposite' say that they have not the least desire to> injure theworking man. or the industrial movement, and in almost, the next one they support legislation the' sole purpose of which is to bludgeon, the working men into submission to the leaders of big business-in this country. They know very well in their hearts that this bill will not prevent industrial trouble from . occurring. It is aimed solely against the working men.",109
492,Mr COOK,Unknown,"It is an insult to the , and working man for the Leader of the Oppo",109
493,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It is nothing of the kind, for it is impossible to avoid the clear meaning of the language in which the proposed new sub-section 8AA is couched. When the hard facts are brought under the notice of honourable members opposite, they attempt to show that the measure does not mean what it says. The right honourable member for North Sydney { Mr Hughes)-, very . well knew the meaning of this clause, and he intimated that he intended to amend it . I do not propose to do anything of the kind. I shall have nothing to do with legislation of this character. I am opposed to it, lock, .stock, and barrel. No amendment will be moved by honourable members on this side of the chamber. We consider that the measure is totally opposed to the best interests of the country. If honourable members opposite think differently on the matter they, like all men in public positions, must bear the responsibility for their action. We hold very strong views .about the meaning and purpose of this particular clause, and we shall 'take , every opportunity to express them, so that later on the people of this country will have no doubt whatever about where-we stood. I hope that the present industrial dispute will be speedily settled. There are some prospects of it , I am glad to say. But trouble is liable to rise again at any time, particularly in the coal-mining districts of New South Wales, where the men are not paid by the week, or even by the day, but by results. Conditions in collieries vary day by day. A different grade of coal .may be worked; some variation may be found in the nature of the seam; faults mav develop, <or a had roof - may cause trouble. All isorts of things like this occur, and they must be met at the moment. If these men were working by the day or week they would, receive their wages, and there would be no dispute. Honourable members opposite advocate payment by results, but one effect of that system would be that there would be more disputes. If there was a dispute - in my district men like HamMin Lewis, "" Billy "" Brennani, and' others, who are as good citizens as any honourable member in this House, could, under the provisions of this bill, be deported. were sent to jail, and it was a .shame that they should have been, under the Wade Coercion Act. Their only crime was that they were standing by their fellow men in a time of adversity. Under the provisions of this bill they could be torn away from their families and sent out of the country in which they have lived for 25 years. What .would be the effect on the people of this country of action like that? Does the Government think that the great mass of working people would sit idly by and see their representative men taken by the throat, denied trial by jury, and deported from this country? There would be a great upheaval at once if anything like that was attempted, and .it is mainly because I do not want to see such an upheaval that I oppose this measure.",110
494,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Darling Downs-^-Attorney-General) [11.32 a.m.]. - I move That after the word "" time,"" in proposed new sub-section 8AB, the following words be inserted :-- ' whether before or after the commencement of this section, within three years before the notice in writing referred to in this section."" I wish to reply briefly to the remarks of the honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). The honourable gentleman did not correctly interpret the meaning ox effect of clause 7. He stated that the intention was to penalize industrialists, meaning,, presumably, those men who are deeply interested in industrial matters and are working for the welfare of their fellow men. Men who. are legitimately engaged in that field of operations have nothing whatever to fear from this bill, which will, in fact, protect them and legitimate trade unionism. I wish to show exactly what the clause means, so as to check the continual misinterpretation of it. The clausecontains two sections, which I - shall consider separately. The first deals only with cases in which there has arisen in Australia "" a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth."" Thus, in any casewhere the Government is faced with a condition of affairs that threatens the industrial peace of the Commonwealth, - the duty is placed upon the Government of preserving the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth. SecThey tion 8AA provides machinery to enable the Government to cope with such a situation. When such a condition exists a proclamation is to be issued by the executive. The disturbance first takes place, the executive then meets, and if it decides that the situation described in the section has arisen, it may - issue a proclamation, - which is a warning goods to all engaged im industrial turbances that the executive is of opinion that the peace, lorder, or good governthat ment of the Commonwealth is threatened. The next step is that, if it is found a person who was not born in Australia '' 'has been concerned in Australia in directed towards hindering or obstructing, to'fihe prejudice of the public, the transport of goods, or the conveyance of passengers in relation to .trade or commerce with other countries or among the states,"" the executive may take action against him.

Is such a man 'classed among the peaceful industrialists described by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition-me n who, in the true spirit of altruism, are working for the benefit of their fellow men? The clause is directed at the man who, knowing that there are proper laws for the. settlement of industrial disputes, w i l full y, during an industrial disturbance, hinders trade and commerce, and by his actions becomes a menace to the peace, order, or good government of the country in which he resides. Honourable members opposite may disagree with that provision, but I am explaining it so that they may vote with their eyes open. The inherent righ t of self-preservation is possessed by every nation. In one of the cases reported in ap1906 in the Commonwealth Law Reports - Uootelme s v. Brenan-the deportation of an islander was in question. The Chief Justice on that occasion said I ask TasJsow, there can be no doubt that, to use the T of .the .'Judicial - Committee of the Privy Committee in the case - of The Attorney-General for Canada v. Gain and Gillmla, decided on July Inst, "" one of the rights preserved by place. the supreme power in every state is the right the .possito refuse to permit im alien to enter that .to anuex what conditions it pleases to the permission to enter ..it, and to. expel or deport Irom the state, at - pleasure, even .a alien, especially if it considers his prein the state opposed to its peace, order, or good government, or to its social or material is .a .statement .of law as laid down the Privy Council, and it has been than held that we possess those rights.. Then the the Chief Justice quoted from Vattel's The bill Law of Nations, as follows: The power of expulsion is, in truth, but the complement of the power of exclusion. If be prohibited it would seem to follow that the government which has .the power to exclude should have the power to expel the alien Who enters in opposition to its Taws. It is the inherent right of every uation expel from its shores tliose' persons who threaten its existence. Honourable members opposite expel from their party a member who does not agree with themupon a vital matter. Trade unionists expel members of their trade unions, ancl, by their policy of preference to unionists, thereby deny persons so expelled the means of livelihood. not complaining of that, but am merely pointing out that it is a right which honourable members opposite and others possess and exercise. If one of their unions considers that the membership of a certain individual is detrimental to the union to which he belongs, the union expels him.",111
496,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Bu the is given at r i a l first.,112
497,Sir LITTLETONGROOM,Unknown,"I have read criticisms of the kind of trials such men get. I shall not discuss that aspect of the matter, but the trial is certainly uot by a jury .",112
498,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It .is by the .accused - man's peers.,112
499,Sir LITTLETONGROOM,Unknown,"It may be by his peers, but it is not by a jury . What is right ' for the society, the organization, and the club, is right for the highest organism of all, the nation. Therefore the Government is perfectly justified in exercising those powers. The next proposed section relates', not to a period of industrial disturbance, but to normal conditions.. It provides that if a person; within three years before being summoned before the tribunal, had been convicted of ' an - offence against the laws relating to trade and commerce or conciliation and arbitration, and the Minister is satisfied that.any of the acts' constituting the offence were directed' towards hinderingor obstructing, to the prejudice of the public, the production or transport of goods, &c., and that the presence of that person in Australia would prejudice the peace, order, or good government of. the Commonwealth, the Minister may summon that person to appear before a board to show cause why he should not be deported. Where is the justification for the suggestion that this bill is an attempt to burst up unionism and to send out of the country peaceful advocates of industrial organization ? If honourable members opposite will read the bill carefully they will find that it gives to the Government no extreme power. The honourable member for Fawkner has been criticized because of his speech upon the second reading. His arguments at that stage were unanswerable. He contended that if communists, or others who advocate the overthrow by force of society as at present constituted, took advantage' of an industrial disturbI am ance in order to further their nefarious schemes, it would be reasonable and proper to deport them, if they came within the terms of this bill . That was a sound argument, fairly and clearly stated. In regard to the constitution of the proposed tribunal, honourable members charge .the Government with desiring to take away the righ t to trial by jury . The right to trial by jury does not apply to all cases under English law. In other countries persons who advocate the overthrow of society by force are liable to executive action. Mr E . RILEY - The Gommonwealth Executive has power to take action now.",112
500,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"If that, is so, why do honourable members object to stating that power definitely in a statute? Every executive must have power to deal with extraordinary cases, and that is. all that is proposed in this bill. Under Canadian legislation a board of three members is appointed to inquire into all cases relating to undesirable immigrants. In the United States of America, also, there is a n . executive board of, I think , three members. The South A f r i c a n law gives absolute power to the executive, and the Undesirable Immigrants Exclusion Act of New Zealand is exceedingly drastic. Under that act the Attorney-General, if so directed by the Governor in Council, and if he is satisfied that a person is. disaffected, disloyal, or likely to be a source of danger to the peace, order and good government of the Dominion, and has not been resident in the Dom in i o n ' for at least twelve months, may order him to be deported. There the power is vested wholly in the executive. In this bill we are merely asking that the Executive shall be armed with power to do its duty effectively; but it proposes lo constitute an impartial tribunal, to be presided over by a judicial officer, before whom the person charged may state his defence. In that way the Executive is defining its own power in the interests of the public and of the person who may be charged. It is necessary that this executive power should exist for use in time of serious trouble. The proposed new sections are reasonable and necessary for the preservation of the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [11.53 a.m.] - As alj lawyers do, the Attorney-General delights in setting up men of straw and knocking them down again. We do not deny that the Government has executive power to exclude undesirables. The honourable member for Eawkner tried to assist the Government by saying repeatedly that the executive has the right to deport communists who are try: ing to overthrow by force the present order of society. I admit that, but this bill does not relate to communists. Itintroduces a new list of crimes so that industrial leaders who were not born in Australia may be deported. Mr MAXWELL.;-Can communists dealt with under this bill? Mr E. RILEY - I suppose they can, but as the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) pointed out, they can be dealt with under existing legislation. All this talk about communists is mere moonshine.. This legislation is directly related to the dispute in the shipping industry. Why should the Government attempt to make a criminal bf a person not born in Australia, because he happens to be a union leader? If he had been born in Australia he could do anything without risk of deportation; therefore, these proposed sub-sections are class legislation of the worse character, and are directed against people who came from abroad and have helped to build up this country. The honourable member for  able member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell) were originally immigrants, and because of that, if they should become engaged in industrial strife, they might be deported under this bill.  to take the risk along with honourable members opposite. Mr E. RILEY - But why discriminate against Britishers who have helped by their energy, manhood, and money to make the Commonwealth what it is ? The most desperate criminal may not be deported under this proposed law, ancl is it fair to place the leader of a trade union in a worse position than a murderer occupies? My experience is that most union leaders try to prevent strikes, but nevertheless a person who was born abroad and happens to be in a responsible position in his union while it is engaged in an industrial dispute may be deported. If the Government should deport the men who are at the head of the Seamen's Union, Australians will be elected as president ancl - secretary, and the work of the union will continue. A strike cannot be settled or prevented by these methods. Are the native-born better qualified and more intelligent than men who came to Australia from abroad? Amongst thousands of others who have been prominent in Australian, public life, but were not born in Australia, are Sir Joseph Cook, the late Sir George Reid, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), Sir William Irvine, aiid be Mr Andrew Pisher. Will anybody impugn, their good citizenship? Yet, having been born outside the Commonwealth, they could be deported. Mr MANN. - The honourable member knows that the bill does not apply to such as they. Mr E. RILEY - I am indicating what could be done under this proposal. I and the party to which I belong believe in arbitration, but men are only human and not even arbitration will entirely prevent industrial disputes. A strike is often declared in defence of vital principles. Mr MAXWELL^-The Arbitration Court does not prevent industrial disputes; its business is to settle them. - Mr E. RILEY - The first stage is conciliation, and if the parties, meeting round a table cannot compose their differences the matters that remain in dispute are referred to the Arbitration Court for settlement. The whole of the waterside workers of the country have for a long time supported arbitration, and for many years we have had industrial peace. There have been stoppages of work which may be deplored, but that is not a sufficient reason for striking a blow at unionism; or doing away with arbitration. Some honourable members opposite have said that they do not believe in arbitration. In China and in the Dnited States of America arbitration is not provided for, and any one who reads the industrial history of other parts of the world will know that when strikes take place the 'result is bloodshed, destruction of property, and chaos generally. That has never been experienced in this country. I remember that in 1890, when there was a great strike, there was no violence. And there were no deportations. When the leader of the party in the Parliament of Victoria introduced a coercion bill that bill did not settle the strike. Any one who reads political or religious history will agree that every attempt made, by imprisonment or deportation, to suppress the free expression of opinion has proved utterly futile.  laws providing for the exclusion of undesirable persons. Mr E. RILEY - I do not say that we should not have what laws may be necessary to secure order and good government, but how can honourable members justify the introduction of a measure to deal only with industrial leaders? The Attorney-General has said that i i communication with Tasmania were cut off, we should protect the interests of that state. Certainly we should; but if the shipping companies cut off communication with Tasmania because, from their point of view, it was not a paying business, what would the Government do about j t?",112
501,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"The honourable member said, in answer to me, that communists are not mentioned in the clause. Is there any mention of industrial leaders in .the clause ? Mr E. RILEY - Of course there is.",114
502,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Will the honourable member read out the reference to "" in dustrial leaders"" in the clause? Mr E. RILEY - It is not necessary that the bill should set but the name of ah individual to enable us to know who is aimed at. The clause deals with any one who interferes with trade, commerce, or transport services. Whilst I excuse the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell), since he is not a practical man, that should be plain to the honourable member.",114
503,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The honourable member was on a wages board some years ago, and recommended a wage of 10s. 6d. a week. Mr E. RILEY - The honourable member made a name for himself while he was on that wages board. We are all anxious for industrial peace, and I sincerely hope that the strike will shortly be settled. If the bill is passed, and by executive act the Government puts it into operation and deports the whole of the executive omcers of the Seamen's Union who were not born in Australia, do honourable members: opposite think, that, that can have any other effect than to inflame the minds of unionists? If the leaders of unions are taken from their wives-- and families and deported, no one can say what will be the result. I ask the Government to be very careful Before it"" takes action to deport any individual. I have had experience of industrial matters. I have been president of a labour council, and have been in charge of strikes. The last strike in which I was engaged was the tramway strike in New South Wales. At that time the wholeof the trams in Sydney were left standing at a particular hour, and the people had to walk to and from their work. That continued for some weeks. What was the cause of that strike ? The men driving the trams suffered from consumption and other diseases, and they wanted the front of the cars glassed in for their protection. The case was listed before the court, and was the next case to be tried, when the law ceased to operate. The tramway men asked the Premier of the state to extend the operation of. the. law to enable their case to be dealt with. He brushed them aside. They then asked for a special board to. hear their case, but the Premier would have none of it. In the circumstances, that strike was absolutely necessary to enable the men to secure the protection they required. The result of the strike was that every tram car in Sydneyis now glassed in, and the tramway men are protected from the weather. Because we took a strong stand in that case warrants were issued for our arrest. That did not deter us from doing what we proposed to do. We knew that if we were arrested, others would be found to take our place. The history of trade unionism shows that men have always been prepared to make sacrifices in theinterests of the class to which they belonged', and* no benefits have been won for the workers in this, or any other country, except by force and organization.  ber say "" force ""-? Mr E. RILEY - Yes . The benefits enjoyed by workers today were not voluntarily given to them. The force of organization which enabled men to decline to sell their labour, except at their own price, has secured for them the benefits that have been won. If I have only my labour to sell, why should I be coerced, to sell it at less than the price at which I value it? The seamen today are prepared to sign on, providingthe articles which they sign cover their conditions, hours of work, and wages. The employers in the shipping industry will not consent to that. The seamen have a right to the protection of the law. I have no time for some of the tactics that have been adopted, but I say that the seamen are justified in demanding that their interests shall be - protected by having the conditions under which they are asked to work set out in the articles they sign. This is done in every other part of the world. The shipping companies say, and I do not dispute their statement, that they have no intention to reduce the wagee or increase the hours of labour of the seamen; but, if so., all that is necessary to prevent a great .industrial upheaval at the present time is that they should include in the articles which the seamen are asked to sign a copy of the arbitration award, setting out the conditions of their labour. The leaders of the Seamen's Union are compelled to advocate this, because the bulk of the unionists consider it right. If it is just or fair to deport one or two men in a union, why does not the Government propose to go further and deport every member of the union who was not born in this country ? This bill will be stigmatized throughout the Commonwealth as special legislation, intended to aim a deadly blow at the trade union movement. The Government are in this measure creating a new crime, and are proposing to treat in dustrial leaders as we do not treat the greatest criminal in the land. I might be a communist, or an anarchist; I might set fire, to property and cause general destruction, but I could not be deported under this bill. I hope the Governmentwill accept the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, who is prepared to assist ini bringing about industrial peace. Whenever an act of this kind is placed on the statute-book it reacts upon the Government responsible for it . Our whole charter is liberty of speech and action, so long as we do not injure any one else. There svre men in this House interested in combines to regulate trade and commerce. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company regulates the price of sugar and the conditions under which it is imported and exported. There are members of this House who at the present time are trying to regulate the export of wool, which will tie up, to some extent, the trade and eommerco of thocountry. There are men in the corner' opposite who are trying to regulate the export of butter. I would not think of deporting these men. They have a right to sell their commodities in the best market they can get. If they have the right to regulate the commeice in which they are concerned so as to secure fair conditions for themselves, why should we deny to the seamen the right to decline to give their labour - unless the conditions they require are included in the articles they are asked to sign? f hope that very soon an opportunity will be given to the people of this country to pronounce their judgment on this bill.",114
504,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"New England) D-2.13] - listenin g to the speeches of honourable members opposite, I have been reminded of an aphorism by Stephen Leacock, who said, "" A half truth is like a half brick. It is more dangerous than a whole one, because it can be thrown f u r the r ."" Honourable members opposite have indulged in half truths throughout this debate. They have been saying that this bill is a class conscious attack upon the trade union movement in this country. The answer to that charge is to be found in the bill itself. As the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom) has clearly pointed out, the clause under consideration explains ihe whole motive of the measure. The bill is not aimed at a particular type of trade unionist, or at trade unionism. It is aimed at a particular type of i m ported nuisance that has become an absolute menace to the industrial peaco of Australia of late years, practically coincident with the period during which compulsory arbitration has been the policy of this country. The governing portion of the clause under consideration is aa clear as daylight- «, If at any time the Governor General is ol opinion that there exists in Australia a senous industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. That is an absolute safeguard against the terrors honourable members opposite have suggested. The Government has first, to make a recommendation to the Governor General, who will thereupon issue a proclamation which will declare a state of industrial war. If that proclamation is not issued, no one can he deported under this bill . There is the further provision that the Governor General cannot issue such a proclamation unless he is of opinion thab a serious industrial disturbance, and not any trivial disorder - exists. further provided that the ance must threaten, the peace, or good government of the monwealth. Thus there sets of conditions which, in my opinion, amply safeguard trade unionism. only individuals who can be roped in under the governing portion of the clause are those who deliberately defy the arbitration laws, and who by their actions bring about a condition of industrial war throughout Australia. The next of the clause indicates that there can be no attack upon the fundamental ciples of trade unionism. ment will take the extreme step of issuing a proclamation unless the position is so serious as to affect the political thought country, and when a proclamation is in force it can only apply' to persons not born in Australia who may be responsible for bringing about a state of disorder that is interfering with the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers, or the provision of the necessary services. vvill be noted that the offences for which the people, concerned may be indicted are strictly limited, namely, offences and a general strike transport services. It will be almost impossible to inflict punishment other class of' offence. The wealth, I take it, will not be concerned with purely State offences. The bill will deal only with industrial disturbances of an interstate character that are likely to affect seriously the governmental. tions of the Commonwealth. possibility of the provisions of the bill being applied to any alien unless they deliberately defy the Arbitration Court and the Government of the country, and by their actions our transport services inside and outside the Commonwealth. This is the sole objective of the bill. There is no possibility of the men who direct the activities of trade unionism being under the provisions of this bill unless they commit offences of a national character, like the 1917 strike South Wales. That disturbance tically reduced the State to a condition of siege, and it. so aroused the that they came from all parts of the country to fight the organized ,V»:. Thompson. bodies that were responsible for it . There is need for action against imported . It' is agitators, who come to this country, and disturb- after a brief residence in it set themorder, selves to Break down the authority ot Com- our Arbitration Courts. Let me quote are three a statement of Mr J . S. Garden, who had the audacity the other day to The ajiproach the Prime Minister with a request to establish a super-arbitration court for the special benefit of the Seamen's Union. The newspaper report of the meeting of the New South Wales Labour Council on February 24, 1924, portion states:After referring to the Arbitration Court's prin- deregistration of the Amalgamated Printing No Govern- Trades Union, and to its decision regarding night baking, Mr Garden, in his report, added, "" I believe in using the Arbitration Court when industrial it will be of service to me, and that, is very profoundly seldom; but my analysis of the trade union of the movement leads me to state that the Arbitration Court has sapped the vitality of the workers of this country, with the result that the working class is losing its - fighting spirit. The Arbitration Court has been, and is, truly a snare and a delusion, notwithstanding the fact that all unions patronize it . "" That is a definite declaration of war It against the Arbitration Court by a man whose influence on the trade union movement in Australia is unquestioned. The maritime answer to that attack is to be found in involving the record of the court itself. Mr Justice Powers, speaking in the court at Melbourne on the 21st December, 1923, said for any that for the year 1923 the court had Common- settled 600 disputes' and claims. Only one strike had taken place in the .preceding twelve months in a dispute that was within the jurisdiction of the court, and for the seven years up to the end of 1923 func- there had been an average of one There is no strike a year in disputes that were within the jurisdiction of the court. The agitators object of this bill is to preserve this valued institution, which, as I have shown, has done so much for the settleparalyse ment of industrial disturbances. I shall not say much about Mr Walsh at this juncture. It is possible that utterances by honourable members in this House may have an unfortunate effect at the present brought time. I may say, however, that, although he is comparatively a new-comer, he has a-very potent influence on trade unionism in New in Australia'. prac- MT . FENTON - He has been in Australia longer than the honourable member people has.",115
505,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"He is not regarded industrial ' as an Australian in spirit, and he has never shown himself to be in sympathy with true Australian ideals. He has openly flouted the authority of the court,.even in the court itself. Mr Walsh and Mr . Garden are men of the same type. Both are a menace to the industrial life of Australia. Honourable members opnosite cannot have it both ways. If they allow men like Mr Walsh and Mr Garden to entrench, themselves in our industrial life, then they must be prepared ultimately to abandon altogether the principle of compulsory arbitration, in which the people of Australia have every confidence. Mr . Walsh and Mr Garden have a most disruptive influence in the public life of Australia - I cannot understand why members of the Labour party support them, because they really are bitter enemies of that party. Mr Garden has publicly denounced the Labour party as '' rotten and corrupt,'' and as "" a bourgeois party."" The trouble seems to be that Labour members are afraid of the trade unions, which are under .the thumbs of Mr Walsh and Mr Garden. My name has been mentioned in this debate by several' speakers, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Gharlton), in connection with an article which I wrote for the newspapers. Mr . Charlton pointed out that I was wrong when I said that he had missed the point in his speech by stating that if this b i ll had been in operation 30 years ago men like Mr Hughes would have been deported from Australia. ' I pointed out that we had not then this system pf compulsory arbitration, which is the outcome of the activities of the Labour party and trade unionism of that day. I also stated that, had this machinery been in existence, every dispute, no matter what its magnitude, could have been settled by the Arbitration Court. In spite of our costly arbitration system,, we still have industrial, unrest, because men like Mr Walsh arid Mr Garden are defying the courts, and are endeavouring to persuade the workers to be disloyal toi these established institutions. Because honourable gentlemen opposite are afraid to stand up and tell these imported agitators what they really think, honourable members on this side have to do it for them. In return they are misrepresented and slandered. There is the danger that one day all the executive positions in the industrial life of Austraha will be filled by men of the Garden and Walsh type. When that day comes, some good men who occupy seats in this House, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), will have about as much chance of getting into the party as Mr Hughes and Mr Spence would have today. The Labour party, instead of denouncing the Government, should help it to pass the bill, so that it can accept the responsibility of dealing with a particular class of men that honourable members opposite are afraid of and dare not deal with.",116
506,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"Denison) [12.31] The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), in his speech stated that the chief object of the deportation clause was to deal with men of the type of Walsh, Garden and others. He then made use of this phrase, "" Members who are standing up in defence of that class of man."" I inform the honourable member that we do not defend any type of man whose actions are inimical to the interests of the workers and unionists of Australia. We. stand up for honest Australian unionists who render a great service to this country generally. If any men in this country have broken our laws, why does not this Government take its courage in both hands and proceed against them under existing laws? The arm of.the law is long enough and strong enough to punish any person who commits an offence. The Attorney-General in reply to an interjection by myself, referred to the troubles that Tasmania had suffered through the frequent dislocation of its shipping service, and suggested that the bill to a great extent would be a remedy. I have said more than once in this Parliament that shipping is the very life blood of Tasmania, and that as a component part of the Commonwealth that state should receive special consideration, especially in view of its geographical isolation. I should vote for any measure which I thought would improve the Tasmanian shipping service. But I know the temper and spirit which is permeating the Unionist workers of Australia, and I firmly believe that the effect of the deportation clauses in this bill will be opposite to what is intended. In the past we have conceded, to union leaders the right to fight in the interests of their unions, but the clause relating to deportation is undoubtedly in direct contradiction to that concession. What d id this Government do during the last shipping strike?",117
507,Sir LITTLETONGBOOM,Unknown,"It provided a vessel for Tasmania. - Mr OKEEFE - The Government of the day, aa usual, .bungled the situation, before the Tasmanian G ° ' v e r n m e n t steps to maintain the running of cargo vessels. Sir LITTLET ON GBOOM - What has Attorney-General to say against the people who brought about the dislocation of the Tasmanian shipping service? Mr O ' KEEFE - I may differ from the Attorney-General respecting the persons who were responsible for the conditions in Tasmania at that time. There are always two sides to a question. The Commonwealth Government was asked to divert to Hobart a Commonwealth liner on its way out from the Old Country. It was the holiday season, and thousands of inainlanders were stranded either in Tasmania or on the mainland. A f t e r some time had elapsed, and several telegrams had .been sent by myself and other Tasmanian members, the Government agreed to divert the vessel. The tourists in Tasmania paid their own travelling expenses to Hobart to join the vessel there. Meanwhile the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) requested the Commonwealth Government to divert the vessel to Launceston. His request was granted and 'the vessel arrived at the mouth of the Tamar. The' tourists in Tasmania had to rush to Launceston, travel down the river to the ocean, and crowd on small tender boats to embark. weather was rough, and it was certainly by the mercy of Providence that a large number of people were not drowned during embarkation. clause takes away the eight to trial by jury, a right held sacred by every wanker and unionist in Australia for years past. Honourable members on that side isay that they support the clause, but in the same breath they mouth their in terest in the welfare of the .unionists.",117
508,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Many honourable members on this side are unionists. Mr O ' KEEFE - This bill when first introduced contained a provision under which certain pejrsons could be taken secretly at dead of night or at any other time and deported from this country without t r i a l. The Prime Minister then gave notice of an amendment to substitute for that proposal - one providing f o i a board with .power to deal 1 with such persons. It is evident that the bill when first in-troduced was an ill-considered piece of legislation. for under it men could have been deported on the bare word of the Minister. The Gotook vernment realized that that went a little too far for even its supporters, and .so it decided to amend the clause and provide the that the power to deport should be exercised by a board. That board, however, will not be in any sense a properly constited legal tribunal, and it cannot be compared with a judge and j u r y . The Government reserves to itself the right to appoint the two lay members of the board, which at once must destroy confidence in the board's impartiality. I do not think that even honourable members opposite can think for a moment that such a tribunal will suit the free, independent, and justice-loving spirit of our people. The Government has said in effect, "" We must have this deportation power, but ' it will only be used in isolated instances.""' That in itself is a sufficient reason for rejecting the clause. It is nothing more nor less than panic legislation. If it 5s passed it will be repealed by the next Parliament. Honourable members on this side of the committee have been twitted with favouring "" direct action."" As .a matter of fact, the Government has proved beyond doubt that it believes i u that policy. 1 regret that the honourable member for Fawkner has left the chamber, for I wished to say in his hearing a few words in reply to the speech he deThe livered the other night. I must confess that until then I had quite a lot of respect for him. I certainly harboured the delusion that, to some extent-perhap s as The far as his environment would permit i the sympathized with the democracy of this country, and with unionism; but his tirade of abuse the other night completely removed any ideas of that kind from my mind. The one word that he seemed unable to avoid saying was communism. He tried, first of all, to fasten on the Lahotir party the charge that it favoured 'communism, and then he traduced lO.ur leader by accusing him of marching with the communists in the Eight Hours procession in Brisbane. I have been in politics for the last 25 ;years, practically ever since I was a iboy, and I . have always admired those who were opposed to me, provided that T was satisfied that - they were sincere. (I can never again think that the honourable member for Fawkner is sincere. Hit* speech the other night was nothing but absolute and - insufferable humbug. He knew in his heart of hearts that he was paying no regard whatever to the truth when he was addressing the House. We did not expect him to support our politics nor, I think, did he expect us to support his. I am forced to say that when he not was: making his abusive attack upon he. knew damned well that he was telling absolute lies. It was nicely arranged honourable members opposite that he should be the last speaker in the secondThey reading' debate. ' When, he was about to conclude his remarks, the. Prime Minfore, isteistepped in and applied the ""gag.' One result of that was that honourable members on this side of the chamber had no opportunity to reply to his attacks. It was a put up job' and it reflected credit on honourable members who concome nived at it . The honourable member Eawkner said that this measure was signed to deal with communism, but we know perfectly well that its object is to. give power in industrial disputes to' deport trade union leaders. It has been pointed out frequently during the debate that the word "" communism "" does not occur in the bill. It is abundantly that the object, of the Government is deal a severe blow at trade unionists. know that the bill will be passed, for the Government has the numbers; but i will not be very .many months, probably less than a year,, before it will be moved from the statute-book. I am sure that the good sense of our people will quest its repeal without delay, for it is totally subversive of and contrary to the spirit of freedom and independence which pulsates in the great heart of our people.",118
509,Unknown,Unknown,"Sitting suspended from 12.5:7 to 2.15 p.m. (Thursday).  - I listened this morning with a good deal of pleasure to the accents, and pain to the argument, of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. thought Riley). He blamed the Government for introducing legislation which, he said, amounted to intentional discrimination between British-born and native-born Australians. He indicated that the honto orable member for Eawkner (Mr MaxUnionists well), who was then sitting somewhere near me, and myself might conceivably come under the ban. I think that I can speak for the honourable member as well as' myself, and' take any risk that there may be of our deportation under this'bill. The charge that the Government, has intentionally shown discrimination in this - respect cannot be sustained. The only reason why the native-born Australian is served in the same way as the British:us born Australian is that it would be impossible to expect any other country to by accept those persons born on our soil of whom we were anxious to rid ourselves. are our responsibility, and, therewe have some right to expect that men from other countries who have 1 proved themselves a nuisance shall be received back by those countries. Without splitting hairs,, it seems to me that there no is a distinction between Britishers, who to Australia and Australians who for .originally came from Great Britain. deWhile the honourable member for Eawkner and myself may at one time have been spoken of as Scotchmen who came to Aus- tralia, we might fairly be regarded today as Australians who originally came from Scotland. Some honourable members who hail from the Old Country might claim clear more credit for being Australian than to some other honourable members who are We Australians, not because they choee to the be, but because they were born Austrat lians. This bill gives power to the Goreivernment to deport men Avho - come from Great Britain or other countries, and do renot wish to become .good Australians. Many of these people refuse to respect, the laws of this country, and incite others to go to war with society. They do it ostensibly to improve the workers' conditions and remedy grievances for the redress of which constitutional moans, perhaps more liberal than those provided in any other country, are available. I think that it was the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) who said that surely the seaof men or any other unionists should be given the right to sell their labour as they fit. I concede that; but if the unionist determines to take up an individualistic position, he must recognize that that principle cuts two ways, and must allow others, without coercion, sell their labour as they deem proper. cannot, reasonably expect to have the benefit of collective bargaining, and, at the same time, have absolute freedom with regard to the disposal of their labour. At any rate, they cannot have both at one and the same time. If a unionist wishes to act as he thinks fit, he must dissociate himself from the organization that is bargaining for him. It seems to be considered by some of the opponents of the measure that the power to deport is almost new. I have, however, some figures from official statistics which show that during the year ended the SOth June, 1.925, a large number of people were deported from the Gommonwealth. During that year 36 Chinese. 9 Indians, 4 Japanese, 25 Germans, 0 coloured persons other than Chinese, Indians, and Japanese, and 1 Britisher, were deported from our shores because they belonged to prohibited classes or had broken the existing federal law. . In addition to these, two Arabs and one Chinaman were deported for crimes of violence subsequent to their arrival. Pive Britishers and one American were deported because they were convicted, within three years of their arrival i i i Australia, of offences under state laws.",119
510,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"That was done under the existing law.  by the somewhat half-hearted fight honourable members opposite, it seems to me that many of them would welcome the addition to that list of the agitators who do so much harm io unionism in Ausinto the trap set for them. tralia.",120
511,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,Werriwa) [2.23] The honourable member for New England deprecated the argument from this side of the House that the measure sought promote class consciousness. I think that it may be described as a desperate poligood tical manoeuvre on the part of the Governtion ment.,120
512,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"And a very questiondealt able one, too.",120
513,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Quite so. A manoeuvre to extricate theGoveniment from trouble, and to improve the price their political stock. It is a desperate effort, because under the bill an indusplaced trial "" frame-up *' could be easily manienemy pulated. Such tactics are not new in the history of governments opposed to labour, and striving to retain the power that find rapidly slipping from their grip. political record of every country where organized labour is marching forward victory is full of instances of legisto lation of this character. It liberately engineered to produce suitable political psychology to enable those governments to retain, if they have not already lost, control. Although today the party opposite describes the present Government as a composite one, it is the old reactionary Tory party under another name, whose desire always has been to fan the flames of industrial trouble, and use legislation of this character toantagonize and intimidate industrial organizations. By causing turmoil they hope to exjiloit the people. I claim that the first object of this measure is to create industrial unrest.",120
514,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,I call attention to the want of a quorum. [Quorum formed.'],120
515,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I am satisfied thatcases will be "" f r a m e d up "" in order to find the necessary victims to do the work of the Government. The portion of the measure that Ministers are most concerned about is that dealing with the deportation of citizens of this country who may take a certain line of action. The coal upheaval in New South Wales some years ago was deliberately engineered, and legislation was passed for the purpose of creating a suitable political atmosphere for the return to power of by the party opposed to Labour. But the history of that incident should serve as a warning to this Government, since the people on that occasion refused to be led The honourable member for Eawkner (Mr Maxwell) repeated a threadbare story when he spoke of communism.. Honourable members opposite must spea,k with their to tongues in their cheeks when they say that these things are to be done for the of Australia. Under this legislano man will be safe. We have had examples in this country of men being with by secret tribunals, with the result that they have been placed in j a i l , or even deported. Some honourable members may remember the case of an of Australian-born citizen who, at the dead, of night, was taken from his home and in a concentration camp, among subjects, for a period of eight months. It has also been argued that the Government would not attempt to use they harshly the powers conferred by. this The legislation, but if honourable, members were sincere they would admit that the toGovernment already has adequate power deal with any situation that may arise. is deThe real reason for the .introduction of a this measure is that the Government ancl its supporters are in disfavour throughout the country, and desire that there shall he a big industrial upheaval, so that, by appealing to the prejudices of the electors, they may retain control of the Treasury bench. I should like to be informed under what clause a person who preaches anarchy or communism may be deported. The bill provides that for no other act than that of. engaging in an' industrial disturbance can a man be deported. The honourable member for Fawkner spoke of a hidden hand. There is no ambiguity in the language of the bill, nor can there be any doubt that the only persons to whom it applies are the industrialists. Who is to be the judge of the seriousness of an industrial trouble? Is it right to vest that power in a Minister? It is said that the provisions of this bill will ensure that no person born in Australia will be deported for any of the offences mentioned therein, and that, in any case, the only persons who are likely to come within its ambit are aliens; but I point out, that persons born in various parts of the empire - 1 Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and even Great Britain itself-ar e branded as aliens under this bill. Seeing that nearly all the leaders of the trade unions in Australia are Australian born, the only reason for the introduction of this measure is to create industrial turmoil so that the Government and its supporters may be able to arrange a "" frame-up "" for political purposes.' The Government wants propaganda for the next election. The honourable member for Fawkner said that he would not bring these men before a j y > y if some of these dangerous u r e t foreigners to whom he' referred were in danger of deportationj and, by a legal quibble, that action could be prevented, the. honourable member, if the fee were high enough, would use all his eloquence, and practically tear the act to shreds, to retain them in this country. The cry has been raised that for the good of trade unionism those who create industrial disturbances should, be deported. That argument is as old as unionism itself. There have always been some men connected with the trade unions who "" for the good of the organization '' should be deported ! , In this chamber ' the friends of . the trade unions are all ranged on this side. If for example among the friends of trade unions we must include the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), who sits opposite, I say ""' God help trade unionism in this country."" That honourable gentleman by interjection said that the purpose of the bill was to protect trade and commerce, and the community generally. When he speaks of the community the honourable member means only the captains of industry, as his vote on many occasions has clearly shown. It is ridiculous for honourable members' opposite to suggest that this bill has not been framed with the intention of striking a deadly blow at trade unionism, and in an endeavour to deprive hundreds of thousands of worthy Australian citizens of those privileges which they now enjoy as the result of hard work and great sacrifice. I do not think any honourable member would dare to suggest that it has been introduced in order to bring the employers to a better understanding of their responsibility to the community. Any one who has followed the proceedings in our Arbitration Court knows that there is not an instance on record where employers have been punished for causing a lockout. I I miners, for instance, decline, for what may be very good reasons, to commence work they are punished; but if work is. not available because of a lockout, the mine proprietors are not in any way penalized. Officials in control of - governmental activities are sometimes directly responsible for a dislocation of transportservices, and they, too, shoiild be deported ; but this clause is not intended to apply to them - The measure has been introduced by the Government as a last desperate effort-bu t it will prove a vain attempt-to make its position a little more secure. It is a desperate throw of the gambler's dice, and although it is said that it has been submitted with the intention of restoring industrial peace, its main object is to serve the convenience of the Government. Mr F. FRANCIS (Henty) [2.53] - I expressed my views on this measure dur-' trade ing the second-reading debate, and would not. have risen on this occasion had it not been for the statement of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) that a majority of the leaders of trade unionism in Australia are Australian-born citizens. If that is the case, the honourable member should not oppose the deportation provisions of the bill, because they do not affect Australian-born citizens, and therefore it could be applied to only a very small number of the leaders of trad© unionist's in Austraha. The honourable member is not justified in saying that the measure has been introduced merely to strike a blow at trade unionism, because it is not for that purpose. It is merely to protect the interests of the law-abiding section of the community. I am as good a friend of genuine trade unionists as is - any honourable member opposite, and am always willing to give them that consideration to which they are justly entitled. One would gather from the remarks of the honourable member that it was the in tention of the .Government to deport all the leaders in the trade union movement, but, as the honourable member knows, an Australian-born person cannot be deported. No distinction is made in the measure between employee or employer, and it applies only to persons who are considered undesirable, and who have been responsible for interfering with the peace, order, or good government of the country..",120
516,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling ) [ 3 . 0 ] This clause smacks of war-time legislation. It appears to be tainted with that hysteria .which was manifested from time to time during the years i 914-1918. resurrection-of past legislation, a breathing of life into legislation 'that died a natural death. The purpose is to try to draw a red herring before the eyes of the people, and to distract their attention from the barrenness of the Government's ideas, its incapacity, and its extraordinary outlook on matters Australian. The At torney-General (Sir Littleton Groom), in an impassioned speech, called to Heaven to proclaim the necessity for bringing down such a measure. He gave quite a number of more or less incoherent reasons for the speedy passage of the bill . We have endeavoured to find out what the biU means, against whom it is aimed, and when it is to be put into operation. One 'honourable member "" let the cat out of the bag "" when he said, quite frankly, by way of interjection, that it was aimed directly and specifically at one man. If the Government intimated to its that it intended to operate against ono man, I think that we should be told who that man is. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) indicated the desire to bring communists within the provisions of the bill, but he gave no more than a broad hint regarding the persons at whom it is aimed. The Attorney-General, this morning, made the same speech that he made in 1918, when dealing with a measure that contained provisions very closely related to those that are found in this legislation. That measure also was the outcome of the f u t i l it y of the Government, and' its absolute incapacity to prevent industrial trouble, or to settle strikes. It appears that the. usual law court procedure is to be departed from , inasmuch as the services of juries are to be dispensed with. We have not to seek very far for a reason for that proposal. If juries meddled with such matters, the communists, and others against whom this legislation is aimed, might not get thai; brand of justice which the Government desires to mete out to them. Apparently, the justice of the courts is different from that which the Government wishes 'to apply to offenders against this law.. It is somewhat depressing and disconcerting to find in this chamber legal gentlemen, who have had a long experience in constitutional, civil, - and criminal law. failing to protect the people from such an iniquity. Only one member of the bar has spoken against the bill . But whenever ..nere is any dirty It is a work to be done, whenever legal camouflage is required, there are men who are willing to be made, for the time being, political hacks. They are content to be wood and water joeys for the Government in the hope that they may. later, be asked to fill a vacancy in the Cabinet. We find the honourable member for Fawkner pitting himself against the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) in the race for the next portfolio. The way in which the legal members of the Government party have been used during this session has great significance. It makes one think that the Attorney-General may soon be elevated to a higher and more responsible position. If he is, let us hope that his decisions will be more fair and honest, and tinged with a greater measure of justice, than is the bill that he is. now fathering. Under this law anomalies will be created. Look at what caucus might have happened a couple of years ago, when trouble threatened the coal industry. There are Australian-born oflicials in the Workers' Industrial Union of Australia, and there are other officials who are British subjects, 'but born outside Australia. Under the provisions of this bill those who were not fortunate enough to have been born in Australia might in the event of an industrial upheaval, be deported, whilst those who had been horn in Australia would go scot-free. What a travesty of justice! What a futility 1 Yet men, who stand very high in the legal circles of this country, support such legislation! The public life of Australia has reached a pretty pass when men who have been educated at universities, and have gone through a legal course of training, allow themselves to be used as political puppets. A ll coercive legislation is of the butterfly type-it is born today and dies tomorrow. No one recognizes more than the Attorney-General, and the Government, that this legislation will disappear from the statute-booh next year, like other kindergarten legislation that has been passed by the present Administration. In their futility, in their incapacity, they think that this will solve industrial trouble. In the concluding .portion of his remarks, when speaking on the penal clauses of the bill, the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) said. Onr greatest hope lies in the leaders of the different sections of the community, whether they be employers or employees. If they will counsel their followers wisely, and particularly if the leaders of the .working class will come into the open, and denounce those men who are bringing incalculable suffering to tens of thousands of men, . women, and children, a great service will be done to Australia. I have heard a great deal about my duty as Prime Minister to prevent .these industrial heavals, but upon the leaders of industry there is a much greater responsibility. At least once during his speech; the right honourable gentleman was honest. He.recognized the absolute futility and incapacity of the Government to take action to avert a threatened industrial upheaval. That action lies with the representatives of the workers, not the representatives of the wealthy. It is not from the representatives of vested interests (that we can obtain industrial peace. When we ask that a round table conference shall be held to endeavour to bring about industrial peace the hypocrisy of the Government is shown by its .absolutely cold refusal to grant the request. Government does not desire tnat tnere shall be industrial peace in Australia. It is exceedingly curious to find on the opposite benches men, who, in the past have been most bitter in their opposition to the Labour movement, and most loyid to the interests they themselves serve, now protesting their great friendliness to that movement, and their absolute love for its leaders. For instance, the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), in a hurst of benevolence and love for the workers of this country, desires they should free themselves from the fetters of communists, agitators, and such like. But, af ter all, the. right honourable gentleman is hardly in a position to judge. He is a representative of the wealthy classes, and the importing firm of which he is a member has had constant trouble with the workers over matters affecting wages and working conditions. Among other stalwarts of the Labour movement opposite is the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). A couple .of days ago he had a brief given to him for which he will no doubt receive his reward, perhaps not in the actual shape of fees, but possibly in the form of a portfolio, if the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr. Latham) does not get in before him. The honourable member, is a representative 'of the newspaper and metal interests of Australia, and to a great extent of 'the associated banks, but he is not a representative of the shearers, the shed hands, the wool pressers, the seamen, the cooks, or the wharf labourers-the y have not sufficient cash. The honourable member for Kooyong also represents the great financial interests of Australia. Whenup- ever a fight has to be put up in the courts in the interests of shareholders of great combines, he is briefed handsomely to represent them, aaid in - this chamber he is only carrying on the good work. When he is talking here about undermining the interests of the trade union movement and about protecting the workers, one cannot but wonder at his hyprocrisy. The hon represents big importing interests. If it were possible to do so he would kill the great secondary industries of the country. Yet he also claims to be a friend of the worker, and that his one aim in life is to prevent the workers from being misled. The Then we have the honourable member for  the jam interests of Australia, and of the t in interests of the Malay Archipelago. Like quite a' number of honourable members opposite whose names I have mentioned he is a wealthy man. Honourable members have. made their money, but they still have interests which they endeavour to protect to the best of their ability in this chamber. The honourable member for M a r t in is another friend of labour, who, in the in terval between looking after the in terests of the peach peelers, tinners and canners in his factories, lodges libel actions against Labour newspapers There is also the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Duncan-Hughes). He almost converted me recently when I heard him pleading that something should be done to protect the great trade unions of Australia against agitators, foreigners, and communists. He is, of course, representative of the great pastoral industry of South Australia. H is money comes from wool, and quite a lot of it by virtue of the fact that in the early days trade unionism in the pastoral industry was very weak. Thou we have the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Maiming) , who has a brief for the coal "" barons'""' and squatters, whom he is supposed to defend whenever they are attacked. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D . Cameron) is another representative of the pastoral in dustry in Australia. We have also . the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen), who in evading his proper taxation and voting that he should evade it , represents all the wealthy squatters and pastoral in terests of this country. .",122

Every government has a an* right to say who shall be admitted into Ministhe 'country, and th© laws (should be Ausobeyed; but if they are' objectionable either to those who come here from other parts of the world, or to the Anstraliani t is within the rights of the people to offer strenuous opposition to them. The people stand for the White Australia Mr F. FRANCIS - And democracy.",126
558,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"There are different ideas as to what constitutes democracy. It is uot a democratic procedure to deport a citizen. If he breaks the laws of his should be punished according laws, but not deported. I shall if His Excellency to the Governor General gives assent t.o deportation of subjects of His Majesty King George. Thousands of men have come from Eng>recently, and they mostly have progressive ideas. In many instances, I suppose, they have broken the laws of this in fighting, for what they consider their organizations are entitled to. But if they are returned to the country from which they have been encouraged to. miwe shall be offering a great insult to Great Britain. This measure is by no means in harmony with the principles of of democracy. It is safe to assume that the deportation clauses are aimed at the industrial leaders in the seamen's dispute. no No doubt the ship-owners are as much at fault in that matter as the seamen, but At there is no proposal to deal with the They simply flout thelaw. to They have told those who have endeavoured to negotiate for a settlement that Caesar has spoken, and that from his decision there is no appeal. We have reached the stage when the laws that we pass should apply with equal force to all, and not to the industrial leaders only. During the last 30 years I have seen many big struggles in this country, particularly in the pastoral industry; but at no time during those great upheavals was it thought necessary to legislate for the deportation of any one connected with them. The principle of deportation is wrong. Unless a man has been declared an habitual criminal, or is suffering from an incurable disease which he contracted be.fore arriving in this country, he should not be deported. I point out here that hundreds of people have come to Australia suffering from insanity and incurable diseases after having been passed by the doctors on the other side of the world. There should be a strict medical examination of all persons desirous of entering the country. A few weeks ago the case of a man, who, with his wife and three children, had recently arrived in Sydney from England, was brought under my notice. Although he had been passed by the doctors before leaving the Old Country, he developed insanity soon after his arrival, and was - placed in an asylum. His wife was forced to work to maintain herself and her children. The Imperial Government, which allowed that man to leave its shores, should maintain his wife and family until the children have left school. It is claimed by the Government that this bill, When enacted, will give stability in the industrial life of this try, and prevent disputes. Because of the liability to deportation, it is thought that men will not engage further in industrial disputes. But what is. the lesson of history? From time immemorial coercive measures have been introduced to deal with various difficulties, but in every case they have failed; every country that has adopted coercive legislation has bred revolution. The French Revolution was due to the masses of the people being debarred from enjoying any liberty at all. And so with Russia also, where, millions of workers were deprived of the rights or citizenship. In 1904, when the Russian peasantry sought a little political liberty, the brutal Cossacks trained their guns on them, and mowed them down. Men, women, and children were slaughtered until the streets of the cities ran with blood. Honourable members will remember that in 1890, during the maritime strike the militia were called out under [52] Colonel Tom Price, who issued the now historic command to "" Fire low and lay 'em out."" But did that prevent industrial disputes in this country, or subdue our Australian manhood? Again, honourable members will remember the railway strike of 1903, when Mr William Irvine, now Sir William Irvine, the Chief Justice of Victoria, introduced in the State Parliament legislation to jail every railway man who was seen talking to a friend in the street. Those coercive measures have since been removed from the statute-book. The same thing will happen in connection with this bill, if it becomes law. Twelve months hence it will cease to be the law of this country, because the Government, if still in office, will be so ashamed of the measure that it will be repealed. Deportation will not prevent industrial disputes. The only way by which industrial disturbances can be prevented is by bringing the parties together. Disputes can only be settled by conciliatory methods. The Labour party of Australia was responsible for the introduction of arbitration and conciliation laws for the settlement of industrial disputes. Well do I remember the scoffs and the jeers of the people who today are praising the system. That legislation has done more to ensure peace in this country than anything else. When we break away from the principle of arbitration, there will be a revival of the industrial upheavals from which we suffered before such laws were enacted. coun- This Government professes to be sympathetic towards the workers of Australia, but if it continues to proceed along the lines indicated in this bill, I say, "" God help Australia!""",126

As I expected that he, because of his long experience in the courts of this country and his high status in his profession, would give us a wellreasoned, criticism of the bill, I listened attentively to his remarks. Had he so desired, he. could have torn the bill to pieces. He could, at least, have shown us any good points that it contained, but, instead, the honourable gentleman devoted his energies to a long tirade of abuse of the Labour party.",127

565,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,"The honourable member pretends to be a great friend of the workers of Australia. His ability is undoubted, but, unfortunately, we do not benefit a great deal from it, as whenever he speaks it is to attack the Opposition. Of course, this bill will be carried, as Government has the numbers; and, no doubt, it will become law next week. I presume that one of the first acts of the Government then will be to issue warrants for the arrest of a number of men connected with the present shipping trouble. One may safely predict, however, that not one of the ship-owners will be arrested or brought before the board to show cause why he should not be deported. I do not think a representative of any of our big shipping companies will ever be arrested and deported, and, in conclusion, I repeat that the bill is unwarranted, undesirable, and an absolute disgrace to the Government of this country. I trust that the next Government, whether it consists of members of the Labour party, the Nationalist party, or Country party, will have the decency to wipe out this almost indelible blot which is being placed on the statute-book by the' present Administration.",128
566,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [4.1] - I wish to place on record my opinion concerning the important phase of the bill with which we are now dealing. I have listened today to the speeches of one or two honourable members opposite, which have consisted, in the main, of wretched clap-trap and utter nonsense, such as no self-respecting man should be asked to listen to. We have been told today, for instance, that there is a strong tendency on the part of the Government to engineer industrial disputes, and create what the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) terms ""frame-ups,"" merely for political purposes. Those who are alleged to be guilty of assisting in such treacherous deeds are said to be on this side of the chamber. Such statements are absolutely false, and every honourable member opposite knows it. There is not a shadow of truth in any statements of honourable members opposite to the effect that an attempt is being made to engineer industrial disputes in order, as they say, to ensure the safety of the Government. We do not wish to go back and experience the conditions which existed when Labour had to fight so strenuously for its rights. No one will dispute the rights of Labour, or attempt to deprive unionists.of the privileges and conditions which they now enjoy as the result of strenuous effort and self-sacrificing devothe tion to a. just cause. But, unfortunately, political, economy has been cast to the winds by the present Labour party. We have been informed that this bill has been submitted with the sole intention of destroying unionism and deporting all its leaders. Honourable members opposite know that that is untrue. No sane man would attempt, to destroy unionism, or deprive Labour of its rights. The conditions which unionists enjoy today have been won after a great struggle.",128
567,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,Does the honourable member employ unionists in his store at Quorn ?,128
568,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I never ask my employees whether they are unionists or not. I believe in every man having his own opinions, and in engaging employees, whether in my business or on my farm, I pay regard only to their character and ability to perform the duties they are to undertake. It cannot be said that I do. not treat my employees well.",128
569,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,Does the honourable member pay them good wages?,128
570,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I do. I can recall the time when investigations were made into the conditions under which my employees were working. On one occasion a union representative made certain inquiries, and after he had .concluded he said, ""For God's sake leave that man alone, because if all employers were as good there would be no need for organizers or agitators."" Mr YATES.'-Does the honourable mem-, ber employ any of the Barwell boys ?",128
571,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"No ; I wish I did. I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the honourable member for Adelaide on the wonderful improvement he has made during the last two years. He is enlarging his circle of friends and widening the sphere of his in fluence. I do not wish the honourable member ' to go back to the miry clay, the horrible pit, and I trust that he will remember that by this bill the Government is endeavouring to bring the Labour party into a position of safety. It is an earnest attempt on the part of the Government to place the Labour party on a solid foundation. I desire to remind the honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCNeill) that no attempt can be made under this measure to deprive any Australian citizen of his rights or of his liberty to speak on behalf of others. The purport of the measure has been clearly explained by the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom), and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr . Latham). The bill has been conceived in the interests of Labour, and will be the salvation of unionism. I believe that from 80 per cent, to 90 per cent, of the members of the Labour party ara earnestly praying that this measure will be passed, as any action taken under it will undoubtedly be in the interests of the Labour party. It is ridiculous to suggest that an attempt is being made to destroy unionism.",129
572,Mr YATES,Unknown,It is true.,129
573,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,The honourable member for Adelaide should not spoil his reputation. I am hoping that he will not return to the wilderness. The TEMPORARY (Mr M a n n ) - I ask the honourable member not to be diverted from the bill by interjections.,129
574,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"The object of the bill is to protect our national life and to preserve the industries of this country. Members of the Labour party in South Australia have asked me if some action could not be taken in the Federal Parliament on their behalf, as they could not save themselves. Honourable members opposite are everlastingly speaking of the - necessity of building up our secondary industries. There is not the slightest hops of that being done u n t i l a measure such as this is passed and power is taken to deal with industrial wreckers. Apparently aii unseen hand is influencing honourable members opposite, who know what they ought to do, but are afraid to act according to the dictates of their conscience. They know who is responsible for the industrial unrest which is so rampant, and which is causing unemployment, poverty, and hardship on every hand. Many of their speeches have been moderate, and,' fortunately, we have not heard tirades such as heard in the Domain in Sydney or on the Yarra bank in Melbourne. If the present industrial condition is allowed to continue we will be on the verge of national disaster.",129
575,Mr MCNEILL,Unknown,Does the honourable member think thab deportation will meet the situation?,129
576,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I . do. We are only proposing to do what other governments have already done. A drought year like 1914 would put Australia in such a position that there would be no need to appeal for peace industrially, because the community would be full y occupied in earning sufficient to buy even bread and cheese. This is a great financial question. Honourable members opposite speak as though, by ruining the capital that is employed for productive purposes, they can r u in the men who earn it . That is not possible without bringing corresponding r u in to every interest in the community, in which case the greatest sufferers would be those where capital is bone and muscle. It has been said that this is a dangerous law. It is on the statutebooks of other countries, but has not been used in a ridiculous way. Particularly in free and fair Australia, no body of men would exercise these provisions except in an extreme crisis, because the community would not stand it . Thank CHAIRMAN God that the people of Australia are of British descent, and will not support any socialistic and communistic destroyers. I admit the possibility of wrecking our industries and arresting our development. If industrial upheavals do not cease, a drought year will bring many homes very near to the bread line. Eighty per cent, of the working men are praying night ancl day that the bill will pass, and that it will be the means of permanently restoring industrial peace to Australia.",129
577,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [4.20] - It would be impossible to give a greater exhibition of calamity-howling than thar of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster). Nobody will be deceived by his eleventh-hour profession of a desire to support democratic principles. His record is too well known. In South Australia he is regarded as one of the most reactionary tories in the Commonwealth. In view of the honourable member's profession of a desire to serve the welfare of the workers and to further their interests, it is interesting to study his record as a Minister in a South Australian Cabinet. The conditions that he imposed upon the railway men of that state gained him the reputation of being the hardest taskmaster that they had ever had.",130
578,Mr FOSTEB,Unknown,There is not a word of truth in that statement.,130
579,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,I ask that that remark be withdrawn.,130
580,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," The honourable member for Hindmarsh having taken exception to the remark, the honourable member for Wakefield must withdraw it.",130
581,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I withdraw, but that the statement of the honourable member is contrary to fact.",130
582,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I worked in the railway workshops in South Australia for five years, and I know exactly the feeling regarding the honourable member that is held there, and throughout the railway service generally. Let me show the inconsistency of this great disciple of democratic principles. I asked him whether his employees were members of a union. He said he did not know whether they were or not, and, further, that the matter did not worry him. He said he recognized that they had a perfect right to freedom of thought in union and political matters. Yet he is prepared to support a bill making it possible to deport men from Australia because they have certain industrial and political beliefs. How can the honourable member reconcile his attitude with his professions? He and many other persons are willing to aid and abet the Government to trespass upon, a cardinal and fundamental principle of British justice, and the rules which govern the conduct of our judiciary. We have the right to expect that anybody who has committed either a criminal or a civil misdemeanour shall be tried by a jury, and have the opportunity to answer any charge that is made against him. This bill does not afford that opportunity. It is rather anomalous that some honourable gentlemen who occupy leading positions at the bar in the Commonwealth should adopt towards this proposal an attitude that is totally inconsistent with the rules of their profession. The only conclusion that one can come to is that their political bias outweighs their better judgment. That which we most cherish in our Australian citizenship is freedom of thought and action in social, political, industrial and religious matters. Honourable members opposite would deprive citizens of Australia of the right to answer any faked charge that is laid against them, when the political advantage of those who happen to be in power may be affected. Who is endeavouring at the present time to foment industrial strife? The members of the Government, the ship-owners and those who are allied with them in commerce and trade, desire to precipitate a crisis in order to prepare the way for a further lease of power in the Commonwealth I say Parliament. I notice that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is leaving the chamber. I warn him that I am about to say something regarding his attitude in this matter. Who have made all the overtures for industrial peace? From first to last those who represent the great industrial and political organizations of labour have strained evtry nerve to bring about a settlement, but not a single endeavour has been made by the Government or those who represent the ship-owners, the Chambers of Commerce, or the Chamber of Manufactures. The action of the Government and of those who support it has merely accentuated the difficulties that confront Australia industrially today. The federated shipowners were directly responsible for precipitating the trouble, by .obtaining the deregistration of the Seamen's Union. From that point a constant endeavour has been made to incite the various trade organizations to take the drastic action of engaging in an industrial upheaval. The responsibility cannot be laid at the door of the Labour party; the trouble has been entirely caused by those who represent big employing interests, particularly their representatives in the Government. The opinion I have formed is supported by the Sunday Times, one of the leading journals of the Commonwealth. This journal has a wide circulation in Sydney, * - ---. and its opinions are always received with respect, because ' they largely interpret the views of the people of Sydney. a leading article published on the 12th July last it said: Faced with the responsibility of explaining to Parliament and to the people of the Commonwealth the reasons which inspired the latest attempt to introduce the power of deportation into Australian industrial law, the members of the Federal Government have given unconvincing replies. Out of the maze of verbiage that has been resorted to_ emerges an - underlying desire to be rid of certain people who have achieved positions of authority and influence in the counsels of industrial organization. No Government ever had a weaker case in support of a proposal which strikes at the very root of industrial freedom. Attempts to stifle the legitimate aspirations of industrial organizations, which are born nf the very freedom which is the proudest boast of our Australian citizenship, are as futile as the efforts of the mythical person who tried to defy the incoming tide with the household broom. It must not be forgotten that these positions, of industrial leadership cannot be deliberately stolen from the organizations, as a pickpocket would lift a wallet of notes from an unsuspecting victim. They must be, and are, won in more or less open contest against rival, and often far saner, factions. But to say that leaders thus chosen should be deported from Australia because they carry out the policy of those who elect them is tantamount to saying that the law of deportation should operate against all who assist to make them leaders. And that, of course, is an absurdity. The power of deportation can never be taken from the executive authority of any country. It must remain always a part of the highest judicial functions of the Commonwealth. To incorporate it in the purely domestic machinery of arbitration law is, - however, a fatal mistake. At best it iB an admission of failure in a field of governmental activity which hitherto it has been the boast of Australia that we have been able to make a pattern for the world. We must find a better means of punishing industrial crimes if we are to evolve anything like industrial peace and the permanency of acceptable conditions of employment. The trouble aibout most - of the efforts we make to devise laws for the settlement of industrial disputes is that we are too prone to brand as crimes efforts that are made with the most laudable idea of improving the general conditions of the workers.",130
583,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,That is not newspaper condemning the action of the Government.,131
584,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Q u it e true. The view taken by the Sunday Times is that held by the vast majority of the people of Australia, and sums up the position correctly. It shows that the Government has been wanting in administrative capacity and in its desire to maintain the best interests of the Commonwealth or further In its welfare. As the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), the paragon . of political virtue, the man who is without sin or blemish, is now in his place, I shall show the extent of his consistency. The honourable member, who is always so keen, and who is as pure as the lily in affairs political, the other night gave expression to his friendship for tradeunionism. He said that he had always been friendly towards trade unionism, but his record in 1897 is rather interesting reading.",131
585,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Let us have it .,131
586,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"In August, 1897, the honourable member was chairman of a board appointed to determine the wages of white workers. He had then an opportunity to show his sympathy for the workers in that industry, who we know were being sweated. He had an opportunity to vote - to fix the pay for white workers making night dresses at 16s. Yet, according to a report which appeared in the Argus on the 27th August, 1897, he voted with the employers to fix the rate at 14s.",131
587,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,The honourable member is giving a complete misrepresentation of the position.,131
588,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"It is rather significant that no issue of the Argus during the month of August, 1897, contains a statement by the honourable member challenging the correctness of this report, which' is a true and f a it h f u l representation of the attitude of the honourable member towards trade unionism at that time. I am satisfied that after his speech the other night the honourable member has in mind the briefs he is likely to get from the Employers Federation in its fight against the workers.",131
589,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Is this sort of thing to be tolerated in a civilized community?,131
590,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"F o r the benefit of the honourable member, and to show whether I am telling the truth or whether the honourable member is doing eo, I shall the only quote the Argus report to which I have referred.",131
591,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. The honourable member is making a complete misrepresentation of the fact* Is it to be tolerated ?,131
592,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, During the course of this debate a great deal of latitude has been .allowed. The Standing Orders only - prevent honourable members from quoting :from current records relating to the debate. The honourable member presently have ample opportunity to - refute any charges levelled against him. .. Mr MAKIN - It is quite evident that the honourable member cannot stand criti cism that rightly comes to him. He is displaying .cowardice in not standing up to his gruel.,132
593,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"I heard that during my absence last night I had been attacked - by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) on the same matter, and I propose when I become possessed of the facts ""to make a statement concerning them.",132
594,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"The attitude of the honourable member and others associated with him clearly indicates that their professions of friendship for those who are associated with trade unionism are ill founded. It is a direct insult to the workers to challenge their leadership. If we were to challenge the righ t of the 'Chamber of Commerce, or the Chamber iof Manufactures, or the National party 'to select its leaders, or if we weie to say rthat their chosen leaders should be changed ton the ground that they did not represent the views of those who elect them, we - should rightly be told to mind our own 'business. In the same way I tell honourable members opposite to mind their own nusiness, and allow the workers to determine for themselves who their leaders shall be. We can get along without the advice or - sympathy of honourable members opposite, ;and at the proper time we shall see a .government in power in Australia which - will be. truly representative of the interests of those engaged in industry, and of those who are associated in all .forms of wealth production in this great - Commonwealth of ours.",132
595,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [4.44] It is quite a common practice with those who are devoid of arguments on the merits of a case to attack the personality of those who are supporting arguments to which they are opposed. It is one of the commonest of devices to attack the legal profession, which is a favourite target for the revolutionary or any person who for the moment happens to be opposed to the enforcement of an existing or the passing of an intended law. This method of procedure .makes one. smile when one remembers .that probably every honourable member has a legal adviser of his own, whom he is prepared to trust to the utmost with his private affairs. I am will proud of the profession to which I have the honour to belong, and of the standards which it observes. It is the only profession from which a member may be excluded by legal measures for dishonourable conduct or misbehaviour. The honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), have paid the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) and me the compliment of suggesting 'that we, in some way, represent r'the interests of wealthy clients who belong to the employing classes. Those - who are accustomed to the practice of the courts, or .are acquainted .in any way with the - practice of either the honourable member for Fawkner or myself, must be amused at such a suggestion. The services of a member of the bar are at the disposal of any member of the public, whether that member of the public be popular or otherwise. Let me point out that the honourable member for Fawkner appeared, some time ago, in the Colin Ross case, for a most unpopular man, and thereby imperilled his own political welfare.",132
596,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,Because he was paid well for it ; not because of any sympathy with Ross.,132
597,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,": He did it because it is the duty of a member of the bar to appear for any client and to procure for M m justice according to law. Members of the profession, when appearing in the courts, forget their politics entirely. Politics have nothing to do with the administration of justice in the courts, whether one regards judges or reputable members of the legal profession. Reference having also been made to some of my personal actions which are more or less before the committee, I may say that I appeared in the Arbitratio n Court to support the application of the Commonwealth. Steamship Owners' Federation for the dferegistration of the Seamen's Union, and, in doing so, I was-securing the administration of the law in relation to that matter. But at about the same time. I also appeared in court for that well-known person, Mr Thomas Walsh, for whom I had previously appeared. I appeared for him upon his appeal to the H i gh Court, against the convictions recorded against him by a magistrate in Meland bourne-. I did my best for my client, and,, so far as I am aware, he is not satisfied in any way with my efforts his behalf, nor does he think that the force and vigour of my arguments before the court were affected in the slightest degree by my political opinions, which, Liberal administration. I frankly say, are by no means idenablemembers tical with those of Mr Walsh. Since is a matter of common knowledge members of the bar are under an obligation to appear, not only for popular, but also for unpopular persons, and to that justice is done in every case according to the law, excluding all considerations politics and all matters otlier than pure administration of justice, it is really remarkable to hear honourable membersmen of experience' - suggesting that members of the bar in this chamber are in some way particularly identified with the interests of one set of clients. have all kinds of clients. I appear readily and frequently for both unions and for employers. But I reserve myself complete liberty to express my political opinions in this House irrespecthat tive of the interests, financial, industrial or otherwise, of any client who chooses to employ me. It will be a sad day for community when members of the legal of this country? profession let their political views affect their attitude towards clients with political opinions they happen to disagree. I suggest that the attack made upon members of the legal profession the honourable members for Darling and Hindmarsh show that those honourable members have no argument on. the merits of the case, but are content to abuse their opponents. All honourable members, think it can be fairly said, are here to uphold what they honestly regard as the interests of the community, and not of a particular section of it . I certainly take that stand, and that only, and I regard the clause now before the committee as necessary in the interests of the people as a whole. I also desire to mention the statement frequently made from the other side, that the Labour party was responeffort sible for the Arbitration Act . Surely nowhen body with the slightest, even the most opposite superficial, acquaintance with the history of Australia since the establishment the Gommonwealth, can fail to know that the Arbitration Act was substantially work of Mr Deakin, assisted by Mr . Kingston. It was passed in the year 1904, was responsible for some very in teresting and important political crisesat disthat time. The Labour party was for on a short period in power, but it did not originate the measure, and was not responsible for it . It is a Liberal measure, designed, introduced, and enacted by a Surely honoropposite are sufficiently it acquainted with the history of the Com*that monwealtb to be aware of that.",132
598,Mr WATKI NS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [4.55""| see It is amusing to hear the declaration of honourable members opposite-, of that Labour was not responsible for the the Arbitration Act. As one who took part in the initia l steps towards the establishment of compulsory arbitration, I wish to inform the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) that legislative provision for it was first made by a Liberal We administration in New South Wales, solely because of the support received at that time from the Labour party in the to Parliament of that state. Support was given in exchange for concessions, and was why the Beid administration .waskept in office. Where, therefore, is the ground for the claim that a Liberal adthe ministration gave arbitration to the people",133
599,Mr GKEGOBY,Unknown,The honourable member whose knows very well that it did .,133
600,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"The honourable member is quite wrong. The Liberal adminisby tration that passed the New South Wales measure did it for the sake of office, and office alone. The employers would not meet the unions for the settlement of disputes,, and the whole idea of compulsory I arbitration sprang from the Labour party in the state from which I come. It is late in the day for honourable members opposite to claim that they are the fathers and"" champions of this progressive legislation. They opposed it in those days, just as they voted for black labour, and for everything, that was bad in this country. Historywill repeat itself. The present proposal is purely panic legislation. There was no to introduce a measure such as this contractors belonging to the p a r t y built the "" c of f in "" ships. Large Bums were paid out, but the Nationalist of Government did not demand a< return of. any of that money after the contractors the had been found guilty of defrauding the people. Why was not legislation in t r o duced to deport the guilty parties in that case? It is useless to imagine that legislation of this description will intimidate the trade unionists of Australia. Those who understand the psychology of Labour know that the working men of Australia cannot be frightened by a mere pretence such as the present bill. Legislation of this nature will fan industrial turmoil, instead of bringing about a peaceful settleheld ment of it . It will merely aggravate the main body of the unionists who, perhaps, do not agree with the leaders in the present dispute, and that is where the danger of the bill lies. In this enlightened age disagreements between labour and capital should be settled by a mutual and intelligent exchange of ideas by the bodies most concerned. The Labour party has tried to show that it is not on the side of law breakers. These should be tried under the laws of the country, and not dealt with by a system that is centuries old, and was used for crushing the workers in the Old Country. I appeal to the Government to abandon this proposal, which cannot result in peace, but on the contrary must promote industrial war. The Ministry should have dealt the parties to the present dispute under the power that the Prime Minister had at his command, and thus prevented the trouble from reaching its present stage. Honourable members should realise that the members of the Seamen's Union are distributed among vessels which are found in all the seas surrounding Australia, and that it is difficult for them to control the affairs of their union. But they are mistaken if they think that men will be brought to submission by the methods that were adopted in ' England many years ago, and which resulted in men being deported for shooting a rabbit or for daring to quarrel with their employers. The bill refers to those who prevent trade and commerce; it is, no doubt, aimed at those engaged in the coasting trade of this country. The Government does not intend to deport the profiteers of the country, who bled the parents of the men who died for them on the battlefields during the late war; the measure is being introduced with the one object of suppressing trade unionism. Have honourable members opposite endeavoured to place themselves in the position of a man who has the shadow of deportation over him ? The existing legis:Vfr: Watkins lation gives the Government sufficient power to deal with any law-breakers in our midst; but it prefers to use brute force. I charge the Government with having attempted to evade its responsibility. The legislation which gave the Government the power to deport certain persons carried with it certain responsibilities, as the Government itself, was responsible for deporting any person. Under this bill, the Government seeks to evade that responsibility by transferring it to a board. How will this board be constituted? Will it be a board of military officers for whom jobs must be found? Whatever its constitution, the Government will hide behind it. We on this side contend that persons who break the laws of the country should be adequately punished, but not before they have been tried and found guilty by a jury of their peers. This is purely panic legislation, which will hang' as a pall over the people of this country. No government of a free country is worthy to remain in office if it fails to grapple in a reasonable way with a situation such as that which now confronts with us, but prefers, instead, to introduce coercive legislation to attain its selfish ends.",133
601,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"Eawkner) [5.6] - It is gratifying to me to find that the speech which I delivered the other night on this bill has excited so much interest among members of the Opposition. The attention which they gave to my remarks was, however, inadequate, as they have completely misunderstood their purport. As the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr. Latham) has said, honourable members opposite are themselves so bankrupt of argument that they have attacked me personally. From my knowledge of honourable members opposite, I am convinced that only three or four of them would be capable of making such an attack on me as that made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin). Later, when I have the facts before me, I propose, with the consent of the House, to make a personal explanation regarding the charge that I had voted to restrict to 14s. a week the wages of girls engaged in the whitework trade. I claim that I have always been a friend of the workers. On the 4th September next I shall have completed 50 years of residence in Melbourne, and I defy any one-eve n my most bitter enemy, the man who uses every opportunity to decry me and m y actionsto prove anything to the contrary. I challenge the honourable for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) to point to one word or one act of mine during those which would indicate that I have not always been in full sympathy with the working class.",134

603,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"H o n o r a b l e members surely do not expect me, after the lapse of 28 yearsj to deal in detail with this matter at this stage; before I do so, I want to have chapter and verse for all thab I shall say. A f t e r I have, with the consent of the House, made a personal explanation, I shall be quite prepared to allow honourable members opposite-who , with the exception of two or three, I believe are possessed of unbiased minds in the matterto judge whether or not the charge is well founded. My attitude in connection with this bill has been either misunderstood or w i l f u l ly misrepresented. Even the honourable member for Wannon (Mr MCNeill), who usually is very fair-minded, when speaking just nOw with great restraint, showed that he completely misunderstood the purport of my remarks the other night. I have been charged with having associated the Australian Labour party with communists, and with saying that the Labour party is sympathetic towards communism. address the other night was all directed to show that the Australian Labour party is not communistic; that it had deliberately adopted constitutional methods as the means of achieving its objective, and was doing everything that could reasonably be expected to shake itself free from the vampire of communism. quoted the Australian Worker as representing the views of trade unionists i Australia, and as showing the abhorrence with which communism was regarded by legitimate trade unionism in Australia. pointed out, also, that, in spite of the discussion. most strenuous efforts on the part of trade unionists, the communists have succeeded Bamford) - Honourable members in gaining an entry to every trade union in the country.",135
604,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,The unionists do not ask the political opinions of their prospective members. Their unions are formed for an entirely different purpose.,135

606,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,The honourable member cannot prove any control from Moscow.,135
607,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,"I can. Does the honourable honourable member suggest that the communist party in every country where it has gained a footing is not in touch with the Third International at Moscow, and. directed from there? I say that the communists, realizing that trade unionism is the greatest obstacle between them and the achievement of their revolutionary objective, have deliberately adopted the policy of establishing themselves in every trade union, not for the purpose of forwarding the interests of its members, but to capture it in the interests of communism. That is the declared policy of the communists. Why has trade unionism in Australia adopted an attitude which is opposed to communism? Do honourable members opposite endorse the opinion expressed in the Sydney Worker of the 10th March, 1923, which I quoted the other evening? Do they believe that the communist leaders in Australia signed a, false declaration for the purpose of gaining admission to the Australian Labour party conference? Do they agree that the communists have unhesitatingly resorted to subterfuge at the bidding of foreign masters? Do they know that the Australian Labour party repuMy diates with loathing the principles of terrorism that are inculcated by communists'? I have given the opinion of the official organ of what is admitted to be the most powerful Labour organization, or trade union, in Australia. I ask honourable members opposite whether or not they endorse those views. I Mr A . GBEEN - I rise to a point of n order.

Why? at Because he knows that his 'party is indidependent to a large extent for its the support upon those who have these n tendencies, and who hold these ideals. The Leader of the Opposition has not yet satisfactorily explained how it was that on the 4th May last he marched at the head of a procession in Brisbane. interjecting, What was his explanation? He said, "" Oh, it has always been my custom <to do that."" He went on to say that he had been working in the interests of unionists all his life, and that it was an Eight Hours Day procession. It was nothing of the kind. The procession led by the Leader of the.

Communists do not recognize the authority of any law passed here or in any other country. They say, "" The law. be hanged; we do not recognize the authority of any law."" Honourable members opposite speak of the betterment of the working classes and the necessity of legislation to improve their conditions. But the communists say that such is a dream and a delusion, and that the working masses will never obtain any advantage by legislation with in the capitalistic state. They tell us that deliberately and distinctly. There may be men in our midst who would favour a revolution, or incite working men to such a degree that they would be prepared to rise and take by force that which they thought they ought to have; but the Leader of the Opposition and those supporting him say that such men should not be deported, but should be tried by a j u r y . The Labour party and thetrade union movement in Australia have done their very utmost to get r i d of this revolutionary element. This bill provides that if a man is holding revolutionary ideas and is doing his dirty and_ deadly work within the Labour party or the trade union movement, the Government shall have the power to take him by the scruff of the neck, so to speak, and compel him to leave the country.

I also ask the honourable member for Hume to confine himself to the niotion, and not toreflect upon the conduct of in dividual members.  be permitted to refer to the arguments that were used by the honourable member for Fawkner. As a matter of fact, the honourable member answered himself. He confessed that he was obsessed with this matter of communism. Honourable members opposite must realise what that stateGROOM) ment means. We believe the honourable member. If he uses in the law courts arguments similar to those which he uses in this chamber I can understand the reason for his declining success in that, sphere. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) the other day, when speaking about communists, supplied an answer to the honourable memat all ber for Fawkner. At one of those interesting meetings of ladies that he and the honourable member for Fawkner frequently address, he said that, the number of communists in the community was infinitesimal, and that they were a negligible quantity. Listen to the version of the honourable member for Fawkner. He said that the number of votes which were recorded in New South Wales for communist candidates furnished no evidence of the strength of the communists in-Australia. The only conclusion that one can draw from that statement is that the communists-who , he says, are anxious to obtain power in Australia-vot e for other candidates at the elections. The honourable member said that Mr Lang was a great man because he spoke out against the communists. I did not hear the honourable member say one kindly word of Mr Lang whilst the recent New South Wales elections were in progress. His influence, and that of other honourable members opposite, was used to prevent Mr Lang from reaching the Treasury bench in New South Wales. Now, when it suits their political book, and because, in spite of the bogy that they raised, Mr Lang did reach the Treasury bench, they say what a great man he is. Mr R. GBEEN - On a point of order, I ask whether a discussion of the recent New South Wales election is relevant to the motion.",138
635,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Hume would be in order only if the New South Wales elections were the subject-matter of the discussion in committee, the report of which the House is now asked to adopt. I am unaware of what discussion took place in committee, but if the New South Wales elections were discussed the honourable member is not out of order.  honourable member for Fawkner this evening quoted from the Worker newspaper, as though he were its originator or editor. He did not quote from the Age. The other - night he was asked, "" Do you believe everything that Mr . Jock Garden says?"" W it h the same enthusiasm that the young man at the altar who is asked a certain question says "" I will . "" the honourable member said, "" I do."" He was asked, "" Do you believe everything that the Worker newspaper says?"" and he replied, "" I do."" I now ask him whether he believes everything that the Age has said about him . To that no doubt he says, "" I do not."" The Age took him to task the other day, and described him as "" Mir. Facing Bothways,"" a description which sums up his political history most aptly. We have frequently had the honourable member speaking one way and voting another way.",139
636,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not appropriate to comment on the conduct of individual honourable members.  the honourable member with his title of "" Mr Facing Bothways."" His own statement this evening that he has become obsessed with communism enables us to discard 'everything he has said upon the bill. It is quite plain why honourable members of the Opposition lose no opportunity to fight the bill to the very death. No phase of the administration of the War Precautions Act was more drastic, far-reaching, or insidious in its effects than the administration of this legislation is intended to be. Everything that could be done under the War Precautions A ct can be done in a more insidious way under this new measure. Australian-born citi zens under the iniquitous War Precautions Act were placed in internment camps without any charge being levelled against them, and without any evidence being produced except that of spies and pimps paid by the government of the day. And what was done on that occasion was endorsed by members of the present Government. It is true that the Prime Minister of today has not been in possession of the power his predecessor enjoyed. The War Precautions Act enabled the ex-Prime Minister to do what he liked, and one of the many things he did, to the everlasting disgrace of his Government, was to have Australian-born citizens interned without giving any in formation as to why this action was taken against them. We know that even when returned soldiers came to him he refused to give them this information, and it is still withheld. The things that were done under the War Precautions Act were offensive to Australian sentiment; but what can we think of a government that in these days of peace would go equally as far as its predecessors did in time - of war? Speaking at Geelong the other day, the Prime Minister said that the National party of today had no great ideals such as those which guided it in time of war. In - those words we have a complete explanation for the introduction of legislation of the character we are now asked to consider. The right honourable gentleman admits that his party is bereft of ideals except during a time of stress and trouble. Therefore, it is no exaggeration on my part to say that, finding their sins of omission and commission are destined to remove them at an early date from the treasury bench, members of the Government are looking round for something which will inflame the passions of the people, and take their minds oil the charge that they are legislating solely in theinterests of the wealthy sections of the community. There can be no greater in dictment against any government than to say that it is legislating in the interests of one class only. Ministers are aware that the people are awaiting an opportunity to tell them what they think of them, and. in order that the people's minds may be distracted from the real issue, they are bringing in legislation of this character, and not hesitating to let it be known that it may apply to any Australian citizen. No matter how long a man has been in this country he may, in defiance of every principle of British justice, be deported without a trial by a jury of his fellow-countrymen. This is not done in any other British community. Ministers have quoted the legislation of New Zealand and Canada, but only the portions that suit their case. They cannot point to any other country where the Government has turned its back on the great principle that a man must be tried by a jury of his countrvmen before he is liable to deportation.",139
637,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The honourable member is absolutely misrepresenting the position in other countries.  Prime Minister name a British community where the principle of deportation, or condemnation, without a proper trial by a jury of one's fellow citizens is in existence? He cannot do so Unless he misquotes. But even if the principle existed elsewhere, the point is. whether it is right or wrong. Do honourable members opposite stand for a system of condemnation without a trial by a jury of one'sfellow citizens ? Honourable members may endeavour to camouflage the position, but the real point at issue is that we are now being asked to vote for the principle of condemning an Australia n citizen, and deporting him, without granting him a trial by a jury of his own countrymen. It is useless for honourable members to say that they are voting for this because certain wrong-doers in certain unions are endeavouring to take some particular action. Mr E . RILEY - The Government has all the necessary power at the present time.  that it already has the power to deal effectively with - the wrong-doers complained of only substantiates the - statement. I made a few minutes ago, that one of the reasons for this legislation is to distract the minds of the people from the unenviable political past of the Government. This afternoon the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Poster) reminded me of the line, "" The lady protests too much,, methinks."" He assured us that he was a supporter of trade unionism, that this bill was not a blow at trade unionism, and that if it were he would not be found voting, for it . But the honourable member cannot escape the fact that it is the first blow that has ever been openly struck in a time of peace by any government in Australia at the right of t r i a l by jury. Is there any honourable member on the Government side of the House courageous enough to say that he is an opponent of the principle of trial by jury ? No one is game enough to say it .",140
638,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,In one breath the honourable member says that we are introducing a new principle. In the next breath he says that we can do all these things at the present time.,140
639,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,The point about this bill is that it includes new crimes for which a person may be deported.  purpose of the bill is to extend the power of deportation to new crimes.,140
640,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"The Government already has the power to deal with these communists of whom Ministers speak, but it wants power to deal with strikers.  so-called communists about whom the honourable member for Fawkner is so obsessed were half aa bad as he has painted them, the Government, without this legislation, could do what it likes with them. But see the trickery of the Government. Having ample power to deal with communists, it wants to go f u r ther and deal with unionists. That point will be made clear to every man end woman in this country. The people the history of the honourable member for Fawkner, and that in 1897 he stood for the principle, or want of principle, 14s. a week was quite sumcient to pay white-workers in Victoria. The honourable member will find it very difficult to plain away his attitude in that connection. Some people give vent to certain views their political youth, but as time they learn better. On the contrary, honourable member for Fawkner, like Peter Pan, is one who has never grown up. He evidently still adheres sweating principle for which he stood years ago, and today he is just as bitter against the trade unionists and workers. If the so-called communists are aa Bad as he has painted them, there is no need to introduce a bill this character to That isi a complete answer to honourable members opposite who wil l vote for this 'bill. Power to deal with communists already exists. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) admitted that their number is negligible.",140
641,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"But they may be very dangerous.  honourable member follows that line of reasoning, he will soon arrive at the of obsession displayed by ' the honourable member for Fawkner.

When a man is on - trial for his life, the honourable member munism. for Fawkner pins his f a it h to tr is l by jury, and he does not hesitate to secure know the acquittal of a man who may have committed a capital offence. In the case of trade unionists, however, he contends that that they have not the right to demand to a .decent price for the sale of flesh and blood. And if they take steps to secure exbetter conditions, he would deport them without a trial by jury, which he in would grant in the case of a criminal. goes on Since he receives no fees from the the working classes, he is willing to have them tried, not by a jury of their own countrymen, but by a political board. to the We know very well the nature of the 28 Commonwealth Bank Board and other boards appointed by Ministers from their the own class.

650,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Hlakeley), this afternoon, in the course of a tirade of Scullin, J. H . abuse directed at a number of honourable members on this side, made a scurrilous personal attack upon me. He said that I have been guilty of not paying my taxation; that I would not pay my employees the wages specified in the award covering their employment; and that I would not provide for them the accommodation required by law. All those statements are absolutely without foundation. I have paid my land tax-to which, I presume, the honourable member referred-o n the due date, although the sum charged was, in my opinion, more than I honestly owed; all other taxes imposed upon me, I have always paid when due.

654,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt. Hon. W . A. W at --Before the suspension of the sitting dinner, the Navigation Bill was read first time, according to the usual procepend dure. There are only two ways by which the second reading of a bill can be on the same day as the first reading.

655,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter ) [8.5] - We seem to be having surprise upon surprise. A f t e r 27 hours' continuous sitting, Government is proceeding with the second reading of a bill that was only introduced today. It is one of the most important measures with which this House could asked to deal, and in such circumstances it is the usual practice to adjourn the bate to enable honourable members to bein the dispute. come conversant with the provisions of the h ill . The purpose of the bil l is amend the Navigation Act, and, theresentence fore, its clauses need careful scrutiny. Owing to the pressure of business in this House during the past week it has been almost impossible for honourable members - to review properly the legislation thrust, before them. From the other side the chamber there comes very little disone cussion, and on this side we have to do the best we can with the very .limited knowledge we have of the measures proposed, f the Ministry gives us practically no infordifficult mation. The right honourable gentleman has now coolly come forward with a very important measure, and has asked the House to agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable it to be dealt with at once. That is asking too much of this deliberative assembly, and if honourable members grant the request they will have some difficulty in justifying their action to the people. I desire to have, time to study the provisions of the I assert that no government, can whatever majority it may have, is justified in using its power in a brutal manner to force legislation through this House. The Government t ) . apparently seeks to pass legislation much for as a butcher produces sausages from a maa chine. The purpose of the bill is to suscertain clauses of the Navigation Act because-so it will probably - be moved alleged-of . an impending industrial Only yesterday I urged the Minister, as the head of this Commonwealth, to use his influence to prevent the threatened industrial upheaval. That is the first thing that a man in his posithe tion should do. Whatever opinions honourable members may have of what is happening outside, they should have no' doubt as to what the Prime Minister should do in this crisis. Obviously a duty devolves upon him.",144
656,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,And he is trying to discharge j t .,144
657,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"All he has done is to bring forward legislation that will in the tensify the feeling of the people outside, and will not tend to lessen the antagonism of the disputants. I ask the honourable member for Sw.an (Mr Gregory) whether be he remembers what the Prime Minister said yesterday in concluding his reply to demy suggestion that he should intervene At my request every honourable member on this side refused to to speak further. The Prime Minister's last was that he thought we should not discuss this matter further because it might intensify the passions of the people outside-o r words to that effect. If we do not want to inflame the passions of the people, why do we discuss bills like of that which we recently passed, and the now before the House? Will these measures assist in bringing about a settle- ment of the dispute, or will they aggrao r vate it , and make a settlement much more ? I said yesterday, and I repeat now, .that there is every possibility of settling this dispute, and that the man who can settle it is the Prime Minister. The right honourable .gentleman, however, has fallen down on his job. Instead of exerting himself to settle the dispute, he and his Government are forcing through this House legislation which can only have the effect of incensing the industrialists in every occupation in Australia. mere suggestion of such an interference with industrial affairs will cause every trade unionist, whether he approves of the present shipping strike or not, to stand up against the Government, which he must now recognize is working' in the interests, not of the Commonwealth, but of those people who are its masters. There is little doubt that vested interests and privileged people have dictated this legislation, and that the Go-, vernment is compelled to pass it . I say that without the slightest reservation, for everything indicates the truth of it . When the Government, after my statement to the House yesterday that there was a good prospect of settling the dispute if the Prime Minister would intervene, proceeds with such legislation, it is time that I spoke plainly, and put the responsibility on the right shoulders. Some honourable members do' - not like plain talking, but it is absolutely warranted. For what purpose does the Government propose to amend the Navigation Act ? The Parliament that passed the Navigation Act took great credit for it. It took seven years to pass the bill , and the people of Australia have always admired its provisions. It protected our Australian seamen against unfair competition; it provided for the employment of white men on the ships engaged in the Australian coasting trade; and it excluded members of black, yellow, and other alien races from those vessels. Yet at this moment, when the threatened dispute has already commenced, the Government is endeavouring to bludgeon through legislation to suspend certain clauses of that act. The previous Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), acted quite differently in similar circumstances. He, at least, realized his responsibility. H is government was not controlled by those privileged people who are above the law, and are permitted by the Government now in office, to be a law unto themselves. No action is ever taken to prevent them f n m indulging in profiteering or anythiug else that they wish to indulge in . Industrialists, whether they are right or wrong, do not enjoy the same immunity. When a deputation of representatives of the transport unions waited upon the Prime Minister he practically turned his back upon them and refused to take any action to bring - about a settlement. The Why? Obviously because concerted action had been arranged between certain people and the Government. They intend to bring about an industrial upheaval at all costs. They care nothing for the women and children who may suffer in consequence of their action. Honourable members opposite were born with silver, spoons in their mouths.",144
658,Mr MANNING,Unknown,Sham e !,145
659,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is true of every honourable member on the Ministerial side. Honourable members interjecting,",145
660,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is the duty of the Chair to enforce order. I do not desire to intimidate honourable members, but it is perfectly plain to me that we are at the commencement of a rather heated discussion, and I ask honourable members on both sides to refrain from interjections that might lead to disorder.",145
661,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite know nothing of the cares and troubles of the industrialists.. They have never experienced the pangs of hunger. They have never worked with their hands for a living. They haye been reared in an atmosphere of comfort, and consequently they have no sympathy with the great masses of the people who produce everything that enables the few to live in luxury.",145
662,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must know that he is not speaking to the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. I must ask him to endeavour to confine his remarks within ihe limits of the motion.,145
663,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I thought that in disclosing the motive that actuates the Government in submitting this motion I was in order. I deliberately refrained from saying what I have said to-night until I saw that there was a disposition on the part of the Government to create an industrial upheaval. To that end the Standing Orders are to be suspended. For eight months Parliament was closed, but when the Government desires to do something detrimental to the working classes we are forced to sit here night after night. Much as I desire to assist to entertain our American visitors, I suggest that the proper course for the Government to adopt is to postpone this business-and adjourn the House until next week. If the Prime Minister wishes to do the right thing by the nation's visitors he must steer a different course. workers will not accept quietly these proposals of the Government, and if next week there should be industrial turmoil, the responsibility will rest upon honourable members opposite. They are inviting trouble. In order tb please honourable members who desire to go home tomorrow night, this House is to sit continuously, and this panic legislation is to be passed by means of the closure and the guillotine. It is high time that the people outside knew how the business of the country is conducted. Nobody can justify a proposal to repeal portions of the Navigation Act without allowing adequate time for its discussion. Doubtless honourable members will sleep in the chamber to-night, as they did last night, and lake no. part in the debate.",145
664,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,We heard nothing worthwhile from the Opposition side last night.,146
665,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"-Nothin g was heard from the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jackson). He is always chattering like a parrot, and has never taken an intelligent part in the proceedings of the House.",146
666,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,146
667,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. Is that remark by the Leader of the Opposition fair? M t . SPEAKER - I am concerned not as to whether it is fair, but as to whether it is parliamentary. It certainly is not parliamentary, and I ask the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw it .",146
668,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"On a point of order. The honourable member for Bass made an insulting, allusion to the Leader of the Opposition, who, he said, had not uttered a word worth listening to. That statement was as offensive as anytbiug the Leader of the Opposition said of the honourable member for Bass.",146
669,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think that when the honourable member for Reid has been longer in the House he will not regard such a remark as involving a breach of ordp.r.,146
670,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I withdraw any remark to which the honourable member for Bass takes exception, but I ask him to realise that his constant interjections are disconcerting. The bill which is before the House proposes to repeal practically the whole of Part VI . of the Navigation Act relating to the coasting trade. The sections in that part regulate the carriage of passengers by British ships, and The ships in receipt of foreign subsidies, and the licensing of ships to engage in the coasting trade. Even British ships, manned by white men, are prohibited from picking up passengers in Australian waters, and ships manned by black and coloured labour are effectually debarred from competing with other ships upon which Australian conditions and rates of wages obtain. If those conditions are to be maintained, it is essential that these provisions of the act shall continue. Why the Government should be taking this action before anything has occurred to warrant it is beyond my comprehension. I have known times of industrial turmoil when it was necessary to take drastic action, but I have never previously heard of a Government deliberately preparing, before trouble occurred, to train the guns on the workers of this country. A study of the legislation brought forward by the Government during the past few days in evitably forces one to the conclusion that that is the intention of the party now in power in the Commonwealth. At the preaent time negotiations are taking place for a settlement of the dispute in the shipping industry, and a successful issue is possible. This proposed legislation is the . only obstacle. Only today I had inquiries from another state regarding the meaning of the Government's policy. Having regard to what has been said by ministerial members, and the actions of the Government, are representatives of the unions likely to come to Melbourne to attempt to settle the dispute when they fear that they may be arrested at any moment ? Is it fair of the Government to ask for powers of this kind ? It is evident that the Government does not desire the dispute to be peacefully settled, and it is unfortunate that it should seek to make political capital at the expense of Australian men and women. I believe the trouble could be settled before Monday if there was a disposition on the part of this Parliament to do that. T have been doing all I possibly could during the past three weeks, and have been engaged for half of this day in endeavouring to smooth the way for a settlement.' A successful outcome was probable but for the Government's actions, which have made the workers apprehensive. They desire to know the reason for rushing this legislation through. Nothing is more calculated to aggravate the present delicate situation than a policy which creates the suspicion that the Government intends to take hostile action against the workers engaged in the dispute. There are two sides to every argument, and honourable members opposite must not take it for granted that the workers are always in the wrong. They have made mistakes, and will do so again, just as this Parliament has been making mistakes during this week; but that does not justify onesided legislation. Would the Prime M in ister have introduced this bill if there were not behind it some motive that has not been disclosed to the House? man would dare to interfere with the Navigation Act if the people realized that his object was to allow foreign ships, manned with coloured labour, to compete in the Australian coastal trade and lower the conditions of our own seafaring people. Honourable members opposite profess to believe in a White Australia, but when it suits them they are prepared to allow coloured people to enter Australia and work while our own people are idle. This bill reached this House only this afternoon, and no honourable member has had time to compare it with the principal act. Unfortunately, the work of studying bills devolves upon two or three members; the others take not the slightest in terest in the legislation that is brought forward. Every honourable member on this side played his part last night, but honourable members opposite remained 'dumb and knew nothing of the subject of the discussion or the arguments that were advanced in opposition to the Government's proposal. They are supposed to protect the interests of their constituents and of the Australian people generally, but they show a flippant disregard of their duties. They passed not a word of censure upon the Government for continuing the parliamentary recess for eight or nine months, during which the Government did by executive act many things that should have been referred to the legislature. New. within a few weeks of the fcpiated meeting of the House, they are ready to force us to sit all night to pass hurriedly legislation that may have serious results. Nobody can justify such action. Honourable members on this side, who throughout the week have been doing the lion's share of the work of Parliament, cannot be expected to submit calmly and dispassionately to such treatment. We cannot be expected to sit here calmly when measures are thrust upon us without the opportunity to properly consider them. Why is this course adopted? There are two reasons: One is that this legislation may, if necessary, be used in connection with any industrial trouble The other is in order that we may rise tomorrow to take a three weeks' holiday and enjoy ourselves at the functions arranged in connection with the. visit of the American Fleet. I have no objection to welcome the American Fleet. I should like tb see the welcome properly carried out, but we should not be asked to rush No legislation of this kin d through to enable that to be done. If I had the choice, T would prefer that the House should sit next week, even though the fleet were here, to consider these measures, rather than they should be bludgeoned through as the Government proposes. The settlement of serious industrial trouble is of far greater importance to Australia than the welcome to the American Fleet.",146
671,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,The Government will settle the trouble when Parliament rises.,147
672,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,That is what I < am afraid of. This legislation is in tended to enable the Government to settle it in a certain way.,147
673,Mr CUNNINGHAM,Unknown,"It would be better, in the circumstances, that the American Fleet should not come here.",147
674,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"F a r better, and the Admira l in command of the fleet would be well advised not to come here if there is industrial trouble in the Commonwealth, The Government must face the position, and I shall at least be able to let the people of Australia know who is responsible for it .",147
675,Mr MANNING,Unknown,Fro m the honourable member's point of view.,147
676,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes , from my point of view, and the people will decide between the honourable member and myself. I am not afraid of their decision. If honourable members opposite are so anxious for the decision of the people, they might have gone to them long ago. When they do go to the people, I doubt very, much whether the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) will grace this chamber again. I have given reasons for my opposition to this bill. It gives power to the Government to issue a proclamation through the Governoraction General when Parliament is not sitting, and the issue of that proclamation may be disastrous to the country. Parliait ment should be sitting when any step of that kind is taken. It is not an opportunity of dealing with any matter. These proposals are forced us, and then, if trouble arises, shall be invited by the newspapers to lieve that the workers are in the wrong lar purpose. all the time. I am in a position now to say that the men are prepared to meet the pther side in conference. The Prime Minister refuses to endeavour to bring about a conference, and prefers to troduce legislation of this character. is my duty to let the people know what to speak upon it ? the true position is. The Prime Minister has made many mistakes since he reading. has been in office, but this is the biggest blunder he ever made. It spells disaster for the Commonwealth. Honourable mempermit bers opposite consider that we are not justified in our opposition to these sures. They would be very pleased i like them, we held our tongues and allowed this bill to go through in an hour. They would pass it in half an hour, and then go home and say, ""What jolly good fellows we are,"" notwithstandin. ing the fact that this legislation may juriously affect the future I suppose there is no member of the House who does not desire that Australia ready taken place? should prosper, but we cannot bring about prosperity by passing legislation of this kind at a critical time. We should be endeavouring to bring the people conaffairs war-rants it . cerned in the dispute together, in order to settle the trouble. It is as yet only beships idle. ginning, but if it contiunes, most of the boats will be tied up next week; the whole of the coal miners, and workers in steel works may be out of employment; the trams may be stopped; factories closed down, and their workers out of employthough ment. With so serious a position confronting usthe Government makes no honest endeavour, as custodians of the public weal, to bring together the parties to the'dispute. On the contrary, it endeavouring to drive them apart. stead of adopting conciliatory measures, the Government has introduced two bills, which, in the opinion of the industrialists, think so. are aimed at their organizations and leaders. This Parliament cannot justify Mr Charlton. of that kind. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) may say that the bill is aimed at communists, but contains no reference to communists.",147
677,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I see nothing in the given bill referring to communists.,148

687,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It is unfortunate if Western Australia is not getting a fair deal. We are accustomed to that sugges-tion from the honourable member for For has not been fairly treated I deplore it , and honourable members supporting the Government should do something in the matter.",148
688,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That has nothing to do with the bill. Mr Charlton. - It is not often that I am disposed to refuse leave for the introduction of a bill, or protest against the suspension of the Standing Orders. I have in such matters given the Government more than a fair deal since Parliament met, and I expect a fair deal in return. I am not getting it . I am supposed to keep in touch with everything that is going on in this House, but when measures are thrust upon honourable members in this way it is impossible to do so. I am talking, to-night, after being here for about 28 hours without sleep, and with the prospect before me of another all night sitting. That is not a proper position in which to place the Leader of the Opposition. The Government are endeavouring to rush all this legislation through in one week, although Parliament did nothing for eight months. We were brought together six weeks ago, and we are being asked this week to work night and day to pass certain legislation. Then we shall go into recess, and when Parliament is in recess, and honourable members cannot make their voices heard, action may be taken upon these measures. It is essential that Parliament should be sitting to prevent the issue of a proclamation which may be disastrous to the country. At a time of crisis Parliament is not justified in going into recess. The Commonwealth is threatened with a big industrial upheaval, and Parliament should be in session at the time, so that honourable members may watch events. - I am aware, of course, that we shall be outvoted in the division, hut I do not propose to allow the motion to pass without the strongest opposition. If Parliament closes down at the end of this week, action will then be taken by the Government detrimental to the best interests of the people, whilst we are having a picnic. The Prime Minister would be well advised not to adjourn the House. We should meet next week, - and, if necessary, the following week also, to transact the - business of the country. If the right orable gentleman is not going to do any more than he has done up to the present in regard to this industrial trouble, it would be far better to advise the com-. mander of the American Fleet not to come to Australia. If industry is interfered with the people will suffer. It will be a test of endurance of the stomach against the purse. We should use every legitimate means at our disposal to prevent th? dispute from extending. I am firmly convinced that intervention at this juncture by the Prime Minister, with the object of calling a conference of the dis- . putants, will bring about this happy result. I have never known of a Prime Minister, in a crisis like this, declining to take the necessary' action to bring the parties together. Instead of doing this, the right honourable gentleman is forcing through legislation the only effect of which will be to aggravate people outside and intensify the trouble. I hold no brief for either party. The ship-owners may be in the right. I do not know. My only object is to serve the interests of the general public and, if possible, prevent this industrial upheaval from extending. Exhausted as we are after an all-night sitting,' we are not as mentally alert as usual, and cannot give close attention to the details of the measures which the Government proposes to introduce tonight. This is a time when all honourable members should be cool and collected. No effort should he spared by the Leader of the Government to bring the contending parties together. Certainly there is no need to pass panic legislation of this nature. It will do more harm than good to the economic life of .the country. Speaking as one who has had some experience in these matters, I know how essential it is, at the outset of. any industrial dispute, to bring the parties together; but when I made an appeal to the Prime Minister yesterday, the right honourable gentleman threw cold water on my suggestion. He said that it would be unwise to discuss the matter further, for fear that it might arouse the passions of the contending parties. Though no inducement is held out to the industrial leaders to act, it is to their credit that they areworking harder than any one else to bring about a settlement of this trouble. I have been in touch with them hon- since the week before the last measure was introduced, and I know what efforts they are making to peacefully settle the trouble.",149
689,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Why , then, did they issue the ultimatum to the ship-owners?",150
690,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am speaking of the industrial leaders generally, not of an individual union. I know not who is in the wrong. Probably there are faults on both sides. I am satisfied, however, that if the Prime Minister moved to bring the parties together some good would be accomplished. Unfortunately, there is too much thought of the interests of party in this matter. It is difficult to understand how a man holding the position of Prime Minister, the highest honour that can be conferred on any man by the people, can sit quietly down without doing something to effect a settlement. The Shipping Board, a non-political body, created by this Government, made an arrangement with the unions concerned when Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, intervened a few days ago, so that there is' no trouble with the Commonwealth ships today. It is quite evident, however, that the Government was disappointed at the agreement, and the Prime Minister asked for information from the board as to the terms of settlement.",150
691,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I should like a little closer relationship to the motion.,150
692,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I submit, Mr. Speaker, that I am in order, because the motion has relation to the second reading of the Navigation Bill.",150
693,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Navigation Bill is not before the House.,150
694,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"But the purpose of the motion is to bring the Navigation Bill before the House, and I am endeavouring to show that there is no need to suspend the Standing Orders for that purpose. I point out that already the Commonwealth Line has. come to an agreement with the seamen. What is to prevent the other ship-owners from following the example of the Commonwealth Shipping Board ? Where is the necessity to suspend the Standing Orders if a settlement of the dispute is possible?",150
695,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that he cannot discuss the merits of the Navigation Bill at this stage. Mr Charlton,- I am not discussing the merits of the bill. I am merely referring to the position of the Commonwealth ships. I can see no reason why vessels controlled by private ship-owners should not also be in commission, because the same terms are obtainable for them. I believe that they would be put in commission again if the Prime Minister would call a conference of the contending parties. It is possible that a settlement will be arrived at without his intervention, but if it is it will be a reflection upon the right honourable gentleman. There is no occasion to intensify the trouble by passing this drastic legislation. Everything that is possible to settle the dispute has been done by the industrial leaders, including one man who has been strongly condemned by the honourable member for Fawkner.",150
696,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,Is that Mr Garden?,150
697,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes . We must give Mr Garden credit for what he is doing. He and other industrial leaders realise the responsibility of their position, and are trying earnestly to prevent an extension of the trouble. They want to see the ships in commission. When people are brought together to discuss their grievances usually they can be induced to agree to a settlement. We should use every effort to keep the wheels of industry going. If this industrial upheaval extends, progress will be retarded. A settlement would mean much to the industrial and economic life of the Commonwealth. Taking these things into consideration, I cannot understand why the Government is not endeavouring to settle the trouble instead of introdiicing this measure. I should not object to it if I thought that it was necessary. The Prime Minister is laughing with his supporters on the front bench, and seems to take little interest in what I am saying.",150
698,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,I am sorry if I have inconvenienced the honourable member.,150
699,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,This is an important matter and should not be treated lightly.,150
700,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,The honourable member knows that I always listen to him very carefully.,150
701,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I am complaining more of the general conversation. I object to this method of conducting the business of this country. If the Government had endeavoured to settle this dispute a week ago, the vessels would now be running. This House is not justified in rising until the dispute is settled. I view with alarm the possible development of this trouble if Parliament adjourns for three weeks. The composite ministry has made up its mind and has determined upon a course of action which was evidently arrived at some time ago. The Government's proposals have no doubt been approved by honourable members at their party meetings. A certain decision has been arrived at, and honourable members will stand behind the Government irrespective of the results. They are concerned more with party benefit than with the interests of this country. The Government has taken up an unfortunate position which cannot be accepted by those honourable members who are here to protect the people's interests. Our first and foremost duty should be to discuss the position as we see it, and to use every endeavour to bring the parties together to try to settle the dispute, or at least prevent its extension. I regret that the Government is making no attempt to prevent an extension of the trouble. I thought yesterday that something wonld be done to try to settle the dispute, but instead the Government introduced a measure, which in all probability will aggravate the position. I have been asked what is likely to happen, but I am unable to give an answer. When the Labour party is struggling with a problem of this kind, free of all party interest, honourable members behind the Government pay little attention. They rush this legislation through, keeping us sitting here hour after hour to gain their ends, oblivious of what is in the minds and hearts of the great mass of the people they represent. It is not to their credit. At least honourable members on this side of the House will have the satisfaction of knowing that they endeavoured to bring about a settlement of the dispute. If it were possible for me to convene a meeting of the parties to the dispute I should do so. In a serious crisis like this, no one would dare to refuse the Prime Minister if he asked the parties concerned to meet to discuss the position. Everybody knows that. Why does he refrain from taking action? If he convened a meeting and failed to reach a settlement the people would know that he did his best. If he succeeded, then he would receive the credit due to him for having accomplished a great service to this country. An industrial upheaval is staring us in the face, and no effort is being made to preserve the peace. Honourable members opposite sit contentedly in their places. The few who do speak, deal only with industrial leaders, industrialism, or communism. There is urgent necessity for them to take action. The laws of ' the country have to be administered to keep the wheels of industry going. The first and foremost duty of the Government, at a time like this, when there is a probability of a general upheaval that will seriously affect the prosperity and economic conditions of this country, is to take such action as will bring the two parties together. Let them see that the head of this Government is not partisan, that he leans neither to one side nor the other, but endeavours to hold the scales of justice evenly balanced. In the interests, not only of the disputants, but also of the great mass of the people-afte r all there is a third party to this dispute-every thing possible should be done to settle the dispute. It is the people who feel the pinch, the parents who pay heavy rents in our great cities, to provide a shelter for their little ones. Those who suffer will be, not the members of Parliament, but the people who live from hand to mouth, struggling to rear their children. The extension of the shipping dispute will cause misery to hundreds of thousands of people, including the little children, who have no say in these matters. This is the greatest crisis that has occurred in the history of this country, and the obvious duty of the Commonwealth Parliament is to compel the two parties to come to some settlement to prevent an injury being done to the great body of the people. If the parties concerned cannot settle their disputes by arbitration, the Prime Minister should convene a conference, preside over it and deal with the matter on its merits. If he would do that I have every reason to believe that the dispute would be settled, and the country saved from endless misery.",150

705,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"W.'t h Chows and Japs.  thing to say later in respect to that in terjection. Before outlining the provisons of the bill, I should like to give honourable members a r6sume of the history of our navigation legislation. The firstNavigation Bill was introduced ir> this House in 1903, and from then u n t i l 1912, when it was passed, the measure was almost constantly under discussion. It probably received more attention from the legislature than any other measure that has been placed on our statute-book. It was provided that the act was not to become operative u n t il it had been proclaimed, and some portions of it were proclaimed earlier than others. On account of the war, no further legislation was passed u n t i l 191,9, but in that year, and also in 1920, two amending were passed. These also were thoroughly discussed, and the legislation became operative, in part, in 1921. Although provision was made in the various acts for the safety and survey of ships, the maintenance of life-saving apparatus, - and the like, their principal object was to build mp - an Australian mercantile marine. In order to achieve this purpose it - was necessary adequately to safeguard both the Australian ship-owners and the Australian seamen against unfair competition from overseas shipping. To this end it was provided that no ship should engage in the Australian coastal trade except it was licensed to do so, or, in exceptional circumstances, was given a permit under which it could provide a service where no licensed ships were operating. The conditions under which, the licences were granted were that ships should be manned in accordance with the act and the regulations made pursuant to it , and that the accommodation provided! for the seamen should be up to the standards prescribed. Under this legislation and the Arbitratio n Court awards the Australian seamen have enjoyed higher wages, shorter hours, and better accommodation than any other merchant seamen in the world. They have had annual holidays, time off in port in lieu of holidays and Sundays spent at sea, free hospital attendance and medicine in time of sickness, and full wages for a period of three months if , owing to sickness, they had to be landed away from their home port.",152
706,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I respectfully draw your atten. faon, Mr Speaker, to the nature of the Minister's remarks, and ask your ruling as to whether they have anything to do with the Navigation Bill?",153
707,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member's mind is very agile to-night. I am not certain whether the Minister's remarks are applicable to the bill . I am waiting to find that out, and if they arc not I shall tell him so. Mr Blakeley interjecting,",153
708,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I warn the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) that it is improper and disorderly to speak when the Speaker is addressing the House.,153
709,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker.  bills - the conditions existing, and brought about by the operation of the Navigation Act, in the Australian mercantile marine, and I shall then explain the application of the bill to the present situation. W it h out wearying the House too much with details of the awards made by the courts, or even with the act, which is the basis of those awards, I should like to say, and it can be entirely proved, that the conditions in the Australian mercantile marine, in which both the owners and the seamen are protected by the act, are by far the best in the world.",153
710,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Is the Minister sorry for that?  it . In order to prove my statement, I shall quote evidence given in the Arbitration Court as recently as last October, when a witness saidSo far as their association was concerned (the New South Wales Coastal Steamship Owners) the seamen werein some cases earning very large sums. He had prepared a list for income tax purposes, and one man had been paid over £400 for the year.",153
711,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I respectfully draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to the fact that the seamen's wages have nothing whatever to do with the Navigation Act.",153
712,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Bourke will read the act again he will see that several sections of it relate to the wages and conditions of seamen. I shall intervene if I hear the Minister saying anything irrelevant.  the Arbitration Court stated that many able seamen earned from £350 to £400 a year, in addition to their keep. I u making these comparisons, I wish it to be clearly - understood that I am not cavilling at the rates of pay of Australian seamen.",153
713,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I wish to raise a point of order. A very undesirable practice is growing up in this House of reading speeches, and I direct your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the fact that the Minister is reading his speech.",154
714,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Standing Orders, as well as long established parliamentary practice, prevent an honourable member from reading his speech. A ll he is entitled to do is to refresh his memory from copious notes. I hope that the Minister will not offend against that practice. I have noticed a tendency several times in the present session to depart from it.  to do so it would be impossible for me, with the zig-zag arguments that are going on all round me, to read my speech. In deference to the objections of my honourable friends opposite, I shall not say thing further about the great benefits that the Australian seamen are enjoying, but I think I am in order in discussing the Navigation Act and its relation to the proposals of the Government. From the stand-point of the owners, the Australian shipping industry receives a larger measure of practical protection than any other industry in the Commonwealth. It is true that any British or even foreign ship may apply, in compliance with the regulations laid down, for a licence to engage in the Australian trade, but the conditions are so onerous that such applications are not made. The result is that the Australian shipping industry is a close monopoly of the Australian ship-owners and the Australian seamen. In view of these facts, one would think that if any industry in the Commonwealth would be conducted harmoniously by the employers and the employees, it would be the shipping industry; but, most regrettably, that industry is in an almost chronic state of industrial turmoil.",154
715,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Will the Minister state the profits of the shipping companies, seeing that he has stated the wages of the seamen ?  reported that the ship-owners' profits were no more than reasonable, and that report is of very recent date. If these industrial troubles involved only the ship-owners and the seamen, the matter would be bad enough; but it cannot be too strongly emphasized that they go far beyond that. The Australian shipping industry is a key industry- I might almost say that it is ""the"" key industry of the Commonwealth-and any disorganization of it is immediately felt in every other industry, and by the whole community. It is evident that when ships at short notice cease to run, shippers, producers, and consignees suffer great inconvenience and loss. The losses in wages to the seamen and other maritime workers directly affected are bad enough. From 1921 to 1924, which were the first four years after the provisions of the act came into force, the seamen and wharf labourers alone lost, owing to shipping disputes, wages amounting to no less than £309,414, but others besides the seamen and wharf labourers are thrown out of employment when there is a hold-up in the shipping services. One of the Commonanywealth Statistician's latest reports shows that for the year 1919, £34,497 was lost in wages by the seamen and wharf labourers, and that the total estimated loss in wages by all the trade unionists and other industrial workers affected amounted to no less than £775,000. That figure represents the wages for 1,500,000 working days of 16,000 people. In addition, there are innumerable direct and indirect losses. There are the extra rail freights and personal expenses that have to be paid, the effect on trade generally of the decreased consumption of goods, the increased unemployment, the losses due to delays in transport, and many other things. No figures are available to show the indirect losses, but we have one illustration of them in the effect of the holdup of the Tasmanian shipping services early this year. On that occasion a large number of people suffered heavy personal losses, and great inconvenience, by being stranded in Tasmania or on the mainland. We have also direct evidence from the Commonwealth Shipping Board of very large sums directly lost through the hold-up of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers. In attempting to make an estimate of the indirect losses it is not unreasonable to say that they may be ten, or even twenty, times as large as the loss of wages by unionists. Great suffering is inflicted upon the people of the Commonwealth other ways. The people of Tasmania, trusted Western Australia, and Northern Queensland depend almost entirely upon regular shipping services for many of their necessities. I think I have demongiven, strated that the shipping industry is national and a key industry, and that when it is dislocated great losses are flicted not only directly on the men immesented diately concerned, but also indirectly large sections of the community. The sugar industry of Queensland f u nishes one illustration of the consequences of a shipping dislocation. That industry cerned. is almost wholly dependent upon shipping facilities, and if they are not available the industry ceases because the mills can only hold moving stocks. Therefore, the round of industrial activity is interthe rupted for any length of time the mills must close and the cane rots in the field. This entails dislocation of subsidiary in dustries that are dependent upon the proper distribution of sugar. makers and f r u it canners are affected, give and through them indirectly the f r u it - in growers suffer. Confectioners and biscuit pend manufacturers also use sugar, and employ large numbers of workers. Coal supplies another illustration. The distribution coal depends very largely upon adequate shipping facilities, and that fuel is essensuspension tia l to practically the whole of secondary industries, which employ nearly seas, 400,000 people. If there is a serious dismation, location in connection with its distribuof tion, the interests of all those workers affected. These facts are common knowbill ledge, but in a discussion of a measure of this nature it is right to take into sideration all the concomitant circumthe stances and possibilities. Doubtless, honourable members opposite will declare that this bill is another thrust at Austraother lian trade unionism, and will import the discussion a spirit of partisanship. The Government has no desire to add in any way to the difficulties with which those who are directly interested in the shipping industry are faced, but it has its responsibilities to the general community, and not merely to any section of it. Without commenting upon the merits of the present partial dispute, I assure honourable members 'that the Government has the most fervent sire that industrial peace shall prevail, but it must accept the responsiin bility with which the people have eni t , and therefore it asks Parliament to grant certain powers which would be obviously necessary in a time . of national crisis. If those powers are the Government will at such a a time exercise them and be responsible to the House and to the electors of the in - whole Commonwealth. The bill is preto the House in a serious spirit, on and with no thought of giving provocation, but with an earnest desire to help r - the whole of the people and the trade unionists directly and indirectly conThe first portion of the b i ll deals with Part VI . of the Navigation Act, comprising sections 284 to 293 inclusive, and if relating to the coasting trade. Under provisions of Part VI . , no ship may carry passengers and cargo between ports within the coasting trade limits unless - either licensed to do so, or, in exceptional circumstances, under a special permit. Jam The bill proposes to add a new section to the Governor General power the public interest to susby proclamation any of the provisions of Part VI . as regards any ship or class of ships, subject to such of conditions as the Governor General may think fit to impose. The effect of such a would be that any Lbip, whether the owned in the Commonwealth or overof the class set for t h in the proclacould participate in the carriage passengers or cargoes on the Austraare lian coast. The second portion of the is designed to facilitate traffic without interfering substantially with the conprovisions of Part VI . For instance, Government could suspend the provisions as to the carriage of, say, a doctor on a ship travelling on the coast, or as to minor matters, that would not deinto tract from the general efliciency and safety of the ship as a whole. This pro1 posal may be regarded to some extent as an alternative to the first portion of the bill ; that is, it may be possible by relatively minor exemptions granted under this proposed section to permit ships to operate in the coasting trade without a total suspension of Part VI . The insertion in an act relating to shipping and navigation of a provision giving the executive authority to dispense, on occadesions, with Ihe requirements of some sections of the general mercantile marine law, is not a new departure. Section 78 of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act 1906 gives to the . British Board of Trade powers very similar to those proposed to be conferred by this bill. That section reads-^The Board of Trade may, if they think fit, and upon such conditions (if any) as they tliink fit to impose, exempt any ship from any specified requirement contained in, or prescribed in pursuance of, the Merchant Shipping Act, or dispense with the observance of any such requirement in the case of any ship, if they are satisfied that that requirement has been substantially complied with in the case of that ship, or that compliance with the requirement is unnecessary in the circumstances of the case, and that the action taken or provision made as respects the subject-matter of the requirement in the case of the ship is as effective as, or more effective than, actual compliance with the requirement. That section also requires the Board of Trade to lay annually before both Houses of Parliament a special report the cases in which they have exercised their powers under that section the preceding year, and the upon which they have acted in each case. A somewhat similar provision is contained in the bill now before the House. 57 of the New Zealand Shipping and Seamen Amendment Act 1909, is almost precisely the same as section 78 of the Imperial Act, and gives to the Minister of Marine the same power of as is conferred in Great Britain upon the Board of Trade. I appeal to this House to treat this bill in a non-party The Government regards it as a measure to be used solely for the benefit of the whole community,- and will be responsible to the House and to the country if , and when, any executive action under its provisions. Australia splendid mercantile marine. of capital invested, and the of men employed it is easily the largest industry in Australia, and no sane Australian wishes to destroy it. There are indications that that view is shared by the vast majority of trade unionists, in spite of the exceptional conditions under which the seamen work, they appear, according to the reports in the ' daily press, to desire to hold the to ransom, and even to wreck .own industry. My reliance is upon a settlement being effected by the sane, solid, and sensible unionists of Australia, and also by the men who are coming  ashore from the ships, wanting to know what all the trouble is about, and getting no satisfactory reply.",154
716,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Is this the voice of a non-party man?  takes no sides in this matter so far as the disputants are concerned. It is neither upon the side of the employer nor upon that of the employee in this matter. It asks for a reserve power, to be used only in the interests of the whole community in connection with a position which we all hope will never arise-the total cessation of transport facilities on the whole of our coast. This power will be used by the Government only in case of extreme urgency, and only to benefit the whole of the people. I need not remind the House that the Government is responsible for every action it takes. I submit stating the bill with every confidence that it proposes a reserve power, which in the l i g h t during of the conditions which exist today, the grounds Government of the country should possess. Most probably this power will never need to be used, but we cannot Section risk the extreme possibility which might arise in connection with our shipping transport, when the whole community may be held up by something which is not the fault of the great bulk of trade dispensation unionists. I am confident that this bill will be a great factor in a possible future crisis. I believe that the great spirit. elements-publi c sentiment and public opinion-ar e behind the action of the Government in the course it is taking to-night. Neither of the disputants in the present trouble is the biggest party is taken affected by what is taking place. The has a biggest party is the community.

We have the law as it stands, and we have before a bill to suspend the operation of that law-. Of the bill the Minister had pracbread. tically nothing to say, and he was forced to say something about the Navigation Act.

There no part of the British dominions, irrespective of whether an arbitration law exists there or not, or whether the seamen's wages are £100 or 10s. per month, where the conditions .they entaken joy are due to the passing of an act.

They were later covered by awards under, arbitration laws, and are not, any way due to the passing of the Navi - iquities of the eeamen. gation Act. To justify the Government proposal, the Minister has told us that the dislocation of the shipping industry has caused an immense loss of wages to the men who go down to the sea in ships, or work upon the waterfront of this country. The honourable gentleman would have us believe that he is not partisan, but a broad-minded public man, rising serenely above the conflict of party and faction. He says, "" T not a partisan ; I am a public man, observe the issues. I see that the. seaI men by constant dislocations of the adshipping industry lose an enormous amount in wages."" How the honourable' Howrebe grettable it is that men should take action to deprive themselves of £755,000 in wages, should lose 1,000,000 hours of and labour, and should be the cause of of their fellows losing their employfor ment.

It is a crime if the workman turns away from his job and says that he will not continue is to work unless his conditions are i m proved. He is a criminal, a destroyer of wealth, a thrower away of wages. But that the employer sometimes casts his employees out upon the street is never into consideration by this Minister who claims to be a broad-minded public He puts only one side to the people of this country, and yet has the audacity to claim to be no partisan. He said-no t because it had to do with the bill, since it had nothing to do with it-that he is no "" God forgive me if I would I I am not against the ship-owner or the seamen.""' But the honourable gentleman has only in one eye, and he can see only the in W it h all his experience as Minister for Trade and Customs he has not found one cause of complaint against those who operate ships upon our coast. Is that not marvellous? Ask the honourable member for  the matter is. He will tell us that there a was a shipping business in Western Australia, but the ships were taken off. It is his complaint that the Ship-owners am Federation lessened the frequency of and their service to Western Australian ports because it pleased tbem to do so, and Western Australia suffered in consequence. Its ports were left shipping facilities, not because of the action of the seamen, but because it did not suit the book of the shipping tion to continue them. Where are the honourable members representing mania ? Is it not a fact that the north-west coast of that state was deserted by the Ship-owners Federation""? It was not the seamen who left the north-west of Tasmania desolate. The took their ships off the service to ports on that coast. They wanted to make the utmost profit. They could make one ship do where previously two had been in commission. By taking one away they put money into their pockets, and seamen, firemen, and wharf labourers were cast upon the streets and lost wages as the result. But that was not a crime. honourable member for Forrest that the north-west ports of Tasmania were deserted and cargo left rotting in them, not because the seamen struck, but because the Ship-owners would not put ships on. the coast to carry it away. What happened? There was in Tasmania at the .time a Government, and not a Labour ment. It was a Government hostile to everything which the Labour stands for, and particularly to every principle of public ownership the Labour party stands. But it was driven by the very force of stances and by the outcry of farmers and primary producers for ships to carry their products away. The ship-owners had a vessel lying idle in Sydney harbour, the Melbourne. They would not use her because there was not enough trade. Nationalist Government of Tasmania purchased that vessel for £60,000, and put her into the service on the coast of the State. That ship went into different ports on the coast and lifted the cargo that had been left rotting there by the Ship-owners Federation. the ship-owners do then? They again put ships into the service, and these ships went into Burnie, Devonport, and every other north-west coast port in Tasmania ahead of the vessel purchased by the Nationalist Government and cleaned up the cargo offering; cargo that had been left rotting in Tasmanian ports, not because of the action of the seamen, but because of the action of the ship-owners. Mr Anstey. not the Minister know that? No ; he is blindly ignorant of it . Yet he has the without audacity to say, "" I am not a partisan; I am serenely above faction. I hold the scales of justice evenly."" The bill profedera- poses to suspend the existing shipping law. Why? To enable the Government to Tas- keep running between our ports vessels which employ black, yellow, tan, or any other colour of labour and work it under' any conditions. For what purpose do coastMinisters wish to do that? To defeat ship-owners the ship-owners? Not at all. To defeat the seamen ! Yet these gentlemen say that they are not partisans in this industrial crisis. Every one knows that this bill does not stand by itself. It is complementary to that other measure, the deportation bill , which has just left this chamber. It is part two of the Government programme. It dove-tails in with The the former bill, under which it will b3 knows possible to deport a man who raises his voice in connection with any industrial dispute. A man may commit almost any offence in the calendar. He may Federation commit crimes of violence against the person, robbery, crimes against women; he may commit crimes that mean wreckNationalist age and r u into thousands of homes; but Govern- for not one of these may he be deported. If charged with the committal of any party one of these crimes he will have the right of trial by judge and jury in for which open court. The authority to deport without trial in open court will only be circum- exercised in the case of the man who, in an industrial dispute, urges his fellow workmen to refuse to work. By raising his voice, an industrial leader will commit a crime carrying a greater penalty than robbery with violence, or than manThe slaughter, or even than rape.",156
718,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! . north-west Mr ANSTEY - This bill , as I have said, is part, two of the Government programme. Its purpose is to break these industrial organizations and destroy the What did conditions which have been won for our seamen, by permitting vessels manned by any class of labour to trade from port to port upon our coasts. I do not ask who are in the right or who are in the wrong, but if I held a position of responsibility I should endeavour to place myself in the position occupied by the seamen and find out what is the cause of the dispute. What has been Does said against the seamen may be quite true. A trouble like that which threatens . can spread like a pestilence through the community and carry desolation to thousands'of homes. It may wreck industry on farm and in factory in every state cf the Commonwealth. What is the Government doing ? It has brought in this measure for the lopping off of heads; but if "" heads are lopped o*her heads will appear. There is no end to suppression, but there is finality to j u tice. Cannot the Government rise above the viewpoint of the seamen and of the shipowners and do something to bring about peace, unity and concord ? I realise, that for the proper observance of the laws there must be discipline among our workmen; but, if the Government seeks the public good, it will endeavour to remove the cause of this discord between the parties. The Government is clothed with power, prestige and responsibility. It can be the adjudicator between - the - ship-owners and the seamen. But"", instead of acting in that capacity, it declares that this thing must be fought to a finish. But the Government cannot fight against both parties. Accordingly, although it professes to seek the ways of peace, it has deliberately ranged itself on the side of organized wealth in this struggle. Did not we see this in the attitude of the Prime Minister the other night? The Commonwealth Shipping Board . has made an agreement with the seamen. This country has li©en told that the Government can exercise no control over that board. Yet the Prime Minister was indignant with members of the Commonwealth Shipping Board for the action which it took because that action has somewhat complicated the position. The Government, so we understood, had agreed with the Shipowners' Federation to fight this powerful industrial organization to a finish. Accordingly, the Prime Minister wrote a letter to Admira l Clarkson asking why the board had dared to come to an agreement without consulting the Government. Was it not like his impudence to do that? Time after time in recent years, when questions have been asked concerning the woollen mills, the Commonwealth Bank, and other governmental activities, we have been told that they were under the control of boards, and so were completely removed from all political influence. In this case, however, the Prime Minister asked Admira l Clarkson why and on what [53] : terms the Shipping Board had entered into an agreement with the seamen. When my leader (Mr Charlton) asked what was the nature of the board's reply, he drew a blank. Is it not reasonable and proper that Parliament shouJd be informed of what the board has done? Is it not possible also that the reply given by Admiral Clarkson to the Prime Minister might have been helpful to honourable members on this side.of the House if it had been furnished. The right honourable gentleman informed my leader that the board's reply was in genera) terms, and was of no value to the country. Do honourable members think that that reply would have been given if the terms of Admiral Clarkson's letter could have been used as an instrument against us ? In that case the' Prime Minister, make no mistake about it , would have speedily given the information to the House and to the country. But because the board's reply could not be so used, and because it suited the Government to carry this struggle to a finish, Admiral Clarkson's letter has been suppressed. This bill, this odious, unclean thing, represents the policy of the .Government. B y its passage Ministers think to serve some useful purpose. This Government declares that it is serving the public interest; that it seeks the ends of justice! Has there ever been a despot in the world who has not justified his actions by the declaration that he was acting for the public good? "" In politics,"" said Desmoulins, in the French Chamber of Deputies, "" there are no principles, only interests."" So we have these professions for the public good, and, side by side with them, measures to create discord. These people represent the money lords of the country. They do not seek to preserve the interests of the nation. Instead of speaking in the name of humanity, and acting in the interest of justice by endeavouring to bring the two parties together, the Prime Minister is going i;o fight the seamen to a finish. Yet this struggle, which can only end in disaster, could be averted. When my leader approached the Prime M in ister, what answer did he get? The Prime Minister referred to the errors and follies of this and that individual, but failed to face the problems and issues of the day. The Labour party does not believe in perpetually feeding upon the corpses of the past. What doesi t matter if Casey, Brown, or Jones, as the case may be, is deported tomorrow? Individuals are insignificant, mere atoms on the stream of public life. When they go out of existence, nothing is' altered, and others take their places. The Government should not proceed with this bill . It s passage can do the ment no harm, but its effect will be that, instead of a kinder and better feeling being encouraged in the community, there will be caused a bitter and savage hostility such as a wise government would sweep away and banish for ever.",158
719,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"Bass) [10.32] - I regret that I disregarded the Standing Orders by interjecting earlier in the evening. My remark was made in the heat of the moment, and caused the Leader of the Opposition to say something that 1 felt compelled to ask him to withdraw. My contributions to debates in this House have been neither long nor many. I have no - lesire for my efficiency to be judged by the number of pages in Hansard filled with reports of my speeches. failure to speak on the Immigration Bill was no faul t of mine. I was trying to get the call when the closure was applied. We have heard a lot about the rights of trade unionists in Australia. I full y recognize those rights; but I remind honourable members that other people have rights as well. I know, too, that it is impossible sometimes for one's rights not to intrude on the rights of others. One of the most direct reasons for Tasmania's sorry financial plight today is the prevalence of shipping strikes, over which the people of that state have no control whatever. During the last seven years we have had a series of hold-ups of shipping, costing us a considerable amount of money. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) referred - to the fact that more produce had been left to rot on the wharves in Tasmania through the shipping companies not sending their vessels to those ports than had been lost through shipping strikes. shall not contest that statement, because the honourable member, being a member of the Navigation Committee,, haa the whole of the facts and figures before him. It matters not to me whether the shipping companies or the seamen,- stewards, or engineers are responsible. All I know is that Tasmania is suffering, and will suffer again, from strikes, and that this bill may to some extent remedy the position.",160
720,Mr YATES,Unknown,In what way has Tasmania suffered?,160
721,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The honourable member heard what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said about produce Labour move- being left on the wharfs.,160
722,Mr YATES,Unknown,That is only one in stance.,160
723,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"It has occurred year after year. It is most unfortunate for Tasmania that the time at which strikes occur coincides with the height of the tourist season and, incidentally, the height of the produce season. Considerably more than £1,000,000 worth of produce was lost to Tasmania through a strike that occurred three or four years ago. About that time the northern portion of ""Victoria and part of New South Wales were drought-stricken. High prices were offering, but owing to the strike the farmers of Tasmania were unable to get their produce to the mainMy land. Prior to the strike in January last the boarding-house proprietors in Tasmania had made preparations for a record tourist season. Their accommodation was full y booked, and then the strike came. The loss of revenue to these people amounted to thousands of pounds, and their expenditure on improvements was wasted - The average tourist pays for the round trip , and allows himself a few pounds for pocket expenses. During the strike a thousand of these people were stranded in Tasmania. An effort was made there to have the operation of the Navigation Act suspended. I believe that even the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) was ansious that this should be done to allow the tourists to be returned to their homes and to bring Tasmanians from the mainland back to their own state. These losses to Tasmania are never recouped. Many people know the conditions of travel on the small boats-the mosquito I fleet-whic h travel to and from Tasmania. In rough weather the passage across the bass strait in those vessels is an experience that is not willingly repeated, and, as a result, people who have undergone it in visiting Tasmania never return there unless a large steamer is available for the trip . The worse feature of these strikes is their suddenness. Usually the first intimation of trouble is the notification in the press that the Loongana or the Nairana has not left Melbourne. Then our isolation commences. Owing to the proximity of Melbourne, the people of Tasmania hold only nominal stocks of various household commodities, and great difficulty is experienced in obtaining fresh supplies. .Luring last January a large Tasmanian j a m factory, which employs many hundreds of hands and absorbs the small fruit s grown round about Hobart, suffered serious loss because sugar could not be obtained for jam-making. Mr O ' KEEFE - And the Tasmanian Labour Government immediately took steps to bring sugar to Tasmania.",160
724,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,"That is so. Australia is a large continent, ancl I think that sometimes we are apt to forget its dimensions. The Commonwealth Parliament at times passes legislation which must of necessity impose a hardship on portions of the country. The Navigation Act has undoubtedly imposed a hardship on the states of Tasmania, Western Australia, and Queensland. area of Western Australia is tremendous, and the people in and near its northern ports suffer considerably through the failure to obtain supplies. hope that the present strike will soon end, so that the power to be conferred under this bill will not need -£o be exercised. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) stated that he was not familiar with the merits or demerits of the shipping dispute. Most of us are in the same position. We know that under the Navigation Act and the Arbitration Court trade unionists have considerably improved their conditions, and in return they certainly owe the community a duty. The people of Tasmania, who suffer year after year through shipping hold-ups, are at least entitled to some consideration. This bill, if put into operation, may give some relief to that state. We are told that the unions propose to permit vessels to travel to and from Tasmania, but we are also informed in the newspapers that they propose to take no action "" for the present."" It is possible that certain honourable members may not be able to return to Tasmania next week. What will be the position? Is Tasmania to suffer further loss ? It s financial position is already bad, and there is no inducement to establish industries in Tasmania while shipping hold-ups continue to take place. The people of that state demand permanent communication with the mainland. Tasmania has been drained of population and seems to have become a breeding and learning ground for the other states. It costs £300,000 to educate the children of Tasmania, and no sooner do they reach man's estate than they leave for the other states to obtain employmentTwo antagonistic monopolies have been created by the protection afforded by the Navigation Act and the Arbitration Court, and the public pays. I am of opinion that the Arbitration Court and the Navigation Act should not be disturbed, since a measure of protection to the shipping industry is: necessary in order to maintain the standard of living of those engaged in it . But those instrumentalities should not be used to oppress any section: of the community. It is essential that Tasmania should have constant communication with the mainland. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition The coastal expressed regret that the Tasmanian shipping line turned out to be such a fiasco. I also regret it . Although the firm with which I am connected does not I sincerely do a great deal of shipping it never allowed an opportunity to use the vessels of that line to pass. With the Deputy Leader of the Opposition I deplore that the farmers of Tasmania, failed to support the line as they might have done. In any case, however, that service was not sufficient to maintain proper communication between the mainland and Tasmania. I support this bill , not because I like it , but because I think it is necessary in the interests of my state. Mr E. BILEY (South Sydney) [10.47] - I have a great deal of sympathy with honourable members who represent Tasmania, but I do not feel that I shall be justified on that account in supporting the Government's proposal to repeal the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act.",161
725,Sir LITTLETON GBOOM,Unknown,"It is proposed not to repeal, but to suspend them. Mr E . RILEY - It amounts to the same thing while the suspension is in operation. This bill aims a blow at the seamen and many other workers who are associated with the Australian shipping industry. The captains and mates, for instance, are vitally affected, notwithstanding that through their organization they have loyally observed the arbitration court awards in every particular. The marine engineers are in the same position.",161
726,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Thei r awards will still remain in force. Mr E. RILEY - But of what effect will they be, for these men will be compelled to compete with black labour. The stewards, cooks and pantrymen will also be seriously affected. Even the shipping companies which trade on our coastwill suffer heavy loss if this measure is passed. If German, French, Italian and Japanese boats are permitted to call at - our various ports to pick up cargo and passengers the Australian shipping companies will be placed in jeopardy. Those who have invested money in Australian - shipping enterprises surely deserve some - consideration. If the bill is passed unfairness and injustice must result. Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr; Pratten) could do something useful for the country by introducing a tariff revision to provide adequate protection for our manufacturing industries. In consequence of the lackadaisical manner in which his department is administered thousands of our people are unemployed. Instead of taking steps to remedy that situation he is proposing to dislocate our trade and industry still further. bill is not only a deadly blow at in dustry; it is also subversive of our ""White Australia policy. Under its provisions persons of all nationalities and colours will be permitted to trade on our coast in competition with our own people. Even that will not be the end of its disastrous effects. Although the Government disapproved of the action of the Commonwealth Shipping Board in entering into an agreement with the Seamen's Union, it is not justified on that account in introducing a measure which will practically cripple the board by obliging it to work its vessels in competition with ships that employ black labour. Commonwealth Shipping Line observes Australian standards in all respects; but the overseas ships which the Government proposes to permit to trade on our coast do not.",162
727,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,It is proposed to the power provided by this bill only to maintain essential services. Mr E . RILEY - That is what we are told; but once the Government gets the power it can use it according to its own sweet will . The ships of all nations will be able to trade on our coast.,162
728,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,That will depend upon what the proclamation provides.. It may be limited to certain ships. Mr E . RILEY - We have no information at all on that point.,162
729,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"No proclamation may be issued. Mr E . RILEY - P suppose that if the shipping dispute were settled to-morrowand we all hope that it will be settled shortly-the Government would not issue a proclamation. Our point, however, is that there is no need to give it the power to do so. Every honourable member who had anything to do with, passing the Navigation Act was proud that it made the best conditions in the world possible for Australian sailors. Under its proThe visions our seamen are treated as respectable men. I could understand a Government introducing this measure if we were in danger of annihilation or something like it ; but the mere fact that a dispute exists between the sTiip-owners and 'he seamen does not warrant its introduction. If the Prime Minister would only get off his high horse and call the parties to the dispute together, I believe that This a settlement might be effected; but by introducing this b i ll he is simply annoying the seamen. In effect he is saying to them, "" We have decided that you shall no longer enjoy the protection afforded you by the Navigation Act. You must compete with the black labour ships of other nations and take your chance with them."" That is an invitation to a fight to the bitter end. It is well known that the various industrial sections of our' community are united, and the in troduction of this measure may conceivably cause a general strike. The coalminers, for instance, may say that they The will strike in sympathy with the seamen, and the gas-workers, railwaymen and tramwaymen may follow their example.",162
730,Mr FOSTEH,Unknown,They have too much common sense to do that. Mr E. RILEY - If they are incensed use and excited by legislation of this character they may not use their common sense.,162
731,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"But the honourable member will advise them to do so? Mr E. EILEY - On every occasion when I return to Sydney, I do what I can to cause the sections of the community with which I come into contact to act as reasonable men. The plain fact is that the Government has taken sides with the ship-owners in this matter.",163
732,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"That is not true. Mr E. EILEY - I shall go further, and say that this measure was introduced at the instigation of the ship-owners. It is well known that the honourable mem bf his Western Australian colleagues, as well as some honourable members. who represent Tasmanian constituencies, have consistently advocated the suspension of those sections of the Navigation Act which prevent overseas vessels from engaging in our coastal trade. May I say, in passing, that Tasmania has been a most expensive state to the Commonwealth. Almost every year we are asked to grant money to it, and now we are invited to allow black labour vessels to call at its various ports and ship its apples aud other products. The present Attorney General (Sir Littleton Groom), Sir Elliot Johnson, the late Mr Tudor, arid many others whom I could name, wee proud that they helped to pass the Navigation Act. ""„ Mr Foster - But I fought it strenu.tously at every stage, and my attitude ha."" been justified over and over again. Mr E. RILEY - I will say that the honourable member for Wakefield has at least been consistent. Other countries have shown a tendency to imitate that act, and some of them have copied several of its provisions. Without any justification the Minister, with cool audacity, has flung this bill at the House. If it is passed, it will cut the heart out of the act. The usual procedure with bills is to adjourn the debate after the Minister has moved the second reading. What is the power behind this Government? Behind the National party is the Country party, and behind both is the shipping combine. All the interstate shippine companies are under the control of the Inchcape combine, which does not, of course, wish the Navigation Act to be continued because it wants to employ black-labour ships in our coastal trade. It is good policy for the combine to get the vital sections of the act repealed, and it will save thousands of pounds by the passing of this bill. The Minister did not explain ivhy he introduced the bill. He said that in case of emergency it would be put into operation, but not otherwise. I was on a royal commission which inquired into shipping, and one of the facts established was that the interstate shipping companies were under the control of the Inchcape combine. If the Government persists with this bill it will suffer when the next appeal is made to the. electors. Personally I shall fight every clause of it. If we could see a list of the shareholders of the different shipping companies, we should find in it the names of some of those honourable members who are defending this bill. It is deplorable that men should, in their own interests, vote in this House against the interests of the country. There has been no call by the general public for the bill. The repeal of the Navigation Act was not an issue at the last election. The Minister would be better employed in bringing down a tariff to protect local industries against oversea competition.",163
733,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I direct attention to the state of the House. \ Quorum formed.]  Government should certainly have the additional power which it is seeking. It is quite true, as the last speaker indicated, that members of all parties assisted in evolving the Navigation Act, which, I agree, is in advance of similar legislation in any other country. The people of Australia gave to the ship-owners and the seamen advantages that no other ship-owners or seamen enjoy. One object was to build up an Australian mercantile marine, but in that respect the act has completely failed. In view of the monopoly given by the people of Australia to the ship-owners and seamen, a natural and moral obligation rests upon them to provide the people with an uninterrupted shipping service. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) said that at the outset of this disturbance the Government was bludgeoning this bill through. I interiected that we had "" a before and a behind "" to this bill. We have iust passed through a very 3erious shipping dispute. Those honourable members who live in Melbourne and Sydney did not experience the full effect of it , but those who live in more remote places understand something of its persecuting influence. The women and children, to whom the Leader of the Opposition referred, have had to suffer for want of supplies because the public fe'ave superior conditions to the seamen and the shipping companies. We have seen how the kindness of the public has been requited. We have placed ourselves in a net by giving these organizations a monopoly. On the most trivial pretext they hold up the whole of the commerce of Australia. The women and children of Western Australia may be kept without sugar, but that does not seem to matter to that section of the community. It would appear, from ' the speeches of honourable members opposite, that if we do not consider exclusively those whom it is admitted we have treated most handsomely, we shall be involved in a serious industrial turmoil. That one section of the community should be greater than the whole, and greater than this Parliament, does not accord with my views. I am never ashamed to say what T conscientiously believe. I have already had a hand in framin g part of the report of the royal commission on the Navigation Act.",163
734,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Undoubtedly , and this bill is a result of that.  so far as I would like it to go. Four j f the seven honourable members on the royal commission recommended that the coastal clauses of the Navigation Act should be permanently repealed, but the Government does notseek to do that. merely seeks power to deal with a situation such as the people of Western Australia and Tasmania have recently suffered from. By passing the Navigation Act we placed ourselves in the hands of a dual monopoly - The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) seems to be ready to believe everything that the Tariff Board says. That body, reporting on the effect of the ' Navigation Act , saidMany 'bitter complaints have been' made to the Tariff Board that the working of the Navigation Act is acting detrimentally at present to the best interests of Australian industries, both primary and secondary. It was stressed whilst the Government professes to do all in its power to encourage - decentralization and the peopling of our distant parts, yet it endorses the policy of the Navigation Act, which more than any otner legislation discourages the settler on our coasts far removed from industrial centres. It was also urged that the oversea merchants arc assisted in their trade against our own producers by the fact that our present method of administering our shipping laws places heavy freights on our own products whilst overseas goods are carried for much lower freights. . 'Ihe board found that this discontent existed in all states, but that the application was most keenly felt in Western Australia and Queensland. Not only is the freight on Australian goods shipped to these states high, but the heavy freight in return places the producers at a serious disadvantage when endeavouring to compete with imported goods shipped to the other states. Representations have also been made to the board in regard to the serious disadvantage imposed on Tasmania by the' restriction in shipping upon which she has solely to depend. Inquiries made by the board showed that the cost of shipping certain goods from South Australia to Western Australia was greater than the cost of shipping them from Europe to Western Australia. Again, it was frequently stated to the board that the freight on butter from Queensland to other states was much heavier than from New Zealand to Australia. The board has no hesitation in reporting that the present Navigation Act is working very detrimentally against the best interests of the primary and secondary producers. Much of the benefit conceded by the tariff is lost through the additional cost in freight on Australiau goods, and our primary producers and manufacturers will not be able to obtain the full share of the markets they are entitled to until some other methods can be adopted to provide a service that will not place our shippers at a disadvantage. Notwithstanding the sacrifices which the community has made in order to give advantages to the seamen and the shipIt ping companies, the people are on tenterhooks the whole time. They never know when the whole shipping industry may not be held up. That is the effect of delivering ourselves wholly into the hande of the Australian shipping companies and the seamen. Sometimes people have to wait for days at remote ports for an Australian boat to give them a passage to another portion of the Commonwealth, although vessels carrying mails from Europe are calling at the ports and.leaving with empty passenger accommodation.",164
735,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I think the honourable member's speech deserves more attention than it is receiving. I therefore call attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.]  seamen may have the excellent conditions that they enjoy, the shipping services have been curtailed. which next year will celebrate the centenary of its foundation, had a better shipping service twenty years ago, when it had 25 per cent, less population than it has now. At one time about eight ships called at that port every month, but now not more than two ships call there. The shipping service has been reduced in order to confer advantages upon the Australian seamen and shipping companies.",164
736,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that that is not correct.  tributory cause is said to be the competition of the East-West railway with the shipping companies. Nevertheless, the shipping combine has control of the whole of the coastal trade, and has parcelled out the coastline amongst its constituent companies. Each company fixes its scale of charges and time-table, and because there . is no competition, the public can take what is offered, or go without. That is ' why four of the seven members of the royal commission on navigation recommended the permanent repeal of a portion of the Navigation Act. I , as one of the four, must support the Government in seeking power to ensure that if the shipping services become worse, the Australian people shall receive some consideration. No section should be more powerful than the whole community. Why should Parliament wait, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested, u n t i l the trouble becomes acute before conferring these emergency powers upon the Government? The national government, no matter from .what party it is formed, should be supreme; neither Walsh nor any other man should be above the Government that is kept in power by a Parliament elected . by the people. Honourable members may be interested to hear a short summary of the principal conclusions contained in the majority report of the royal commission on navigationPURPOSE OF NAVIGATION ACT. The Navigation Aet has failed in its purpose, namely, to establish an Australian mercantile marine. It is quite true that outside capitalists in. have obtained a controlling interest i some Australian shipping companies. NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA. The states of New South Wales and Victoria have no complaints against the act, which are Albany, not common to all states. The outlying parts of the Commonwealth are more severely affected than the large centres of New South Wales and Victoria. QUEENSLAND. 1. The statement of the Tariff Board ""that much of the benefit conceded by the tariff is lost through additional cost in freight on Australian goods"" has proved correct, and examples in Queensland are the cement industry and the maize-growing industry. 2. In connection with the Queensland fruit industry, the only way that the operation of the Navigation Act could be attributable to the unsatisfactory handling and carriage of fruit is that, in the absence of the competitive element in this trade, no attempt is made by the shipping companies to handle the products on modern scientific lines. And therefore it is more profitable to transport the f r u it by train. 3. The monopoly of the interstate shipping is responsible, to a large extent, for the decline of the timber industry in the Innisfail district. 4. In regard to the effect of the act on the meat industry of Queensland, there is no doubt that the act has restricted the interstate trade, and the -"" permit"" system, under section 286 of the act, has not been sufficiently workable to enable the meat industry to take practical advantage of it. All these disabilities having been imposed for the benefit of the seamen, it is reasonable that the Government should be given control even of them. TASMANIA. 1. The Navigation Act is responsible for the cessation of several important oversea and interstate shipping services to Hobart. 2. The cessation of such services has militated against the building up of the tourist traffic of Tasmania, and that state has suffered thereby. 3. The Tasmanian timber industry has been severely handicapped through the restriction of shipping services with South Tasmania, and considerable trade, particularly with New Zealand and South Australia, has been lost thereby. . 4. Since the act came into operation, the mail steamers will not visit Hobart except under contract to lift large cargoes of fruit. This has affected Tasmania in two ways, firstly, by depriving the fruit industry of a regular and satisfactory shipping service to the English market, and secondly, by hindering a wealthy class of tourist visiting that state. Referring to the disabilities' complained' of in Western Australia, the report says1. The act, toy helping to keep freights on a high level, has seriously affected primary production in Western Australia, and. has made trade relations with the eastern states primary and secondary productions almost n impossible. By high freights, all importations from other states are made more costly. and thereby trade with the rest of Australia becomes difficult. We cannot even be customers of the eastern states because of the shipping difficulties. The report continues2. The timber industry of Western Australia is suffering at the hands of the shipping monopoly of the interstate trade, made possible by the coastal trading provisions of the Navigation Act, which has resulted in hign timber freight and insufficient cargo space lor timber from Western Australia. 3. The prosperity of Albany has been prejudicially affected' by the operation of the act, and the district of Albany at present has insufficient passenger and cargo shipping service. 4. The port of Geraidton has declined by reason of the fact that since the Navigation Act came into operation the irregularity ana infrequency of shipping services to that port prevented the merchants of that place obtaining tlieir merchandise promptly on through bills of lading. 5. That the "" permits"" granted to certain vessels trading in the north-west coast of Australia are essential to the development of the north-west of Australia, and if these permits were discontinued the growth of settlement there would be retarded. 6. The Navigation Act was to a considerable extent responsible for the failure of an. attempt to develop the whaling industry in Western Australia. In view of the advantages secured by Parliament to the seamen of Australia, is it too much to ask a guarantee of a regular and efficient service from them ? I do not"" think that is an unreasonable request.",165

The sugar-growers of Queensland do not give consumers in Western Australia a proper service. Like those engaged in the shipping industry, they do not play the game. The report continuesTHE SiiirriNG COMPANIES OF AUSTRALIA. 1. The interstate shipping companies of Australia are to a great extent owned and controlled by British oversea shipping companies. 2. The interstate shipping companies have large interests in the key industries of Australia. FREIGHTS GENERALLY. 1. Freights generally on the Australian coast are abnormally high when compared with oversea freights, but from tliese high freights the shipping companies are not nmking exorbitant profits in view of the enormous increases in expenses. Since this report was issued, an additional report has been received from the Auditor General's Department, which went into the accounts of certain shipping companies, and, taking into consideration their association with other concerns, their profits are shown to have been better than appeared at first sight2. Such freights are too high for the primary and secondary producers, especially to tliose who have to compete in the open markets of the world. NA NA There being fewer passenger ships regularly . engaged on the Australian coast now than in 1914, the facilities of travelling by oversea vessels having been taken away, and the popur lution of Australia having materially increased during the ten years from 1914 to 1924, it is obvious that the above complaint has real foundation in fact. THE "" PERMIT "" SYSTEM. The "" permit"" system under section 286 of the act has failed in its purpose, namely, to' provide that passengers and cargo may be carried between interstate ports when an interstate vessel is not available. This is another way in which, in view of the benefits they enjoy, the seamen and shipping companies might do a little for the people of Australia. When we ask for a permit, it has to be determined whether there is an adequate shipping service, and that is lef t entirely to the shipping companies to decide. Oversea vessels are afraid to ask for permits to carry passengers lest they should be declared "" black."" This is no way to treat a country in which seamen are given conditions better than those enjoyed by seamen in any other country.",166

The following recommendations were signed by two other commissioners:\'our commissioners therefore recommend:(1) That the coastal trading provisions of the Navigation Act be repealed. , (2) That there be substituted adequate duties, under the Customs Tariff Act, upon foreign shipping, with a lesser preferential rate upon British shipping, calculated in the case of cargoes upon the rates of freight charged per ton, and, in the case of passengers, upon the fares charged.

742,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.40] - I hope that the action of the Government in introducing this bill is the most iniquitous that it will perpetrate during its career. I regard it very seriously, and am very much annoyed about it , but I do not suppose that matters to honourable members opposite. I resent being driven into a frame of mind in which I want to fight. T am disposed to use the language of those who fought in France to express my opinion of this measure. I regard it as a base betrayal, and an attempt to undo beneficent legislation of the last twenty years. At one fell swoop the Government proposes to put the seamen of this country back where they were twenty years ago. Ministers do this gloatingly and without the of an eyelid. I am prepared to fight for the eeamen as I ' would for those with whom I have worked myself. I ask honourable members not to attempt to put it over me that this is a measure merely to give the Government u power which they can hold in reserve.

The benefits for which men have struggled for years are, under this measure, to be taken away from them. The members of the . Government, in my opinion, will do the job just as relentlessly and callously as they are putting this measure through the House. Their action is malicious. They are blood-drunk, if I may apply the term politically. They are going to take away all the benefits that have been won by the seamen, who have less opportunity than other workers of getting anything done politically. The reason for this is that they are most of their time away from their home ports, and must depend on land-lubbers to do the work they require done. I am glad to say that their workers ashore have The evi- been f a it h f u l to them, and have used their influence in their behalf. As a result of the work which has been done in the past, the seamen enjoy as fine conditions as seamen in any part of the world enjoy. . It is the pride of Aus-' tralians that we - have not to say that we had to go to Great Britain for such legislation as has been passed in the interests of seamen. The Minister quoted Great Britain and New Zealand. Away with them! What do Ave care f o i Great Brita in or New Zealand? Australia stands on its own. It sets its own standards and does its own job. It is not to be dragged at the heels of any other country that does not see fit to adopt its standards. I may be told that I am a red-ragger. I have been one, and I hope I shall never change until I get what I want. I am like the kiddy in the bath: I want the soap, and I won't stop crying u n t i l I get it.

When I asked the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) whom he would deport, he gave the name of a man who had rendered this great service to this community.

It that seamen shall no longer live in Ihe forecastle of a ship without, the opportunity to escape in the event of an accident. No longer have the men to get their food at the cook's galley and sit about anywhere to eat it. In manv other respects their health and comfort are considered. On certain vessels communication has to be provided. suspension of the coastal provisions of the act will do away with all this. The hon who was a member of the tion Commission, omitted tion that one reason why the traffic to Tasmania had fallen was that people objected on the smaller vessels. They wanted to make the '.' apple trip "" on the liners. The statement that the Navigation Act is damaging Tasmanian interests backed up by the evidence. South Australia, the following 13 contained in the general resumS of evidence on page 8 of the report signed by the honourable member for Forrest and <he Sfr. Yates. for honourable member for Franklin (Mr SeaGuthrie, brook)Hughes-but The chief complaint, however, was made by the timber industry. As South Australia is not a timber-producing state to any appredid their ciable extent, she requires to import a great them. proportion of her requirements. It was stated that the principal hardwood timbers are obtained from Western Australia and Tasmania, and that in recent years considerable difficulty has been experienced in fulfilling orders. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Foster) did not tell the House that the Patrick Shipping Company was able to cut into the Gulf trade of South Auslegislation traha because shippers were being over the charged. Rates were reduced by 10 per fifteen cent., but eventually the Patrick Steamship Company had to get out. The I always evidence tendered in South Australia indifor sea- cated that the grievance against the ect was not so great as in the more distant parts of the Commonwealth. It would appear, therefore, that the suspension of 'he different. coastal provisions of the act would not mean a great deal to South Australia.  and the disadvantages in regard to freight rates were common to all the states. For- Mr YATES - The Commissioner ol Audit, who went into the position of the different steamship companies, reported before they were not making any undue profits provides from their operations. In the report signed by myself, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey), and Senator MCHugh, it is shown that in America, South Africa, and other parts of the world where black labour is employed on vessels, freights are comparable with those ruling on the Australian coast. In some instances rates are. lower in Australia.  The might tell the House why a manufacturei obtained timber from Noumea when suitable timber could have been obtained in Queensland.

744,Mr YATES,Unknown,Evidenc e was invited from a number of persons. The Navigation Act is not responsible for the present position of Albany. The construction of the east-west railway line is a very i m portant factor. Prior to railway communication there was important passenger traffic in coastal steamers between the eastern states and Albany.,169
745,Unknown,Unknown,"Sitting suspended from 12 to 1 a.m. (Friday). Friday, 11th July, 1925.",169
746,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I have contended that the bill should not have been introduced, because there was really no necessity for the amendment of the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act. This contention is supported - by the findings of the Navigation Commission of which I was a member. The Navigation Commission submitted three reports, _ two signed by two members, and one signed by three members. None of them bears out the contention that in the case of Tasmania and Western Australia the coastal provisions of the act should be suspended. I shall quote certain portions of the report relating to coastal trade and commerce. P r i o r to the commission being appointed, it was stated that the Navigation Act had had a hampering effect upon the trade and development of the Commonwealth, but the reports of the commission are to the contrary. It is urged that Tasmania, owing to its isolation from the mainland, is detrimentally affected by the provisions of the act. While I admit that the cessation of our shipping services has a worse effect on that state than it has on the mainland, yet the statement that the act has had a hampering effect upon Tasmania is not borne out by the report signed by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr . Prowse), and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook). The report of the commission reads:According to figures .placed before your commissioners, 500 people visited .Tasmania by means of the ""apple tri|>"" in 1313, and in 1914 this number increased to 1,000. It is claimed that the number of wealthy tourists was increased, and that this branch of the traffic was being built up, when the war stopped it, and the Navigation Act prevented its revival. As against this argument, evidence was furnished by the representatives of the interstate shipping companies that the service provided by them is ample, and for more than half of the year their vessels from Sydney to Hobart, and Melbourne to Launceston have a great percentage of empty passenger accommodation. Tbis is proved amply, but' evidence was also brought forward that during the"" tourist season these vessels are always full, and are crowded to a great extent. It was shown that at the time of the Melbourne Cup and other gala periods the passenger accommodation was full y taxed. That is no argument for the sus(midnight) pension of the provisions of the Navigation Act, because with or without them these periods of activity will always recur. Another report was signed by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey), Senator MCH u g h , and myself. We dealt exhaustively with the position of Tasmania as affected by the act. F r u it is the staple industry of that State, although I admit that the tourist traffic is a great factor in its prosperity. In dustries have been established there by Pascal's, Cadbury's, Fry's, and the Electrolytic Zinc Company. These, together with the hydro-electric scheme, make it quite possible that Tasmania will develop, notwithstanding the retarding effect of its isolation from the mainland. Australia has never had a greater era of prosperity than it has at present. The Arbitration Court has given the workers a higher standard of living, and the community has not suffered in consequence. The captains of industry and the primary producers of Australia cannot complain. If the working man is on a. good wicket, the primary producer and the manufacturer are on a very much better one. The Navigation Commission, dealing with Tasmania's f r u it export, statedI t was asserted that the oversea fruit export of Tasmania has been seriously injured reason of the Navigation Act. The Tasmanian the Navigation Aet. fruit exports overseas are as follows:FRUIT EXPORT OVERSEAS. Pre-war record-191 4 Since war1920 1921 . . . .. Since Navigation Act1922 .. 1923 ..

747,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,The State Government spends a large amount of money on tourist traffic.,170
748,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I have quoted figures respecting the passenger traffic from the mainland to Tasmania to show that the operation of the Navigation Act has not had a detrimental effect on that state's tourist traffic. I admit that a certain class of persons will not travel on the interstate ships. The commission received in evidence a telegram which had been sent from Tasmania to Mr Hughes when he was Prime Minister. In reply, Mr Hughes said that the conditions relating to the shipping services of Australia were not to be broken down to meet the wishes of the fastidious few who refused to travel on interstate boats. The honourable member for Bass said that the tourist industry had been hampered by the operation of the Navigation Act.",170

751,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,Thos e were strike years.,170
752,Mr YATES,Unknown,"They are the only' postwar years when the coastal provisions of the act were not operating. In 1922, which was after they were proclaimed, the-passengers totalled 9,083, and in 1923 the total was 10,851. The report alsogives the following totals: Mainland passengers into Tasmania during two yearsPrior to the war (1013 and 1914), 78,543. Prior to the act (1920-21), 65,526. Since the act' (1922-3), 83,272. It cannot be argued, therefore, that the operation of these sections has been detrimental to Tasmania from the tourist point, of view, for the evidence reveals that in, the two years following their proclamation nearly 18,000 more travellers went there than in the two post-war yearsbefore their proclamation, and nearly 5,000 more than in 1913 and 1914. I ' direct the attention of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) to a paragraph from the last annual report that the Hobart Chamber of Commerce issued 1 prior to the preparation of this report. I If any authority is able to gauge thevolume of the tourist traffic to Tasmania the Hobart Chamber of Commerce should' be able to do so. The paragraph readsLast season provided a record . . . Business people of the city who deal direct with"" the tourist traffic report a record business. Port Arthur is a good index, and the guides employed there to show visitors over the ruins dealt with larger numbers than ever before That does not suggest stagnation. Surely the honourable member for Bass cannot vote for this measure on the ground lhat the operation of the coastal sections of the act have been detrimental to Tasmania.",170
753,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,I shall vote for it only in order that its provisions may be used under strike conditions.,171
754,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I will concede the honourable member his point, but let me assure him that the difficulties of Tasmania's situation will not be overcome, even if the coastal provisions of the Navigation A ct are suspended. If the niggerworked Inchcape, Norddeutscher - Lloyd, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and Dutch Packet lines attempt to impose upon our wharf labourers any other than Australian conditions there will be trouble. Australian unionists will not take that sort of thing lying down. I do not make that statement in a threatening way. I wish it to be understood that, having strugglsd hard to win for themselves the conditions that they now enjoy, they will fight to the last ditch to retain them. For the time being the Government may glory in its power, but the day of reckoning will come. I have quoted the report of two commissioners who represented the other side of the House, and also that of two commissioners who represented this side. I propose now to quote the findings of Senator Elliot t and Senator Duncan, who were members of the commission. Although the honourable member for Forrest claims that they agreed with his report, I propose to show that they did so with important reservations and qualifications. They stated in regard to Tasmania generallyThere were no complaints against the act from ' the north-west ports, which enjoy good shipping services. I invite the Minister for Trade and Customs to study that statement, and also this one that immediately follows it Generally speaking, the case put forward by Hobart against the operation of the Navigation Act was not convincing.",171
755,Mr JACKSON,Unknown,I am with the honourable member there.,171
756,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The report proceedsCertainly the port of Hobart, for reasons arising out of the war, the Navigation Act, and the cutting of the Panama Canal, lost certain oversea and interstate shipping services which it previously enjoyed. In those cases where the interstate services have been curtailed it was shown clearly by the shipping companies that the trade did not' warrant the continuance of""the service. This referred to the Hobart-Melbourne, Hobart-New Zealand, . and Hobart-Strahan-Melbourne services. A dispassionate witness in Tasmania was the State Government Statisticion, whose evidence was interesting. He stated that Tasmania was not seriously suffering by reason of the Navigation Act, and that the outcry against the act bordered on 'exaggeration, and was a symptom of a bad disease. He stated that Tasmania was in such a desperate financial plight that the people had to blame something, and in Hobart one of the chief objects of abuse was the Navigation Act. That gentleman must be regarded as an authoritative witness, who would not decry his state without good reason. I submit, therefore, that the evidence is overwhelming that the operation of the coastal provisions of the act has not detrimentally affected Tasmania. The remarks that I have made with respect to Tasmania apply also to Albany, in Western Australia, which is suffering from various changes that have been made in world shipping arrangements. The report signed by Senator MCHugh, the honourable member for Bourke (Mr . Anstey), and myself statesPassenger vessels in and out of Albany have been reduced owing to the thousands of passengers drawn off by the East-West railway. It is admitted (question 4092) that "" cargo boats have been put on in their place."" These increased cargo facilities have not revived Albany trade. There is a continuous decline in the supply of exportable cargo from Albany for anywhere-overseas , interstate, or coastal. Imports show a similar decline. This goes on while other ports under the same act are nourishing. The causes are outside and anterior to the act. Albany witnesses made the following statements :1. Interstate sea carriage of passengers seriously affected by the East-West railway (question 4903). Had there been no trans-Australian railway, Albany would have been in a better position (question 4466). 2. District has become more self-contained, therefore importing less (questions 4014, 4464).  tions.",171
757,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The honourable member ought to produce facts to support his contention. My statements are based on the evidence given by business people and residents of Albany. I do not doubt that the honourable member sees things from a different point of view. The ship that brought me out to Australia called, at K i ng George's Sound, but I doubt very much whether that would be the first port of call today. The shipping companies cannot be expected to send ships to Albany to pick up a few tourists for the east, especially when the tourists' view often is that the steamship companies may "" g o hang."" Many people would rather travel 1,000 miles by rail than 50 miles by water. I quote again fro m page 39 of the report-Oversea ships call at Albany for cargo, but - cargo not offering. Very little cargo for either overseas or state. Only small amount of cargo offering. Coastal trade between Albany and other Western Australian ports fallen off. Presume railways carry more and coastal boats less. Wagin nearer to Albany and a cheaper freight to Albany than Fremantle, but Wagin merchants prefer to buy in Fremantle. Not the .same demand for coal from the Eastern states. There is one significant feature of the decline of Albany. Business men from Wagin, who, I suppose, know their own interests best, stated in evidence that it paid them better to have their goods sent to Fremantle for distribution to Wagin, than to consign them via Albany. The cargoes that go to Fremantle are larger than those that go to Albany, and the trade centralized in Fremantle is increasing at the expense of the outer ports.",171
758,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,That does not affect the present situation. Does the honourable member say that no ships should call at Albany f,172
759,Mr YATES,Unknown,Evidenc e was given to us that more cargo space and passenger accommodation were offered to Albany than Albany could accept. Ships have called at Albany for cargo when there has been noneto pick up.,172
760,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The provisions in the bill are for abnormal times, when no boats are running.",172
761,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The honourable member's view is not the same as that of the hon who has lived for the day when the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act will be repealed. He wants to see ships manned by black labour call at Albany, and when they do he will pay his passenger fare to Melbourne out of the £1.000 a year that a grateful country gives him, and will thus swell the profits of shipping companies that employ, not Australian, but black labour. If the Peninsular and Oriental boats are put on that service, the honourable member will travel by them. ",172
762,Mr YATES,Unknown,"The honourable member does not mind how he spends the good Commonwealth money he receives. He does not concern himself whether it goes to support black, blue, or brindle boats. When the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) speaks on this subject he will be more vehement than the honourable member for Forrest in urging that the ships with black crews call at Tasmanian ports. These people want the companies owning such boats to take their profits inter- out of the workers of this community. The bill is not intended merely to meet the present situation. The Government saw an opportunity to repeal the Navigation Act, and made necessity its excuse. It brought in the bill as "" a little bit of bak sheesh,"" as we used to say in France, when we got something for nothing, on top of the Immigration Bill . It was stated when the Immigration Bill was being discussed that the Government had power to deport undesirables. It also has power to exempt any ship fro m the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act. Let the Minister tell the House how many applications he has had to suspend the coastal provisions of the act. Let him also tell us how many applications have not been, but should have been, granted. The Government has not attempted to make the act serviceable. The - administration of the act is much like rhe management of state enterprises. In nine cases out of ten state undertakings are controlled by people who do not believe in Government ownership, and do not want to make successes of them. A man who went with his own whaling ship to the north-west of Western Australia applied to the department for a permit to bring oil down from the whaling station to Fremantle, but he could not get it . He had to bring his ship down in ballast, and oil that should have been sold in Australia was sent overseas. That was not due to defects in the Navigation Act, but to want of sympathetic administration. The Minister has not said why the bill is needed, or how it will be operated. He is tearing down one of the coping-stones of Labour's legislative edifice. The bill affects a large number of men who are entitled to every consideration from the land dwellers of this continent. If the Seamen's Union is the cause of the present trouble, the Minister has no right on that account to interfere with the N a v i gation Act. If the object is to penalize the seamen, he should interfere with the sections that affect the seamen, but he should not interfere with the conditions of the cooks, pantrymen, engineers, stewards, and others that make up a ship's complement.  when the ships are held up?",172
763,Mr YATES,Unknown,"-The Government should go to the root of the trouble. No honourable member has attempted to do that. The source of the trouble was stated in the Herald last night. It was the action of the Commonwealth Government Line ir. chartering the Volumma and the Clan Munro. I saw' the Clan Munro at Perth. She was full of niggers. The cause of this dispute was not Walsh, not Johannsen, not the Seamen's Union, not trade unionism, but an organized effort by the Government nominees on the Commonwealth Shipping Board to break down the provisions of the Navigation Act. Let. supporters of the Government talk, not about the Navigation Act, but about the Shipping Board, which has made a mess of the whole business. The Government has been very fond of boards, and has created more than any other Government. It is booming financial interests, with a board; it is making a big mess of the North-irn Territory, with a board ; and it has made a big mess of the industrial situation, with a board. Why does not the Government consult the Shipping Board about the origin of the trouble? Why does it not sav to the board, "" Why did you do this foolish thing? You knew you were dealing with Australians who would not quietly allow you to filch these conditions from them without a strike?""",173

765,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Richmond) [1.45 a.m..] - Notwithstandin g that the Houso has been sitting almost continuously for 35 hours, I shall attempt to answer a few of the arguments that have been advanced by honourable members opposite. honourable member for Adelaide (Mr . Yates) told us a lot concerning the in vestigations by the Navigation Commission, but I draw attention to the fact that the powers conferred by this bill will be used only in circumstances of . urgent necessity. Except in an emergency, no government would dare to propose (he suspension of those portions of the Navigation Act that relate to the coasting - trade, and the bill provides that the Government shall present to Parliament each year a report stating the number of cases in which it has exercised this power and the reason for so doing. That requirement will certainly act as a brake upon any government which might be desirous of using these powers and dispensations other than as this Parliament intends. It is necessary that the Government of the day should have power to deal with abnormal circumstances. The present law is rathar too stringent, and the bill will enable the Government to ensure the carrying on of essential services, so that communities in distant parts of the Commonwealth and on the islands controlled by Australia shall not be unduly penalized during an industrial upheaval. Whether or not any good will result from this measure I am not prepared to say, but I believe that its very presence on the statute-book will have an influence in maintaining essential services. The honourable member for Adelaide appeared to be obsessed with the idea, that the bill is designed to abolish by underhand means those safeguards to the Australian mercantile marine that are contained in the Navigation Act. I do not believe that. This power of dispensation is not to be applied indiscriminately to all shipping that comes upon the coast; it is to be limited to such ships or classes of ships as the Minister deems fit, and he will have to answer to Parliament for any transgression of the White Australia policy. No government would dare to grant exemptions to a company that employed black labour upon its vessels; or if any government did so dare, it would perish at. the succeeding general election.",173
766,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,What about the Peninsular and Oriental Company ?,173
767,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,I do not believe that the Peninsular and Oriental Company would be granted a dispensation under this Bill .,173
768,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Is the honourable member aware that the trade on the north-west coast is done by licensed ships? The Mr R GREEN - I would oppose any government that allowed ships manned by coloured labour to compete with Australian ships manned by whites. There is no necessity for the Government lo do that. Plenty of foreign vessels worked with white crews come to Australia, and they could be utilized for the maintenance of necessary services; or alternatively, the Commonwealth or State Governments, could charter vessels and place white crews in charge of them. I personally would prefer that these permits or should be given only to vessels on the British register. danger of coloured labour of which we have heard eo much is a bogy, because no government would get support from honourable members if it waived the provisions of the Navigation Act in respect of a ship worked by a black crew. Some time ago I drew attention to the fact that the Seamen's Union which is causing so much trouble today is not only un-Australian but, in its opposition to the White Australian policy, is deliberately anti-Australian. It is a remarkable fact that during the debate to-night honourable members opposite have said nothing about the Seamen's Union. Do they support it or are they afraid to express their views in regard to it? If they are not afraid I hope that some of them will tell us whether or not they approve of the policy of the union.",173
769,Mr WEST,Unknown,The honourable member heard what was said by the honourable member for Adelaide regarding the origin of the present trouble.,174
770,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"I did, but I have my own view as to how that trouble originated.",174
771,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member may have his own view, but there can be only one set of facts.",174
772,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,And the construction placed upon those facts depends upon one's prejudices.,174
773,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member consider that the attitude of the seamen in the present dispute is unreasonable?,174
774,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"I do not hide my views regarding the Seamen's Union, but regarding the present dispute, I shall express no opinion, because I believe that there is.a possibility of a settlement, and I do not want to say anything that would hinder it . I read that last Sunday out official of the union stated, "" The war io on."" It has been on for a long timo. T wish to place on record a few episodes in the history of the union which have forced me to the conclusion that some disciplinary measures are desirable. It may be necessary for the Minister to use rh? powers conferred by this bill sooner than some of us contemplate. Mr O ' KEEFE - B e ' fair and admit that before any official of the union said ' ' the dispensations war ison,"" the Prime Minister had spoken of a fight to a finish. The alleged Mr R GREEN - The Prime Minister is reported to have made that statement, but I did not hear him say it . For a considerable time past the war of which the union official spoke has been in progress. One vessel, the Eomura, was held up for eighteen days in Newcastle, because a member of the crew had damaged his thumb in a 'fight ashore. The union contended that the damage had been caused on the vessel and claimed that the man'i wages should be paid while he was in capacitated. Three other vessels were held up on account of that dispute, but when the claim was heard by the President of the Arbitration Court he unhesitatingly found against the union and said that there was no justification for the seamen's action. Here is another case:Certain members of the crew of the Saros were imprisoned, uncier the Justices Act of South Australia, for refusing to pay a fine inflicted by a police magistrate. The union demanded that their wages should be paid whilst they were in prison, although the Navigation Act clearly provides that seamen are not entitled to wages w/iilst in prison. Tfie ship was delayed for no less than 119 days on this account. Last December, the Clan Munro, an overseas vessel, was declared black by the Seamen's Union, and the waterside workers having agreed to work her, the Seamen's Union retaliated upon , the watersiders by instructing the donkeymen not to raise steam to work cargo for in terstate steamers. The vessel in connection with which the dispute arose was an overseas vessel, and yet interstate vessels were held up through the action of the Seamen's Union. Here is another case which occurred last A p r i l , the vessel concerned being another interstate vessel, the Cooma. I quote the following report of the case:One Saturday, at Brisbane, the union delegate on the vessel stated that the crew refused to take the ship to sea until they had consulted the local secretary of the Seamen's Union over a dispute which had arisen amongst themselves. He did not himself know the nature of the dispute. The local secretary could not be got into touch with until the Monday, when he came down to the steamer, and said that the men now admitted that the ca.use of dispute was all a fabrication. So. it was then found that the vessel might sail away, after having been delayed over the week-end for no cause whatever.",174
775,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member might leave it at that now. Things look pretty good.,175
776,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"I will leave it at that at the honourable member's suggestion, but he should remember that reports such as he is now relying upon have appeared in the press day after day for some time past, and he knows the effect attributed to hope deferred. three months of last year, ships engaged in the Australian trade lost 524 days, and during the three months ending the 30th June of this year they lost 687 days. I sliould like to refer now to the mock in dignation which honourable members opposite have expressed concerning the action of the Prime Minister in asking the Shipping Board for information about the agreement entered into for manning the ships of the Gommonwealth line. I have heard the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) on several occasions ask the Prime Minister concerning pay for holidays at Cockatoo Dock, requesting him, with the approval of honourable members opposite, to approach the Shipping Board on behalf of certain employees of the board. In one breath honourable members opposite assert that the Shipping Board should be independent of political control, and in the next they, demand that it should not be so. They cannot have it both ways. I presume that the .honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) will give the House the benefit of his views on the way in which the bill is likely to affect Tasmania. I have no doubt that other members of the House will be as pleased as I shall be to listen to him. We have heard the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) speaking as a representative of Tasmania on this subject, and have heard his remarks refuted by an honourable member who does not represent a Tasmanian constituency, but who visited the state to take certain evidence as a member of a royal commission. Just as the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) invited an expression of opinion on this bill from the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), I . in v it e the honourable member for Denison to say what he thinks of it . We should hear something also from my namesake, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr . A. Green) about the way in which the Navigation Act affects Western Australia. In conclusion, I want to say that the most important consideration in this matter is whether 8,000 men belonging to the Seamen's Union, who by their own deliberate acts have set themselves outside the law, should be permitted to hold 6,000,000 of people in Australia by the throat, or During should be forced into submission by the rest of the community. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) struck a sentimental note when he talked of the sufferings of wives and children, but I should like to know from him whether the rest of the people of Australia are to suffer because of the deliberate act of the seamen in placing themselves outside the law The real question at issue is whether that small section shall be upheld, or whether the community generally shall be given first consideration.

OONAH AND LOONGANA EXEMPT. It was definitely stated yesterday by Mr C. ONEILL, assistant secretary of the Melbourne branch of the Seamen's Union, that the Tas36 manian steamers Loongana and Oonah would 22 continue the mail service between Melbourne and Tasmania without interruption. 14 The Seamen's Union, he said, had come to an agreement with the State Labour party (at ATES. present in power in Tasmanian Parliament) that Tasmania would not be put to inconvenience through the dispute as far as the seamen were concerned, but that the union would see that crews were provided for the Loongana and Oonah as long as tliose vessels ran under the old articles (granting award rates and conditions to seamen), which, in the case of both tliese vessels, do not expire until the end of August. The Oonah is due to leave for Burnie today. , This is a d e f in it e statement by an officia l of the u n i o n that was so severely conThompson, V.

The maintenance of communication with that state is a Commonwealth responsibility, not only in time of shipping trouble, but all the time. It is just as much the responsibility of the Commonwealth to maintain a shipping service between Tasmania and the mainland as it is to"" maintain the train service on the trans-Australian line. The people of Tasmania contribute to the cost of that railway, and are, therefore, entitled to receive some measure of justice at the hands of the .Commonwealth Government. There was recently formed in Tasmania an organization known as the Tasmanian State Eights League. In the bill is a provision empowering the Government to suspend the Navigation Act, and among a number of requests which have been drawn up by that league for presentation to the Commonwealth Government is one for the suspension of the coastal sections of the Navigation Act, so far as they relate to passengers. The league realizes that the act was intended to help to build up an Australian mercantile marine, and that this could not be brought about unless Australian-owned, vessels were able to obtain cargoes. The league's request is a reasonable one, because there is nothing to prevent the Government from giving the right to carry passengers to oversea vessels which call at Tasmania during three months of the year to pick up fruit cargoes. But the Tasmanian Bights League does not ask that these boats should be allowed to carry cargoes between Australian ports.. The true solution of the Tasmanian shipping difficulty will not be obtained by this bill, or by the other measure which was passed a few hours ago. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), when in Tasmania twelve months ago suggested as the true solution of Tasmania's difficulties, a Commonwealth owned and controlled line of up-to-date passenger and cargo steamers to trade between the mainland and the ports of Tasmania. Until that comes about Tasmania will never be free from continuous shipping trouble. The men employed on these vessels, from the skipper downwards, would be public servants.",176
779,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,On the same lines as the railways?,177
780,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,Yes . This line of steamers would be run on the same lines as are other Commonwealth utilities under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. The advantage would be that the m.en employed on these boats would have continuous employment.,177
781,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Iio w would the honourable member get rid of the seamen if they became objectionable?,177
782,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"In the-same way as the Commonwealth discharges any public servant who becomes objectionable. That difficulty is easily overcome. It is evident that the Commonwealth Government, by introducing this bill, is in agreement with the ship-owners.",177
783,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The honourable member knows that the Australian shipowners oppose the exemption of Tasmania from the operation of the Navigation Act. Mr OKEEFE:-This bill seems to be a change of front which I cannot understand. If the bill is passed the Australian shij>ping trade must, unless the Australian mercantile marine is prepared to cut wages, fall, to a large extent, into the hands of its competitors. I am sure that the majority of the people of Australia, would not favour the lowering of the wages of Australian seamen. The Commonwealth Government shipping line has agreed to continue to run its vessels. Whether it will do so if this legislation is passed, and its provisions put into operation, remains to be seen. If the Australian ship-owners here lay up their vessels the suspension of the coastal provisions of the act will permit foreign going vessels, manned by cheap labour, to enter into competition with the Commonwealth Government Line, with the result that many of our seamen will be discharged, ancl those remaining in the employ of the line will probably have to accept a reduction in wages. I have no time for job control, and neither have the great majority"" of Australian unionists. There is power to deal with breaches of the law under our present legislation, and if the Government had any courage at all it would deal direct .with the lawbreakers instead of bringing down panic legislation. I earnestly desire to see a settlement of the shipping trouble, so that the people of Australia shall not suffer. I cannot resist quoting from a speech delivered by Senator Pearce in the Senate on the 31st August, 1910, when, as a Minister of the Labour Government, he introduced the Navigation Bill. Hansard report readsI propose to confine my remarks largely to principles; and I may say that this measure contains the principle that the Australian coastal trade shall he reserved exclusively for vessels complying with Australian conditions. The Government contend that this is in accord with the protective principle which has been adopted in regard to trade in other directions. We haye to remember that, in building up our mercantile marine, it is necessary for us to adopt a similar method to that which has been adopted in relation to other industries. 'We have to recollect that our mercantile murine is subject, not only to similar competition, but in many respects to a more formidable competition. Other industries are subject to the competition of foreign manufacturers who are themselves the subject of comthat petition in tlieir own countries, but our cantile marine is subject to the competition of foreign vessels, which are very often subof sidized by foreign countries to enable them to successfully compete in Australian waters and in the waters of other countries. Again, vision. the competition in our waters with Britishowned vessels is very often of an unfair acter because tliose vessels are in all cases manned by crews whose members receive less than the Australian rate of wage, whilst many cases they are manned by coloured crews who are paid even a very much lower rate.",177
784,Senator KEATING,Unknown,"Frenc h sailing vessels call at Hobart week after week ostensibly for orders, but really for no other to obtain the bounty which their own Government grants to them.",178
785,Senator PEARCE,Unknown,"Yes ; I also know that the many steamers which are competing in our coastal trade are bounty fed. Yet they pay attempted lower rates of wages to their crews than do for Australian vessels, so that our ship-owners are subject to a doubly unfair competition in manne d by coloured and that whilst their vessels are not bounty fed, they are required to pay a fairly decent rate of wages. Senator MCCorx - No Britisli vessel is bounty fed.",178
786,Senator PEAKCE,Unknown,"No. The with foreign vessels is really more unfair our ship-owners than is the competition British vessels. The foreigner is in a better position to oust our ships than is the Britisher. Nevertheless the British ship-owner enjoys an advantage over the Australian whilst the foreigner enjoys a double advant i m tage. This bill attempts to make the condiThe tions of seafaring life on our coast such as efforts will induce young Australians to embark on settle the present s h i p p in g dispute. it as their life vocation. Its object is to encourage them to become seafaring men as were their ancestors. . . . We believe that if this bill becomes law it will render the Mr O'Keefe. conditions of life aboard ship much more bearable and much more attractive-in short, that it will induce many young Australians who now regard a seafaring life as a last resort to enter that calling. Thus we shall secure a better class of workmen, who will The be able to enjoy some of the comforts of life. I was a member of the Senate for practicall y the whole of the time that that N a v i g at i o n Bill was before it , and I well remember the many speeches delivered in support of it by that g r and old So u t h Australian seaman, Senator R . G u t h r i e . T i m e a f t e r time he pointed o ut the disabilities, and de. scribed the deplorable conditions of our Australian seamen. It is a wonder that he did n ot turn in his grave when this legislation was in t r o d u c e d . In another p a r t of the speech by Senator Pearce, from w h i c h I have already quoted, the following passage appears:An important provision in these clauses is a seaman must possess a sufficient knowmerledge of English to understand the orders issued to him. Senators who have read some the accounts of shipwreck, which have been brought under my notice during the past few days, will realise how important is that pro",178

If the Government really desired to provide shipping facilities during the present dispute it should have requisitioned for that purpose as many privately-owned vessels as it needed to supplement its own fleet. Vessels have been requisitioned before, and could be again. The Government could have told the ship-owners that as they were not prepared to operate their vessels it would do so u n t i l they changed their minds. The bill is an attack on our White Australia policy, as well as on the seamen. Honourable members opposite talk glibly with tlieir tongue in their cheek, about their lief in the White Australia policy and trade unionism, but slightest of pretexts they are helping the Government to introduce black labour into our shipping industry. This is the only important measure that the Minis has introduced since he assumed office. He used, as a. private member, to talk learnedly about the necessity for establishing Australia's secondary industries on a firm basis, but now he figures as the Minister in charge of a most reactionary measure that is calculated to do tremendous damage to our industries. Doubtless he desires to introduce into Australia the same class of coloured labour that is working the t in mines abroad in which he is interested. sympathy with the Australian workingman is so great that he wants the coolie and the lascar to come here. from outside has compelled the Government to introduce this bill, and it has been brought in with the object of deliberately fomenting industrial turmoil. The Government has used the visit of the American; Fleet, which it says should be casion of national rejoicing, as a pretext for compelling us to endure two all-night sittings in succession to pass this and ths Immigration Bill . The real object of the fleetcoming here is to fan the war spirit. This is the last desperate throw of these political gamblers. The Government hopes that by engineering an industrial upheaval it will influence the electors to return it for another three years of office. It knows very well that if it can irritate the industrial organizations in the country to such an extent that they strike and so cause public inconvenience, it will have a chance of retaining office. It is deliberately throwing down the gauntlet and challenging industrialists to a fight. The workers have escaped the intolerable conditions of *he past by a long series of desperate struggles, and they cannot quietly permit legislation of this kind to be placed on the statute-book. The honourable  siders that the working men of Australia arei living in a veritable paradise, and he rushed to support this effort by the Government to reduce our economic standards. If a big industrial upheaval occurs thousands of women and helpless be- little children will go hungry, but that ^s nothing to the Government. All it is on the concerned about is to frame up a set of circumstances that will enable it to retain office. This is the desperatiou of despair, but history, will repeat itself, and we shall be shown that coercive measures of this kind never achieve their object. The introduction of this measure confirms the opinion that honourable members on this side of the House formed when the Immigration Bill was introduced. We are now certain that this discredited and disgraced Government is deliberately endeavouring to cause industrial turmoil for its own unworthy purposes.",178

I am not surprised the Government's action; because it is is in keeping with its black political record, its black administration, black principles enunciated by many of those associated with it. One cannot expect from this Government but legislation of this character. We have a political beggar on horseback riding Australia to hell. Hasty and ill-considered legislation of this kind is calculated to fan the flames of resentment the workers, and is likely to involve the Commonwealth in a. far-reaching trial conflict. I cannot do otherwise than regard this bill as a challenge to the organized forces of maritime unionism. It has already been damned by the apologia of the Minister for Trade  orable the Leader of the Opposition Charlton) has admirably said, this is a time that calls for conciliation in the interests not only of the many of workers in the transport industry, who have been earnestly striving for peace, but also of the Commonwealth whole. The Government should certainly have held out the olive branch, and acted on the suggestion that it should convene a conference. This legislation is like cracking a peanut with a steam hammer. The bill is another instance of the dangerous procedure of transferring tain functions of this Parliament arbitrary jurisdiction of a Cabinet ister, who, in this case, is the Minister for Trade and Customs. It has been stated that the Minister is responsible to Parliament; but I would again remind"" the House that Parliament cently been closed for eight and that if the Government been clothed with this authority ing that long recess, it could taken extreme and ill-considered that might have involved the Commonwealth in a serious crisis, without liament having an opportunity its machinations. The bill not only proposes to give the Minister power to suspend the coastal trading provisions of the Navigation Act, but it will also give him Mr Coleman. and in- power practically to abrogate any section proposals. of the act. I see in that a breach of an desire established principle. The Navigation Act represents, in effect, the codified indig- marine law of the Commonwealth, and curtail my it contains many far-reaching .clauses. at One section of it prescribes that the rate or' wages shall be set out in the seaman's articles, and that various precautions shall ancl the be taken to safeguard human life. It is also provided that seamen must have certain qualifications, consisting in the case anything of A.B.'s of three years' practical experience at sea. These provisions are in themselves an assurance that the ships will be manned efficiently, and that human life will be safeguarded. Under the wide in powers that the passing of this' bill will confer, the Minister will be able to disindus- regard, abrogate, or override any of those important provisions. We are asked in effect, to give the Government a trade blank cheque. The history of navigation in Australia shows that that is a very dangerous thing to do. As the hon- Any one who remembers the disastrous (Mr strike of 1890 will recall that at that time, owing to the ill-considered action of the Government of New South thousands Wales, ships were manned with men who were not practical seamen, with the result that some of the ships were wrecked as a and lives were lost. Involved in the proposal that these powers be vested in the Minister is the risk that, as the result of the insane attitude of the Government to the marine transport unions, human l if e may be sacrificed. I submit that the Navigation Act is cercomparable with the Factories and Shops to the Act, which no one for a moment would Min- suggest should be suspended because of a strike in a shop in Sydney. The suspension of the Navigation Act will remove protection from a large body of maritime workers who are prepared at the present has re- time to assist in maintaining industrial months, peace and are not directly implicated in had any trouble. Immediately the Government durattempts to suspend the act, all the marihave time unions will consider that a deathaction blow is being, struck at' the charter of their industrial freedom. If the matter Par- is handled with the usual tactlessness of to check the Government, a disastrous strike will result. I do not wish to discuss the merits or demerits of the seamen's dispute. I have been associated for many years with marine workers, and while regret the present dispute, 1 recognize that it is useless for the Government attempt to stop the strike by methods repression. When the seamen were cently deregistered by the court, many prophets declared that the result would be that another union would be registered, because there was so much dissatisfaction by'the seamen with the executive control of their organization. When the union was deregistered an opportunity was proproposal vided for any body of dissatisfied seamen to register another union. The fact that they did not do so, conclusively proved that they were content to accept the disindustrial cipline and policy of the Seamen's Union. Looking at the question from the view-point of honourable members who sit behind Government, and who believe in punishhave ment for industrial offences, the barring of the seamen from the Arbitration Court was surely sufficient punishment for their failure to obey the court's decision. Now that they are deregistered, they should allowed the right, enjoyed by other vantage therefrom. workers, of demanding that there should be set out in their articles of agreement the full terms and conditions of their employment. In section 113 or 114 the Merchant .'Shipping Act of Great Britain, there is provision that the men may demand a f u ll statement of the lation terms and conditions of their employand ment. Our Navigation Act provides that the rates of wages must be set out, but nothing is said about specifying the conconditions. ditions in full. But the very spirit the Navigation Act, which is based on broad principles of the Merchant Shiptude ping Act, is that the seamen have the right to demand that, in their contract with the owners, which of course submits them to certain penalties, their conditions of employment shall be set out. Wrong things may have been done and bad gard tactics may have been indulged in both sides, but the deliberate attempt that has been made to convince the public that the seamen' were wrong, is absoearth lutely unjust to a large body of workers. In this regard, at any rate, the men's Union is entitled to the sympathy of the organized workers of Australia. The Government would serve the interests of the Commonwealth more effectively i it devoted its energies to trying to settle the strike instead of bringing down hastily I conceived legislation of this character. Beyond doubt, this legislation will be reto garded as a definite breach of the proof tection afforded by the Navigation Act. reWould not the Minister for Trade and Customs and other honourable members opposite foam at the mouth if we on this side were to suggest that the tariff should be suspended because of the sweating tactics of a few manufacturers ? Fortunately, no such impractical and insane is likely to emanate from this side of the House; but political insanity seems to be an outstanding feature of this Government, and, if at this juncture, Australia is saved from a gigantic upheaval, it will be only because of the sound common-sense and discipline of the workers affected. The the tactics of the Government throughout lent colour to the declaration, and strengthens the suspicion in the minds of many unionists that the Government is nothing less than the agent jyrovocateur of capital, seeking to create strife in the be hope that it may reap some political ad",179

But the Governmen is merely recognizing the facts and necessities of the case when it requires that there shall be a certain degree of f flexibility in legislation to meet changes in circumstances, and, particularly, emergencies of a national character. This bill only proposes to give the Government power to cope with new and emerg3nt conditions during the e-istence of special circumstances. The responsibility of deciding how and for what period of time these special provisions shall operate, must be accepted by the Government.

As Minister for Trade and Customs pointed out, there can be no competition in that trade by Vessels fro m abroad unless special permit, and the conditions i posed by the Navigation Ac t are such none but a ship-owner confining his sels to the Australian coastal would find it worthwhile to comply with them in order to get a licence. If the powers to suspend certain sections the act relating to the coasting trade is exercised, the effect will be to deprive ship-owners of that monopoly which is their most valuable possession. It is true that if the trade passes to other companies' vessels, and Australian seamen lose their employment, they, too, will suffer in a very practical manner.

One of the legal "" woodand-water joeys "" of the Government, in recently submitted in this chamber, spoke of the conservatism the Labour party in desiring that existing legislation ' shall stand.

One wonders how they achieved distinction in the law courts of Certainly they have not decontributed materially to the debate on The Navigation Act has undoubtedly played an important part in the development of a great industry-the a transportation of passengers and goods round the coast of Australia. The inof the act is also felt in every part of the world where Australian ships to be seen. Many years ago the conditions on vessels engaged in the coastal I seen stud rams penned close up to door of the places where the seamen slept. In tliose days seamen were compelled to take their food from the cook's galley, and find a place somewhere to eat it. On one vessel I saw about 150 pigs penned within a few feet of the accommodation for the seamen. food then was not as good as that given to prize boars or sows, and it was prepared by people who by no stretch of imagination could be called cooks. that time the question was not what air space should be provided seaman, but how to get as many seamen as possible into a given space. In most instances ship-owners achieved the apparently impossible in that Since the Navigation Act was proclaimed ship-owners have been pelled to provide proper tion and - proper, well-cooked for seamen. These improvements cost the owners many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and naturally they do not regard the act with a very eye. I am convinced that the real reason for thesuspension of the coastal provisions of the act is not the welfare of the people of Australia, but the desire to meet the wishes of the ship-owners and those conservative die-hards amongst the anti-Labour forces who are prepared to go to any length t6 achieve their object. Possibly the Government will be enough, if this measure becomes law, to suspend the provisions of the act next week, but any .such suspension will only be temporary, because as soon as a Labour Government comes into office the act will be put into operation again. South Wales Government has instituted a 44-hour week. Probably when the Australian Labour party is in control of the treasury bench next year there will be a-44-hour week in connection Commonwealth instrumentalities. sibly with the following swing of the pendulum the anti-Labour forces may repeal the provision, but subsequently will come again and re-enact the law.

Mr COLEMAN. - I direct attention to the state of the committee -[Quorum com- formed.} accommodafood Mr BLAKELEY - In this and similar have legislation passed recently, there is evidence of outside influence at work. Some time ago the Inchcape combine had sufficient influence-ho w it was obtained was friendly not far to seek-to get a reduction of £100,000 a year in taxation on its overseas tonnage. The people of Australia are unable to collect certain taxation, because the representatives of the pastoralists in this chamber are strong enough to make their influence felt. It is evident that in this matter the Inchcape combine advised the Governstupid ment as to the best course to pursue. W it h the exception of, perhaps, a few American tramp steamers and Chinese and Japanese boats, the whole of the shipping on the Australian coast will be carried out by "" vessels worked with The New coloured labour and owned by the Inchcape combine. It is regrettable that the Minister who introduced the bill is not better employed. There are languishing industries in Australia, but he appears to with all put in most of his time preventing the Pos- development of our secondary industries. His intention now is to stifle, emasculate, or k ill the provisions of the Navigation Labour Act. This Government has subsidized the squatters and allowed the big interests of this country to evade their just taxation. There is in this chamber at least one honourable member, and there may be others, who will have to make good Naviga- his taxation arrears when the La'bour as well as party obtains office. The Government is capi- now endeavouring to break up the> trade will unions of this country. It has, under coastal the lap, frequently endeavoured to break down the White Australia policy.

800,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Capricornia) [4.6 a.m.]. - This clause is quite unnecessary and very unwise, because, if passed, it will have a disastrous effect. The bill is a blow at the trade unions of Australia. For that reason, if for no other, honourable members on this side of the committee are prepared to fight it.every inch of the way. The Minister for Trade  to believe that the Government has no wish to interfere with trade unions at all. But the bill is undoubtedly the thin end of the wedge to introduce cheap coloured labour on the coastal boats of Australia. We know that repeated requests have been made for the repeal or amendment of the Navigation Act, and the Government now, under cover of an industrial dispute, is proposing to amend the Act. If the Prime Minister had any courage at all he would take the initiative and call a round-table conference, bringing the seamen and shipowners together with a view to settling this dispute. But he prefers to take no action other than to tell the seamen to go back to the Arbitration Court. Prime Minister is not big enough for his job. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) showed wonderful restraint the other day when he moved the adjournment of the House to appeal to the Prime Minister, even at that belated hour, to call a conference of the representatives of the employers and employees; but it was of no avail. I firmly believe that had a conference been called, it would have culminated in a satisfactory settlement of the dispute. The Prime Minister should be above party. The trouble is that the Government has behind it the wealthy shipping interests of Australia They supply the sinews of war at election time, so they naturally dictate the Government's policy.

This Government is not likely to interfere with the interests of the shipping companies. Last year it handed over to a board the control of the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line, and because Sir William Clarkson, the acting chairman, saw fit to rise above party squabbles and to come to some arrangement with the seamen, he was asked by the Prime Minister .for an explanation of his action No doubt he will be taken to task by the Government for signing the agreement with them, but I believe that his action was the first of the moves that will culminate in a settlement of the dispute.

804,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Yes ; not the bitterness and vituperation which the honourable member for Fawkner brings into this chamber. He appears to have been briefed by the Government to say the The bitterest things possible about the Labour party, although no one knows better than himself that there is not a' scintilla of t r u th in his charges. Had the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) been Prime M i nister of Australia this dispute would have been settled long ago; but the Government is very busily fanning the flame with a view to causing a great conflagration. It is acting in collusion with the ship-owners to foment a widespread industrial upheaval for its own purposes. The Commonwealth under the present administration has been deservedly dubbed a ""rudderless chip."" Not a single constructive legislative proposal has emanated from the Government and its muddling administration has disgusted the leaders of the secondary industries of this country who might have reasonably been expected to support it . The Government hopes to coerce the seamen into causing a protracted strike during which an election campaign will occur that will result in it retaining the treasury bench for another three years. The Navigation Act was placed on the statute-book after ten years of consistent advocacy by the Labour party. A royal commission, with the right honourable member for Nort h Sydney (Mr Hughes) as chairman, was appointed in 1906 to consider and report upon the bill that had been introduced into the Senate in 1904. Its report revealed that a degrading state of affairs existed in the shipping industry, and that cheap lascar and.coolie labour was a menace to any country. The report stated that the conditions of the seamen in the British mercantile marine and on the vessels trading round the Australian coast were deplorable. The men were forced to occupy cabins and forecastles that were not fit for dogs. Any one who travelled on our coastal boats in those times will readily admit that the seamen were disgracefully treated by the shipping companies. Seafaring is an irksome, arduous and dangerous occupation.",185
805,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Almos t as dangerous as motoring!,186
806,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I think that even the honourable member for Eawkner will admit that the lot of the seafaring man is frequently most disagreeable. They are exposed to all kinds of weather, and never know when they leave their home for a voyage whether they will return to it . The Navigation Act brought about wonderfully improved conditions of employment for them, but because the act is, for the moment, unpopular with certain sections of the community outside of this House who support honourable members opposite, we are asked to suspend it , and to destroy all that has been built up with so much labour, during so many years. The report of the royal commission to which I have already referred contains some interesting figures. It shows that from 1890 to 1900 the number of Britishers employed in the British mercantile marine decreased by 11,615, while the number of foreigners, excluding Asiatics, increased by 9,666, and the number of Asiatics increased by 13,289. The total increase of Asiatics and other foreigners was 22,955. During the decade the population of Great B ritain and Ireland increased by approximately 4,000,000, and the total tonnage of British ships advanced from 11,150,506 to 14,064,152. The population increased by 10 per cent., the tonnage of ships by more than 26 per cent.; the foreigners employed, excluding Asiatics, by more than 35 per cent., and the Asiatics employed, by more 'than 58 per cent. Do honourable members opposite desire to see lascars and other Asiatics working the ships that carry passengers round the Australian coast? Would*' that be in harmony with our White Australia policy? Is it fair that oversea boats, which do not comply with Australian Arbitration Court awards, should compete with Australian boats that do? Does that appeal to ""the fairness of the Minister for Trade and Customs? He has studied Queensland industries to some extent, and I am sure that he must realise that a terrible blight was. placed on them when the conservative governments of that state foisted black labour on it . The Kanakas were responsible for hindering the development and progress of Queensland for many years, and much trouble occurred before they were deported. No wonder that Lord Kimberley, ' when Colonial St'cretary, in dispatches to the governors of the Australian colonies, referred to the Queer,sland Kanaka traffic in these terms : The conduct of this traffic brings discredit on the British name. Crinres are perpetrated by persons proceeding from Australia, and these crimes are legally cognizable by Australian courts of justice. Yet these violations of the law escape punishment. A petition that was sent to the British Government in connection with the Kanakas statedMurder, piracy, kidnapping, and other acts of barbarity characterize this traffic. There is no necessity for it ; the industries in which the Kanakas are engaged were previously extensively and profitably conducted by white labour. During a debate on the Kanaka problem in the British House of Commons the f o l lowing remark was made:Queensland was becoming a second South' Carolina. It is a state ruled by an oligarchy with all the vices of a slave-holding government.

Minister for Works and (Mr Hill ) said in this House on 2nd A p r i l , 1924I would remove the sugar embargo and do away with Arbitration Courts and all tariffs.

Every true Australian, when he learns the . significance of this bill, will view it with serious concern and grave apprehension. May I be perto protest against the conditions from the in which honourable members are compelled by the Government to consider it? This House has now been sitting consuftinuously for 40 hours, and I and other of honourable members have been deprived of the rest and relief that is our due. Supporters of the Government are not seritroubled about this bill ; they merely turn over in their slumbers while drastic honourable members on this side exercise We believe that the of this bill will be inimical to the best interests of our country and prejudicial to the welfare of its citizens. the 40 hours that we have been sitting we have passed a bill that is probably more far reaching, industrially, than any otherbill ever brought before this The present bill is hardly less It was introduced before the suspension of the sitting at dinner time last night, and we are required within a round of the clock to pass it through all its stages. I know that in the district I represent feelings of indignation and rise in the minds of the people at the way in which we are required to do our duties in Parliament. It is impossible to give the bill the consideration that serves in the time allowed by the Government. I endeavoured during second-reading debate to urge the Government to withdraw the bill, but instead the Government applied the which works with terrible precision preventing honourable members from expressing their opinions. The Act conferred upon those Australian zens who go down to the sea in ships a protection that was very necessary, and it also endeavoured to safeguard the lives of those who travel as passengers on Australian ships. If there is any interference with the act many cherished safeguards may be It is distressing to think of the evil conditions of employment that obtained in the mercantile marine years tions which this Government desires to revive. Our experience the last 40 hours proves that no policy is too. reactionary to be adopted by this Government. It is prepared to set back the clock of time to a period when the workers enjoyed no security in regard to wages or conditions of living. members on this side would be lacking in their duty if they did not protest against the action of the Government in meddling with legislation which secures to tralian workmen better conditions are enjoyed in any other part of the world. As the representative stituency which includes a very port, 1 know the circumstances in which seafaring men work, and though wages and working hours represent a big improvement upon the conditions obtained a few years ago, there is yet need for a considerable further Instead of lowering the safeguards, and thus giving to unscrupulous ilr.

On two visits to Papua, and one to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, I Parliament. saw the conditions under which labour is important. employed upon vessels there. [Quorum formed.'] I believe those conditions would bo introduced on the coast of the mainland if the law permitted the shipowners to introduce them. In the islands Kanaka labour is employed - on resentment vessels at from 5s. to -15s. per month with rations. No proper accommodation is provided for these black seamen; they are required to sleep on the hatch it de- or deck, and their diet is of the meanest and crudest kind, consisting usually of the boiled rice, supplemented occasionally by a little fish or tinned meat. By the acceptance of this bill we are encouraging guillotine, ship-owners to endeavour to introduce in into the coasting trade of the mainland the same, conditions as obtain in the Navigation islands. The very thought of such a citipossibility is revolting. I am sure that if the people had an opportunity to do so they would show their unqualified objection to the provisions of this bill. Honourable members on this side have endeavoured to of chose draw attention to the menace it contains. removed. There is a possibility that by reason of the granting of interstate exemptions to vessels registered in foreign ports Asiatic ago-condi- and Hindu labour will be introduced in apparently the Australian trade. That would during endanger the maintenance of the standards set up by our White Australia policy. The Government, in introducing this measure, hasindicated a desire to break down that policy. The passage of this legislation will afford Honourable those controlling the mercantile marine of Australia an opportunity for the employment of a class of labour which will be a serious, menace to it .

815,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"Macquarie) [5.6 advance. a.m.] - The debate on this bill has been by no means edifying. Honourable memship-owners bers opposite have imputed motives to the Government for which they know there is not justification. We listened to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlsent time. ton) endeavouring, in a frantic effort, to place the blame for the unfortunate position in the shipping industry upon the vernment. The facts do not justify attack, and the public realizes this well. Any one who has followed the course events-and no. one has followed it with greater interest and anxiety than the Leader of the Opposition-mus t be aware that the present position is not the result of precipitate action - We know that movement. in December last there was every possihave bility of such a situation arising as that with which we are now confronted. The Prime Minister and his colleagues, in dealing with this matter, have shown a degree of patience which I do not. think I could have shown. They have avoided i any action which might possibly precipiof tate a general strike or lead to dition of affairs which every right-thinkagainst ing person of this community,would plore. In December last the men directhowever, ing the actions of the Seamen's Union under and the transport unions were conducting strain than are honourable their affairs in such a way as would justified the deregistration of those unions. The Prime Minister and his leagues were urged to take drastic. action at that time, but they stayed their hands and made use of every possible means to avoid the introduction of the drastic legispared lation which they have been forced to i troduce at the present time,. ! l , and others, held the view that the patience shown by the Government, in the effort have these difficulties settled, would be i vain.

I am prepared to. believe that they are, because they realise now, when it is too late, that they have a match to a powder magazine, and that destruction must befall this country less something is done to settle the existdo ing trouble. They have realized its ousness too late. They have egged men responsible for the present condition of affairs, and the representatives men in this Parliament have done nothing but try to make out that they are justified in the action they are taking at the p r e",188
816,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,That is not correct.,189
817,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"In their publis Goutterances they have justified the action his of the men.

The Leader of the a conOpposition has today made charges honourable members on this side dethat do not do him credit.

819,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"The Government is asking for this legislation, not for the put purpose of suspending the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act , but in unorder that it shall have the authority to so if the position becomes more acute. seriThe Government should have this power. on the The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), in his speech last night of the on another measure, made a very important contribution to the debate. There is no doubt that he laid his finger on the source of the trouble. Every one who has given careful thought to the circumstances surrounding the present dispute, must have been impressed - with the thought that something was bound to happen. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that, because Mr "" J o c k "" Garden secured only 240 votes at the recent New South Wales election, he is a man of no influence. As secretary of the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, he, as well as Mr Walsh and Mr Johannsen, wields considerable influence in the industrial lif e of this country. There are seventy unions, including the Seamen's Union, affiliated with that body. We have evidence that the disputes which have been occuring of late, are part and parcel of a pre-conceived plan to cause unemployment and bring about a revolution in Australia. That the trouble has not extended is due to the fact that the leaders now believe that the time is inopportune. They realise now, and they will realise more clearly as time goes on, that once the people are aroused to the seriousness of the situation, they will deal with firmly. In his evidence before a royal commission, appointed by this House, Mr . Garden declared that the one solution of the unemployed problem in Australia was a system of Communism. That opinion is backed up by Esmond MacDonald Higgins, director of the labour research bureau attached to the Trades Hall Council.",189

And the Seamen's Union, as I have shown, is affiliated with the Trades and Labour Council in New South Wales. The secretary of that body is Mr Garden, who stood at the last New South Wales election as a communist candidate. In evidence before the royal commission, Mr Garden stated that the Trades and Labour Council was constituted of affiliated unions, and that itrepresented a membership of 120,000 unionists. Each union elected delegates according to its numerical strength, and these delegates then go on to the council. Prom this it will be seen that Mr Garden, an avowed communist, represents 120,000 men, who select 130 delegates, who in their turn elected him as their secretary. It may be of interest to honourable members to know that in the recent New South Wales election, the Communists were advised to vote for the labour candidate.",190

The Prime Minister, during the last seven or eight months, has exercised a patience of which very few of us to would have been capable.

We have now come to what is practically a dead-end, and the leaders of the unions who are directly responsible for it , realizing the seriousness of the position, and that they are absolutely out of touch with the great majorit y of right-thinking people, are endeavouring to effect a patched-up peace.

877,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I am quite ready, if there is any doubt in the matter, and in order to satisfy the honourable member for Macquarie, to withdraw all I have said up to the present. Every honourable member is entitled to his opinion, especially if he has remained, as I have, calm and collected during the storm that the honourable member for Macquarie raised for the obvious purpose of defeating me in my intention of making a considered speech on this subject. The honourable member commenced his remarks by saying that the debate was not very edifying, and I ask the committee to say to what extent he has contributed by his utterances to the general edification. I suggest that he did not do very much in that direction. It is curious that his contribution to edification in this debate has been to slumber peacefully while the work of the committee was being - done by honourable members on this side of the House; and it reflects no great credit on him that he did not evince sufficient intelligence to sleep on his own side of the House. I have sat in this chamber during the discussion, supported by almost all the members of the Labour party, and have seen on the benches opposite the recumbent forms of honourable members who support the Government in the only way they can-by sleeping behind it . In order to take a practical step in the direction of irnproving the clause, I move as an amendment- That the following words be added :- "" Provided that such proelam'»tion shall not be gazetted or have effect within the period years from the date of the passing of the bill."" Honourable members will observe that the terms of the amendment are guarded.. While I ask them to agree to postpone the gazettal o.f the proclamation for ten years. I do not ask them to fix a definite date when it should be gazetted after the expiration of that period. I leave that to the mature deliberation of those who will have to consider the situation when it arises. That will be not only after the next census, but also after the next elections, and it may then be my privilege to address the House as the supporter of a new and different government. There are many reasons why supporters of the Government should vote for this amendment: Let me quote the one phrase that has ever found ready acceptance by honourable members opposite- "" The time is not yet ripe."" Whenever anything necessary for the amelioration of the conditions of the people has been submitted by a member of the Labour party, or any other progressive person, honourable members opposite have never neglected to proclaim that "" The time is not yet ripe."" I , therefore, submit with the utmost confidence that "" The time is not yet ripe "" for the proclamation to be gazetted, and that it will not be ripe at least until the expiration of the decennial period mentioned in my amendment. More than once I have heard honourable members opposite say that LaboUr members were "" prone to panic legislation."" I want to avoid panic legislation, and to ensure that mature consideration and deliberation are given to the proclamation. Surely, also, we are entitled to consider the claims of posterity. Although we are the trustees for the time being of a great measure of wisdom, we cannot claim to have a monopoly of it . It is safe to assume that those who will occupy the Government benches ten years hence will be as capable as we are of deciding when the proclamation shall be issued. Casting my mind back, as the poet has so beautifully expressed it, "" In the dark backward and abysm of time,"" I recall that the original Navigation Act was passed, after having been on the stocks for about ten years, and that the date of the proclamation was deferred for a very long time. The great advantage that I see in deferring the proclamation of the bill we are discussing is that the particular trouble the Government has a mind to create in this community may by that time have of ten passed, away. I appreciate the fact that tnis Government may gain among its immediate supporters some little kudos for stirring up class hatred in the community, and applying a - policy of force, which I say is a policy also of cowardice, to certain people. These temporary political gains, by which the Government may hope to live a little longer than it otherwise would, should not be set against the peace, order, and permanent good government of the Commonwealth. Having that in mind, I suggest that the Government should follow the example of those pioneers who decided that the proclamation of the original Navigation Act should be postponed for several years.",194

In view of the debate which has taken place on the bill, the Government can have no objection to my motion. This is a bill to encourage the employment of black labour on ships, and that beiug so, its object should be disclosed by its title. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) might save time by indicating his acceptance of my proposal. The bill will have far-reaching effects, and I have no doubt that the shipping companies will desire to know what they may do under it. They should be informed by the title chosen for the measure that they will be at liberty under it to employ black labour. principle of the Navigation Act is to observe the ""White Australia policy in the shipping industry, but this bill will so alter that act that it will defeat that policy. If the Minister for Trade and  accept the amendment of the title which I suggest, I shall sit down.  honourable member. Mr E. RILEY - I do not want a reply; I want action. In the interests of all concerned I think I have suggested a proper title for the bill. object is to enable the ship-owners to obtain cheap labour. I presume that Sir Robert Garran drafted the measure, and that the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom), who is very cunning, misled him as to the title which should be used to describe it.",195
880,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,Unknown,"Would the honourable member like an explanation? Mr E. RILEY - I do not want one now. If the Government accepts the amendment of the title which I suggest I have no doubt that the bill will be passed with the greatest harmony. The bill proposes to alter the whole principle of our Navigation Act, under which the captains and officers of ships must be white men. If it becomes law the shipowners may employ Chinese captains and Indian mates. I should prefer white engineers to be employed in our ships, because most engineers are Scotchmen, and I should like to protect their interests.. I am afraid that if the bill is passed my countrymen, who are engineers, will be deprived of their employment. this measure the stewards and the cooks now employed may be displaced by Indians, Cingalese, Chinese, or Japanese. I think the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) should inform the primary producers of the object of this measure. I believe they would refuse to ship their products in vessels manned by coloured labour. In the past in Queensland whole droves of Kanakas were introduced for the sugar plantations, and some of those people might get into the shipping industry under this bill. This should be interesting to Burns, Philp and Company, who receive a subsidy from the Commonwealth for the carriage of mails. What a grand advertisement it The would be for the Commonwealth if the bill were properly described by its title as a bill for the encouragement of the employment of black labour in the shipping industry.

I understand that my name appears in the division list NOES. having voted in favour of the amendment of clause 2 of the Navigation Bill moved by the honourable'member for Batman (Mr Brennan). Probably, as the result of two days and two nights of continuous sitting, I did not hear the question put, and when I became aware that a division was taking place it was too late for me to cross the floor. I wish to say that I had no intention of supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman. * IMMIGRATI ON BILL. Bill returned from, the Senate without ... 35 amendment. INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL. AYES.",196
883,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [7.2 a.m.] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. I thank honourable members for permitting me to move, at this stage, the second reading of this bill. I am doing so to avoid the necessity of sitting late again today. The bill is not contentious, and its - purpose is to re-enact a principle which was unanimously decided upon by this House three or four years ago. The necessity was then seen for the constitution of a board of appeal in connection with the Income Tax Assessment Act, to NOES. review the decision of the Commissioner Moloney, Parker of Taxation on certain questions of fact. This board of appeal was asked for by the taxpayers generally throughout the CommonAvealth, and it was given to them because their request was considered to be fair and just. The principal purpose of this bill is to reconstitute the Income - Tax Board of Appeal, which Parliament understood it had created effectively by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1921, and continued by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922, and at the same time to put beyond question the validity of some clauses of the Income Tax Assessment Act which contained provisions regarding the board of appeal. The only other matter dealt with in the bill is the placing of coa operative societies on the same basis for taxation as applied under the Income Tax as Assessment Act 1922, that basis having. been materially altered by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1923, which caused all companies to be taxed on the whole of their profits, irrespective of the amount distributed to members or shareholders. Honourable members will recollect that ""the design of Parliament, in bringing a board of appeal into existence, was to enable taxpayers to test the correctness of-the commissioner's decisions which the acts previously made conclusive, so far as they related to findings of fact. For instance, under section 17, where any trading stock of a business is sold, the consideration for the sale which is attributable to the trading stock is to be determined by the commissioner, and the amount so determined is to be deemed to be the price paid by the purchaser for trading stock. Under section 21, where a company has not distributed to its shareholders in any year at least two-thirds of its taxable income, the commissioner is to determine whether a further sum could reasonably have been distributed to the members. Under section 23 e deductions for depreciation are to be allowed to such extent as the commissioner thinks just and reasonable. Under section 28 (1) when any business which is carried on in Australia is controlled principally by persons resident oul of Australia, and it appears to the commissioner that the business produces either no taxable income or less than the ordinary taxable income which might be expected from that business, then the person carrying on the business in Australia is to be assessable and chargeable with income tax on such percentage of the total receipts, whether cash or credit, of the business as the commissioner in his judgment thinks proper. The power thus reposed in the commissioner was held by the court not to allow of an appeal, so far as it is exercised in determining a question of fact, and obviously this was a very extensive authority to delegate to any officer. Accordingly Parliament resolved to erect boards of appeal, which should be independent, and in regard to each of the sections above mentioned, and indeed with respect to any conclusion of fact on which the act directed the commissioner to determine, it was expressly provided that a taxpayer, who is dissatisfied with the decision of the commissioner, may require him to refer his case to a board of appeal, Dr Earle Page. and that the commissioner is to refer the case. These provisions were clearly for the benefit of the taxpayer as being a relief against the use of an arbitrary discretion in fixing taxable liability. The act then provided in section 41 and following sections that there shall be a board or boards of appeal, each board to consist of a chairman, and two other members appointed by the Governor in Council, and holding office for seven years. Under section 50 (4) a taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the decision of the commissioner may, within a time limit, in writing, request the commissioner to treat his objection as an appeal, and to forward it, as required by the taxpayer, either to the High Court or the Supreme Court of a state, where the objection raises questions of law only, or to the High Court or a Supreme Court, or a board of appeal, where the objection raises questions of fact.",197
884,Mr SCOTXIN,Unknown,Does the taxpayer have a choice?,198
885,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Yes . Under section 51 (2) an order of the board on questions of fact was to be final and conclusive, and under sub-section 8 an appeal lay to the High Court from, any order made by the board, except a decision by the board on a question of fact. Under sub-section 1 on the hearing of an appeal the court or board of appeal was empowered to make such order as it thinks fit, and either reduce or increase the assessment. Unfortunately, in drafting clause 51 of the act, the powers of the board were not merely confined to n determination of questions of fact and the reservation of the right of appeal to be called on questions of law, but, owing to the wording of the section, the power of resolving questions of law was said to be conferred by the clause. On the hearing of the appeal, the court or board of appeal would make such order as it thought fit. and either increase or reduce the assessment. As a result of this position a recent judgment' in a special case taken to the High Court by the board of appeal in connection with an appeal made to the board of appeal by the British Imperial Oil Company Limited, the High Court ruled that the board of appeal was invalid and had no legal existence. That is really the whole purpose of the act.",198
886,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,To review assessments?,199
887,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Yes . The purpose of the bill is to appoint in the place of the board of appeal a board of review which will have unquestionable legal existence. The various sub-sections which are omitted from or altered in clauses 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12 and 13 of the bill are simply wiping out the present position which has been held to be in valid. The balance of the bill deals with the constitution of the board of review and the validity of assessments of the board of appeal, and the preservation of rights under the board of appeal. The appeal by the British Imperial Oil Company had arisen out of an assessment which was issued to the company under rhe provisions of section 28 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922. That section had been inserted in the act by Parliament to deal more effectively with businesses conducted in a manner similar to that of the British Imperial Oil Compay. A number of such businesses had been assessed under the section. It contained also a sub-section entitling a taxpayer who was dissatisfied with the assessment made by the Commissioner, to request the Commissioner to refer the assessment to the board of appeal. The company availed itself of this right, and the assessment was referred to the board of appeal. The conrpany requested the board to state a case for the opinion of the High Court on certain questions of law connected with the appeal. board stated a case accordingly. Before the High Court the company's representatives contended that the board had no legal standing. The H i gh Court agreed with that view. and. on the 9th A p r i l , 1925, struck the ease out of its list for the reason that there was no case properly - before it, seeing that there was no proper board of appeal in. existenceto state a case. The company also contended before the High Court that section 28 of the principal act is invalid because it had no operation except in conjunction with a validly constituted board of appeal. The High Court has not yet determined that the section is invalid. That point would arise for determination at the next sittings of the court in au action which the British Imperial Oil Company has instituted against the Commissioner of Taxation for refund of income tax paid by the company on the assessment which gave rise to the judgment of the High Court which destroyed the board of appeal. The company will not be in a position to succeed in its pending action if the bill now before the House is passed, as the alleged invalidity in the law will then have been validated by Parliament. In the meantime the income tax hoard of appeal has ceased to exist as such, and the general body of taxpayers has been deprived of the facilities which this Parliament clearly intended to give to them for the speedy and economical settlement of their, assessment disputes with the Taxation Department. The Government lost no time in deciding to legislateto reconstitute the board in such a manner as to remove it from the legal objections which had previously destroyed it . The present b i ll provides for the constitution of a board to review the decisions. of the Commissioner of Taxation, the Assistant Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner as the case requires. The persons who were appointed as members of the board of appeal will , in terms of this bill, be the first members of the board of review. Their periods of office will be those originally granted to them, namely, seven years fro m the date of their appointments in 1922. The board will have the same powers as the Commissioner of Taxation, and the decision of the board will rank as a decision of the Commissioner of Taxation, but in The substitution'for the actual decision of the Commissioner himself in the event of the board's, decision differing from that of the Commissioner. This arrangement will not expose the board of review to successful challenge on the score of in validity. A dissatisfied taxpayer will have the option of having his objection transmitted direct to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of a state, or to the board of review. This was the position under the existing law in the case of the board of appeal. In the great maj o r it y of cases in the past, objecting taxpayers have preferred to have their objections dealt with by the board of appeal, and there is no reason to think that they will not prefer to go before the proposed board of review. The history of the board of appeal references is most in teresting. I give the following figures for the information of honourable members :Total requests for submission of cases to the board .. Number of objections transmitted to the board up to 9th April, 1925, when the High Court ruled that the board did not exist .. .. .. (ti) Finally dealt with by the board up to Oth April, 1925 .. .. .. Decisions in favour of taxpayers .. .. 11 Decisions in favour of the department .. 54 Decisions partly favouringboth sides .. 16) Partly dealt with by the board up to 9th April, 1925 (c) Pending before the board on 9th April, 1925 .. 53 (d) Transmitted to board but settled before being heard by board .. .. (c) Lapsed because no additional tax payable .. 1 Cases not yet transmitted to board .. .. .. 66 (a) Awaiting transmission 26 (6) Settled with taxpayer 40 Cases in which taxpayers have, since 9th April, 1925, requested that tlieir objections should be referred to the board of appeal The provisions of this bill dealing with .the procedure to be followed in bringing assessments before the board of review for review, and the rights and privileges of taxpayers and the department, have been drafted so as to preserve the substance of the position in this regard created by the existing law in the case of .the board of appeal. The provisions relating to the board of review are expressed separately from those relating to the courts. Under the existing law these provisions were expressed together. It is considered that the judgment of the High Court in the appeal of the British Imperial Oil Company Limited clearly indicates the necessity for the separation provided for in the bill. The bill contains the necessary provisions for validating all past action by a dissatisfied taxpayer, by the Commissioner of Taxation, and by Dr .Earle Page. the board of appeal, in dealing with and giving decisions upon cases which were referred to the board of appeal. 234 Clause 18 is designed to give effect to the suggestions contained in judgments of some of the members of the High Court to restore rights of appeal which tax168 payers thought they possessed when they requested the Commissioner of Taxation to refer their objections to the board of 67 appeal. In this connection the bill also provides the right of approach to the board of review to those taxpayers who may have appealed to. the court only because the court's judgment of 9th April, 2 1925, deprived them of the board of ap67 peal. These persons will be permitted to remove their cases from the court's lists and send them to the board of review to 5 be dealt with on the same terms and conditions as will apply to any new cases which may arise in the future. The bill also provides for the resumption of sus42 pended action in cases in which the Commissioner or the taxpayer may have appealed to the High Court against a deTotal .. 168 cision by the invalid board of appeal. There are two such cases. It will be noticed that clauses 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the bill remove from sections 17, 21, 23 and 28 of the principal act, the sub-sections which previously entitled a dissatisfied 23 4 taxpayer who had been assessed under those sections, to have his case referred to the board of appeal. Owing to the manner in which the bill has been pre6 pared, these sub-sections are no longer necessary. In future the taxpayer will have the right to object to any assessment, and to go to the board of review or to the court. If he has objected to any decision which the act leaves to the discretion of the Commissioner, an' appeal to the court would probably be unsuccessful, because the court. has previously refused to substitute its discretion in such cases for that of the Commissioner. The court would not interfere unless it were satisfied that the Commissioner had improperly dealt with the case. The taxpayer will, however, be able to carry his objection in such a' case to the board of review, and secure a revision of the assessment if the board's opinion of the case differs from that of the Commissioner. The board's decision then takes the place of the Commissioner's ruling. In all cases which may be dealt with by the board of review, either the taxpayer or the Commissioner may carry the questions at issue to the H i g l i Oourt if that court considers that a question of law is involved. If a question of law, is not involved, the decision of the board of review becomes final and binding on the taxpayer and the Commissioner. The amendments to sections 17, 21, 23 and Z8 of the net made by clauses 2, 4, 5 and 6 are. by clause 20, made retrospective to the 18th October, 1922, the date of the commencement of the principal act. This course is uecessary in order that it may be quite clear to the High Court that Parliament at all times intended that the paragraphs being omitted from sections 17, 81. 23 and 2S were not intended to render the balance of the sections in valid. Consequential upon the retrospective operation of the amendments to sections .17, 21, 23 nnd 28 of the principal act, it has been considered necessary by the Parliamentary Draftsman to formally validate all determinations, decisions and rulings of the Commissioner given under' the principal act. This validation applies only to determinations, decisions and r u l ings which would have been effective determinations, decisions or rulings under the appropriate sections of the principal act if tliose sections did not contain any provision for reference of the determinations, decisions or inlingsto the board of appeal. This course has .been considered desirable because of the cases now pending beforo the H i i i h Court, in which taxpayers are contending that determinations ""by the Commissioner of Taxation under section 21 of the act are invalid because the board of appeal is invalid, and that as the section contains a righ t of reference to. the board of appeal, therefore the whole section is invalid. There is good reason for thinking that if the High Court is called upon to decide upon the validity of the section it will , in the circumstances,, decide that it is invalid. B y this validation, ministrative tend subsequent legislative difficulties will be avoided. It was necessary that I should introduce this bill as earlv as possible, - in order that the public generally might know the intentions of the Government with regard to the uositicm.

The supply of sngar there has already fallen very low, and will be completely exhausted within a few days unless it is supplemented. I have been asked to request a definite assurance from the Government that consideration will be given to the position. I have received telegrams from manufacturers, to the effect that if suppbes cannot he - obtained rapidly they will have to close down thoir works within ten days, which will mean that more than 300 employees will be thrown out of work. When 1 consulted the Minister for Trndo and Customs (Mr. Prnl-to.li) ou ihe matter, he informed me that extra supplies had gone forward, but the latesttelegrams I have received from the manufacturers concerned make it quite clear that if the supplies were sent forward they have been distributed. I urge the Government to do something immediately, so that these manufacturers jhall not bn left without sugar. If sugar cannot be obtained from the eastern states they request, that, an arrangement shall be made by which it may be obtained from Java pr elsewhere. In the event of the industrial situation developing in such a way that: transportation difficulties increase, I wish the Minister for Works and Eailways (Mr Hill ) to run extra trains on the transcontinental railway.

In order to stifle criticism by honourable members, legislation has been passed by the application of the closure and the guillotine. The object of the Government has been to prevent honourable members, from expressing their opinions, and to drive a hellish, black torpedo into the navigation laws of our country. I hope that in ths future honourable members will so realise the necessity for protecting their interests that they will not allow the Government to escape criticism by repeating these tactics.

As soon as I receive a reply, which I am hopeful will bo reassuring, I shall communicate with the honourable member. I can only tell the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe) that the inquiry into the timber iudustry has been a very long and many-sided one.
