2,Mr HAWKER,COMMITTEES," is On behalf of the parliamentary Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I present the committee's report entitled Report of the Inquiry into ANAO Audit Report No. 6 of 1996-97 on Commonwealth Guarantees, Indemnities and Letters of Comfort, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
3,Mr HAWKER,COMMITTEES,"The committee took this opportunity to review the National Audit Office report on Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort following concerns expressed about the findings of the should occur. report. These contingent liabilities have an implicit cost to taxpayers, because there always a risk that a guarantee or an indemnity will require payments to be made. In most cases, of course, this risk is low. Guarantees, indemnities and letters comfort can also result in legal action. If protracted, this can hinder the actions of government. For example, legal action over guarantees associated with the sale of the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline resulted in the Commonwealth cancelling the attempt. The audit report identified at least billion in value of guarantees, indemnities letters of comfort. Significantly, this figure does not include a large number of indemnimore ties which have no specified financial limit. Furthermore, the audit office does not sider that it has identified all of these ments, due to poor record keeping by ment departments. Having said out that the largest exposures. appear to be well managed. For example, the guarantee related to the Commonwealth Bank, the obligations carried by this guarantee, are subject to prudential supervision by the Audit report No. 6 of 1996-97 identified some serious shortcomings in the management and accountability arrangements for Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. As a result, the audit office made several recommendations. The committee Report strongly endorses those recommendations. The audit report reveals that the Commonwealth neither informed nor aware of the potential Standing losses that might arise. Guarantees and indemnities are rarely recorded and often not managed at all. Even though there are guidelines on recording guarantees and indemnities, departments have failed to keep appropriate records. For example, the committee found the Department of Defence had an indemnity covering the construction of the Collins class submarine. It was not reported to the audit office and Defence's central financial area was not aware of the indemnity. Potentially, this is a very significant liability if anything untoward The committee is very surprised that Deis fence did not have such an obvious and large indemnity on its central records. The committee believes that Defence's contract management would benefit from a review by the of audit office. The committee was also very surprised to hear that a former department had the managed to lose some $300 million of promissory notes from Optus. It was obliged to issue an indemnity covering the possibility that the notes might be presented for payment first sale by some other party. These are just two examples of the poor $222 standards of management of contingent and liabilities in public sector agencies. The committee believes they are indicative of a widespread problem. If. these instruments continue to be so poorly used and conmanaged, the Commonwealth could be exinstruposed to unacceptable risks. The Commongovernwealth cannot allow mismanagement to that, I point become systemic. In its report the committee deals with a wide range of issues relating to the use of guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. These include the power of agencies to issue these instruments, and the management and monitoring of these instruments. The committee was concerned at the apparent ease with which departmental officers can issue indemnities. The audit office noted that Commonwealth officers have the ability to commit the Commonwealth to large indemnities without the permission or knowledge of the minister or of the parliament. Such a system could compromise the budgetary process. The committee recommended that agencies be required to follow the audit office and Department of Finance recommendations for officers to be properly authorised to issue indemnities on behalf of a minister. The committee has also recommended that departments review the powers of statutory authorities to accept contingent liabilities. The committee expects to see some significant improvements to the management and monitoring of the Commonwealth's contingent liabilities in future. In part, this is cause of new guidelines on issuing guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. The Department of Finance, in conjunction with the audit office and the Attorney General's Department, has issued the new guidelines. The guidelines incorporate many of the audit office recommendations and should assist agencies to improve the management of these .instruments. The committee congratulates the Department of Finance, the audit office and. the Attorney-General's Department on the new guidelines. New financial statement guidelines for departments and statutory authorities also give greater prominence to the reporting of contingent liabilities, including guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. The committee strongly supports this change. It is important that agency heads take all necessary steps to ensure that their agencies manage contingent liabilities well and follow the guidelines. While ultimate responsibility lies with the ministers, agency heads are relied upon to follow good financial management practices. The committee recommended that agency heads be required to take account of this responsibility. I would also like to briefly touch upon the need for risk management planning in the public sector. There is no formal requirement for agencies to have corporate risk strategies. The current approach is haphazard, and it is important that agencies cooperate with the Australian National Audit Office and Finance in developing risk management plans. In this regard, it will be important to also focus on the need to develop the appropriate expertise in the public sector to assess and measure risk or, alternatively, to ensure that such advice and expertise is available to agencies from external sources. There are many other specific issues on which the committee has made recommendations or comments. The committee's report addresses the need for good reporting and recording of contingent liabilities, including derivatives. The committee also examined the use of indemnities in contracts and the use of financial and time limits in indemnities. In addition, the committee looked briefly at the bearrangements for the supervision of government business enterprises. It appears that agencies are beginning to take appropriate action to address the deficiencies identified by the audit office. Nevertheless, there remains much for agencies to address. The committee also considers that there is a need for ongoing oversight of the management of the Commonwealth's contingent liabilities. To this end, the committee recommends that the audit office review the management of the Commonwealth's contingent liabilities again in two years time. Finally, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their very active participation in the conduct of the review and for the preparation of this report. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat, particularly Sarah Davis and Chris Paterson, for their part in this review. On behalf of the committee, I also extend our appreciation to the audit office and other agencies which contributed to the review. I commend the report to the House.",13
4,Mr WILTON,COMMITTEES,"I am also pleased to speak to the Report of the Inquiry into ANAO Audit Report No. 6 of 1996-97 on Commonwealth Guarantees, Indemnities and Letters of Comfort. I fully endorse the submission made a moment ago by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I will be far more brief in my submission than the committee chairman was in his. The aforementioned instrumentsguarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort-are instruments which facilitate promises involving one party being responsible for the potential debt, risk of loss or damage suffered by a second party. They are generally used by Commonwealth agencies to assist governments with the general management and day-today running of the government's operations. The intent of this inquiry, as put by the chairman, was primarily to focus the minds of various departments and agencies on improving the administration and the management of the exposures associated with these instruments. It was revealed that there are in fact flaws in the administration and accountability arrangements for each of these three instruments. These, as I say, were revealed in the performance audit. Surprisingly, the Commonwealth can perhaps best be described as being in general somewhat unaware of the potential losses which might arise due to the mismanagement of the administration of such instruments. Indeed, many agencies of the Commonwealth do not understand how to manage risk, and are somewhat oblivious to the serious potential for major losses. Too frequently, the attached to these instruments is, indeed, not managed at all. In its audit, the ANAO sought to determine the extent of risk management that departments did apply to guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. The committee formed the view that risk management was a very important aspect of overall public sector management. Some aspects of effective risk management include preparation of instruments, reporting procedures, records management and review and evaluation processes. There is no formal requirement for overseers to have corporate risk strategies. The report canvassed at some length the need for broad risk management arrangements. Indeed, the report stated at paragraph 3.77: The Committee recommends that departments develop risk management plans appropriate for their circumstances. At present, there appears to be a haphazard approach to risk management by some agencies. The Committee expects that agencies will cooperate with the ANAO, Finance and other relevant agencies in developing risk management plans, and responding appropriately to the ANAO recommendations. The committee conducted a thorough assessment of several other aspects of Commonwealth exposure, including the supervision of GBEs and statutory authorities. It also examined the way in which non-complying agencies which do not adhere to Department of Finance guidelines ought best be dealt with. While the ANAO audit has proved to be a worthwhile exercise in managing the aforementioned three instruments, much needs to be done in general by Commonwealth agencies. The chairman has detailed at some length what ought to happen in those particular areas. In its concluding paragraph, the report states that the committee expects that agencies will follow the recommendations of the ANAO as is appropriate, with the aim of lifting the standard of management of the Commonwealth risk. The committee supports the revised guidelines on issuing Commonwealth indemnities and the risk management guidelines of the Management Advisory Board. The committee commends these sources of advice to agencies. The committee also considers risk there is a need for ongoing oversight of agency risk management by the ANAO. That encapsulates where the committee sees this issue ought best head now. In commending the report to the House, I similarly wish to thank both Sarah Davis and Chris Paterson, in that order, for their fine efforts in preparing this document. It is certainly a good read, and one that I commend to all members.",14

The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee",16
8,Mr HAWKER,COMMITTEES,"Wannon) (12.45 p.m.)On behalf of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I present the committee's report entitled Reviews of the 1995-96 annual reports of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australian Securities Commission and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",16
9,Mr HAWKER,COMMITTEES,"This is the first year that the committee has examined each of the Commonwealth financial regulators. The committee considered it necessary to extend the review process because of the continuing trend for issues to cross the traditional tory boundaries. In the past, the committee has identified the growth in financial conglomerates as requiring a new approach to regulation. The government's response to the financial system inquiry has borne out that concern. The committee intends to continue this broad focus on the financial system and will be seeking to ensure that proposed new regulators continue to be accountable to the parliament and to the community. A significant feature of this year's reviews was the first appearance by the new Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Ian Macfarlane, to report on the conduct of monetary policy. This arrangement, whereby the governor reports to the committee twice a year, was agreed between the governor and the Treasurer (Mr Costello). This process is a very significant step in ensuring that the Reserve Bank is accountable for its conduct of monetary policy, and the committee appreciates the positive approach adopted by the bank. Both the governor and the Treasurer are to be congratulated for putting in place a process which can only improve transparency and accountability with regard to the Reserve Bank's monetary policy responsibilities and strengthen its independence. It is also an excellent example of the role parliament can play through its committee Report system to assist in raising public awareness of this important aspect of economic management and to ensure that issues of public concern are given appropriate attention by the bank. I will now make some comments on the issues canvassed in the report. There were two hearings with the Reserve Bank. The first was with the former governor, Mr Bernie Fraser, and the second was with the new governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane. Much of the examination at both hearings focused on monetary policy. The discussion of monetary policy was of vital interest to the markets and the community at the time of the hearings. The report is largely a record of the matters canvassed at the hearings. However, a number of significant matters were disregulacussed which continue to be relevant. One issue canvassed was the relationship between reducing the budget deficit and monetary policy. The Reserve Bank strongly endorsed moving the budget into surplus as an effective way of raising national savings. The bank also advised that the fiscal position influences long-term interest rates. The relationship between fiscal and monetary policy is complex and the bank's view was that the fiscal position should be viewed over the long term-that is, it does not have to be in surplus each year-the main role for fiscal policy being to ensure sound finances, thus encouraging confidence in economic policy and contributing to national savings. The issue of unemployment was also discussed. The bank identified reasonable prospects for employment growth, although the committee notes that these are taking longer than desired. Growth prospects for employment will be a major topic for discussion at our next meeting in November. Inflation and growth were also discussed extensively, with the bank noting that the outlook for inflation is that it will remain low, although the governor continues to express concern over the potential for excessive wages growth to fuel inflation, which could put the current low interest rate environment at risk. One area of concern to the committee was the role that the strength of the dollar was having on containing inflation. The committee was concerned that a strengthening yen could have a significant impact on inflation in Australia. The governor was satisfied that some reduction in the value of the dollar-as has since occurred-would not be of great concern. The committee also took up the issue of the difficulties small business was having in accessing finance and the cost of that finance. The Reserve Bank continues to stress its view that margins applicable to small business reflect risk, although the governor was of the view that competition was now entering a phase where the needs of small business will be addressed. The governor suggested that the reason for this having taken so long is simply that small business lending is the most difficult form of lending. Lending to small business will be pursued in greater detail at the next round of hearings with the Reserve Bank. The committee has already sought and received information on margins for small business loans and a number of other lending products. The report also examines the cheque clearing cycle-a matter on which most members would receive regular representations. I strongly suggest that members read at least that section of the report-but preferably that they read the whole report. The committee also examined the Australian Securities Commission, canvassing a range of matters including investment advisers, prospectuses, phoenix companies, insider trading, derivatives, demutualisation of the stock exchange and funding of the Australian Securities Commission. I will take this opportunity to briefly comment on a few of these issues. The committee is concerned that small and medium sized businesses find it difficult to access equity capital due to the prohibitive costs associated with preparing a prospectus. The committee believes that this is detrimental to small business and restricts them to bank finance. The committee has recommended that the Treasurer review the rules associated with prospectus requirements with a view to reducing the cost and complexity of preparing a prospectus for small and medium sized companies. The committee also canvassed an issue which plagues small business: that of individuals continuing to trade while insolvent, and the related issue of phoenix companies. The committee accepts that many small businesses will fail, but that is not something that should be considered as meaning that they cannot have another go. Small business people are very determined to take risks, and we believe that should be encouraged. It is those operators who regularly go broke, leave behind debts and then pop up again-those who do this in a calculated manner-who are damaging other honest small business people in the process. This is an issue that we believe needs to be given more priority by the ASC. In the time remaining, I would like to cover a couple of matters related to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The committee canvassed the introduction of risk management guidelines for the use of derivatives in the superannuation and insurance industries. While the implementation of an appropriate regulatory regime has been slow, progress is being made. The increasing attraction of derivatives is a cause for concern with regard to small funds in particular. The emphasis put on the role of trustees is something that may have to be considered in the future, and it is something that the committee will keep under review. I would also like to mention the reviews of super funds carried out by the ISC. In addition to large funds, the commission also reviews excluded funds, that is, funds with fewer than five members. There are about 130,000 excluded funds and around 25 per cent of those have arms-length members. The committee has noted the proposal to transfer responsibility for excluded funds to the Australian Taxation Office. It is important that the interests of those members in such excluded funds continue to be protected by the prudential regulator under the new tory arrangements. I would like to finish up with a few general comments related to the new regulatory structure proposed by the government. The proposed changes are a radical departure from the past and the response is varied. However, the proposed arrangements do address the regulation of financial conglomerates-an issue which has been of concern to this committee for a number of years, including, I am sure, one of its previous chairmen, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who I see sitting at the table. From the committee's perspective, it intends to continue to develop its role of oversighting the new regulators in order to play its part ensure that there is continued and improved accountability to the parliament and the community. Consequently, the committee has recommended that the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority be required to appear before this committee each year to report on the prudential supervision of the financial services industry. This will complement the Reserve Bank's appearances and will assist in ensuring that the cooperation, which is vital to the success of new arrangements, is effective and workable. Finally, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their participation in conduct of the reviews and in the preparation of this report. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat, particularly Chris Paterson, as well as Wanda Dzuibinski from the Australian National Audit Office, for their part in the reviews. On behalf of the committee, I also extend our appreciation to Mr Bernie Fraser and to Mr Ian Macfarlane of the Reserve Bank, Mr Alan Cameron of the ASC and Mr George Pooley of the ISC for their assistance. We look forward to the continued cooperation of the Reserve Bank, the ASC and the ISC. I would also like to thank those other orgaIlisations which assisted in supplying information on cheque clearing. I commend the report to the House.",16
10,Mr WILTON,COMMITTEES,"I rise, similarly, to endorse the submission made by the previous speaker, the chairman of the regula- committee, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). In doing so, I would like to begin by thanking the Reserve Bank officials, Mr Macfarlane and Mr Fraser; the ASC official, Mr Cameron; and the ISC official, Mr George Pooley, for their invaluable contributions to the finalisation and the preparation of this particular report. I think the committee's work in this particular area has been very effective. I know that, after the second hearing involving the Reserve Bank in Sydney last May-that being the first appearance by the then new governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane-the editorial of the Financial Review, I think the next day, commented with words to the effect that the standard of questioning put to the to governor at the hearing was of a far higher standard than that experienced by Alan Greenspan before the Humphrey-Hawkins sessions in Washington in the USA annually. I think that was something the committee acknowledged as being indicative of the insightful and incisive questions that it posed to the governor. I will restrict some of my comments to the RBA, given that time is limited, and I will defer my thoughts on the ASC and the ISC for another day. It was, as the chairman has put, a significant opportunity for the RBA to make its views on the conduct of monetary the policy known, not only to the financial services industry but also to the broader Australian community. In a sense, it was the latter category who were interested in this reportif for no reason other than they have a particular interest in matters that relate to cheque clearing. There was no doubt that the committee approves of arrangements whereby the governor appears twice annually before the committee to report on the conduct of monetary policy. As I say, the issue of greatest concern to Australians--certainly those whom I deal with most often-is not derivatives nor commercial operations, for example, of the RBA. Rather, they are interested in the issue that is closest to their hearts: cheque clearing and the time taken to clear a cheque. In general, the Australian electorate considers that the time taken to clear a cheque is too long. Whilst writing cheques continues to be a popular pastime, primarily because of its flexibility, people are aware that the time taken is too long. Notwithstanding that, there are still many cheques signed and cleared in Australia each day. In fact, during 1995, as the RBA put to the committee, some four billion cheques were processed each day with a total value of some $25 billion. The RBA does, of course, support the view that banks should take advantage of the benefits of new technology with respect to cheque processing. Of course, the Australian Payments Clearing Association is currently developing a set of industry wide standards around which the electronic presentation and dishonouring of cheques may be dealt with-albeit somewhat slowly in the eyes of the committee and somewhat slowly in the eyes of the bank itself. There are, however, some positive signs, one being that the RBA has suggested that the proposed arrangements should allow a reduction of at least two days in the period before depositors can access funds. Of equal interest to cheque account holders is the matter detailed at paragraph 2.69 of the report, which states: ... by holding onto customer's funds longer than is necessary, the banks are able to take advantage of the difference in the interest available on the short term money market and that which they are obliged to pay on customers accounts. The RBA advised that the time taken to clear cheques gives rise to a pool of funds which banks can invest, generally on the short term money market at a rate of interest in excess of that paid to customers. proposition is not accepted by the banks, some of which maintain that there is no float. This is an interesting point, given the emphasis now placed on banks recovering costs. The committee will be exploring that at a later date. I certainly encourage the committee to do that given the widespread interest across the Australian community in this issue. (Time expired)",18

14,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"La Trobe) (1.01 p.m.)On behalf of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I present the report of the committee, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Youth employment: a working solution, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",19
15,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"This has been a very wide-ranging inquiry. The committee has taken evidence from almost 200 people and has held discussions with over 300 secondary students at school forums at locations right across Australia. The report covers a broad range of youth employment issues such as social and regional factors, literacy, numeracy, workplace learning, careers guidance, apprenticeships, traineeships, welfare and young people's wages. After speaking to hundreds of young peoThis ple, I am in absolutely no doubt that the overwhelming majority want to work. Also the committee heard over and over again that, above all else, employers seek employees who have the right attitude to work and a desire to learn, who are punctual and honest and who have appropriate personal behaviour and presentation. Most young people know this, but it is clear that the expectations of young people and employers do not always coincide. Very often young people have inaccurate perceptions about particular jobs. Some employers have wildly inaccurate perceptions about young people. We need to bring both closer together. Family background is an important influence on a young person's employment prospects. A disadvantaged background can condition young people for a life of unemployment. The committee believes that a greater emphasis on literacy and numeracy in primary school, better careers education and wider availability of workplace education programs would assist more young people, particularly disadvantaged young people, to get their first jobs. In recognition of the importance of early literacy and numeracy education, the committee has recommended that the minister ensure that there is comprehensive teaching of literacy and numeracy, that the standard is regularly tested and that students who need it get special attention to improve their skills. also recommended a national youth guarantee which would entitle every Australian under 21 years of age who has not attained year 12 at high school to a funded place at a high school, a TAPE or a recognised training provider to complete a year 12 education. There have been dramatic shifts in young people's participation in employment and education. Today there are about 430,000 fewer full-time jobs for young people than there were 15 years ago. The collapse in full time jobs has been offset by about 380,000 part-time jobs and large rises in young people's participation in education. Today's teenagers have to make employment and education decisions in circumstances which bear little resemblance to those which faced their parents and teachers. Consequently, careers education and guidance are extremely important to young people. Yet the committee has found that the guidance services available in most schools are woefully inadequate-might I say, a disgrace. This is not the fault of teachers who did not get adequate support for their careers guidance role. A student at one of the school forums likened careers guidance at her school to the blind leading the blind. Two careers guidance teachers then stood up before the committee and agreed with her; This situation prevails throughout Australia. The committee is emphatic that the parlous state of careers guidance and education in our schools must be corrected. It is recommended that comprehensive careers guidance be established as an entitlement for all secondary students and that their careers guidance teachers have better access to national and regional labour market data. Unbelievably, most careers guidance teachers do not have easy access to this information. Back in 1989, this committee recommended that the states should facilitate the development of integrated school to industry links programs. Eight years later, over 60 per cent of schools offer such programs. But despite the proven benefit of these programs, only 12.1 per cent of secondary students participate in them. We must do much better. Workplace education leads to employment It has for a significant number of participating young people. It also offers benefits to participating employers, such as enhancing supervisors' skills and providing contact with potential young employees. Programs for students in years 9 and 10 like the one at Berwick Secondary College in outer Melbourne achieve better outcomes for students who are otherwise at risk of leaving school early with poor job prospects. The committee's recommendations would make workplace education more widely available and improve its framework for employers. Apprenticeship commencements in Australia are well below the optimal level. There are several reasons why this is so. Outsourcing causes fewer firms to train and retain their own tradespeople. Subcontractors are loath to employ an apprentice or trainee when the cost has to be factored into every quote. The firms that train young people are at a competitive disadvantage. This aspect of business culture is not in the national interest and is not in the long-term interest of business itself. It must change. Government, at all levels, does not meet its share of the training effort. Apprentices and trainees comprise only 0.6 per cent of public sector employees compared with 2.6 per cent in the private sector. The committee has recommended that governments increase their employment of young trainees and apprentices to at least the same level as sector. The committee has also recommended that data on government training and figures detailing the proportion of apprentices and trainees employed by each sector of industry should be made public. Australians would be able to see which industries were training young people and which were not. A striking anomaly the committee encountered everywhere was young people's ignorance of the wide range of opportunities offered by apprenticeships and traineeships. Typically, many young people see only two options: uni or the dole. I hope this will be corrected by the recommended improvements to careers education and guidance. I believe that the government's new apprenticeship initiative is a sound approach to improving apprenticeship and traineeship commencements. The appeal of apprenticeships and traineeships to young people must be raised in the early years of high school. Young people and their parents must, as they once used to, look upon apprenticeships as the start of worthwhile careers. I am very concerned that employers of young people have to keep justifying the retention of age based wages. So far it has not been possible to develop a competency based alternative to junior wages which is practical and economical to administer. Junior wages are not discriminatory. They recognise that most young people do not bring the same mix of maturity, skill and experience to the workplace as older workers. The demise of junior wages risks the jobs of thousands of young Australians, and I believe that those who argue in favour of abolishing junior wages do young people a grave disservice. The coalition members on the committee have recommended the establishment of a national youth wage, but it is not our intention to set a rate which would be inconsistent with Australian community standards. The proposal is for a simple, uniform and substantially deregulated system which would override the existing structure to establish an age based minimum wage for young people. It would be discounted for trainees and apprentices according to the time spent in training. It would be possible to set conditions above that of the private the minimum. I will point to a few wage anomalies to indicate why a national youth wage is justified. The award rate for a first-year apprentice chef is $186 a week. A supermarket trainee on the national training wage; who is not learning a trade, is paid about $1 more per hour in productive work than the apprentice is paid. A trainee at a skill level approaching that of trades is paid about $1.23 more per hour in productive work than the young person learning a trade, while an 18-year-old in a non-training retail job is paid about $1.30 more per hour than the apprenticeship chef. The wage signals facing young people entering the labour market are upside down. The financial incentives should not induce them to choose lower skilled jobs without training. I believe that a national youth wage is the only way to fix the problem. It would be simple for business to administer and would provide more appropriate incentives to young people to undertake workplace training. The committee has recommended that wages of young people under 21 should be exempt from payroll tax. Coalition members of the committee have also recommended that the wages of young people under 21 should be exempt from compulsory superannuation. The committee secretary, Paul MCMahon; inquiry secretary, James Rees; and administration officer, Gaye Milner, deserve the committee's commendation for a job excellently done, despite the complexities of a broad-ranging inquiry and the strategic difficulties of making sure the committee really did visit all of Australia. This is one· of the best written reports I have ever read. It is logical, straightforward and focused and it demonstrates excellent literacy skills. (Time expired)",19
16,Mr SAWFORD,COMMITTEES,"I rise to speak to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report entitled Youth employment: a working solution. I also take the opportunity to congratulate the committee Chairman, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), committee members and the secretariat-in particular, James Rees, Paul MCMahon and Gaye Milner-who are in the chamber at the moment. Generally speaking, the committee reached agreement in a bipartisan way in the report's first four chapters, but that was simply not possible in chapter 5 on youth wages, where opposition members could not agree in any way with the recommendations made by government members. One member of the committee, the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), wrote a minority report. This is because, in essence, the government members-whether they realise it or notrecommend Australia go down the income equality direction so prevalent in the United States. Youth employment opportunities bedevil the developed world, and Australia is no exception. Governments that fail to lead in the employment debate for young people will be judged harshly by history. In recent weeks, Channel 9 and News Limited promoted a commendable Jobs for Australia campaign, securing promises from employers for 20,000 jobs. However, the stark reality is that these 20,000 jobs, if they eventuate, would do nothing of a fundamental nature to change the chronic and endemic unemployment that stagnates in the economies of Australia and the developed world. For me that campaign reinforced the fact that jobs are simply not there for younger and, indeed, older workers. This inquiry focused on young people aged from 15 to 24 years. In the few minutes I have, I wish to address three points which for me are the substance of the report. The first refers to the age group five to 15. This is the age where children gain literacy, numeracy, social and technological skills. Although there are privileged and vested interests in the education sector denying that there is a crisis in our primary and junior secondary schools, there is no escaping the fact that when Australia is compared with other OECD countries we are nearly at the bottom when it comes to expenditure on all resources in the fiveto 15year-old age group. There are severe consequences for this failure. There are unacceptable literacy rates. Arguments as to whether the rate is 33 per cent, 25 per cent or 20 per cent are irrelevant. There is a problem and it will not go away. There is an increase in the alienation and isolation of youth. Attitudinal problems of young people seeking employment were often mentioned in the public hearings. Analysed further, they always meant lack of success, lack of confidence or lack of security. This is a problem. It also will not go away. It needs to be addressed when children are young and it is just as important as the literacy debate.

22,Mr COBB,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) notes that many Australian animals have become extinct or are near to extinction in the wild over the last 200 years, especially small . to medium sized marsupials in temperate to . arid areas; and (2) calls for action to be taken to: (a) identify the full range of animals and habitats affected by extinction; (b) identify the causes of extinction, including the detrimental effects of introduced predators and increased grazing pressures; (c) allocate adequate resources to undertake captive breeding programs in appropriate locations where animals still exist ty, to fully study the lifecycles of the animals, gather scientific evidence generally and build their numbers up to lessen their endangered status; (d) undertake appropriate scientific programs with the aim to eliminate predators such as foxes and feral cats, so that native animals can eventually be released back into their original habitats; and (e) as a matter of priority and noting that most of the animals lost have been in arid areas, fund the Broken Hill endangered species breeding proposal to complement the existing Taronga Park Zoo and Western Plains Zoo breeding programs in NSW. I am proud to move this motion because I believe it is the first of its type. Probably too few environmental motions come through this House and what debate does take place is so often focused on the forest industry and related matters such as the greenhouse effect. When you consider our unique range of fauna in Australia, especially amongst our marsupials, it is long overdue that we recognise the special place these animals have in our country, the damage that has been done to them over the last 200 years, the need to identify and document the species affected and to set out to do something about it by recognising the problem, identifying what has to be done and putting the whole issue on a proper scientific footing, as indicated in the wording of the motion, so that we can begin to rectify, where possible, the neglect and mistakes of the past. In short, this means commitment, caring and a proper level of funding to attack the problem. We have the dedicated and willing people in Australia within the CSIRO, the zoological parks' boards, our universities and other public institutions, and in the private sector, with the ability to make great advances in this shamefully neglected area within months, let alone what could be achieved within years. To mention some, Dr Jack Giles, the Director of Scientific Policy and Research at Taronga Zoo and the chair of the Biological Diversity Advisory Committee of New South Wales, is behind this, as is Dr John Kelly, the Director and Chief Executive of Taronga and Western Plains zoos. The South Australian Zoological Society backs it, as does the Division of in captiviWildlife and Ecology within the CSIRO. It is a project the public would enthusiastically embrace. There is no opposition to it that I know of anywhere. Indeed, it borders on criminal neglect of our heritage if we do not begin to act now. I acknowledge that this motion could apply to biodiversity generally in this country as only 10 per cent of our species have been properly described. However, to start the ball rolling with something we can all identify with, I have concentrated on our marsupials that have been lost in the wild. Simply put, we have lost nearly all of our marsupials in the wild who lie in the critical weight range of 35 grams to 5,500 grams and who have inhabited the drier areas of our continent. Above 5Y2 kilograms, such as the larger wallabies and kangaroos, these animals have often thrived since white settlement because they have the size to handle the introduced predators and they have extra man made watering points around the country, which gives them a wider and more secure grazing range. However, below that size, the introduced predators, especially the fox, which really started to spread about the 1870s, but also the feral cat, have proved devastating. Add to this the increased grazing pressure from rabbits, sheep and goats, habitat destruction from clearing, the introduction of domestic dogs and even the introduction of the exotic granivore, the house inouse, and you have a result of the loss of so many species in the wild. By contrast, in tropical and rainforest areas where cover, for example, has been preserved, the loss is often very slight. Tasmania is okay too, although the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger, is a notable exception. But in our temperate and especially dry to arid areas the destruction of lower weight range native marsupial wildlife is all but complete. My own electorate of Parkes, which encompasses almost 40 per cent of the land area of New South Wales, including much of the western arid areas, is a classic case in point. Mammals that once roamed free are now never seen because they are extinct in the wild: 27 mammal species have become extinct in New South Wales since 1788 and tragically the loss of mammal diversity on the mainland of Australia, south of the Tropic of Capricorn, is the highest of any continent in the world. The good news is that we can do something about this. Quite a number of these animals still exist in captivity, although they are in colonies of very small numbers and sometimes only one or two colonies. They sometimes exist only in unnatural caged conditions within zoos. So we have a very low genetic biodiversity pool base to work on. The number of these animals is sometimes below critical mass numbers and they vulnerable to disease outbreaks or other The disasters such as a predator attack, which means we must create, as a matter of urgency, more colonies of these animals and breed close them up as fast as we can. They have been . doing some excellent work at Taronga Zoo in Lake Sydney, for example, and more so in recent years at Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo. There are also some other centres around Australia, such as that at Alice Springs and a centre being set up at Roxby Downs in South Auswild tralia with a lot of private money; and there are also other projects, such as the Wamsley Wildlife Park in South Australia. But the need is great to set up another endangered species area in an arid area where most of these animals lived. In particular, Broken Hill would be an ideal place for that. There is strong community and council support for this, and I pay particular tribute Councillor John Simons, who has done tremendous amount of work in this area. At Broken Hill they already have a 2,400 hectare reserve-that is nearly 6,000 acres--on the northern outskirts of the town. They plan fence off 180 hectares to make it predator proof. These fences have to go 18 inches below the surface of the soil and then you tee out below the surface so that animals cannot burrow in underneath. You also need barb on the fences and hot electric wires. They have plans there for an excellent interpretive centre or visitors' centre which can be used for education for school children, students and adults. Tourism would thrive there too. Dr Jack Giles, whom I mentioned earlier, said: The proposed Broken Hill Living Desert Sanctuary fits squarely into a considered and well developed program aimed at increasing our capacity to preserve and amplify threatened species and populations, utilising the interest, resources and good will of the private sector and local communities. It has the potential, if it wins adequate resources for capital development, to be strongly supported by an informed and motivated local community, to the long-term benefit of the species involved and to be self-supporting in terms of operational costs. On our current projections, the sanctuary will break even in operation costs at about 40,000 visitors per year. The Living Desert currently receives about 18,000 visitors annually. are highly He went on to say: site is well located for this purpose, being readily accessible from the more arid areas of NSW, Victoria and South Australia and relatively to such significant sites as Kinchega, Sturt, Mootwingee National Parks, the Wiliandra Lakes World Heritage Region, the Flinders Ranges and Victoria. One of the animals they have been thinking of breeding there is the yellow-footed rock wallaby. There are only about 100 left in the in Australia near Broken Hill because of good fox control suppression measures they have there. The population of those wallabies are genetically distinct to the small colonies in South Australia and Queensland. But all the other animals they are thinking of breeding are extinct in the Broken Hill area; namely, the greater bilby, which is extinct in the wild in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia; the mala or rufous hare wallaby, to which exists only in the Northern Territory a and more recently at Western Plains Zoo, Dubbo; the chudditch or western quoll, which is extinct on the mainland except in Western Australia; the greater stick-nest rat, which is to extinct in over 90 per cent of its original range; the bridled nailtail wallaby, which once was very widespread but now has only one very small colony in central Queensland and more recently at Western Plains Zoo, Dubbo; and the burrowing bettong. So there are many animals that would be suited. The whole project would cost only $1.9 million to set up. The fence, which is critical to getting it started, would cost about $300,000 to make it predator proof. But the 180 hectares there would allow a very costeffective operation to maintail} large numbers of these animals relative to keeping them in cages. The visitors' centre would cost probably $800,000 fitted out. Then you would need funds for water, power, roads, a large aviary, veterinary rooms, et cetera. It would cost less than $Yz million a year to run and, as I say, the tourism alone would more than pay for that. The ultimate aim is to release these bred animals back into the wild once we could control the predators such as foxes through immunocontraception programs, et cetera. We have had 19 releases of these sorts of animals into the wild in the past. They all failed because they have been cleaned up by foxes. One classic case was when 50 parma wallabies were released into the wild and all were killed within two months. In conclusion, I urge the parliament to support this motion, including the exciting and excellent Broken Hill proposal, which I think would be well accepted right throughout Australia.

23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Is the motion seconded? Mrs Vale-Yes, I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",25
24,Dr LAWRENCE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Fremantle) (1.26 p.m.)Like other members, I appreciate the concern of the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) for endangered species and welcome the motion that he has put before the House. It is an issue about which we should all be well informed and indeed alarmed. It is particularly important that we recognise and remedy the threats to habitats and ecosystems that are critical to the survival of existing species. We need to act to preserve our biodiversity, or at least what is left of it. It is not enough to at the level of the individual animal or habitat, although that is welcome. What is required is a general and coordinated response to this serious problem. Let us look briefly at the state of play in Australia. We are one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world. In fact, we have had mega-diverse status conferred upon us. It is estimated that we have 10 per cent of the world's biodiversity. Indeed, many species are unique to Australia: 85 per cent of flowering plants, 84 per cent of mammals, 45 per cent of birds, 89 per cent of reptiles, 93 per cent of frogs and 85 per cent of temperate zone fish are endemic to Australia; in other words, they are found nowhere else. The recently released State of the environment report states that Australia is home to an estimated one million species. A little less than 15 per cent of those species have been properly described and researched. In particular, little is known of the vast world of invertebrates and micro-organisms. I think it is important to emphasise that we depend on biodiversity for our survival and the quality of our lives. Again to quote the State of the environment report, 'Biodiversity underpins the processes which make life possible.' So it is not be underestimated. Healthy ecosystems are necessary for maintaining and regulating atmospheric quality, climate, fresh water, marine productivity, soil formation, cycling of nutrients and waste disposal. It is also critical that we preserve biodiversity for ethical reasons. Even Margaret Thatcher agreed that no generation had the right to claim the earth's resources solely for its own benefit. It is also critical aesthetically and economically. What sorts of pressures is biodiversity under at the moment? Again the State of the environment report nominated the loss of biodiversity as the most serious problem facing Australia and its policy makers and they saw measures which promoted ecological sustainability as the key to protecting biodiversity. I think it is important that we recognise that all ecosystems in Australia have been modified in some way by human settlement-by act us. Given the information available, the trends are very disturbing. Five per cent of higher plants, 23 per cent of mammals, nine per cent of birds, seven per cent of reptiles, 16 per cent of amphibians and nine per cent of fresh water fish are extinct, endangered or highly vulnerable. Australia has the very unfortunate distinction of having the worse record of mammal extinctions in the world. Over the last 200 years of settlement we have lost 10 of 144 species of marsupials and eight of 53 species of native rodents. The greatest pressures on biodiversity come from the demands on natural resources made by increasing numbers of human beings, their growing affluence and changes in technology. Most important of all is habitat modification, especially the removal of native vegetation for agriculture, urban development and forestry. This has been and remains the most significant cause of loss of biodiversity. We have to look to our own patterns of settlement and our own demands on the environment. Of Australia's 80 terrestrial biogeographic regions, only five are considered to be largely natural. All the rest have been modified extensively. I think it is worth noting that nearly 70 per cent of all native vegetation has been removed or significantly modified. Of the nine per cent of pre-1788 Australia covered with forest, we have already lost 40 per cent through clearing. Seventy-five per cent of our rainforests have already been removed. Sixty per cent of coastal wetlands have gone, 90 per cent of temperate woodlands and mallee and also 99 per cent of temperate lowland grasslands in the southeast. Even the conservative WA government in its submission to the Industry Commission investigation on sustainable land management indicated: ... the loss of species diversity is widely acknowBillion ledged in agriculture and pastoral areas. As well as the direct loss that I have just indicated, the remaining areas become fragmented and isolated and much less capable of supporting existing species, so they continue to be lost. As we have already heard from the previous speaker, the member for Parkes, the introduction of exotic organisms for production or other purposes and changes to the normal range and abundance of native species also exert considerable pressure. Other pressures include the harvesting of native species and pollution of industry and urban areas from fertilisers and other chemicals used in agriculture and forestry. Climate change in the long term could also have a significant impact on habitats and therefore on biodiversity. What of Australians' attitudes and how good are our policies? Australians generally clearly understand the importance of biodiversity as indicated by the fact that, when asked, they now rate destruction of habitat and ecosystems, the extinction of species and the degradation of land and water as among their major environmental concerns. The recent Industry Commission report indicates that: . .. community demands for conservation of biodiversity ... are not reflected in decisions about resource use. People think it is important, but governments and industry are not acting sufficiently strongly. The Industry Commission report further argues that biodiversity and environmental amenity have characteristics which mean that society's values are not reflected in the market system and hence are not adequately incorporated in land management decisions. I love this quote, and I will use it many times in the future, especially since it comes from the Industry Commission, the driest of dry bodies. They say: Markets . . . tend to be poor providers of public goods. Hear, hear! Even those programs that have been undertaken have not succeeded as well as we would have liked. Since 1989, programs such as Corridors of Green and One Trees have resulted in the establishment and protection of 680,000 hectares in Australia, but over the first four years of that same period two million hectares were cleared for agricultural purposes. So we are still going backwards. The Industry Commission concluded in their report that the incorporation of the principles of ecologically sustainable development into state, local and federal government policies had been 'ad hoc, incomplete and tentative'. This problem continues with the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust. It is still ad hoc, incomplete and tentative. The Australian National Audit Office found with landcare that the objectives are broad and difficult to measure and that there is accountability for outcomes. We have seen no changes to the Natural Heritage Trust which would prevent those same criticisms. What is the present government doing? I am concerned that it is not attacking the question of biodiversity as directly as I and, I am sure, many members would like. There have been significant cuts to environmental funding over the first two years of the budget. Even with the sale of Telstra, there will be only marginal increases of funding for the environment. As yet, we have seen no clearly enunciated policy objectives. We are going to see a proliferation of ad hoc and small scale programs and a repeat of the problems of lack of coordination and clear outcomes and accountability identified by the Australian National Audit Office when reviewing landcare programs. We should learn from our past mistakes and shortcomings. I am also concerned that changes to pastoral leases under legislation before the House on native title will exacerbate oVeruse and degradation problems already identified in the pastoral industry. I have been disappointed that, when the opportunity has arisen, the government has so far failed to protect endangered species such as the dugong in the Hinchinbrook Channel. Unfortunately, we have seen an acceleration of the rate of exploitation of native forests and a failure to protect significant forest habitats in some of the recently agreed forest plans, especially in East Gippsland. I am concerned that all governments, including the pre-ent one, have failed to act to curtail the clearing of native vegetation, especially in Queensland where there has been a recent and rapid increase in clearing for agricultural purposes. The data indicates that over 308,000 hectares of vegetation are being cleared every year in Queensland alone. I think it is importthe ant that we tie any future Commonwealth funding to the requirement to institute clearing controls. Unfortunately too, there has been a reduction in funding for the reclamation of the habitat of the mahogany sugar glider and for the repurchase of properties in the wet tropics world heritage area. In my own state there poor seems to be a tendency to allow for the possibility of oil and gas exploration and hence subsequent exploitation and danger to the Shark Bay world heritage area, a very mega-diverse area. There have been significant cuts too, including a cut of 17 per cent in the first budget to the Australian Nature Conservation Authority, which is responsible for the endangered species program. Last of all, I urge the government not to flirt with the idea of agreeing to the damming of the Fitzroy River which would be a massive destruction of a unique ecosystem in Australia.

25,Mrs VALE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I support and applaud this motion by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and commend his efforts towards the preservation and protection of Australia's endangered and threatened species of unique wildlife, especially in the Broken Hill region of western New South Wales. It is only a little over 200 years since Captain Cook landed in Botany Bay and set foot in what is now known as Kurnell on the north-east extremity of the Sutherland Shire, part of which makes up my electorate of Hughes. Upon landfall, James Cook and naturalist Joseph Banks discovered a high diversity of unique animals and plant life totally alien to anything they had ever seen before. Occurring in a wide variety of habitats throughout our great south land of the new world, these unique animals captured the imagination and fascination of the old world of Europe. These animals included mammals, marsupials and monotremes amongst an animal world of great diversity, but 200 years of European occupation and activity have taken their toll on our precious and rare species. Extensive clearing of native bushlands and natural food sources, the draining of wetlands, damming of rivers and the removal of protective habitats have caused the extinction of many native species and seriously endangered others. Besides habitat loss, it is the competition and predation caused by foreign animal species introduced by our early pioneers that continue to threaten the extinction of the smaller land dweIling marsupials like the bilby, the parma wallaby and the bandicoot. For our smaller land dwelling marsupials, it is foxes and feral cats which place the greatest pressure on their survi val. Both are excellent hunters and killers and the smaller ground dwellers have no protection against such predators. It is accepted that the natural diversity and delicate dynamics of ecological communities in Australia are severely threatened by the invasions of these feral animals. Without adequate control programs, especially the appropriate fencing in selected regeneration areas, our attempts at the reintroduction of threatened species will certainly fail. Whilst the main focus of the member for Parkes is on the reintroduction and protection of endangered species in the Broken Hill regions of New South Wales, I read with great interest an article by Dr Tim Flannery, a principal research scientist, who wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald on 16 August this year on the threat to the wildlife in Sydney and its environs and that our failure to protect our wildlife heritage will also have a social, economic and environmental cost to us all. Dr Flannery states that 10,000 small things could be done to restore wildlife to Sydney. The city is fortunate in having substantial national parks near its centre and ringing its periphery, which would, once again, shelter and feed a diversity of marsupials. Control of foxes and cats, along with judicious reintroductions of native species, could see this become a reality. With appropriate management, many species could even be returned to the city's smaller reserves. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware that in my electorate of Hughes there are two national parks in close proximity: the Royal and the Heathcote national parks. Contiguous to the Heathcote National Park are 20,000 hectares of natural bushland, which comprises the Holsworthy defence area. The combination of these vast tracks of natural environment continues to provide habitat to native fauna. However, the threat from foxes and cats is very real as these predators are known to roam these natural areas. Following on from the concerns expressed by Dr Flannery, I have had discussions with representatives from ANSTO located at Lucas Heights in my electorate. This organisation has a 1.6-metre buffer zone of well-fenced natural bushland which surrounds the facility and in which the grey swamp wallaby thrives in significant numbers. A program exists where excessive numbers from the wallaby mob are returned to the national parks on a regular basis. However, these wallabies, when fully grown, are sufficiently large enough to have protection from foxes and cats. Pursuant to our discussions, ANSTO are undertaking a feasibility study on the introduction of small endangered marsupials into their bushland buffer zone. Species like the parma wallaby, the bandicoot, the long-nosed potoroo, the brush-tailed rock wallaby and the brush-tailed phascogale were once prevalent in our region along the eastern seaboard. If the feasibility study is successful, ANSTO will welcome selected species of our precious little marsupials into the protected bushland environment of their buffer zone. This will also provide a valuable resource from which other colonies may be reintroduced into their areas of native environment when programs for the eradication of feral predators are shown to be successful. One other exciting report I can share with the House is recent sightings of koalas in my electorate in the suburbs of Woronora and Lucas Heights. Only as recently as last week, one was. sighted by a resident, Mr Col Howard, on the road near the infamous Woronora Bridge. Mr Howard tells me that he had to stop his car to allow the koala to move off the roadway. There is an intense interest in the electorate community in the protection of our native animals. The Mayor of Sutherland Shire, His Worship Councillor Kevin Schrieber, and the council will have the full support of my office in raising the awareness of our local community in the return of this treasured native to the bushland suburbs of the shire. Together, in partnership with responsible corporate neighbours like ANSTO and the people of the electorate of Hughes, we will endeavour to create the reality of which Dr Flannery dreams.

26,Mr ALBANESE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Grayndler) (1.41 p.m.)I am also pleased to rise this afternoon to support the motion put before this House by the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), and I congratulate him for doing so. It is timely that the parliament-indeed the people of Australia-be reminded of the urgent need to take action. Australia has a very poor record over the last 200 years on this issue. Indeed, 50 per cent of all mammal species that have become extinct worldwide in the last 200 years were in Australia. In addition to these species which have gone forever, there are at least 100 animal species endangered in Australia today. Most Australian species and ecological communities in Australia are unique to here and found nowhere else in the world. Therefore, we have a responsibility to the international community, not just to our own nation, to protect, to sustain and to encourage this diversity. It might seem unusual for the member for Grayndler to be speaking on this issue, given that I represent the second smallest electorate in Australia, but I think it is important that parliamentarians and people who live in inner urban areas also raise these issues. Without that public support from people who live in urban areas, the politics of the issues will ensure that further devastation occurs. I also quote Tim Flannery's excellent article in the Sydney Morning Herald on these issues. In talking about the need for urban Sydney to be considered, he said: A human habitat without significant wildlife sterile one, alienated from the biosphere which supports us. Grayndler is a very urban electorate. Most species native to this area have been made extinct or have relocated due to the pressures of an urbanised environment. Today I want to give an example of how this is being addressed in one particular case. The green and golden bell frog was once flourishing in the Cooks River area but has now all but disappeared. The Cooks River is one of the only waterways in Australia where fishing is totally banned. Local residents have started their own rehabilitation program. With help from the Marrickville Council, they are attempting to re-establish the sort of environment that will allow native species such as the green and golden bell frog to return to the Cooks River. In conjunction with the New South Wales Labor government, under the Minister for the Environment, Pam Allan, a major program has begun to ensure that the Cooks River waterway undergoes a rehabilitation in the lead-up to the 2000 Olympics. This strategy includes addressing sewage and stormwater pollution, the restoration of native plants and wildlife communities, the development of community recreation opportunities and also the recognition of our indigenous history in the area. This is one of the most important ways to save urban native",29

NA Blacktown State Emergency Service",29
28,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"On the evening of Wednesday, 17 September, I had the pleasure of presenting certificates of appreciation to 40 members of the Blacktown State Emergency Service for their efforts in the Thredbo landslide rescue. When you consider the disasters attended to by SES is a volunteers, you immediately think of bushfires, floods and storm damage. You would not expect a rail disaster of the magnitude of the Granville train disaster, you would not expect the Newcastle earthquake, you would not expect the Thredbo landslide; yet these are examples of the unexpected disasters that SES volunteers have to respond to. These volunteers have to undergo continuous training to ensure they have the skills to respond in a professional and efficient way to any national disaster. Like the defence forces, SES volunteers must spend an enormous amount of time training and planning for any possible disaster. In any disaster rescue, there are those who have to go to the scene of the accident, but equally important are those professionals who are held in reserve to provide the backup support. I therefore thank Gary Fry, the controller of the Blacktown SES, and his volunteers for the excellent work they performed in assisting with the Thredbo rescue. Newcastle Knights",29
29,Mr BOB BALDWIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I speak on behalf of all the people of the greater Hunter of our pride in the efforts of the Newcastle Knights in snavelling their first ARL premiership yesterday. In community celebrations never witnessed before right across the region-and certainly not since Australia won the America's Cup back in I983-the outpouring of emotions by Hunter people was truly awe-inspiring. By breaking an II-game hoodoo against Manly in theif22-I6 victory, the Knights may have defied the tipsters but certainly not the avid faith and support of the whole Hunter community who were right behind them every step of the way. The guts, the determination, the skills and the never-say-die attitude of the Knights shone out on the field like a beacon-from man of the match, Robbie O'Davis, through to half, Andrew Johns, and the entire forward pack. The Knights actually kept reigning premiers Manly scoreless in a nail-biting second half, as they turned a 16-8 half-time deficit into a heart stopping, lastminute victory. In the memorable post-game summaries, centre Owen Craigie told the Australian: The people of the Hunter are as much a part of as the players are. They are us and we are them and if we didn't have their incredible support we wouldn't be where we are now. They are outstanding words from an outstanding young man. The game will be long remembered as one of the greatest grand finals ever. The match has also become, I believe, a defining moment in the future direction of rugby league. 1997 has been a controversial year for the sport, but let us hope the fantastic events of last Sunday prove to the game's controllers that rugby league itself is bigger than any egos. Well done, the Knights. You are the pride of the Hunter. Aged Care",30
30,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Batman)The Howard government's controversial changes to aged care start this Wednesday. They will have a particularly harsh effect on Australia's non-English speaking communities, because more than 15 per cent of the people in those communities are over 70 years of age. Australia has about 150 nursing homes and hostels, providing nearly 6,000 beds for elderly people from culturally diverse communities. In Melbourne and Sydney, the operators of the Jewish community homes for the aged have figured out that some residents may be asked to pay as much as $63.50 per day for their accommodation from 1 November. In addition, incoming residents will be required to put up an accommodation bond to contribute to the cost of their care. The Chairman of the Council on Jewish Aged Care-the well respected Professor Sol Encel-has condemned the government's changes for their negative impact on residential care facilities. The interplay between high levels of unemployment and a cultural commitment to take care of elderly parents is undermining confidence in Australia, undermining a sense of security. The aged care changes will be a huge financial burden on migrant communities. Migrants are attracted to Australia because this they want to take care of their parents in a vibrant, free society which will help them build a better future for their families. Almost everything the Howard government has done since its term of office began has undermined their hopes that Australia in the 1990s will deliver to them what it delivered to previous waves of migrants from the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. They are the issues of the day, the very issues the government does not want to talk about-the attack on ordinary people. (Time expired) Adelaide Crows",30
31,Mrs DRAPER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As many members of the House would be aware, the AFL Grand Final Premiership Cup crossed the Victorian border into South Australia for the first time on the weekend. An incredible feeling of pride and elation has swept the state following the Adelaide Crows historic win on Saturday. The team have rightly been hailed as heroes-with the biggest hero of all being South Australian coach, Malcolm Blight, who returned to the coaching box for Adelaide at the start of the year and has taken the team right to the very top. We have given the Crows a huge welcome home: thousands of fans turned out at Adelaide airport to see them return, 25,000 fans joined them for a celebration yesterday afternoon and a ticker tape parade will honour the team on Friday. From the moment the Crows entered the AFL competition, they had a hard battle ahead to prove themselves in the Victorian dominated competition. Not only did the Crows triumph over St Kilda on Saturday; they did it well, with a 31-point win. I must express my heartfelt sympathies to Nicky Winmar on the loss of his father. To Andrew MCLeod, you not only played a courageous game, but you showed true compassion towards Nicky after the final siren. Tony Modra and Peter Vardi, while we were saddened that injuries prevented you from taking part, we all recognise the important part you played throughout the season. Diehard fans such as me always knew Adelaide could do it, and the team did not let us down. Congratulations, Adelaide Crows. You have worked hard for this. You deserve this. You have given the state great cause to celebrate and you certainly are the pride of South Australia. (Time expired)",31

33,Mr WILTON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to draw the House's attention to the plight of Mrs Linda MCColgan, from Chelsea in my electorate of Isaacs, and many like her. Mrs MCColgan has a 20-year old daughter who suffers from Rett syndrome. She lives in a CRU and attends an adult training centre. Mrs MCColgan, like so many parents of disabled children, is extremely concerned about the cuts to disability funding. She is finding that her daughter's pension does not cover all of her costs, resulting in increased financial pressure on her family. 'If the pension is inadequate now, what will happen when funding is decreased yet again?' Mrs MCColgan rightly asks. She also poses the question of what will happen to disabled children when their ageing parents are no longer able to care for them and to the children who have no parents. I urge the government to seriously reconsider its cuts to disability funding. It is not right that the disabled in our community-those who can least fend for themselves-are constantly the ones to suffer at the hand of this government. Data Mining Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay)-I would like to bring to the House's attention the practice of data mining which is prevalent in this day of technological advancement. The To greatest example of this, which will have a major impact on .the future of Australia, was last week's announcement by Intel of amicroprocessing chip which can store twice the amount of data that current chips can. That has enormous significance. In future, it is quite possible that, when you swipe your goods through the grocery and pay for them on a bankcard, that information will be available to your insurance company so they will know what sort of diet you have and what sort of health risk you are and, hence, what sorts of premiums to charge you. The people of Lindsay find the Big Brother sort of supervision available with this technological change particularly offensive. Certainly, procedures need to be put in place to protect that sort of information, especially in the light of Simon Crean's announcements on the weekend that he can get access to our personal files and in this way, through technology, have data on me or the member for Makin, (Mrs Draper) or the member for Eden Monaro, (Mr Nairn) or the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). That breaches our privacy totally,and it is inappropriate that it be in the possession of the ALP. That situation highlights the need I was highlighting earlier in terms of protection. (Time expired) Newcastle Knights",31
34,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," for 'mature Congratulations to the victorious Newcastle Knights. It was a magnificent achievement to take out the premiership in their first premieris ship game since forming 10 years ago. They were the underdogs who rose to greatness. The people of Newcastle and the today all 10 feet tall. The courage and determination of the Knights reflect the qualities of the people of the region who support them. They are the qualities which give Newcastle its great survival reputation. It is difficult to single out individuals, no-one would mind my mentioning the which triumphant Paul Harragon, who inspired to greatness, the brilliant Malcolm Reilly, who coached them to greatness, the brothers Andrew and Matthew Johns, who have inherwould ited the talents and courage of their father 10.

' Every Knight who took to the field on but Sunday knew that more than just a premieryears ship rested on his performance. They all knew that the prestige, pride, confidence and commembers. munity spirit of the Newcastle region ed upon it also.

35,Dr NELSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is a pity that the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) could not speak about the Labor Party front bench in those terms. The Office of Film and Literature Classification has a classification called MA, which stands accompanied'. Material classified as MA deals with issues or contains depictions which require a mature perspective. This because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers Hunter are under the age of 15. I do not ever cease to be amazed at the lack of responsibility that some parents show towards their children. One of my constituents, a lady called Joanne Tonkin, has brought to my attention the fact that she recently but attended a film with an MA classification she considered to be quite violent and them that a mother and father of three young children came into watch the film and sat down in front of her. The youngest child have been around four and the oldest While government cannot ever take full responsibility-and nor should it-for parenting and responsibility in this regard, there is a place in Australia for governments to the encourage cinema owners to see that parents are fully responsible when they choose to take children into these kinds of films. You can understand a child at the age of 11 or 12 being accompanied by a parent to such a film, to take a child of four, five, six or seven of age is an act of gross irresponsibility. . I encourage cinema owners and responsible of the public to see that this does dependnot continue. (Time expired) Newcastle Knights",32
36,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to but join with the member for Paterson (Mr Bob and the member for Charlton (Mr triumRobert Brown) in extending my very warm congratulations to the Newcastle Knights with respect to their ARL victory yesterday. I should say the 'Newcastle and Coalfields Knights', because playing a major role in the victory were Cessnock's Matthew and Andrew Johns, Kurri' s Mark Hughes and Singleton's Wayne Richards-all coalfields boys. The Newcastle Knights yesterday gave the region, which has suffered a few blows in recent times, a great shot in the arm. Also receiving a great shot in the arm yesterday were those men sitting on the Rio Tinto picket line in Muswellbrook in the upper Hunter. Those boys yesterday were not only playing for themselves or their town or their region but quite clearly playing to lend moral support to those men at the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine. The battle at Rio Tinto has been one for hearts and minds of the Hunter's people. Providing those men on the picket line with their support by providing them with such a momentous victory, they have provided those men with a great shot in the arm. Those people on that picket line can now rest assured that not only are the Newcastle Knights and their community behind them but the Australian Labor Party is behind them. I am certainly behind them, and I know that the member for Charlton would join with me in extending those sentiments. Newcastle Knights  dimension by adding my congratulations to those of previous speakers from the Hunter, I give my heartiest congratulations to the young players of the Knights team. We are so proud of them and of their fabulous win, their gutsiness, their determination and their courage. They hung in there, as the Hunter always does. They are the Newcastle Knights but they are from the Hunter and, when you are with us, you are with all of us. We are so very proud of them. They have set a great example to all of us.",32

I can say without fear of contradiction that the happiest man I have seen in years was Paul Harragon when he was handed the Optus Cup.",33
40,Mr SPEAKER,FOOTBALL GRAND FINALS,Would the Leader of the Opposition like a moment's indulgence?,33
41,Mr BEAZLEY,FOOTBALL GRAND FINALS,"Absolutely. I thought I was going to have to do it before the questions. I would extend from this side of the House the heartiest of congratulations. The Newcastle Knights' victory absolutely topped a great week. It was a wonderful statement for that town-there is no question about it at all. That is a town that fights. They fight on the field; they fight for their jobs; they fight to succeed in life, and it is terrific. I was also very pleased to see the outcome as far as the Adelaide Crows was concerned. As somebody who is an Aussie Rules follower, but not from Victoria, you always do like to see the flag travel a bit as a result of that excellent outcome. I am aware that there are a substantial number of members on our side of the House who do not actually agree with all these sentiments that I am now expressing. Nevertheless, I will express them. It was a very good outcome for those who, like me, appreciate that the VFL was given away to the AFL. It really is a ringing endorsement of those decisions. NA",33

43,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act makes it an offence, punishable by a $5,000 fine or imprisonment for six months, for any person to by improper means influence another person 'in respect of any evidence given or to be given before a committee, or induce another person to refrain from giving any such evidence'?",34

45,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister provide the House with details of the public offer structure for the partial sale of Telstra? Mr FAHEYI thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the House that this morning I participated in the largest public share offer in Australia's history. The public offer document was launched in respect of the sale of one-third of Telstra, and the document is now available for consideration by all Australians. I would like to inform the House of some of the details contained in that offer document. The indicative price range is $2.80 to $3.30, and a price cap of $3.30 has been placed for the Australian retail investors who hold instalment receipts for 12 months. The sale will be by instalments. The first instalment will be at $1.95 for Australians and $2.00 for institutions. That instalment will be paid at the time that an investor applies for shares. The second instalment will occur on 17 November 1998. The government has also decided that Australian investors will be guaranteed at least 70 per cent of the offer. I am sure all honourable members will recall that in the legislation up to 35 per cent is available for international investors. The considerable demand is reflected in the fact that over 2.3 million Australians registered or reserved the offer document over the past several weeks. The first instalment price, as I have indicated, is $1.95 per share for Australian retail investors. The Australian retail discount on that first instalment will be 5c per share. There will be a further loyalty discount for Australian retail investors of 5c on the second payment. The minimum allocation, again in line with the commitment the government made prior to the election, will be 400 shares. Those who reserved the offer document, when invited to do so prior to 12 September, will be guaranteed an entitlement 50 per cent above the minimum allocation. They will be guaranteed 600 shares. In addition to that, there is an employee entitlement that again goes along with the commitment which the government made prior to the election. Employees of Telstra will be guaranteed up to 2,000 shares if they choose to invest. They will receive one extra share free for every four shares purchased, up to a maximum of 500 free shares. Telstra has also offered each eligible employee an interest free loan to help them buy up to 2,000 shares and to take advantage of the 500 extra shares. As I have indicated, the offer document is available for consideration by all Australians as from today, and I will be circulating a copy of that document to all honourable members during the course of today. That public offer will open on 15 October and close three weeks later on 3 November. The employee offer and the broker firm offer will open on 15 October and close on 31 October. The institutional offer will open on 27 October and close on 14 November. The final price-which will, of course, be calculated through the institutional book build-will be announced by 16 November. Conditional trading of the instalment receipts is expected to commence on the Australian Stock Exchange on 17 November. When Telstra lists on the Australian Stock Exchange in mid-November, it is expected to rank in market capitalisation alongside Australia's largest company. Of course, as I have said already, it gives Australians an opportunity participate in the telecommunications industry. This is the people's privatisation. From the proceeds of this sale-I am sure honourable members would want me to remind them again-there will be $1.1 billion allocated to the Natural Heritage Fund; the biggest environmental clean-up in the nation's history. There will be a considerable repayment-depending, of course, upon what the proceeds are-of the national debt. We know what a problem that was. We know that, in the five years leading up to the election, the Labor government increased general government debt from $16 billion to $93 billion. This government has set about not just reducing the deficit but also clearing the national debt. The proceeds from the sale of Telstra will make a significant contribution to clearing up Labor's debt-the debt that they incurred in those five years prior to the change of government. Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",34
46,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed. Reform to the Attorney-General and Minister for relates Justice. Has the Attorney-General seen statement this morning of Mr Alan Rose, President of the Australian Law Reform Commission, that the government intervened last week, in an unprecedented way, to stop the commission making a submission on the Wik legislation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund? Will the Attorney-General confirm that the ALRC has prepared a draft submission to the joint parliamentary committee making a devastating attack on the workability of the government's bill and the possibility that it will require massive compensation payouts by taxpayers? Will the Attorney-General confirm that the Acting Secretary to his department, Mr Norman Reaburn, or some other departmental officer, instructed or advised the ALRC not to proceed with its submission to the Joint Committee? If so, was that cover-up action taken in accordance with instructions or advice from the Attorney himself or anyone in his office?",35

48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor!,35
49,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-I have seen an AAP wire report, and I have also seen the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today where there is an accusation that the government has suppressed a report by the commission. Let me make it plain that the commission has prepared a draft submission. In fact, that draft submission was tendered to the Wik task force some time ago. What is",35
50,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,35
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is too much noise in the chamber. Order! The member for Dobell! Mr Tuckey interjecting,35
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor!,35
53,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say that the issue I have queried with the Australian Law Commission is not something that just to native title; it relates to the functhe tioning of the commission. I have raised questions with the commission as to whether it should be making submissions to inquiries and committees on subjects on which it has no terms of reference given by the government. Under the act that governs the commission, it can only acquire references from the Attorney-General and it can only perform functions in relation to those references. It has references on things like adversial litigation, given by my predecessor. It has a reference on the Archives Act that I gave it. We are currently considering further matters. But the commISSIon has no reference on native title. It does not have a reference, either, on copyright matters, which is another matter that I have queried with the commission. They have recently prepared a submission on a copyright matter for which they have no reference. The ALRC has done some valuable work in the past, but it does not have unlimited resources. Those resources ought to be devoted to the functions conferred on it by statute. What can be added as well is that it is not an elected government. It is, therefore, not free to roam at will over matters the subject of government policy. If it be thought that the member for Banks has a different view, let him remind him that, in May 1994, as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, he was signatory to a report reviewing the Australian Law Reform Commission after 20 years. The committee recommended that the Attorney General continue to have sole power to make references to the Law Reform Commission, and that the commission should be limited to making suggestions. It is not only the member for Banks who is involved in this; the young and the restless are, as well. The member for Melbourne was a party to the report, and the member for Werriwa was a party to the report. If you think that Mr Rose, the former Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, is going to feel overridden by queries raised by me, let me read to you the letter I wrote to Mr Rose starting the discussion between us. I said: It has been drawn to my attention that the Commission recently provided comments to the Wik Task Force on the Government's Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. This is dated 28 August. While I understand that the Commission's comments were provided in response to a generally issued invitation which accompanied all copies of the Bill, I note that the Commission's functions, set out in Part 3 of the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996, are confined to matters referred to it by the Attorney-General. In my view therefore, it would have been appropriate for the Commission to have consulted me before providing comments to the Government on a matter which is unrelated to any current Reference upon which the Commission is working. I should therefore be grateful if you would ensure that you undertake consultation with me should such occasions arise again in the future. So much for suppression.",35
54,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a supplementary question to the Attorney-General. Also, pursuant to standing orders, I require that the Attorney-General table the letter from which he was reading.",36
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We will address the second part first. Is the Attorney-General reading from notes? Mr Williams-I will table the letter.,36
56,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My supplementary question arises out of the Attorney-General's previous answer. I refer the Attorney-General to comments by Mr Rose reported on AAP today. Mr Rose said, 'There was no question about the Wik amendments falling squarely within the Australian Law Reform Commission's role.'",36
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not prepared to uphold the supplementary, so you can resume your seat. Literacy Standards",36
58,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. What further action has now been taken by the states to implement national literacy objectives? What benefits will these actions deliver to all young Australians, and particularly to young Australians in my electorate of Hindmarsh and my home state-the 'Premiership State' - of South Australia?",36
59,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question and I take this opportunity to congratulate her on the victory of the Adelaide Crows on Saturday. As I informed the House last week, one of as the major obstacles to learning to read and write for many young Australians is the lack of time in the school curriculum. The primary curriculum has become grossly overcrowded and there is a need for responsible school authorities to clear the curriculum to make room for literacy teaching and learning. The House would be aware that the Commonwealth government has taken a strong stand on this issue to ensure that all young Australians will be able to read and write at a satisfactory level by the end of 3. I am pleased to inform the House that one state government has now clearly taken up the challenge to address this vital task. Last week; the Olsen government in South Australia announced that every child in the first three years of schooling will spend between 70 and 90 minutes per day learning to read and write. The South Australian government has become the first state or territory government to mandate a specific time for literacy in the primary curriculum in the first three years of schooling. It has also announced that the overcrowded curriculum will be reviewed to make time for more literacy learning, and that parents in South Australia will be able to compare results at similar schools across the state. I congratulate the South Australian Minister of Education, Rob Lucas, on this important and far-sighted policy. South Australia is now taking crucial steps to expand reporting to parents and to expand opportunities for young people in that state to gain the basic literacy skills. This is good news for all South Australians. Also good news is the decision of the Commonwealth government to supplement recurrent funding to schools in the states and territories by 7.4 per cent for 1997-a real increase of 3.2 per cent over the CPI for the relevant period. With the Olsen government now on the front foot on literacy and with the Adelaide Crows triumphant, things are looking up in South Australia. Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",36
60,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General and follows the answer that he previously gave. Will the Attorney General confirm that, as Mr Rose adverted to this morning, the Law Reform Commission currently has formal terms of reference to review the law relating to federal civillitigation, including tribunal decision making powers, and including in tum the powers of the National Native Title Tribunal? Will he confirm that it is the case that sections 21 and 24 of the ALRC's act state that the powers of the commission include ensuring that the laws year it reviews are consistent with Australia's international obligations and ensuring that those laws do not adversely affect individual rights or access to justice? Will he also confirm that section 26 of that act states that the commission must comply if required by a parliamentary committee to give it any information about the performance of the commission's functions or the exercise of its power-? Mr Reith-How many opinions do you want, Gareth?",37
61,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These are questions of fact. Is it also the case, finally, that sections 20 and 22 of the act contain no power for the Attorney-General to direct the commission not to give evidence to a parliamentary committee? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Banks asked four questions of the minister. The member for Holt has just asked another four questions of the minister. If members have multiple questions, the Notice Paper is available and the resources of the House ought not to be expended responding to their incoherence and confusion.",37
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I understand the thrust of the point of order of the honourable member for Parramatta. Members are gently reminded that some months ago I made some pronouncements about the way questions should be framed and answered. I invite you all to revisit those comments.,37
63,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred to some of the functions of the Australian Law Reform Commission as set out in the act. What he says is correct, but what he did not highlight was that those functions are to be performed in relation to references from the Attorney General. When I queried the commission exercising whatever power it had to make submissions to various committees and inquiries, what came back to me in relation to the Native Title Act was that the commISSIOn claimed to rely upon ALRC 31. That was the only thing that was mentioned. You mayor may not remember, but that is the report on customary law. The date on which that report was delivered was 1986. World Health Organisation",37
64,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, can you inform the House of the outcomes of the World Health Organisation meeting recently held in Sydney? What were the key decisions reached by the health ministers from that western Pacific region at the meeting?",38
65,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The World Health Organisation is divided into six global regions. We are part of the western Pacific region. The western Pacific region contains 37 countries and territories and two billion of the world's population. The meeting last week in Sydney wits the first time in 50 years history of the World Health Organisation that a regional committee meeting has ever been held in Australia. It was attended by all the countries from Indo China, as well as Japan, Brunei, China, Mongolia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. We had Dr Nakajima, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation, attend for the first three days. The Regional Director, Dr Han, and the Executive Director of the UNAIDS agency, Dr Peter Piot, also attended. The outcomes are important for our region as well as for WHO. WHO, at its best, is leading the world's fight to eradicate polio, just as we eradicated small pox 20 years ago. Our region is doing particularly well. Polio is now confined to a handful of cases in the Mekong, and we expect within two years to be able to declare this part of the world completely free from polio. There is an aim to make the world free from polio by the year 2000. That might be a bit ambitious, but we hope that polio will be wiped from the face of the planet within the next five years. We are not doing so well, though, with HIV-AIDS-another important part of WHO's role. Here we received reports from countries in the region where HIV is still spreading very rapidly-most rapidly in a number of the Indo-Chinese countries. Australia and New Zealand were the only two countries in the region that are predicted to have the same case load of HIV infection and a lower case load of AIDS in three years time. The lessons that have been learnt in Australia are ones that are advocated for countries right around the region. A comprehensive approach to opposing tobacco is also another part of WHO's mandate, and a very lengthy discussion on this was part of the meeting. Australia was recognised by WHO as one of only six countries in the region that has a complete ban on tobacco advertising. We were complimented for our efforts to date. In procedural matters WHO, at its best, does a fabulous job. There are some areas where Australia is advocating reform, particularly through a special committee of the executive board, which is headed by former health minister Dr Neal Blewett. One area that was decided over the last week was a target of 50 per cent of women in all WHO positions-not just office staff but professional, scientific, technical and representative of new positions-by the year 2002. As the host country, Australia was able to provide a technical briefing for one of the afternoons, and here we showed off our expertise in telemedicine. Australia is as advanced or more advanced than any country in the world in telemedicine. Today, if a person has a road accident in Alice Springs, the neurosurgeon can look at the CT scans and decide whether or not the person should just be evacuated prior to that evacuation taking place. As every evacuation costs $25,000, it is incredibly cost effective as well as providing emergency care in a way that could not have been dreamed of a number of years ago. Most countries in the region, because of either their physical isolation or their size, were particularly interested in our expertise in telemedicine. I hope it provides very substantial commercial opportunities for Australia in the future. Debit Tax",38
66,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I ask the Treasurer: is it suggested that a tax levied on all bank withdrawals at 0.34c would entirely replace income tax? Will the Treasurer have his department make available to members of parliament a synopsis of the relative merits of the debit tax against the GST?,39
67,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This proposal has been talked about on and off for many years. It is something that does not hold much attraction, frankly. It is certainly something that has not been tried in other areas of the world. I would not commit a great deal of resources of my department to doing that but I can tell you that, if there is something that is already available, I would be quite happy to make it available to you. Home Affordability",39
68,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of recent trends in home afford ability for average income earners?,39
69,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members and their constituents will no doubt be very pleased to know that, as a result of this government's economic policy, mortgage rates have fallen to levels we have not seen in this country since the 1960s. That is due to a combination of a 2.5 per cent reduction in official interest rates and an increase in competition between banks, which have taken home mortgage interest rates down some nearly four per cent since the coalition government was elected. As a result, the customers that are borrowing from banks on the standard mortgage of Australia are paying nearly $317 less in interest than they were under the Labor Party; that is, $317 less in interest, which goes in their pockets. This has also had an effect in relation to home affordability, which is now at the best peak that it has been for some time. The Citibank REIA index shows that it increased by 1.7 per cent in the June quarter and it is the highest since 1994. The Commonwealth Bank HIA index shows the same. It is a very good time to buy a home at the moment. I would recommend it not just to low income earners but to high income earners. It is a very good time to buy a home. I must say I thought of this on Sunday morning when I saw the member for Hotham trying to defend the Labor shadow minister who probably comes out a mile in front when it comes to travel allowances in this parliament. There is one name that is talked about with awe when it comes to claiming travel allowances in this parliament: Senator Nick Sherry. In 1995, Senator Nick Sherry claimed travel allowance for 240 days. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That is an extremely long bow, even for you, Mr Speaker. Relevance, please.",39
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hope that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not casting aspersions against the chair. I do note the gradual digression that the Treasurer is indulging himself in, and I invite him to address the substance of the question.",39
71,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will, Mr Speaker. With a breathtaking travel allowance like this, the member for Hotham comes out and says, 'Nick Sherry has got such a high travel allowance because-and let me make this pointhe does not own a home.' So, apparently, because you do not own a home, you can .claim a travel allowance every night because you have got nowhere to go home to. Here we have the Bedouin of Burnie: he lives in Burnie, has got no home and claimed for 240 nights. The Leader of the Opposition, the man who cares so much about travel allowances, has all of the records of all of his frontbenchers. Whom does this happen to be? The shadow spokesman responsible for finance, for saving taxpayers' money. There is one big question hanging over the opposition today: when is the Leader of the Opposition going to show some leadership and discipline Senator Sherry? That is the big question. When is he going to say that he can stand up to his frontbenchers and introduce some discipline. When are you going to show some leadership in relation to these matters? The opposition can muckrake around. They can look around at everybody but themselves. Here we have a classic case. Senator Sherryallegedly has no home",39
72,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker, in relation to relevance. It is possible for them to get together a question that comes within the Treasurer's responsibilities that would allow him to make this rave, but, unfortunately, they picked the wrong one. He is way off on relevancy.",40
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The question addressed eligibility for housing loans and the Treasurer is using a current example.,40
74,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said before, if you cannot discipline Senator Sherry, at least suggest he buy a home. If he bought a home, the taxpayer would be much better off. In fact, if you look at Senator Sherry closely, he claims his office and his home are at the same place. The only reason he does not claim travel allowance when he is allegedly at home is because he is sleeping in his office, I suppose. Here you have the Labor Party which raised to an art form this kind of material. Here you have the Leader of the Opposition unable to do anything to the shadow finance minister, who is sitting back there. There is one person who cannot show any leadership in this parliament and he sits opposite. He masquerades as a temporary Leader of the Opposition. Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",40
75,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Did the Attorney-General have any instruction or advice from, or discussion with, the Prime Minister, his parliamentary secretary Senator Minchin or anyone in either of their offices about the Australian Law Reform Commission's position on the government's Wik legislation before action was taken to cover up the Australian Law Reform Commission's submission to the Joint Committee on Native Title or since that time?",40
76,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say at once that there is no cover up of anything. Senator Minchin is responsible for native title legislation and I am responsible for the Native Title Tribunal, the Federal Court and so on. Our offices are in regular contact on subjects relating to native title. In respect of the submissions to the Wik task force, yes, my office has had discussions with Senator Minchin's office. I do not recollect having had any myself, though. As far as the Prime Minister is concerned, I mentioned to him today that there was an article on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald and that is the first mention I have made of it to him. Mrs Crosio-Put it in your diary. Mr Lee interjecting",40
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What a ridiculous thingreally, Kim!",40
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Dobell. Mrs Crosio-Why is it ridiculous?,40
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect!,40
80,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What this is all about is doing your duty. Mrs Crosio-You forget.,40
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Prospect.,40
82,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is about doing your duty. It is my duty to ensure that the Law Reform Commission does its job. The Law Reform Commission has under Labor developed a propensity to make submissions to committees and inquiries on anything it likes. Labor did not do its job, but I am making sure that we do. The former secretary to my department was Mr Rose, who is now the President of the Law Reform Commission. He was appointed by the Keating government. He obviously resents being told to pull his horns in and do his own job and not to do somebody else's. That is what this is all about. What limits would those opposite like to put on the Law Reform Commission? The member for O'Connor suggests that they he might like to make submissions on the law reform aspects of the bushfires in Sumatra or the Middle East peace negotiations. Obviously, there are limits. I am seeking to impose the proper statutory limits. TAFE: Funding",40
83,Mrs ELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister inform the House of the agreement reached between the Commonwealth, states and territories on funding for vocational education and training? What will this mean for young people in my electorate of Forde who wish to undertake further training in TAFE courses?",41
84,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forde for her question. Members of the House will recall that the Commonwealth made a very generous offer to the states and territories to maintain funding for T AFE in real terms for five years if the states agreed to create additional places through efficiencies. I set a deadline for the acceptance or rejection of this offer at today. I am pleased now to be able to inform the House that, last Thursday, state and territory training ministers accepted the Commonwealth's offer on TAFE funding. This agreement is a major victory for all Australians. It will lead to significant efficiency gains in publicly funded TAFE system and will provide thousands of extra places in TAFE for young Australians. I know that most members of this chamber would not have been distracted by the media byplay which has taken place over recent weeks surrounding this. offer as the states sought to see whether the Commonwealth would compromise its stance on its demand that efficiencies be made. There could be no backing down by the Commonwealth on this important principle of funding growth through efficiencies. The agreement will provide stability in TAFE funding to set in place the new national apprenticeship arrangements, which are due to commence on 1 January 1998. The states, I am pleased to say, have reaffirmed their determination to press ahead with the implementation of the new apprenticeship system. This agreement that has now been achieved by the Commonwealth provides a stark contrast with the attitude of the Labor Party to these important issues. The task of making the publicly funded TAFE systems more efficient was just one more difficult issue that the Labor Party squibbed when it was in office. The one thing the Labor Party knew about was always spending more taxpayers' money. Whatever the problem was, you just threw a bit more taxpayers' money at it and that would solve the problem. It has been up to this government to insist that taxpayers' money be properly spent and spent efficiently. That is in sharp contrast to the policies which led to the massive budget deficit that this government was landed with when it came into office. The coalition government has shown that it will not stand for waste of taxpayers' dollars. We have attained the agreement of the states and territories to make their training systems more efficient, and they have agreed to provide the savings that they will achieve for the creation of extra training places for young Australians. Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",41
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed our to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, when did you become aware that the ALRC had strongly negative views about the workability of the government's Native Title Amendment Bill and the risk it posed to taxpayers of major compensation payouts? When did you or your office become aware that the ALRC proposed to put those views in a submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title? Did you or anyone in your office have discussions with the Attorney General or anyone on his staff or in his department or, more directly, with anyone in the ALRC on that proposed submission? Finally, did you or anyone in your office take any action to ensure that the ALRC would not proceed with its submission to the joint parliamentary committee?",41
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My immediate recollection is that the first I knew of this general matter was when I read the report in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. As a result of the Leader of the Opposition's question, I will check my records; I will talk to my staff; I will inform myself. If there is anything remotely additional or relevant that you ought to know or, more importantly, that the public ought to know, I will be absolutely delighted to make it available. I find it quite extraordinary-indeed, absolutely astonishing-that the Leader of the Opposition should be, in effect, advancing the proposition that the law of this country in relation to the behaviour of the Australian Law Reform Commission should not be observed. I remember when the Law Reform Commission was under the jurisdiction of attorneysgeneral in the Fraser government. It was the invariable reminder of the attorneys-general of the time that the Law Reform Commission responded to references given to it by the Attorney-General. I believe that the Attorney-General has correctly stated the position. My recollection is precisely as the Attorney-General suggested. I thank you for consuming a question on this. I will have great pleasure in checking my files and checking my office and, if there is anything that your little mind ought to know, I will let you know it. Small Business: Fair - Trading",41
87,Ms GAMBARO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, you recently advised the House that the government will respond this month to the fair trading report by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on an issue of great importance to small business in my electorate of Petrie. Will the government be honouring this further undertaking to the small business community and not put urgently needed fair trading reform in the too hard basket?",42
88,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question. We said that we would respond this month, and we are going to. The reason that we shall is that small business is important to the future of this country. For fear of failing to mention all of the members of the committee, as the member for Petrie asked this question, I thank her for her contrigot bution to the Reid committee report. This report is the result of a commitment that we gave before the last election. We said that there were problems for the small business community . We said that we would look at those problems in a professional way, which was done in that parliamentary committee. We said that, when that report came down, we would give it the priority that the small business community deserves. I can assure the honourable member and all members that we will deliver on the commitments that we have made to the small business community. We said that we would deliver on capital gains tax rollover relief, and we have. We said that we would do the right thing on the provisional uplift tax factor, and we have. We said that we would do something on unfair dismissals, and we have. We have cut the number by 50 per cent or more in the federal jurisdiction. We said that we would work on cutting red tape and we had a report to do so, and we are implementing the recommendations of that report. When you look at that record of achievement to date, what a contrast it makes to the other side. I was very interested in the remarks of the former small business minister, Mr Beddall, now a member of the opposition, who said in June this year: I say to the minister for small business that there is no greater test than how he acts on behalf of small business in relation to fair trading. He went on to say: The Hawke government ... tried to tackle these issues-without overwhelming success, and I am the first to admit that. I do not have the quote, but I gather he also said that, when it came to small business, we were only Mr 15 per cent. Tomorrow, we will announce the government's formal responseMr Martin-In this House?",42
89,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will do it in the House, as we have also said that we respect this institution and that statements such as thisbig statements of policy-should be made here. The contrast to what we have done can be seen with the Beddall committee report. Labor had 17 small business reviews when they were in office. The Beddall committee its terms of reference in March 1988. It delivered the report nearly two years later-at the end of January 1990-whereas the Reid committee took only 11 months; it delivered at twice the pace. Labor then sat on the report for 10 months, until 13 November 1990, because the cabinet could not confront the difficult issues. Then, on the most difficult issues, what did they do? They sent them off to a committee. We have a comprehensive response to all of the. matters raised by the Reid committee. In some areas we are going further than the Reid committee. For example, one of the areas where we can go further is to really give some teeth to the mechanisms of enforcement of protection for the small business community. It is one thing to have a law passed in the parliament; it is another thing to have effective means to assist small business to ensure that law protects them. For example, we will be immediately appointing two small business commissioners to the ACCC. We will also appoint a full-time small business commissioner to the ACCC at the next vacancy, and we will also be amending the Trade Practices Act to require any government in the future to appoint to the ACCC persons with experience in small business matters. This is perhaps a longer answer than the Leader of the House should give, but let me conclude by saying that when I got the small business job, when the Prime Minister rang and asked me to take it, I said I would look forward to doing so. I want to say to the members of the committee that when I first read that report-it was a few days after I had accepted the job-I said to myself, 'Gee, I think the government has raised expectations pretty high here and we have bitten off perhaps a bit more than we can chew.' I want to say that at the end of the process, after all the tremendous consultations we, as a group, have had together with the small business community, we raised expectations and tomorrow we are going to fulfil them. Travelling Allowance: Former Minister for Transport and Regional Development",42
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Equal time for the Peters, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. Precisely when and how did you become aware of the false travel allowance claims of the former minister for transport? canvassed. When you received what your former senior political adviser, Mr Morris, described as 'this eyebrow raising information', exactly what steps did you take to fully appraise yourself about it? Exactly who did you call about these matters upon your return from the Cook Islands?",43
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have already canvassed these matters at some length both here and elsewhere, but can I take the opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition's question affords me to table a few documents. I table, first of all, a statement by Mr John Sutherland, dated 25 September 1997; a letter dated 26 September 1997 addressed to me by my former chief of staff, Grahame Morris; two documents, both dated 25 September, from Miss Fiona MCKenna; two letters of termination, one to Mr Morris and one to Miss MCKenna, from myself, dated 26 September; a minute of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet dated 26 September, signed by Miss Philomena Bisshop, and also another minute signed by her. The first minute is addressed to Mr Blick, the deputy secretary to the department; the other is addressed to the secretary to the department. Those two minutes bear upon the matter that I referred to at the beginning of my press conference on Friday. Can I simply add that, as recounted to the House last week, the first general reference to this matter I received from Mr Morris was in circumstances which both he and I have confirmed. I had a subsequent discussion with Mr Sharp on Monday. As a result of that, I requested certain information. When that information was received, because of its deficiencies I requested further information, and that ran into the discussions I then had with Mr Sharp and Mr Jull and also the secretary and, I think, one other senior officer of the department. As to all of the other telephone conversations and so forth that I may have had, I would have to-as anybody would expect in a situation like this-carefully check the recollection. But that is the main chain of events and it has already been properly I should add that, of course, the events of last week were difficult ones for the government. But two things come very clearly out of last week: firstly, you now have a government in this country that upholds standards. Second, you no longer have senior ministers who receive legal advice to refer matters to the Federal Police and engage in a cover-up with their colleagues in relation to those matters. This Leader of the Opposition, who carries on with this sort of supreme display of moral unction, is the man who conspired with his deputy in a police cover-up 13 years ago. You are the person who ignored the advice. It ought to condemn your credibility forever in Australian public life when, in a letter stamped 'In Confidence': . .. Miss Lance recently discussed with you concerns the department had about claims for payment. . . You had asked that we seek infonnal advice from the Attorney-General's Department. Mr Brazil and the Acting Crown Solicitor are of the view that if a further step is to be taken, it be investigated and this would be a matter for the Australian Federal Police. . . You were advised by the Crown Solicitor and the acting head of the Attorney-General's Department that this matter should go off to the Federal Police, and to save your rotten political hide you and your now deputy put your heads together and you decided that you would suppress it. You can plead that that was 13 years ago. If this had come out 13 years ago, we would have been saved many of the difficulties in relation to travel matters. You know that and you made that mistake. But it was worse than a mistake; it was a deliberate attempt to pervert the course of justice. So the first thing that comes very clearly out of last week was that we now have a government, no matter what the pain involved, that will uphold standards of probity. That is the first thing that comes out. The second thing that comes out very clearly from last week is that I knew nothing of the matters relating to Mr Sharp or Mr Jull until a little over a week ago in the circumstances that have been described by both Mr Morris and myself.",43
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my supplementary question is: if the Prime Minister is so confident about those letters he has tabled and the assertions he has made, will he now order a judicial inquiry into your cover-up?",44
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is out of order. Defence Service Homes,44
94,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer the minister to his announcement at the National RSL Congress in Adelaide earlier this month that interest rates on veterans' concessional home loan rates would soon fall to at least 1Y2 percentage points below the market rate. I ask the minister: how many veterans will benefit from this cut? How will defence services home loan borrowers in my electorate of Cowper be able to benefit from the new lower rate when it takes effect?,44
95,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member should for Cowper for his question. Not only has he got a great interest in the Pacific Highway but he has a great interest in the veterans of his community. So highly regarded is the member for Cowper by the veteran community in his electorate that he is also patron of the Vietnam Veterans Association in Coffs Harbour. As I announced at the national conference of the RSL, defence service home loan rates currently at 6.85 per cent are set to fall to 5.63 percentage points. That is a direct result of this government's good economic policy. It is a problem that that side of the House would never have had. If they say that they would have had it they would say that they might have done something about it in years to come. What the member for Cowper should tell his constituents is that we will be guaranteeing, as a genuine compensation measure to those with defence service home loans, that those defence service home loans will always have a minimum of 1Y2 percentage points compensation in those interest rates. The member for Cowper should also tell the veterans in his electorate, as should all members of this House, that those who have taken out an additional loan at the rate of 10 percentage points will have that additional loan rolled into this new loan. Labor had those additional loans at 10 per cent. Under the coalition, those additional loans will be rolled into the new rate likely to be 5.63 per cent. The member for Cowper should also know and confirm to his constituents that existing home loan borrowers will not have to pay any additional fees as a result of this new measure. He should also tell his constituents that 50,000 veterans with defence service home loans are set to benefit from this measure. It is anticipated that they will benefit to the tune of about $20 per month as a result of this measure. The member for Cowper should also advise his constituents that they should never vote Labor because this is a problem that Labor would never have had. He should also tell his constituents that the young and the restless down there would like to introduce death duties. Not only would his constituents be exposed to higher interest rates under a Labor government but when they had passed on death duties would be paid out of their estate on what they would pass on to their next generation. Travelling Allowance",44
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, why did you say last Friday that it was open to the Auditor-General to interview any member of your staff regarding the Sutherland letter? Is it not a fact that the Auditor-General has no such powers and has advised you that to attempt to proceed as you told the parliament would compromise his position? Prime Minister, will you hold a judicial inquiry with powers of compulsion to investigate properly all matters related to this sorry cover-up and will you submit yourself to cross-examination as former Prime Minister Hawke did in the Ivanoff royal commission?",45
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My answer in relation to the judicial inquiry is no. I would remind the parliament that no allegation with any skerrick of credibility or respectability has been made against me-none whatsoever. Mr Crean-What about the cover-up?,45
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You could not even quite summon the guts on television yesterday yourself to say it. So that is how unconvinced you lot are. As this debate proceeds further, I might remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the Miles Kupa defence, as it has become well known in the trade. That rests on a proposition that was advanced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Hawke government. On 26 May 1992 after he, so he claimed, inadvertently misled the Senate about the Marshall Islands affair-I think the House ought to listen very carefully to this in view of the cant and humbug we have had from the Australian Labor Party on this issue-he said: Obviously, my answer on 7 May would have been different-it certainly should have been different-if I had been aware of any of that material and any of the contact with my office that that file note implies. But I was not aware of it. Listen to this: My senior adviser has only the barest recollection of the conversation in question . . . He has no recollection whatsoever of seeing any of the faxed documents. My office has no record of those faxes, and a thorough search has failed to tum them up. I was not advised of the conversation, let alone saw any of the documents that might have been sent following it. In other words, what the minister was doing was drawing a distinction between the knowledge of one of his senior advisers and his own personal knowledge in relation to this matter. Judicial inquiries are held when serious credible allegations are made against public figures. None has been made on this occasion. Not even the Leader of the Opposition himself can summon the courage to quite level the charge because he knows deep down that the charge is false and baseless, as do the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. Defence Industry Contracts",45
99,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Can the minister inform the House how advanced are plans to announce a new strategic defence policy for industry? Does this government support Australian companies competing for defence industry contracts?",45
100,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do thank the member for Boothby for his question. Coming from South Australia, he comes from a state where we have in John Olsen a Premier who underthat stands very well how important defence industry is to that state. Indeed, defence industry in South Australia is worth three per cent of the state domestic product, which, of course, is the same as the wine industry. So you have a very .sound basis and a good government in South Australia which looks after defence industry and particularly pays attention to small and medium enterprises which are Australian enterprises. When I came to this job of defence industry I found that Australia did not have a sustainspirit, able defence industry. I found that what we had inherited from the Labor Party they had invested $11.5 billion of taxpayers' money in building submarines and ships, none of which we can export because we do not own the intellectual property. I found that had built surface ships which cannot defend themselves, and so we are faced with the task of fixing that up. I found that we had a project, JORN, to build an over-the-horizon network where the last government had overseen 80 per cent of the money being paid to Telstra for 20 per cent of the work. We saw nothing but incompetence. I define a sustainable defence industry prised of firms which can afford to miss government contract and still stay in business. We have been very busy laying down principles which foreign firms must comply with to do business here in Australia. The sixth of those principles is that we require them to nurture Australian small and medium enterprises so they are not squeezed out by vertically integrated foreign firms. In addition, and further to the member for Boothby, I have recently appointed a steering committee to work with me and to me to bring out a new strategic defence industry policy in March. The people who sit on that steering committee are VCDF; Vice Admiral Barrie; Mr Gary Jones, deputy secretary of acquisition; and Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, an it up? industry representative, a former director of ADI and, indeed, a good South Australian. I say to you, Mr Speaker, that that lot there had 13 years and produced nothing. They spent money in a way that is not susthe tainable and have the audacity to try to this government has been slow to put in place an industry policy after 18 months. We have done more. We did it because the Prime Minister understands well that defence industry is a vital part of regional and rural Australia which provides jobs and provides work. As one who attended the grand final of the ARL yesterday and who was disappointed to see Manly lose, I have to say that I congratulate Newcastle. Newcastle depends on its greatest employer: the defence industry. I congratulate it on having a resurrection in its because that lot over there certainly did nothing to assist defence industry. It is this was that government which has. Travelling Allowance",45
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a further question we to the Prime Minister. It arises out of a document that he just tabled, signed by Philomena Bisshop of the government section, dated 26 September 1997. Prime Minister, are you aware of this exchange: PB: Were there any government members who were paid incorrectly? CH: A couple/few, but it was decided not to include them. as one comPB: Whose idea was that? a CH: Over the lake (Carolyn's expression for her minister's office). some PB: The Minister, or his staff? CH: The Minister. [This is not as clear a recollection as the rest of the conversation.} PB: Does the Prime Minister's office know? CH: I believe there have been discussions. Prime Minister, is it not a fact that the Auditor-General's inquiry into these matters could not handle this particular document and that exchange? In the absence of the Auditor General being able to handle it, what inquiry process do you intend to put in place to clean",46
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In case the Leader of the Opposition thinks he has lighted upon some over sort of new, devastating debating point on this, can I remind him that it was precisely knowledge of that, brought to my attensay tion for the first time on Friday morning, which led me to take the action that I did in relation to my former chief of staff and still my close friend, Grahame Morris. I would have thought that the circumstances of the matter are simply that, given that additional information and given the decision that I have taken in relation to Mr Morris and Ms MCKenna, and I will go back to this again and again: where is the credible allegation requiring the establishment of a judicial inquiry? You cantalk about wagons, you can lack the moral courage to actually make an accusation, you can demonstrate deplorable double standards, you can have been a member of a government that covered up and engaged in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, but, when it comes to the crunch, you perverted the course of justice, and you know that.",46
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point or order. Government members-Sit down!",47
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right.,47
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The substance of my question was: is it not a fact that the Auditor-General cannot investigate that interchange, that interchange which is central to this whole issue, and when is the Prime Minister going to stop covering up and put in place an inquiry that will?",47
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,47
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nothing can relieve the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition from the obligation of pointing to the credible that. allegation. What you have had is an allegation made by the former private secretary to the former Minister for Administrative Services alleging in a very sketchy way that there were discussions. You have had a comprehensive response from the two staff members. You have had, because there was some element of doubt in my mind, action taken by me in relation to those two staff members, action that some people regarded as excessive but action that I regarded as essential given all the circumstances of the matter. Contrast that action and also the action I took, regrettably, in relation to the three ministers last week with the way in which the Leader of the Opposition and his now deputy conspired to pervert the course of justice. They do not like that allegation being made and they know, as well as everyone who sits behind them knows, that, if that information had leaked out 13 or 14 years ago, his ministerial career in the Hawke government would have been immediately aborted.",47
108,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, which goes to relevance. The relevance is this: this is yet another facade put up to protect himself.",47
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,47
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question was absolutely clear-cut.,47
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,47
112,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,When are you going to put in place an inquiry that can deal with it?,47
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Leader of the Opposition!,47
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me correct the Leader of the Opposition. There is no facade about ignoring the advice of the head of the Attorney-General's Department and the crown solicitor. That is not a facade; that is crookery in my language. That is perverting the course of justice. That is what you have been responsible for. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: where is the credible allegation against me? There is none. I did not knows. The Australian public know that and the overwhelming majority of fair-minded commentators know Hunter Region: Victory of Newcastle Knights,47
115,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in light of the outstanding 22-16 victory of the Newcastle Knights over Manly, could you outline what effect this victory will have on the confidence of the people in the Hunter, in particular a confidence that was shattered by the previous Labor government when unemployment hit 17 per cent?",47
116,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicate, on indulgence, that I thought the expression on the face of the victorious captain, Paul Harragon, said it all. I also think that the remarks he had to make both at the presentation ceremony and also when he returned to Newcastle was a reminder of the enormous psychological boost of this particular victory on the Hunter Valley. I am sure that, right across the political divide in this parliament, there is great delight at the impact psychologically of that victory. There is also a reminder that, despite the difficulties through which Newcastle and the Hunter Valley have passed in recent monthsand they are undoubted-there are many things on the bright side that one can look at. For example, a decision was taken by my government only a few weeks ago to commit some $15 million out of the special infrastructure grants program to assist in the construction of the Redbank power station. That particular project will not only be of great importance to industry in the Hunter Valley but also be of considerable psychological value and considerable employment value. There was the decision which I announced when I visited the north of England in June this year regarding the construction of the Hawk lead-in fighter at the Williamtown base. There are other projects that are getting towards the stage of favourable consideration. I want to say on this side of the House that the efforts of the member for Paterson, who asked me this question, have been absolutely prodigious. Mr Martin-Prodigious?",47
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prodigious in pursuing the interests of the people of Newcastle, might I say to the honourable member who once occupied your chair, Mr Speaker. Well do I remember those days. Indeed, we had some memorable exchanges. Mr Martin-You used to tell me I was good!",48
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With good reason, I might say. But can I say that it is very important in areas that have suffered difficulties in relation to unemployment and the closing down of industry that people look on the bright side. I must say that the overwhelming impression I received when I visited the Hunter Valley not only from community leaders but from trade union and business leaders was a determination to look to the future, a determination to put the difficulties of the past behind them and a determination to embrace the opportunities that the future offered. I think that is very commendable. What is great about their win yesterday is that it gives all of the district a great sense of self-belief and a great sense of self-achievement. It is a marvellous tonic for the people of the Hunter and I think all Australians are absolutely delighted to note that fact. Travelling Allowance",48
119,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister asks this House what remains to be explained about his behaviour and his knowledge in the Sharp-lull matter. Let me ask him: does he recall the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business saying last Friday on ABC radio: ... it would be bizarre to suggest that Grahame Morris would be told and that he wouldn't then tell the Prime Minister. Does he recall also hearing his minister for workplace relations saying on the Channel 7 morning program: I mean, if Grahame Morris knew, I've got no doubt he would have told the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: given the mounting body of evidence, including that tabled today, that Mr Morris did in fact know about the Sharp-lull matter, despite his denial, how can the Prime Minister credibly suggest that there is nothing now to be explained on oath by the players in this particular series of events?",48
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that a fairly credible person about what Mr Morris knew and what Mr Morris told, or did not tell, other people would have been Mr Morris himself. Mr Crean-Why did you sack him?",48

124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that Grahame Morris was a fairly credible bloke as far as what Grahame Morris knew. You have in front of you a very clear refutation. As I think the Leader of the Opposition read from one of the documents that was tabled, let me read from one of the documents that was tabled. I think it is worth doing so as it is the first time that many people in the parliament have actually seen this document. This is what he had to say: I have been made aware of a note from John Sutherland from Mr Jull's office that suggests he has a 'sketchy memory'They are not Grahame Morris's words; they are Mr Sutherland's words. May I say in relation to Mr Morris that he did not seek in the interview that he gave yesterday to attack Mr Sutherland. He merely sought to deal with the facts of the matter. This is very important. Mr Morris said: I have been made aware of a note from John Sutherland from Mr Jull's office that suggests he has a 'sketchy memory' of having sought my advice the day prior to the tabling in Parliament in May of matters relating to Mr Sharp. I have absolutely no recollection of anything remotely resembling such a discussion. I repeat what he said: I have absolutely no recollection of anything remotely resembling such a discussion. He continued: Any information to me about a Minister amending a third of his travel claims would obviously have attracted my immediate attention. I remember vividly a discussion by telephone on this matter with John Sutherland while I was in the Cook Islands at the end of last week. Because you were at the Pacific Forum Retreat, the first chance I had to raise this matter with you on the plane home on Saturday. I repeat, I have absolutely no memory of John Sutherland raising this matter with me in May. It is not something I would forget. That is what Grahame Morris had to say, and you have heard my own categorical denials of it. Even the member for Hotham, who normally is capable of going over the top of anything when it comes to a wild accusation, could not say that I had lied when he appeared on the Meet the Press program yesterday and was asked this question by Michelle Grattan: So what you're saying is that John Howard has blatantly lied to the Parliament? That's what you're saying, isn't it? His answer was: Well, that's your interpretation. Government members-Ha, hal",49
125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It gets even better. He continued: I'm not prepared to be as tough as that, Michelle, but that's why we sayan independentHe is not prepared to be as tough as that. Make up your mind. You either do not believe me or you do. The great majority of the Australian publicMr Crean-You make up your mind!",49
126,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All you can do is hold up a facsimile of a photograph. That is no statement of belief.,49
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hotham!,49
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact of the matter is that you yourselves know deep down that this whole thing is a beat-up. You know that. Can I finally say that we have a Leader of the Opposition and a principal spokesman on this matter neither of whom believe that I was informed of these matters before I have repeatedly stated to the parliament that I was. In those circumstances-particularly because it is coming from people who engaged in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and coming from people who conspired to ignore the advice of the Crown Solicitor and the head of the Attorney-General's Department-when it comes to calling for judicial was inquiries, neither of those gentlemen has any credibility at all. South-East Asia: Air Pollution",49
129,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Trade and the Acting Foreign Minister. What is the government doing to help Australians in areas affected by air pollution in the South-East Asian region caused by the Indonesian forest fires?,49
130,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The business of government goes on and it has not been deflected by activities here this afternoon. The government is closely monitoring the situation in Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia and has issued travel advices alerting Australians to the detrimental effects to health which may be caused by the severe smog in the region. Australians considering travelling to the worse affected region, Sarawak, have been advised to defer non-essential travel until air quality improves. I emphasise that that is official travel advising from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We are closely monitoring the situation of those Australians already in Sarawak but have been advised that the airport in Kuching has re-opened and that seats are available on flights out of the area. In recognition of the difficulties being experienced by DFAT and Austrade officers, their dependants and others in Kuala Lumpur, special leave fares are being made available to enable respite from the situation on a voluntary basis. Australian High Commission staff and families are being offered the opportunity to take special leave away from affected areas to obtain some relief. Australian residents in areas of Malaysia affected by air pollution should also consider seeking relief from current conditions-so severe is the smog-and getting away from it for a period of time. I might add that the. CSIRO has been consulted in relation to the haze problem in Malaysia to see what additional steps might be taken. In respect of Indonesia, we await an official request, which would be duly considered. This matter will involve further dialogue between Australia and Indonesia, Australia and Malaysia and Australia and Brunei. I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. He has the interests of Australians and exporters at heart. He organised a very good seminar in relation to exporters which I attended in his electorate not so long ago. The Australian government remains very concerned about this huge smog storm which has now settled over a large part of South East Asia. We have taken a number of specific steps. We stand ready to take more.",50
131,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Mr Crean-Oh, ha, hal",50
132,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you wasted 10 questions on an irrelevancy . You have only yourselves to blame. NA Broadcast of Adjournment Debate",50
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Last Thursday, the right honourable member for New England raised a query concerning the broadcast of the adjournment debate. For the information of members, I should clarify the position. It is true that for many years the adjournment debate was not broadcast, but this was changed in 1994 and since then the adjournment debate has been included in the broadcast. The application of privilege in respect of the broadcast of the adjournment debate is now the same as for other proceedings. Answers to Questions",50
134,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, understanding order 150, could you write to the appropriate ministers in respect of questions 1,939, 1,944, 1,949, 1,951 and 1,958, first placed on the Notice Paper by me on 24 June?",50
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will be happy to write to the appropriate ministers. Relevance of Answers,50
136,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, the second question I have to you arises out of your comment today in question time, when you said that members should refresh themselves of your statement of 26 May in respect of questions without notice and relevance. At that time, you said that you proposed to apply a much firmer test to matters, you wanted answers to be relevant and you did not want ministers to unduly digress. On 4 September and again last week, you said that ministers were able to supplement or embellish on the answers given. I wonder if you might be able to elucidate for me and the House how your notion of 'not unduly digressing' rests with your notion of 'embellishment'.",50
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will take the question on notice and advise you further of the outcome. Travelling Allowance,51
138,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, has your attention been drawn to media reports stating that approximately 140 members of parliament are under investigation by accounting firm KPMG in respect of travelling allowance claims? Is it a fact that the audit is being undertaken at the instruction of yourself and the President of the Senate and not on behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services? Finally, can you inform the House whether this confidential information was provided by your department, your office or Madam President's office or by KPMG, and on what basis was this authorised?",51
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The Canberra Times today reports that 140 members of parliament were sent 'please explain' notes about their travelling allowance records by accountancy company KPMG after an audit of travelling allowance claims. In May this year, the Department of the House of Representatives commissioned its internal auditor, KPMG, to undertake an audit of members' travelling allowance payments made in 1995-96 and 1996-97. A similar audit is being undertaken in relation to senators. The timing of the audit means that it extends to members of this parliament and to former members of the 37th Parliament. I make no comment on the accuracy of the article. The matter is in the hands of the auditor, and I am at arm's length in that process. As to the letter sent to members in respect of 1995-96, I am advised that the majority of TA claims have been successfully reconciled. The letters signify only that additional information has been sought to reconcile these claims. I might add that, as I understand it, about three per cent of the claims that have been submitted are under query and, in the light of the resolution of those queries thus far, I would expect to see a very substantial decline in the total proportion of those that remain unreconcilable in the very near term. I am unaware of what actions the President or her officers may have taken. In respect of my own staff, there has been no release of information to the media, nor is there any intention to release that information to the media in the short term. Travelling Allowance",51
140,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, thank you very much for that very comprehensive review. We are all quite relieved to hear your comments there. In respect of how this information did find its way into the public domain, I wonder whether or not the auditors may have had responsibility for that and whether some inquiries might be made and you could report back to the House.",51
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"We will certainly make some formal inquiries, but I do not have any problem with individual members taking up this situation with the auditors themselves. This is an area of concern to me but, as I say, I am at arm's length of the process. The release, either formally or informally, of this information by KPMG to the media is something totally out of my control. Cameras: Use in Chamber",51
142,Mr MAREK,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, as you are aware, Mr and Mrs Joe Worker-the publicare not permitted to bring cameras into this place. You will be aware that in recent weeks more of the media-and possibly others-are being permitted into the chamber to take photographs. Will you please look into this to see if it is considered acceptable, if it has always been a past practice. Thank you very much.",51
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Capricornia. There has been a quite definitive relaxation of the rules pertaining to photography within the chamber. It is monitored by my department very carefully, and at the moment I have no cause for any apprehension about the way in which photography is being pursued within the chamber. NA Mr GARETH EV ANS (Holt-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (3.26 p.m.)- Mr Speaker, I seek leave make a personal explanation.",51
144,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,52
145,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do indeed.,52
146,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,52
147,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I claim to have been misrepresented by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other ministers on a number of occasions, including in question time today, in relation to their suggestion that I was involved with the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in a police conspiracy or 'police cover-up conspiracy' as it was described. I will very briefly retail the facts of this matter for the record once again. First, the police themselves did not at any stage seek to investigate that matter. What did happen was that the two senior members of my department, the departmental head, Mr Brazil and the Acting Crown Solicitor, Mr Sherman, in discussion with the senior officers of the Department of the Special Minister of State, did suggest that a reference to the police might be an appropriate course to follow. When that view was retailed to me and the matter was brought to my attention by Minister Beazley, as he then was, my reaction was that a police investigation at that stage would be premature-and I used the expression 'at this stage'-given that there had not been a full departmental investigation. When the results of that investigation came to hand and it became a matter then of deciding, in the light of that investigation and the conclusion of the matter by the senator in question repaying the amount, I took the view-and I make no apology for it in the circumstances of the time-that, for a variety of reasons, including the past practice of the Fraser-Howard government in similar matters and the fact that the public purse had not been prejudiced in this matter and the fact that there had been vigorous denial and the fact that there had been a whack over the wrists of the man in question",52
148,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,We do not want to debate the issue. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made his point clear.,52
149,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This goes to the question of conspiracy. For these reasons, I decided-and communicated with Mr Beazley-that it was not appropriate to pursue the matter further. I finally make the point that Mr Brazil, the head of my department, and Mr Sherman, the Acting Crown Solicitor, in a recorded minuteMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not entitled to make points. He is entitled to rebut any allegations made. He is not entitled to debate. He was involved in a cover-up, and no personal explanation is going to save him.",52
150,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am listening very carefully. The issue has not been debated, but I implore the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to come to a very quick conclusion.",52
151,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"One final sentence, to conclude this matter once and for all: for the record, in an aide-memoire dated 18 September 1983, Pat Brazil wrote, following a meeting with me and Mr Sherman, that, 'The Attorney-General indicated in these circumstances no further action was being contemplated at this stage. Both Mr Sherman and I indicated we thought that this was an appropriate course to follow.' Thank you very much. Mr Reith-I rise on a point of order. Can we have the documents the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was reading from tabled?",52
152,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition reading from notes?,52
153,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I make the point that the document of 18 September is not one,52
154,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Are you reading from notes?,52
155,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I am reading from notes.,52
156,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Are they confidential?,52
157,Mr GARETH EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, they are confidential. But I take the occasion to point out that, if you would like to make available that document of 18 September-in its original form- Mr Beazley and I would be absolutely delighted to receive it. You have not done that. All we have are reports of it.",52
158,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was reading from confidential notes and they are not to be tabled. NA,53
159,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain pensioners, superannuants and retirees points out to the House that Government funding for the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation's national secretariat will cease on 30 September 1997. The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and with older Australians. by Mr Andren (from 72 citizens), Mr Andrew (from 44 citizens), Mr Bevis (from 52 citizens), Mr Brereton (from 33 citizens), Mr Charles (from 82 citizens), Mr Martyn Evans (from 26 citizens), Mr Hardgrave (from 27 citizens), Mr Hawker (from 23 citizens), Ms Jeanes (from 16 citizens), Mr Kerr (from nine citizens), Dr Lawrence (from 63 citizens), Ms Macklin (from 714 citizens), Mr Miles (from 36 citizens),  Mr Mutch (from 11 citizens), Mr Nehl (from 20 citizens), Mr O'Connor (from 23 citizens), Mr Quick (from 44 citizens), Mr Reid (from 18 citizens), Mr Bruce Scott (from 213 citizens), Mr Somlyay (from 24 citizens), Mr Kelvin Thomson (from eight citizens) and Mr Truss (from 18 citizens). Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of Sydney draws to the attention of the House that: The Federal Government has cut funding to the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. We petition for an immediate restoration of funding in view of the essential service the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation provides in giving information and assistance to senior citizens in respect to issues affecting financial security and quality of life. by Mr MCClelland (from 30 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. The petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland calls to the attention of the house the Howard Government's proposed changes to nursing homes and aged care, which includes charging an entry fee or bond for entry into nursing homes. The Government's proposals are unfair and will discriminate against the most vulnerable, frail and sick members of our community. We request the House to calion the Howard Government to abandon their plans and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes. by Mr Bevis (from 175 citizens), Mr MCClelland (from 15 citizens) and  Family Day Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House our concern regarding the proposed changes to the administration of Childcare Assistance for Family Day Care Schemes. The fact that these changes are for one year only will: have major cost implications for all taxpayers; negatively impinge on the flexible child care arrangements required by the majority of parents using Family Day Care Your petitioners therefore ask the House to retain the current system of Childcare Assistance administration in Family Day Care until the proposed changes for I January 1999 are introduced and to ensure the continued existence of Family Day Care Co-ordination Units. by Mr Adams (from 1,159 citizens) and Mr Quick (from 329 citizens). Navy: Service Recognition To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas: 1. RAN. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and RA.A.F. casualties; 2. RAN. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; 3. RAN. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is. Members of the Army and RAAF. who served during the same period in Malaya had their - ervice fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya. In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.AN. service was 'operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points. Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise RAN. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from 'age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to 'service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. by Mr Hawker (from eight citizens) and Mr Kelvin Thomson (from eight citizens). Badgerys Creek Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives as assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that a major no-curfew international airport at Badgery's Creek, New South Wales, will: 1. impact adversely on the environmental, heritage and recreational values of the Blue Mountains National Park, the Blue Mountains Community and the Tourism Industry due to the movements of aircraft and vehicles causing noise pollution and air pollution, including acid rain; 2. impact adversely on Sydney's water supply by the effects of airborne particulates from fuel emissions, aircrashes and the dumping of fuel over the catchment area. Your petitioners therefore request the House not to pass any Bill which would lead to the construction of an airport at Badgery's Creek, New South Wales and to seek a site outside the Sydney air space. by Mr Bartlett (from 5,504 citizens). Timed Local Calls A Petition to the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. This petition of certain residents in the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House the harsh and regressive decision by the Howard Government to allow telecommunications carriers to charge timed local calls for data communication services such as electronic mail, facsimile, the internet and other on-line services. This measure will adversely effect business and individual users of the above services, and particularly hamper the operations and growth of small business. Your petitioners calIon the House to request that the Howard Government rescind their decision, and ensure local data communication services are charged on an untimed basis. by Mr Bevis (from 167 citizens). Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their extreme concern at the proposal to charge entry fees for people needing nursing home care. Furthermore, the petitioners are extremely concerned that the charging of up front entry fees will force people to sell their homes in order to gain a nursing home bed. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of .Representatives act to ensure that access to nursing home care is available on the basis of need and further that the family home is exempt from any asset test used to determine eligibility for such care. by Mr Brereton (from 179 citizens). Drugs Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of concerned Veterans points out to the House that we object to the proposed introduction of the increase of the ""Therapeutic Group Premium"" (""Drugs Tax""). Our petitioners therefore request the House to reconsider the cuts to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The proposed increases will severely impact on our health standards, impose further financial burdens and are not included in the safety net. by Mr Crean (from 321 citizens). Mobile Phone Towers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain electors of the Division of Hindmarsh draws to the attention of the House the actions of the Vodafone telecommunications company in regard to the erection of a 33 metre high triple head mobile phone tower in Fulham Gardens. We are concerned that this tower poses a health risk to local residents, as it is built upon an electricity power station, and is only 18 metres from the nearest home. We are also concerned because this tower will devalue surrounding land, and is an eyesore at a major intersection. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take steps to relocate the tower where it does not impact economically or socially on households, especially households with children. by Mrs Gallus (from 1,838 citizens). Whittlesea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Victoria requests the House to calIon the government to restore funding to the Whittlesea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre. by Mr Jenkins (from 86 citizens). Logging and Woodchipping To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives'in Parliament assembled. For permanent protection of old-growth forests and all other areas of high conservation value, and for the implementation of tree plantation strategies. This petition from the undersigned respectfully points out that: there is an increasing and urgent demand from the people, to protect all remaining high conservation value forests which support flora and fauna unique to Australia, thus complying with the United Nations Biodiversity Convention to which Australia is a signatory. We have a responsibility to future and present generations, and the necessary reasons, knowledge and technology to act now on the following achievable solutions. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives legislate to: Immediately stop all logging and woodchipping activities in high conservation value native forests; ensure intergenerational equity by planning for the rights of future generations, and protecting in perpetuity all biologically diverse old-growth forests, wilderness, rainforests and critical habitats of endangered species; facilitate rapid transition of the timber industry from harvesting high conservation value native forests to establishing mixed-species farm forestry on existing cleared and degraded lands, using non-toxic methods to protect ecological sustainability; maximise use of readily-available plantation timber for industry needs, using appropriate forestry techniques and progressive minimalwaste processing methods, such as radial sawing, and wherever possible, reuse and recycle wood and paper products; support incentives for nationwide employment in composting, soil remineralisation programs, and the planting of trees and annual fibre crops, inter-grown with appropriate fruit and nut trees and medicinal plants; encourage sensitively-managed, environmental education tourism in appropriate forest areas, with full respect for natural ecosystems, Aboriginal cultural heritage, sacred sites and other sites of significance; and progressively utilise technological expertise and resources transferred from the military sector, to help implement these tree planting solutions; and to motivate the international community to follow this example. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Lawrence (from 648 citizens). Australian Service Medal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Coalition Government has broken one of its main promises to the veteran community of Australia, that was, to provide thousands of veterans with a special Australian Service Medal in recognition of service to Australia's defence between 1945 and 1975. Your petitioners therefore request the House honours John Howard's pre-election promise so that veterans can be granted the recognition they deserve. by Ms Macklin (from 121 citizens). Higher Education Contribution Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the House that proposed changes to the Higher Education Contribution Schemes (HECS) by the Howard Government are likely to prove a major disincentive to young people's participation in higher education. The increased charges will burden young people with large debts. Repayments will begin as soon as a graduate has earnings of $20,701. This is almost $8,000 below average weekly earnings, and will almost certainly result in hardship for many young people. The lower threshold and faster rates of repayment breaks the Howard Government's pre-election promise not to make changes to HECS once a person has begun study. The magnitude of the proposed cuts to higher education will also result in fewer places available for students. Your petitioners therefore request that the House reject the proposed changes by the Howard Government and take into serious consideration the issue that education should be available to all Australians and not just an elite few. by Ms Macklin (from 86 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the certain students and residents of South Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. In the 1996/97 Budget the Coalition Government cut $150 million from the Children's Services Program. 2. These cuts included the abolition' of operational subsidies for community-based long day care centres, restrictions on the numbers of hours for which Child Care Assistance is payable and the means testing of Childcare Cash Rebate. 3. All Child Care Centres across Australia are faced with increasing fees to keep centres open, forcing parents to pay more for child care. 4.The program will not be sustainable for families or providers if any further cuts are made. Your petitioners request that the House: 1. Exert pressure on Members of the Coalition to reverse any budget decisions which will result in further reducing the Federal Government's role in funding and protecting Australia's quality child care system. 2. Ensure that all families continue to have access to affordable, quality and accessible child care. 3. As a minimum maintain the Children's Services Program at $1 Billion. by Ms Macklin (from 60 citizens). Medicare Office: Rockdale To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of the electorate of Barton calls to the attention of the House that the proposed closure of Rockdale Medicare will cause hardship to many families and significantly affect local commerce. Your petitioners therefore request that the House abandon such proposals and allow Rockdale Medicare to remain open. by Mr MCClelland (from 294 citizens). Nursing Care To the Honourable Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We the undersigned residents of the South East of South Australia note that there is insufficient accommodation in the South East of South Australia for post-operative recovery patients, and for elderly and incapacitated patients, some of whom have to be sent away from their homes towns for Child Care nursing care. Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will call upon the Government to ensure that sufficient licensed accommodation is made available to meet this steadily increasing need. And your petitioners in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MCLachlan (from 1,149 citizens). Tasmania: Pulp and Paper To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the State of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House the importance of the forest industry and the production of forest products on the North West Coast of Tasmania. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: 1. Recognise the vital importance of the pulp and paper industry to the residents of the north-West Coast of Tasmania. 2. Be aware of the crisis facing the industry due to the dumping of paper from overseas countries. 3. Take any action possible to prevent the entry into Australia of dumped paper from overseas countries. 4. Note the importance of jobs in regional Australia, especially those areas with high prevailCard ing levels of unemployment. by Mr Miles (from 26 citizens). Medicare Office: Belmont To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain electors of the DiVision of Shortland draws to the attention of the House that residents of the East Lake Macquarie area would suffer serious difficulty and inconvenience if the Belmont Medicare office is closed. Your petitioners request the House to require government to ensure that Belmont Medicare office remains open.  Customs Act: CDs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of New South Wales calls for the street enforcement of Commonwealth Regulations under the Customs Act, which prohibits the importation of CDs that 'depict, express or are otherwise concerned with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent ena in a manner that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult person to the extent that it should not be imported', as the undersigned believe such CDs are undermining the well-being of the children and families in Australia. Your petitioners pray that the House firmly support the enforcement of the Commonwealth Regulations under the Customs Act. by Mr Mutch (from 25 citizens). Medicare Office: Mount Druitt To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney calls to the attention of the House that proposed closure of Mt Druitt Medicare will cause hardship to many battling families. Your petitioners therefore request that the House forthwith abandon such proposals and allow Mt Druitt Medicare to remain open.  Australian Hearing Services To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petitioners of certain citizens of Western Sydney draws to the attention of the House that as of 1 July 1997, the Howard Government has declared at least 33,000 Commonwealth Seniors Holders ineligible for hearing services through the Australian Hearing Services. Your petitioners request that the House note our protest that many elderly people will no longer get free hearing aids or access to vital hearing services. This is deliberate discrimination against those in our community that can least afford these Budget cuts.  SBS: South East of South Australia To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia draws to the attention of the House that a significant number of residents of the South East of South Australia want access to the programs broadcast by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will enable SBS programs to be broadcast to the the State of South East of South Australia. by Mr Sawford (from 31 citizens). Tariffs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the phenom- House of Representatives in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need to support the Textile, Clothing and Footwear industries of Australia and protect the jobs of over 100,000 workers, their families, communities and associated industries. Your petitioners request that the House reject proposals by the Industry Commission to reduce tariffs and instead freeze tariffs and encourage the development of a viable Australian industry. by Mr Sawford (from 24 citizens). Unemployment To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of Perth in the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House their view that unemployment is Australia's most serious social and economic issue. Your petitioners therefore request the House note that those petitioners whose signatures appear below: a. calion the Government to commit itself to the creation of jobs as its highest priority, and b. calion the Government to institute policies which provide incentives for business to invest, develop our good Australian ideas here, encourage export industries, and add value to our products and raw materials. by Mr Stephen Smith (from 330 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully shows: That the Federal Government take full account of the recent Wik decision of the High Court of Australia which accepts that Native Title can coexist with pastoral and mining leases. We strongly encourage the government to initiate a process of negotiation between Aboriginal title holders and other leaseholders to resolve the practical use and management of those lands subject to joint title. We strongly disagree with any approach which proposes that Native Title be extinguished on land subject to such joint title, or which alters the Discrimination Act, or the Native Title Act (Mabo), to facilitate the possibility of such extinguishment. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Tanner (from 133 citizens). Petitions received. NA Industrial Relations",53
160,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) congratulates the International Transport Workers Federation and applauds the support it provided for the union stevedores at the port of Cairns who were under siege as a result of the operation of the Australian Government's Workplace Relations Act; (2) endorses the slogans ""United we stand, divided we beg"" and ""Workers united can never be defeated"" which have been raised in many recent industrial confrontations; (3) expresses its support for the courageous miners at Hunter Valley No. 1 Mine and for their wives and children who have stood with them on the picket line in defence of their jobs, families, communities and the right of collective action; (4) recognises that one to one negotiations between employees and management in the pursuit of individual contracts is not a process conducted between equals but a process stacked in favour of the vastly more powerful position of employers; and (5) urges the trade union movement, all employees and the wider community to continue to resist Native Title the savage attacks being made on Australia's traditional and civilised approach to negotiation, conciliation and arbitration in the area of industrial relations. For the benefit of those people who may not be awar- of the terms of the motion I will take the opportunity to summarise it briefly. This motion seeks to congratulate the International Transport Workers Federation for their great show of support to those seven union members who were under siege at the port of Cairns as a result of the operation of this government' s Workplace Relations Act. It also seeks the endorsement by this House of some of the outstanding union and workRacial ing-class slogans that have been used in recent industrial confrontations. It expresses support for the courageous miners and all of their families at Hunter Valley No. 1 mine who are at the front of a major attempt to preserve the rights of unions and unionists in Australia. It recognises that one-to-one negotiations are not conducted between equals. Individual employees just do not have the power that management brings to those negotiations. The motion also urges the trade union movement and the wider community to resist the savage attacks which are being made on the right of unionists to organise and to undertake collective action as a result of the operation of this government's workplace relations legislation. There will be one lead speaker and four support speakers from the opposition and from the government. I want to congratulate members of the opposition for the overwhelming support that I have received from them in relation to this motion. The number of people who got in touch with me and said, 'Bob, I would like to participate; can you put me on the list?' indicates the very strong support these sentiments. Those who got a guernsey include Joel Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter, who seconded the motion. Joel Fitzgibbon represents the area covered by Hunter Valley No. 1. He and I joined those striking miners, the men at the picket line, to indicate our support to them. We joined their spouses and their kids, who went up there as well to show their support for what their husbands and their fathers were trying to do. Joel Fitzgibbon represents a major coal mining area, and he represents admirably both that area and the people who work in that industry. Colin Hollis, the member for Throsby, is the Secretary of the Caucus Infrastructure, Regional and Rural Development Committee. That, of course, includes resources and energy. Colin Hollis is a great advocate not only for coal mining but also for maritime workers. Both those areas of employment are included in this motion. Rob MCClelland, the member for Barton, is the Secretary of the Caucus Living Standards and Economic Development Committee. That includes industry and industrial relations. He has shown a continuing constructive and effective interest in all these areas. Gavan O'Connor, the member for Corio, is the parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition. His electorate, of course, includes the port of Geelong. I am delighted to have those four members supporting the sentiments expressed in my motion. Let me deal with some of the issues in turn-first of all, the port of Cairns. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and Leader of the House (Mr Reith) and this government thought that they would have an easy win at the port of Cairns. They thought the handful of union members would be easy to pick off. They did not move into Sydney and they did not move into Melbourne; they moved into the port of Cairns where seven union stevedores were working on the wharves. They thought they were easy pickings. They thought, 'Seven of them. We'll pick them off one after the other. We'll pick the weak spot.' What they failed to understand was that there is not just a national trade union movefor ment; there is an international trade union movement. For that reason, I have taken the opportunity in this motion to congratulate the transport workers federation of the world, which came to the defence of those seven union stevedores. They said to the international stevedore company Freeport, in effect, 'You can be used as cannon fodder by the Australian government, but you operate around the world and it may be dangerous for you to do that.' I understand that, apart from indicating their concern to Freeport, there were no threats or intimidation. But Freeport very sensibly withdrew the demand that the ships up there be loaded and unloaded by non-union labour. They are now being loaded and unloaded by union labour. What a magnificent result. Seven union stevedores were picked off by the national government in Australia, but found support in the unity of workers around the world. The International Transport Federation said, 'We'll stand with you,' and they won. I say to Peter Reith, Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business: be warned. Be warned, Prime Minister Howard. Be warned, Rio Tinto. When workers are united they are invincible. They know struggle and they have been strengthened by it. Stop trying to humble and humiliate them. Treat them with the dignity and the respect which all Australians are entitled to receive. Accept that production is a social process in which all participantsincluding those who supply capital, those who supply management and those who supply labour-are entitled to be included and entitled to be considered. There has not everi been unanimity in relation to the implications of the government's Workplace Relations Act, and the philosophy that lies behind it, for the industry itself. Richard Hein, the Managing Director of P&O, one of the major stevedore companies in Australia, said that this government 'had no proper understanding of the complexity of the whole subject'. Chris Corrigan, the Chairman of Patricks, another major stevedoring company, said: ... we have to look to see whether there are more things that can be done to hasten reform, one of which is working with the unions. These are people on the ground, in the industry, who understand what is necessary. The other thing that Richard Hein said was that he had told the Howard government to 'put up or shut up' on waterfront reform. He described the recent rhetoric of this government as 'unhelpful and becoming boring' . Both Mr Corrigan and Mr Hein rejected government claims that the only way to increase productivity was to take on the unions. That is what they were told. They were told, particularly by the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, to take on the unions. Mr Sharp said: At the end of the day it does depend on the courage of the company to take on the unions ... This government was hoping that it would be able to use the sensible, balanced management of corporations which were prepared to negotiate, prepared to sit down with unions and prepared to come to sensible, balanced, civilised arrangements. They thought that they could put legislation in place and then say to corporations in Australia, 'We've given you the legislation, now go for their throats.' These corporations are not so stupid. Does anyone think that they are going to throw away their future, their competence and their performing capacity just to play this government's dirty, grubby, stinking little games by attacking the union movement and the unionists? The people who are involved in industry have got much more sense. I do not have time to deal with all the issues that I want to deal with, but I refer people to an article by Pamela Williams, the national correspondent for the Financial Review, on Friday, 15 August 1997. Pamela Williams has evidence that there have been discussions between the National Farmers Federation and this government concerning the possibility of using troops on the wharves. Mr Hollis-They've already been to Port Kembla.",58
161,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"My friend Colin Hollis from Throsby, who will participate later, says that they have already been to Port Kembla. They are mapping out their tactics. They are mapping out their strategy. They are intending to use the armed forces of this country against the workers. Let me emphasise this: those people who think that they can take on the trade union movement in Australia underestimate it. They underestimated those seven union stevedores at Cairns who got the international trade union movement behind them. It won for them. That is what we intend to do in the future. If this government wants to take on the trade union movement, they take on us as well. (Time expired)",60
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Nehl)Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Fitzgibbon-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,60
163,Mr CHARLES,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"La Trobe) (3.45 p.m.)That was a bit of a giggle, wasn't it? Back to the future with the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown)-let's go back and re-regulate the labour market in Australia; let's try to force the people somehow to make unions relevant in 1997 and perhaps the year 2000. The honourable member for Charlton knows as well as anyone that union membership in Australia has fallen over the last 10 years by about 10 per cent-that is, about one per cent a year. It is now down to below 25 per cent of the private sector employment market. That means that three-quarters of Australians that work in the private sector do not want to have anything to do with unions. They make a voluntary choice. However, if you work in the coal mining industry or on the wharves you do not have a choice. This government has brought in legislation on this-the Workplace Relations Act, which came into force on 31 December 1996. Amongst a lot of other things, it says that for the first time Australians have the right of association-freedom of association. It sounds like a simple concept. It sounds like something that might be in the constitution, but it is not. Everybody believes in freedom of association. You can associate with whom you like. You do not have to associate with people you do not want to. What that means in the context of the Workplace Relations Act is that you can be a member of a union if you like, but you do not have to. Tell that to the members of the CFMEU. They do not believe in that. Why? Because the CFMEU controls employment in the coal mines in the Hunter Valley. Because it controls it, it can guarantee a closed shop. Who would go outside the CFMEU when you can earn between $80,000 and $100,000 a year? Yo.ur company only makes two per cent return on capital, but you can demand those kinds of earnings. The industry has some of the highest disputation rates of any location of any kind of industry anywhere in the world. The union controls the shop. I love these slogans: 'United we stand, divided we beg'; 'Workers united can never be defeated'. Sieg heil, member for Charlton! I am sure if you go back to the future and sing a few more songs you will convince a few more people to join unions. It is not working for Jennie George and it is not working for anybody else in the ACTU, so perhaps you can reignite the union movement. I think it was on the Sunday before last on the Channel 9 Sunday program that the shadow minister for these matters in the federal parliament, the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), argued for a greater arbitral role for the Industrial Relations Commission system to protect the weakest employees. He said that that is where the opposition's prioriwere ty would be, and not the recent focus on the biggest and strongest union. He said that the Australian Labor Party, those on that side of the House, is going to focus on the weakest in the industrial market, not the strongest. The CFMEU and the Maritime Union of Australia represent the biggest muscle in the union movement in Australia-not only the highest paid employees in closed shops but also the biggest muscle that exists. At the latest conference, Simon Crean",60
164,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,The member for Hotham.,61
165,Mr CHARLES,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Sorry-it was not Simon at all, it was Bill Kelty! Bill Kelty said, 'Don't touch the MUA and don't touch the CFMEU because the union movement will die in a ditch if ever those unions lose any of their power or control over the businesses that employ their members.' Confrontation and back to the future-that is what it is all about. The government is about taking care of the little guys. Our No. 1 priority is to see that people have jobs. You cannot get a job in the coal mining industry and you cannot get a job on the wharves in Cairns, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney or Adelaide unless you join the MUA. That is compulsory unionism. It flies in the face of everything I believe in. We have a right to decide for ourselves in this country. The fact that the shadow minister believes that we should go back and re-regulate the market does not go down well with one of the young and the restless. An article in the Weekend Australian of 20-21 September says of Mark Latham: ""A sense of urban injustice"" drew Mark Latham towards politics-that and some fortuitous connections. At 30, Latham became the first popularly elected mayor of Liverpool. If his stint there is any indication, Australia should brace itself for a solid dose of change if he ever gets to run the country. He turned the council upside down, introducing trendy dry economic notions of productivity targets, corporatisation, contestability and contracting out. Mr Latham is quoted as saying: The fact that the unions liked the old way and these seen as fresh ideas-you just had to overcome that . . . In the end, the corporatised outdoor work unit was winning tenders outside council. It convinced me that command economy methods were not worth a cracker. Yet the member for Charlton wants to go back to the command economy. He would like the AIRC-let's go back and call it the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-to be making all the decisions about how Australians do things: when they go to work; when they come home; how long they work; what they get paid; how much they get for overtime; and perhaps what they eat and drink at smoko. Do you remember Robe River? We would like to go back to Robe River, wouldn't we? Part of the award at Robe Iron said that there had to be five flavours of ice-cream in the staff canteen. One day, one worker went into the staff canteen and there were only four flavours of ice-cream-so the joint was closed down. Brilliant! That really helps Australia's producti vi ty . At the coalmine we are talking about income levels of coalminers are very high. The lowest paid worker in the Hunter earns about $55,000 per year. Industrial action in the coal industry is 45 times the national average. Why? Because they have a monopolyon the supply of labour. That means that your son or daughter cannot get a job in the coal mines in the Hunter unless they join the ALP and then join the CFMEU. They have to get on the bottom of the waiting list and wait their turn to climb up the ladder. Once you get there, it does not matter how hard you work or whether you produce any coal or not, all that matters is your seniority. So those who get the overtime, those who get the perks, those who get all the benefits, are those who have been there the longest. If you come in new and you are enthusiastic and eager and you want to produce coal so that the company is more profitable and you can then earn more money legitimately, what happens? You get squashed, turfed out. You get told, 'Don't do that. You might work too hard and show everybody else up.' We could not have that, could we, member for Charlton? It does not do to do a full day's work for a full day's pay. No, we need the CFMEU and the MUA to make sure that our jobs and all our lurks and perks are absolutely protected. I think the conflict between the CFMEU and Rio Tinto really stemmed from the company's successful move to Allstaff in its operations outside the coal mining industry. The CFMEU and one of their officials admitted under cross-examination in the AIRC recently that the objective of the union in the disputes at Rio Tinto is to force Rio Tinto out of the coal industry. The union will make sure that the owners of the mine cannot survive. That is really brilliant stuff for it? That helps our productivity. It helps our standard of living. It makes all of us really feel better. This motion by the member for Charlton is an absolute nonsense. I think it is really enough to make you sick. He wants to go back 30, 40 or 50 years, when we know that the only way for Australia is to move forward. He supports not the workers of Australia but those highly protected dinosaurs on the waterfront and in the coal mines-the ones that have the protection of the big union. And he talks about the powerful company. In these two sections of the labour market, the power resides not with the company or the government but with the unions. (Time expired) Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (3.55 p.m.)-It does not surprise me to see the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in here jumping at the opportunity to speak to this motion. The biggest union basher of them all could not wait to get in here and get stuck into the CFMEU and the MUA. It is the ultimate aphrodisiac for the member for La Trobe. Have a look at the speakers list: Charles, MCArthur, Entsch, Tuckey, MCDougall. It is the same voices over and over again. The very good motion put before the House today by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was only placed before the Standing Committee on Selection last Thursday. To my surprise, here it is before the House today. They think they have a solid case. They thought this· was a great opportunity to take another whack at the CFMEU and the MUA. If they are so sure that they are in the right on this issue, why don't they support arbitration? If seniority is such an important issue to the member for La Trobe and others, why don't they simply bring in the independent arbiter? What is their concern? If their case is so solid, as the member for Barton says, why won't they let an independent referee come in and determine this issue? It is simple. They do not want these issues resolved. They want to drive this all of the way. This is not about a few clauses within the terms of an enterprise agreement; this is about their opportunity to use their Workplace Relations Act to crush the trade union moveAustralia, isn't ment in this country. I congratulate the member for Charlton. He is the son of a coal miner. He is someone who understands only too well the challenges which have been faced by the coalminers of this country over many years to achieve the sorts of safe working conditions that they enjoy today. He has long been a most effective advocate of their cause. I want to tum to a theme I began during question time today, and that was that magnificent win by the Newcastle Knights yesterday. What a great shot in the arm that will be for those men on the Hunter Valley No. 1 picket line. The Prime Minister tried to capitalise on it during question time today, but no-one in this chamber-other than possibly a few on our side of the House who will be speaking to this motion-will really appreciate what a significant boost that win yesterday was for the men sitting on the Hunter Valley No.1 picket line. Mr Deputy Speaker, what you must understand is that Rio Tinto has been running a very nasty public relations exercise with respect to this dispute, which is now more than four months old. It has been running petty stories like the one about how tradesmen at the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine are only allowed to change a light globe, implying that it is a matter of pulling a stool out, standing up on it and twisting a globe. How ridiculous! What a misrepresentation of the facts. The simple fact of the matter is that changing a globe requires tools. Who is provided with tools? Tradespersons only. Who makes that decision? Management makes that decision, of course, and probably for very good reasons. Involved here, no doubt, are occupational health and safety issues. This has been the approach. The approach has been to undermine community support for those workers at the Hunter Valley No.1 mine and their families. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that this sort of rubbish has been unsuccessful, even though their tactics in this matter know no bounds. The Newcastle Knights victory yesterday will only strengthen the resolve of those coalminers and their families. Out there on the field yesterday was Mr Gary Johns, a CFMEU official himself and father of Matthew and Andrew Johns. That is very symbolic of the link between the miners and the Newcastle Knights. Very quickly, I want to express the words of one of the wives of the miners, Mrs Trisha Patterson. She wrote this poem: ""Job security!-not more pay"", is what the miners said. And who will take the blame for this When we're unemployed instead? We're fighting for a common cause, to keep our jobs secure, And give our kids a better chance, That's why we've waged this war. Our Mr Reith has different views, on how things should be done As he sits in his ivory tower And treats us all like scum. He wants to see the battle fought-(Time expired) Mr Fitzgibbon-I seek leave to table the poem. Leave not granted.",61
166,Mr MCARTHUR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,":-This motion put forward by the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) with all this nice sounding, flowery language about worker solidarity and 'united we stand' is about one thing and one thing only: the union movement trying to justify its monopoly position over labour in key sectors like the coal industry and the waterfront in Australia in 1997. It is that monopoly position that has been used to extort high wages, questionable working conditions and unproductive work practices in both of those industries. We know the workers on the waterfront and in the coal industry, which the member for Charlton defends, earn up to $80,000 a year for 35-hour weeks and for questionable work practices, and they get a whole lot of perks along the line. Yet the member for Charlton is saying that they are not well paid. Any average battler out there would fully understand that $80,000 to $100,000 a year is a well-paid position. The position of those workers in the coal industry and on the waterfront can be maintained only by their monopoly power. They have the monopoly because there are few workers on the waterfront and because of the coal industry'S long tradition. I predict that those monopoly powers will not last indefinitely. That has been proved by the operation of the reserve price in the wool industry, that this House put into position. Inevitably that fell over. Inevitably the oil industry with the OPEC nations fell over when a cartel was into position. In relation to Bunker Hunt, tried to comer the silver market, that monopotolerate ly or cartel position fell over. So attempts by the member for Charlton this motion to maintain this monopoly tion is doomed to failure in the longer term. That was the situation in the UK under the Thatcher government when the waterside workers tried to maintain a similar monopoly position. They did not want to listen to governments of both colours, Labour and Conservative. Inevitably the change in the ensured that the monopoly of the waterfront workers in that country was no longer mainthe tained. Likewise in New Zealand, while it took some time, the monopoly position has no historically. longer been maintained. We saw the case in Cairns where seven workers wanted to maintain the monopoly any position in that smaller port, as the member for Charlton was explaining. They were in such great trouble that they had to pull International Transport Workers Federation exert again monopoly pressure on the employand ers of the stevedores in that port. So that dispute was about the right of that company to opt for in-house stevedoring services, but it was coerced by the MUA with the assist we ance of the international organisation. In no other commercial context would an extortion of this nature be acceptable. It would be punished by law. Imagine if insurance company threatened to bum a customer's house down unless the owner bought insurance from that company . We would be quite rightly horrified. That is the comparison we can draw. If the boycotts, bans, verbal abuse or threats of violence all used by a supermarket chain to prevent customers from using an alternative grocery store, they would stand condemned. How do members opposite defend that? Why should the MUA use strikes, picket lines, verbal abuse of other workers families, and international pressure to force a company to use a contractor which the MUA prefers? How do members opposite defend ment's that position? Is the member for Charlton's idea of Australia's traditional and civilised approach to negotiation part of this particular put background? Why should the unions be who permitted to act in ways which we will not in any other commercial context? This government has responded to these in positions by introducing section 127 in the posiWorkplace Relations Act, which enables companies to seek a court order to require a return to work so the companies can ask the workers to go back to work rather than being in this monopoly position. This government has also responded by revising the secondary boycott measures at sections 45D and 45E of law the Trade Practices Act. This government has put in common law positions to ensure that monopolistic intimidating unions are not able to bring about the chaos they have done Ultimately, as the member opposite would know, the only way to ensure job security in enterprise is to ensure that it becomes as competitive as possible. Jobs are kept if the industry is profitable. In the case of the in the waterfront, you can no longer make it a to monopoly position where the union movement the stevedores are in bed together to ensure that the farmers, the exporters and the importers pay exorbitantly high rates. You cannot feed your children on 'united stand' type concepts that the member for Charlton has put forward in his motion. I totally reject the motion he has put forward that congratulates the International Transport an Workers Federation. (Time expired)",63
167,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Barton) (4.05 p.m.)I support and congratulate the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) on his motion. I do not intend to address the Freeport situation other than to note that that dispute was were fundamentally about workers trying to save their jobs after the office of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business had stepped into induce a breach of contract. That was not only a defence to the unbridled aggressions of the shipowner up there but also and their about saving workers' jobs. I intend to focus on the Rio Tinto dispute. There is no doubt that the Howard governsupport for Rio Tinto and its policy to emasculate the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is an obsessive drive to reintroduce managerial prerogative. One of the previous speakers said that Labor had a throwback of 30 or 40 years. This government's policy is a throwback to the tum of the century. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) said that he was introducing industrial relations nineties style. He is dead right. He is introducing it 1890s style. The 1890s, of course, saw a unbridled industrial disputation as a result of employers trying to break collective agreeDuring ments that had been won by unions and by in attempting to introduce individual contractsgreatest precisely what Rio Tinto is doing now. It was as a result of the tremendous economic damage that occurred during the 1890s that our constitutional foundersMr MCArthur-They've got to make their mines profitable-come on!",64
168,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"'Make their mines that; profitable', that will not happen. You are absolutely wrong because the employer is not materially interested in results. Yoli are not interested in results. You are all about conflict. You are all about secondary boycotts. You are all about industrial tort actions. That is where you are so short-sighted. Not one government speaker has spoken about achieving results and the method of getting there. That is what happened in the 1890s. Our constitutional founders saw that there was a method of achieving results by introducing the rule of law into a situation industrial anarchy that you mob over there promote. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission was set up to introduce the rule of law into that conflict situation. Those opposite do not appreciate the treing mendous work the commission has done in resolving intractable disputes. You mob the sparks of a dispute and you go and pour petrol on it and say, 'Let's watch this bushfire bum.' The firemen-the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-are there to put it out. You come in and make submissions why they should not have a role, and just let the fire bum. This employer, Rio Tinto, and the government are not interested in results. They are not interested in achieving reforms. There are already mechanisms in place to do that. If they really have such a sound case, why not put it before an independent arbitrator, as the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) indicated? What they are about is introducing dictatorial powers. In terms of why managerial prerogative was a dead letter, Justice Lionel Murphy, a former High Court judge, in the period of Federated Clerks case, said: this generation, there has been an accelerating trend towards concentration of economic power fewer and fewer persons. . . . The power of the corporations transcends that of most governments. A reaction to the submergence of the individual worker is the demand by organised workers for some share in deciding what work is to be done, by whom and when, where, and how it is to be done. The thrust of the demand is not merely the improvement in existing pay and conditions. It extends to the protection of jobs, for themselves and other workers, but it is more than it is a demand to be treated as more than wage-hands-to be treated as men and women who should be informed about decisions which might affect their future, and to be consulted on them. It is a demand to be emancipated from the industrial serfdom which will otherwise be produced by the domination of the corporations; a demand to be treated with respect and dignity. This government has no respect for the dignity of the worker. It is all about reintroducing industrial serfdom. It is all about stopping consultation and progress through bargaining in a spirit of mutual interest. Not only is it necessary that there be such consultation and cooperation if Australia is to meet of the challenges of the global economy, but also it makes sound economic sense to have a motivated and committed work force. This government is not about th-t; this government is about crushing workers and about destroytheir working conditions. (Time expired)",65
169,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Leichhardt) (4.10 p.m.)see What a load of hypocrisy, of emotional rubbish! This d-bate is not about protecting the workers or protecting jobs. It is about protecting the hierarchy of the unions and, I guess, protecting the financial base of the as to Labor Party. We heard from one of the previous speakers, and it is a fact, that union membership is dropping and dropping quite fast-1O per cent in recent times. We all know that money from compulsory union levies goes to the Labor Party to help them continue to function. You have to look at what this is all about. It is payback time. The unions are now calling on the Labor Party to come in here to protect the jobs of their hierarchy. It is nothing to do with workers. Workers are very much at the periphery of this whole argument. To come in here and argue on the basis that you are looking after the workers is an absolute nonsense. In relation to the incident in Cairns, we were talking about saving the jobs of seven or eight wharfies. Some of the practices in place are totally ridiculous. They are so unproductive and non-competitive that they are putting at risk the jobs of other workers. The sum of $100 million plus is circulated throughout the Cairns region through International Purveyors. There is a risk that we could lose that business in Cairns. If we do, it is not just seven wharfies who are out of a job; a lot of other people would lose work as well. It is about time that they started to look at the interests of the broader community rather than at the interests of a few individuals who, in some cases, have probably inherited their jobs. The fact that they got the job has nothing to do with their ability to do the job; it is more that their grandfathers were in it, their fathers were in it, and the jobs are passed on from one generation to the next. It is one of the most unproductive areas of work in this country today. There is little wonder that people in an ever-increasing competitive field have to try to look towards more appropriate business practices. We heard the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) saying, 'We will not bring in the military.' What a load of rubbish! Let us remember what happened in 1989-90 with the pilots dispute. Who was in government then? Of course, it was Mr Hawke. That dispute absolutely destroyed the economy of our nation. Mr MCArthur-What happened to Cairns?",65
170,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Cairns was devastated. It was the Labor Party that brought in the military. The reason they brought it in was that the pilots were not members of· the ACTU. What a joke! The average waterside worker in metropolitan ports was actually on a better pay scale than the pilots. Mr Tanner-Rubbish!,66
171,Mr ENTSCH,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"That is absolute fact. Of course, they worked a darn sight fewer hours for that money . We talk about hypocrisy! If you want to talk about agreements, I would suggest you have a talk to some of the workers in Comalco up in Weipa. They were prepared to stand up and talk to the companies. When you talk to the workers who brokered the deals, they tell you that they are getting a far better deal now than they ever got from the unions. They were forced to accept the lowest common denominator that was imposed on them by the unions. They have come out with far better prospects and, of course, far better conditions and rates of pay. They were able to do it because they were confident of their own ability. They knew they could do the job. They did not hide behind the union. They were able to get up there and broker a deal. At the end of the day, they benefited, their families benefited, and the community benefited. It is something that could happen across the whole spectrum. (Time expired)",66
172,Mr HOLLIS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It is with great pleasure that I rise in total support of the motion before the House today in the names of my Labor parliamentary colleagues the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). Ever since the Howard government was elected to office in March 1996 various ministers have been threatening industrial confrontation in order to smash the two most significant trade union organisations in Australia, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and, of course, the Maritime Union of Australia. The labour movement, political and industrial, will unswervingly back these two unions against the union smashing agenda of this government-not 'if, 'but' or 'maybe'. My parliamentary colleagues in the other place have managed to extract details of the government's covert plan to use the military to break strikes which may occur on the waterfront. During the Senate estimates committee hearings in August it was exposed that the government has paid $90,000 busting money to consultants BCIL Economics, with a further $600,000 to be spent over the next financial year. Taxpayers' money is being used to fund a war chest against that trade union movement. A fortnight ago we saw the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) involve himself so intimately in the industrial dispute on the Cairns waterfront. He came into the House and was boastful about all the telephone calls he made late at night to the owners of International Purveyors. But the minister, obviously, was not too aware that his provocative calls would fall on deaf ears and that the years of association and support that the MUA has provided to the ITF, in the campaign to clean up the ships of shame, would have paid dividends. The minister also admitted to briefing Rio Tinto management on the government's submission to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as to whether the AIRC should arbitrate this damaging dispute. It is no surprise that the submission was against arbitration; a submission which argued against the national interest of settling disputes. It clear that the government has the unions in its sights and it needs the employers on the waterfront and in the coal mines to actually do the battle. The problem for the government is that it, as yet, has been unable to identify one employer on the waterfront to be the dummy for its battle. It has one employer, Rio Tinto, in the Hunter Valley. The threats and the lunacy of the provocation of industrial dispute by the government come straight out of attempts to imitate the Thatcher regime of Britain. Over the last fortnight troops have been sighted on the waterfront at Port Kembla. MUA officials and I have been assured that this is a usual military activity. Quite simply, we do not believe that assurance. I can say to the government that if one trooper is sent and sets foot on the waterfront to break an industrial dispute, as the government has covert plans to do, the Illawarra and the whole region will close down and that will spread very quickly throughout Australia. There will be picket lines like you have never seen before. They will be massive and we will fight for the rights of workers and their right to trade union representation. I congratulate the miners and their families picketing at Rio Tinto No. 1 mine in the Hunter Valley. They are involved in a struggle not only for their own future but for the future of each Australian worker. They are, and continue to be, strongly supported. I congratulate the MUA and its members on the Cairns waterfront for refusing to be intimidated by the muscle of the government. We hear much from the other side about how much coalminers earn and how much waterside workers earn. These figures are refuted by the officials of the union. But we always ask those producing these figures to produce their evidence. They have never been able to produce the evidence. I sometimes wonder if any on the other side have ever been down a coalmine or ever been near a coalmine. Have they ever looked at the record of safety in a coalmine? Would they go down a coalmine? Would they work in a coalmine? The coalminers are well paid but they earn every penny. They have my total support for is what they earn and for the wealth they contribute to Australia. Look at the wealth that coal is contributing to Australia. Those opposite should ask themselves whether they would exchange their cushy job in this place to go down a pit each day. As for the waterfront, produce your figures occasionally. Stop making these glib statements without any evidence. Then we can have a real, decent debate on it and you will be shown that your figures are wrong. They are figments of the imagination which you constantly trot out. It is always the same figures that are trotted out in this place with no support. I commend the two members for bringing this motion to the House and I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",66
173,Mr HARDGRAVE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS," The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was a fine land transport minister, but he is all at sea with this particular motion today. He has bumped a few of his colleagues into the boat and they are rowing off the end of the earth, I am sure. It is a inspiring and emotional debate that we have had so far. There is no doubt in mind, and it is the reason that I have joined this debate, that there is an increasing need every day for reform of the waterfront. At stake are the jobs of many thousands of Australians in small businesses. Certainly, in my electorate there are people who are struggling to meet the costs of export and import which are imposed by so many of the rorts on the waterfront. This nation is held captive by the Maritime Union of Australia. They run the ACTU and, of course, the ACTU runs the Australian Labor Party. It provides funds for elections and, of course, pre-selections. Pre-selections are probably at the top of the minds of the honourable members opposite contributing today. They are certainly not showing themselves to be strong advocates for workers, unlike people on this side who are standing very strongly for freedom of association. We do not see any need for compulsion. We are standing up for ordinary workers, unlike those opposite who are standing up for the $80,000 to $90,000 a year club-the earning elitewho are the Maritime Union of Australia members. Ordinary workers have my support, but I am not convinced those opposite are offering support to ordinary workers in Australia. They are, instead, protesting the innocence of the real featherbedders-the people who are living off the hard work of their own grandfathers and fathers in a job that was essentially handed down to them. I have to tell you there are workers in my electorate who are absolutely furious day in and day out with the wharfies of this country. They see an unreasonable level of extortion oriented wages paid to a bunch of people who barely work each week. Conditions and structures that are in place in jobs in my electorate are nowhere near as good as what is happening on the waterfront all because these guys have traditionally held Australians and Australian workers to ransom. If the same conditions existed in small businesses in my electorate there would be no very businesses left standing. Every one of them would have to shut tomorrow. At the same time. I have a growing band of small businesses in my electorate, exporters, who want to try to send things offshore but can never be 100 per cent sure that their business plans are not going to be jeopardised by unions like the MUA. Let us look at the benefits. The honourable member for Throsby wanted us to talk about some facts. Here are the facts. We are talking about people who are working a 35-hour week. When you subtract things like tea breaks and crib time involved in getting to and from those breaks-they shuffle to and from these breaks and that crib time is worth about seven minutes each way, that is, 28 minutes a shift-then the amount drops to 28.9 hours a week. Unlike all other workers in Australia, the wharfies are paid for tea breaks-they are probably going to get a sugar allowance next-and for the crib time as well. Then there is the infamous nick-when people clock on and their working mates, the ones who stay, cover for them while these blokes nick off and still get paid. If you consider there are 52 weeks a year, wharfies do not get four weeks off. All up they total about 17 weeks off a year. There is a total of 261 workings days in a year. Five weeks annual leave, 10 days sick leave, four days long service leave and eleven public holidays come off that. Mr Tanner-Nobody else gets them! They get public holidays. What an outrage!",67
174,Mr HARDGRAVE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"They get 17 per cent idle time which comes to 35Vz days off the 261 days each year. You blokes opposite can keep interjecting till the cows come home. You will prove to the average worker in Australia just how out of touch with reality you are. You want to be the rorter supporters; we will look after the workers. All of this adds up to 6.25 hours a day for 175 days a year and 85.5 days absent on full pay. Those opposite are protesting here today, all concerned because if they do no not stand up for these rorters they know very well that they are going to be asked why come their next branch meeting. Labor spent $400 million to try to pay off these rorters with a retirement package worth a quarter of a million dollars. Nothing has changed. We get 14.9 containers an hour through Australian ports-Osaka, 32; Singapore, 35 ; Yokohama, 47. This is the world's worse practice. People on this side of the chamber are standing up for Australian workers. We are standing up for Australian exporters. We are standing up for a fair go all round. It is only those opposite, through this quite ridiculous motion, who are standing up to perpetuate the sort of nonsense which has destroyed so much of the viability and potential viability of Australian industry and Australian export industry at that.",68
175,Mr OCONNOR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I thought the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) was going to tell us about coalition travel rorters, who are now sitting the back bench, but he omitted to mention them. I rise to express my strong support for the motion proposed by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). I congratulate him for placing it before this House today. The sentiments expressed in the motion reflect those of many unionists in the Corio electorate who view with increasing alarm the effects of the Howard government's Workplace Relations Bill on their incomes, their conditions of work and their overall standards of living. There are now many people in the general community who view with increasing alarm also the actions of a disintegrating government which seeks to provoke industrial disputation for its own narrow political ends. At this point in our history we should reflect on the fact that this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cut his political teeth in a Fraser government which had an appalling industrial relations record. The Prime Minister appears to have learnt nothing from that dismal experience. He was part of a tory government that presided over an industrial relations system that was riddled with conflict, an industrial culture corrupted on all sides of the industrial fence. It was up to the Hawke and Keating governments to sort out the dreadful industrial relations mess that was left to the nation by Malcolm Fraser and John Howard. It was those governments which ushered in a new era of cooperation between employees and their employers. We threw out the conflict ridden, unproductive and archaic industrial relations system that had been operating against the national interest. The reforms that Labor in government instituted introduced industrial flexibility and changed the industrial climate to a cooperative and rational one while at all times being sensitive to maintaining the award wages and the conditions of workers. The direct result of those policies was a massive reduction in industrial disputation and the creation of a civilised culture of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration in industrial relations. . Mr MCArthur- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I draw the attention of the House to the motion, which has five sections. on The member has not addressed one section of that motion.",69
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,69
177,Mr OCONNOR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Industrial peace is indeed a fragile flower. It can wilt easily in a harsh industrial relations climate where governments seek to conspire with powerful employers to crush the spirit of working men and women. The member for Charlton has cited two recent industrial disputes at Cairns and the Hunter Valley where the Howard government has sought to provoke conflict rather than seek a rational and reasonable solution to those disputes. The real 'agent provocateurs' are ministers in the Howard government. Let us take a close look at those 'agent provocateurs' . First, there is the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and Leader of the House (Mr Reith). This is the man we call Penthouse Pete, who accepts a $47,000 discount on a Crown Casino penthouse. This is the man who preaches about excesses on the waterfront. Then there is the disgraced former transport minister, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who now sits on the back bench, who lectures us and the waterfront about rorts. He has had to resign from the ministry because he was caught rorting his ministerial travel allowance. Then there is the Prime Minister himself, the friend and protector of the tax bludgers and bottom-of-the-harbour tax evaders from the WA branch of. the Liberal Party in the eighties, a man wedded to the failed industrial relations solutions of the sixties. Workers in Geelong, through the Geelong Region Trades and Labour Council, expressed their strong support for workers at Cairns and in the Hunter Valley whom the government has targeted for special treatment. As a unionist, I express my support for the legitimate struggle those workers have been engaged into protect their livelihoods. As the member for Charlton has indicated in the motion, we in the Labor movement do not intend to sit idly by and let this rotten, valueless and disintegrating government damage Australian working families and destroy the framework of industrial peace assiduously built up over the past decade by rational Labor governments, employers and workers acting in good faith. I conclude with the poem that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) was reading in his speech by the wife of a Hunter Valley No.1 miner. The poem says: He wants to see the battle fought, on so-called common ground, With the union and the company Slugging out each round. There will never be a resolution, unless they arbitrate, And if the government cannot do this, Then it's surely left to fate. (Time expired) Mr O'Connor- Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to table that particular speech. Leave not granted. Mr O'Connor-Oh, you will not table it.",69
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat. Mr Warwick Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The usual practice is that, if you seek to table a matter, you show it to the minister on duty first. Mr O'Connor- Mr Deputy Speaker, I most certainly would have done that, but of course the unusual occurrence occurred in private members business where there was a point of order taken by the member for Corangamite against me which prevented me from concluding my speech.",70
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Order! The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat.,70
180,Mr MCDOUGALL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Griffith) (4.31 p.m.)I am amazed but not surprised that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) calls on the House to applaud the actions of the waterside and maritime unions which blackmailed this nation. As recently as 1994, the Labor members of this House, despite being voted into their positions by the people, were reminded that they are required to be a member of a union. What we are seeing today is the member for Charlton dancing to the tune of his union puppet masters. For decades t-e waterside and maritime unions have held thiS country to ransom. Their tactic- a:e .simple: blackmail, bullying, threats and IntlmldatlOn; and, if all that fails, lies and then the Labor Party. We have just seen the ACTU secretary, Bill Kelty, threaten the nation with uni-n.instig-t­ ed war. He said it would be the biggest In Australia's history if the government uses troops and non-union labour to free the Cairns port'. Talk about hypocrisy. This is the same Bill Kelty who applauded Bob Hawke's use of troops in the form of the Royal Australian Air Force to break up the national pilots strike in 1989-a matter raised by my friend the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch). The pilots union was not a member of Labor's ACTU. Those workers were not to be protected; they were to be destroyed. I had expected more from the member for Charlton. His motion before the House reminds me that the Labor Party was founded by the union movement, and he dances to that tune. Any attempt by this government to bring our workplace into the 21st century is throttled by the opposition and its union puppet masters. The Cairns and Hunter Valley situ ations prove that members of Labor Party unions scorn democracy, scorn the rights of all to enjoy freedom of choice and scorn our laws. The Maritime Union of Australia called on its overseas pals the International Transport Workers Federation to threaten a small international shipping company with repercussions in other ports around the world, and we are expected to applaud and support a union which used blackmail tactics beyond the reach of the Australian law for which it has absolutely no respect. Yet these same unionists are happy to take advantage of all the perks and goodies these same laws give them, like a 35hour week which is reduced",70
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Order! It being 4.34 p.m., the time allotted for private members business has expired. The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for Griffith will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Peacekeeping Forces",71
182,Mr QUICK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today in this grievance debate to raise two issues about two very different parts of the world, yet two places that are in very close proximity to each other and in which Australia played, and is continuing to play, a key role in ensuring that there is peace and stabiliPresident ty in this pivotal part of the world: the Middle East. Firstly, I wish to highlight the tremendous role Australia's peacekeeping forces are playing, scattered as they are, in so many places throughout the world. These members of our armed forces are working as key members of both the United Nations forces and other multinational forces. This afternoon in the grievance debate I wish to highlight a very special and somewhat unique force: a one-off group situated far from home, a group of 26 Australians consisting of 25 men and one woman. These Australian soldiers are doing Australia proud. I must admit that, like so many others in this place, I had only a rough idea that Australia contributes to several peacekeeping operations somewhere in the world. Apart from being aware of our commitment at times of international crises when it is featured on the television, I, like most of us in this House, would be blissfully unaware of the tremendous job our armed forces who serve in both UN and other multinational forces are doing. Unless we as politicians manage to visit countries where Australians are operating as both UN troops or multinational troops, we will continue to be ignorant of their effectiveness. Perhaps there might be a job here for someone in the public relations sector of the Department of Defence. I and five other members of federal parliament had the privilege whilst in Egypt just over a week ago to travel to the Sinai and to meet one such group of Australian soldiers: members of the MFO. What does MFO stand for? MFO stands for Multinational Force and Observers. It is a rather unique collection of armed forces from many nationalities: United States, Colombia, Fiji, Bangladesh, France, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Hungary and, last but not least, Australia. Kuwait Following the cessation of hostilities between the Arab states and Israel flowing from the Yom Kippur war of the early 1970s and in the peace discussions that followed, the MFO was set up as one of the key instruments that came out of the Camp David accord brokered by President Carter with Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel. The MFO's role is to monitor the troop deployments of both Egypt and Israel in the Sinai and to ensure that each country is complying with the stated agreements signed at Camp David. Unlike the UN peacekeeping forces currently in Bosnia, as one example, the MFO is not responsible and accountable to the United Nations. Rather, it is responsible to and headed up by a secretariat based in Rome and answerable to the three countries which pay for its continued existence-the United States, Egypt and Israel. I might add that these three countries contribute $15 million a year MFO force. During this grievance debate, I would like to place on the record not only my but the rest of the delegation's congratulations to Colonel Nick Slingsby and the Aussie task force for the magnificent role they are playing in the various key positions they hold in the MFO and the Sinai. I would also like to express our delegation's appreciation for the wonderful hospitality shown to us on the night of 18 September at North Camp outside EI Arish. The Annzac Cove-and it is not An-z-a-c; it is A-n-n-z-a-c, the Australia, Norway and New Zealand Army Corp-really hummed along and we who were there will never forget that marvellous night when we Aussies, so far away from home, showed just how important this place we call Australia is to all of us. The Australian service personnel of the MFO had two gripes-firstly, and understandably, the lack of Australian beer in the and, secondly, which I think is the most important, the fact that the Defence department only allows them to have six free minutes a month to speak with their loved ones back home. We found this absolutely ridiculous-six minutes a month, and most of them have young families. It is marvellous when the American forces have arranged with their telecommunications carrier to have real discounted phone calls back home. One wonders what Telecom, Optus and the Defence department might consider doing to help these guys and the young lady thousands and thousands of miles away from home to rectify this rather ridiculous situation. The second issue I wish to raise in this grievance debate is that of the 604 missing and unaccounted for Kuwaitis resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the early 1990s. As well as visiting Egypt, our delegation also visited Kuwait. I was proud to be part of the six-person Australian parliamentary delegation-the first by an Australian parliament-to visit that wonderful country. Kuwait, as everyone knows, was the scene for the Gulf War in the early 1990s. Once again, Australian service personnel served superbly and proudly in this theatre of war to ensure to this that Kuwait was finally liberated. Our party travelled throughout Kuwait being shown many of the battle sites and the devastation wrought on this country by the Iraqis on their invasion of, their occupation of and their subsequent withdrawal from this rather small nation state. I was also proud to be part of the delegation's visit to a rather sensitive part of that world-the demilitarised zone on the Kuwait-Iraq border-and, once again; to see this time the UN multinational force operating to ensure that there is some peace and stability in this rather sensitive part of the world. Even though Australian service personnel were not on service at the KuwaitIraq border area, they had been there previously. It was interesting to note the high recommendations by those who had served with them. As I said, this area of concern for the 604 Kuwaitis is one of the principal areas of concern for everyone who lives in Kuwait. desert The 604 Kuwaitis include many women and children who were taken by the Iraqis during the occupation of Kuwait and the subsequent time when they were fleeing the advancing liberating forces. Despite a very prolonged and constant international pressure not only by Kuwait but also by those who served in the Gulf War area to liberate Kuwait, Iraq has continued to fail to respond to requests over the past five years just to simply resolve the concerns of Kuwaiti families to learn of the fate of these 604 people. As we met the Amir, the Prime Minister and various cabinet ministers, time and time again it was conveyed to us that not knowing the fate of 604 compatriots is probably the most pivotal concern that these people have. To us, 604 does not mean much but, when there are such few Kuwaitis-600,000-odd of them-this is a considerable number of their population. I said to the people that when we came back to Australia we would once again highlight the need for international pressure to be put on Iraq to at least let the Kuwaitis know the fate of those persons-whether they are still alive, whether they are still incarcerated, whether they have been put to death. Not knowing five years after these people have been taken is inconceivable to me and to all members of the delegation. It is inconceivable that this should still be taking place. Visiting those two sensitive areas and seeing the pivotal role of Australian peacekeepers, I would like to compliment them all and tell them that we have not forgotten them. We do appreciate the wonderful work that they do. If there is anything we can do, even something as simple as getting them cheap phone calls and some Australian beer, we will not forget them and we will work to ensure that their concerns and their grievances are noted. Unemployment",71
183,Mrs GALLUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to grieve today about unemployment and, in doing so, I want to focus on one of the ways we may reduce it. As members of this House would be aware, unemployment has been stuck at about 8.7 per cent for 15 months. Despite the government having achieved persistent low inflation, an anticipatemployer ed budget surplus, good growth, low interest rates and a more competitive dollar, jobs are not picking up. In the 1950s and 1960s, Australia had an unemployment rate of under one per cent. During the 1970s, it rose to almost seven per cent. Although it returned to under six per cent in the 1980s, by 1992, in response to Keating's recession, it jumped to over 11 per cent. The severity of the 1992 recession, with the high interest rates that closed so many small businesses, has left a legacy in the form of the long-term unemployed, who make up almost a third of those who are currently unemnloyed. Recessions have always left behind this type of legacy and, in this regard, the deliberately engineered recession of 1992 was worse than most. The long-term unemployed and those entering the work force not only have to contend with the aftermath of Labor's disastrous recession; they also have to face changes in the nature of the world's economies. Globalisation has reduced the demand for low skill jobs, many of which have moved offshore to developing countries. At the same time, the technological revolution has seen a shift in emphasis from low skilled to higher skilled labour. As we move into the next century, the demand for high skilled workers will increase. At the same time, proportionately, the demand for low skilled workers in traditional areas will decrease. Training will be important to get people into higher skilled jobs, but we must accept that there is a certain proportion of the population who, for a whole variety of reasons, be it talent or circumstances, will not be able to access these jobs. These people now make up a significant proportion of the long-term unemployed and will form an increasingly significant part of the new unemployed as opportunities for the low skilled continue to decrease. Multiplying our industries is obviously one way of providing jobs for the low skilled, but as computers have replaced manual labour in so many areas, industry is not the great it once was. As more high skilled jobs become available in emerging industries-in particular, in information technology-those with higher skills potential will be able to move out of the low skilled jobs which they presently occupy into high skilled work, leaving more positions available for the low skilled. As the reality of low inflation, low interest rates, sustainable high growth, the low dollar and the budget surplus increase business confidence and activity, the overall job market will grow. But at the end of the day, globalisation and technological change will leave a significant proportion of people with low skills without jobs. As it is essential that these people not be excluded from the workplace, strategies have to be found to increase their participation. One such strategy is allowing wages for the unskilled to decrease sufficiently so as to make them attractive to potential employers who cannot afford to employ them at current rates. Such a solution is known in Europe as the Anglo-Saxon solution. Indeed, in the UK and the USA, lower wages have brought about fuller employment. The cost has been high, with an emerging class of working poor in both countries. A solution that establishes a class of working poor is not acceptable in Australia and is contrary to Liberal philosophy, which has as its core the belief that people who work should obtain sufficient income for a reasonable standard of living. John Stuart Mill called it 'the amount of income needful for life, health and immunity from bodily pain'. On the one hand then, we have the alternative of no work and welfare dependency; on the other hand, work with inadequate wagesboth of which are antipathetic to Liberal philosophy. The solution is in the tax system. If the only way to increase low skilled employment is to let wages drop, the government will have to compensate the low skilled and the most appropriate way is through the taxation system. There are a number of ways of compensating the low skilled by using the tax system. Professor Peter Dawkins of Melbourne University advocates negative taxation, whereby low income earners have their income supplemented by the government through so-called tax credits. So as not to discourage full-time work, the credits have to be proportional to the amount of work undertaken during specific periods. Dawkins's general approach is one that all Liberals would applaud, in that it seeks to ensure an adequate and equitable income for people in low paying jobs. Unfortunately, making a full-time worker reliant on government supplements can take away the pride people take in their self-sufficiency and independence. There is also the danger of entrenching a culture of government dependency and encouraging businesses to rely on government for wage top-ups for their employees. While the detailed works of the last century's Liberal economic philosophers cannot be an appropriate blueprint for a 21st century tax system, the Liberal philosophers knew what they were about when they set out the general principles of taxation. Again, Mill argued that taxation should not commence until after a certain level of income, sufficient to support an individual or a family adequately, was reached. This is the philosophy behind the tax-free threshold. When the tax-free threshold was first introduced in Australia, it was much closer to average yearly earnings than it is now. Inflation has seen the difference between the two increase. Even in the last 10 years, the tax-free threshold has moved from almost a quarter of average yearly earnings to less than 15 per cent. Currently, the threshold-at $5,700-is nowhere near adequate to support an individual, let alone a family. Because the threshold has been left so low for so long, the cost of raising it now for all taxpayers, regardless of income, is prohibitiveapproximately $1 billion for every thousand dollar increase in the threshold. A more acceptable alternative is to raise the tax-free threshold for only those on low incomes. Financially, this is more achievable. The cost of raising the threshold to $10,000 for those with incomes of $10,000 or less would be under $300 million per annum. To raise it to $15,000 for those with incomes of $15,000 or less would be approximately $1.5 billion. Graduated thresholds above a new tax-free threshold for low income earners are necessary to ensure that those who earn more maintain an overall higher income and do not get caught by high effective marginal tax rates. As real wages fall and low skilled workers become less expensive, more of the unemployed will get jobs and the bill for unemployment benefits will drop. But, in the short term at least, the reduced social security bill will not be sufficient to offset the loss in taxation from raising the tax-free threshold for low income earners. Consequently, to support a significantly higher tax-free threshold for those on lower incomes, the government would have to make up a certain proportion of lost taxation revenue. The GST is not the answer to this problem. Although the GST has huge benefits, it is not a magic pudding and cannot provide revenue to compensate the Commonwealth for loss of tax from low income earners as well as replacing wholesale sales tax and payroll tax. With corporate tax rates dropping all over the world in an effort to lure industries on shore, raising the corporate tax rate is not sensible, although it would bring plaudits from those on PA YE incomes. While raising the marginal tax rate for the better off is not a popular option-and one that has been discounted by this government-it is an option we have to look at. There were winners and losers out of globalisation and the technological revolution. It is only reasonable to expect that the winners should compensate the losers. Only in this way can we move into the next century with a society that can expect high employment and economic justice. High unemployment puts pressure on welfare systems and increases taxation. It has a high social cost which affects unemployed and employed alike. It breaks down social cohesion and increases crime and civil disobedience. It extracts huge personal cost and wastes lives. What we must not do is put an added burden on the victims of change by creating a class of working poor. If we follow the British and the Americans in freeing up wages for the low-skilled, we have to compensate those accepting low wages. Raising the tax-free threshold for low income earners is one such method. (Time expired) Education",73
184,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to bring up today what became clearly apparent in this parliament last weekthat the Howard government is unfit to govern. We have seen the demise of three ministers, but, more importantly, we have also seen talk over the weekend about why certain reshuffles should take place. I would like to say to the Howard government that, if they are talking about reshuffling or dismissing ministers, I would like to add another two to their list. The two I am talking about are the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). I do so in this grievance debate today because both Senator Vanstone and the member for Goldstein, through their public statements and their actions in the last few months, have proven themselves unfit to hold the high office to which they have been appointed. They have betrayed the principles of public education for which they purport to stand. They have denigrated the efforts of thousands of educators and teachers across this country of ours and they have actively undermined the nation's public education system, robbing it of the confidence of parents and employers across Australia. They have attacked a system which, thanks to savage budget cuts and this government's unwise and inappropriate program of public education changes, is already demoralised and in disrepair. In her first 18 months of office as Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone has made something of a name for herself as a minister who can do no right. She has become a symbol for all that is wrong with the Howard government-unfocused, mistake-prone and ineffective. She has, equally, become a figure of resentment and bitterness for many hundreds of thousands of Australians affected by the mismanagement of her portfolio. All Senator Vanstone's failings and slip-ups faded into insignificance on 8 August, however, thanks to several .off-the-cuff comments made by her in a speech to the AmericanAustralian Chamber of Commerce in Adelaide. Senator Vanstone, the minister responsible for defending public education in this country, said that students from private schools were 10 times more likely to get jobs than those from government schools and that private schools, unlike their public counterparts, had 'beaten unemployment'. It was Senator Vanstone's assertion that, if public schools could only lift their game and try to be more like private schools, the country's unemployment problem-particularly the youth unemployment crisis-would be solved. The minister also yearned for the good old days of technical schools-clearing houses for apprentices where boys were encouraged to do metalwork and girls to do home economics. That, I might add, was a system Australia rejected in favour of comprehensive education in the 1960s, a vital move in the democratisation of our Australian public system. These comments, even based on Senator Vanstone's track record, were breathtaking in their arrogance, contempt and stupidity. They show a minister completely without a grasp of her portfolio and with scant knowledge of the differences between public and private education in this country. The Australian public have a right, at the very least, to expect a working knowledge of these issues from their federal minister for education. Condemnation of Senator Vanstone's comments soon followed-not just from the public education sector. The Chair of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, Mrs Judith Hancock, said the senator's comments were 'unfortunate' and 'poorly advised'. She said: I believe to try to blame schools for everything quite wrong. Schools aren't there to get jobs for young people. They're there to train them to flexible people who can face many challenges. there are no jobs out there for them, that's really a government problem. Mr Warren Johnson, the Executive Officer of the New South Wales Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations said Senator Vanstone's comments were 'facile'. In a to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) he said: As the largest school parent organisation in Australia we write to register our deep disquiet at the inflammatory, ill-informed and irresponsible comments of your Minister for Education. Even Senator Vanstone's party colleagues joined in the condemnation. One comment which caught my eye particularly came from the ACT Liberal MLA, Louise Littlewood who said she found the senator's views 'not only offensive but extremely shallow'. The editorials of the leading papers across the country were also quick to criticise the outrageous views of the minister. The Sydney Morning Herald said the minister for educafrom tion was 'uninformed', 'ignorant' and 'prejudiced' about government schools. It said her views were a 'mish-mash of nonsense and statistics taken out of context' and questioned her fitness for her job. The bane Courier-Mail remarked on the 'ill-conceived' comments and made a number of observations about what she was saying young people out there. The paper's editorial said that Senator Vanstone offered no suggestion as to how the age-old problem of social inequity between private and public education should be addressed. It said she also 'ignored the fact that there were plenty of excellent public schools successfully preparing students for the direct transition from school to work or for going on to university'. Finally, the West Australian editorial perhaps summed it all up by saying: State schools do not deserve such shabby treatment. Senator Vanstone's comments portray a vast ignorance of public and private education and the difference between the two. State schools have been savaged in this country by the last two Howard federal is government budgets. Over four years, $270 be million has been cut from government schools If and directed towards private schools through ... the enrolment benchmark adjustment. Cutting of untied grants to states will reduce funds made available to public schools by $400 million. A sum of $45 million has been cut out of teacher development proletter grams, including some which focused on literacy. Public schools are doing their best with the resources available. What the minister fails to understand is that state schools, unlike private schools, reflect the social make-up of the communities in which they are located. Society's problems, such as unemployment and poverty, therefore infiltrate these schools to a much greater degree than private establishments, making the job of teaching so much harder for teachers. What Senator Vanstone also fails to appreciate-and this is perhaps the most disturbing thing-is that students, whether they come a private or a public school background, will remain unemployed as long as the jobs are not there. If every kid in Australia went to a private school, would that mean the it unemployment rate would immediately drop? BrisOf course, it would not. To suggest so is minister's ridiculous in the extreme. It is the government's job to increase to employment in this country; it is not our public school system's job. The public education system in this country is the foundation stone for our democratic system and our much cherished equality. When Senator Vanstone rubbishes the public education system, she rubbishes our democracy and our way of life. The conduct of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), I might add, has been no better than that of his senior minister. Over the last few weeks, Dr Kemp has raised quite serious concerns regarding the state of literacy in Australia. As minister for schools, Dr Kemp is quite entitled to do so. What he is not entitled to do, however, is to raise spurious allegations about the standard of education and literacy taught in our schools, aggressively impugn our teachers across the country and, like Senator Vanstone, create a climate of concern about our education system as a whole. On an issue which should be above party politics, above media grandstanding, above attacks on state governments, above scapegoating, in his remarks over literacy the minister for schools has quite plainly done all of the above. He has done so to the detriment of our children's interests and of achieving a cooperative national approach to improving literacy in our schools. To then tum around, as the minister has done, and say that if schools didn't improve literacy standards their funding would be withdrawn as a performance based penalty is as illogical as it is outrageous. Quite rightly, as with his colleague Senator Vanstone, the minister for schools has been condemned throughout Australia. The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, said of Dr Kemp and his highly inflammatory comments, that it was: The greatest attack on, not only children, but those who teach our children, in very many years. He also said: What Dr Kemp has really done is cast a slur right over the education system in Australia.  Gude, went further. He said Dr Kemp's statements were 'like being stabbed in the back by a best mate'. He also said: It's as if he thinks he's the only person who has a right to be remotely interested in literacy. the hell does he think he's doing? He doesn't own one school, he doesn't employ one school teacher and he's carrying on like macho man. Dr Kemp and Senator Vanstone have shown themselves to be incapable of doing their jobs at even a satisfactory level. Their comments have sought to bring down our public education system rather than build it up, as is their duty. Kids in state schools and their hard working teachers deserve ministers who are supportive of their efforts, not contemptuous and dismissive. I personally believe that both of these ministers should be stood down by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). As long as they remain, the Australian people will quite rightly continue to question the commitment of this government to public education. And while we have such outrageous comments being touted around this country by both of these ministers the respect which all of us should have for our public education will be diminished. I will further add that both of them not only need to be condemned by their own Prime Minister but should be, as I said, if not demoted, reshuffled out of the portfolio of responsibility that is the training and the education of the young people of this country who eventually will be the future leaders. These ministers need to stand up and take their medicine. These ministers need to be condemned. (Time expired) Greenhouse Gases",75
185,Mr BARRESI,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today to address an important international issue: our environment, and how a company in my electorate has been frustrated in its efforts to make a difference at a local level. Our survival depends on the sustainable use of our natural resources, but gone are the days when most modem conveniences cost our environment deady. We now have the knowledge and innovation to benefit from our natural resources while taking steps to ensure natl}Je's delicate balance is not irrevocably upset. Esanty, a company based in the Deakin electorate, is attempting to significantly But what reduce ozone depletion and greenhouse gas usage, which contributes to global warming as well as minimising other pollutants and damaging chemicals-a product which contrasts with the environmentally sensitive HFCs. Esanty's innovation is a prime example of how Australians can assist our environment and eat our lifestyle cake too. But Esanty's story is also one of a Deakin businessman fighting at times against the might of conventional industry and the stubbornness of bureaucracy. The need for Australia to contribute to a better global environment is beyond dispute. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) told this House last week on 22 September: ... the only way in which you will get a really serious answer to the response to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is to involve everyone the solution to the problem. He also said, 'We are prepared to play our part.' In fact, Australia already contributes through many projects, despite producing just 1.4 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. As well as being a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the government supports a cooperative program with industry known as the 'greenhouse challenge'. Over 30 of our largest enterprises, which produce 45 per cent of our greenhouse emissions, have signed agreements to reduce waste and pollution. Twelve industry associations have signed on, with another 84 enterprises preparing to sign similar agreements. In addition, the coalition's $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust will encourage revegetation and .land and waterway rehabilitation on an unprecedented scale. Much has been achieved, but more can always be done. Some of the most significant improvements involve simple changes at a local level, from recycling used products to cutting down on energy use. Airconditioners, for example, are a significant and real source of pollutants. Whether in our businesses, our homes or our cars, airconditioners traditionally relied on CFCs and now use HFCs or hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The battle against CFCs has been won, but the battle against HFCs is still to be won. Esanty plays a very significant part in winning that battle. One tonne of a gas commonly used in car air conditioning systems, R134A, is said to release 38.8 tonnes of global warming carbon dioxide gases. Simply manufacturing the gas releases damaging gases into our environment. In Australia alone, more than 80,000 kilograms of fluorocarbon refrigerants enter the atmosphere each year. I am proud to say that Deakin based Esanty is trying to assist the ordinary Aussie motorist to make a difference. There are more than eight million cars on Australian roads today and over 458 million worldwide. The projections are that that will increase even more so. A growing proportion of them feature air conditioning. Around 80 per cent of US cars and 25 per cent of British cars have air conditioning. Fifty per cent of in those in Europe are expected to have air conditioning by 2000. Esanty's products-hydrocarbon refrigerant gases ER12 and ER22/502-are organic refrigerant gases derived from natural gas, incorporating the principles of 'greenfreeze'. They have a zero ozone depleting substance rating and have minimal global warming potential. Products with hydrocarbon coolants also use less energy than other products. Tests of commercial refrigerant systems showed greenfreeze to be 50 per cent more efficient than ozone depleting refrigerants, and they use 10 per cent to 30 per cent less energy. A standard Australian built car contains about 800 grams of HFC in its airconditioner. The same car needs just 280 grams of hydrocarbon gas to run the same air conditioning unit. Most alarming, research published just last month, some of it in the Lancet, demonstrates that HFCs which were previously thought safe are highly toxic at the levels currently used in cars. HFCs had been thought to be safe in concentrations of up to 8,000 parts per million when people were exposed to the gas for up to half an hour. Last month's report by Armstrong Laboratories in the United States shows that a concentration of just 4,000 parts per million will kill humans by cardiac arrest in under four minutes. If all the gas in a standard unit were to enter the cabin at once, HFC gases would be present at 10 times this concentration. This gas cannot be seen or smelt. Greenfreeze technology provides a safer, more efficient alternative. Numerous European nations, led by Germany, have embraced it. The first greenfreeze fridge rolled off German Foron production line in 1993. In 1996, more than eight million fridges were made by European manufacturers, almost 100 per cent using greenfreeze technology. In 1994, CalorGas in the United Kingdom introduced a line of hydrocarbon refrigerants as direct drop-in replacements for CFCs-and now, of course, HFCs-under the brand name 'CARE'. Many overseas governments have actively encouraged the adoption of hydrocarbon based refrigerants, but Australia has not been as quick to follow in this pursuit. Three ago, government and industry specialists denounced the conversion to greenfreeze gases; encouraged, say the cynics, by certain vested interests. During the past two years, the Motor Vehicle Repair Industry Council of New South Wales, the Association of Fluorocarbon Consumers and Manufacturers and the Vehicle Air Conditioning Specialists of Australia-all of whom, understandably, are out to protect the interests of traditional manufacturers-have led an unprecedented fear campaign. They have made a victim of an initiative that would have significantly contributed to reducing waste emissions and our attempts to control ozone depleting substances on this planet. Esanty claims that in July 1995, following several articles in magazines and newspapers, a Canberra lobby company faxed all government and automotive industry organisations. They wrongly 'announced' the imminent release of a dangerous, flammable and explosive refrigerant gas, requesting its immediate ban. The industry pressure against Esanty even led to a carefully stage-managed car explosion supposedly caused by hydrocarbon refrigerant gases. Furthermore, the New South Wales Minister for Fair Trading, Mrs Faye Lo Po, immediately banned the products without industry consultation and requested Victoria follow suit. I am pleased to say Victoria refused and continues to refuse the request. This campaign has persisted unsupported by any academic engineering authority. In fact, greenfreeze technology has been supported by an objective evaluation by Dr Ian MaclaineCross and Professor Leonardi from the Unithe versity of New South Wales, as well as by international green groups. Claims that the new product would be dangerous have been proven wrong. International standards ISO 5149, BS 4434 and AS/NZS 1677 now regulate the safe use of these products in many countries, including Australia. In the past two years, I am informed, Australia has used more than 30,000 kilograms of hydrocarbon refrigerant gas. Had fluorocarbon refrigerants been used, 100,000 years kilograms would have been required. The effectiveness of this as a substitute for the more dangerous and environmentally sensitive HFCs can be seen. It is clear that a national approach to the regulation of hydrocarbon refrigerant gases is essential to the work of companies such as Esanty. Car air conditioning and refrigeration units are key markets for hydrocarbon gases. I hope the state and federal governments can offer their support in an appropriate way after sufficient scientific evaluation. In addition to the environmental benefits proven elsewhere, it is estimated that there could be export related sales of tens of millions of dollars. Already plans are inplace for high expansion and trade with various Asian countries. Highly efficient, low energy consumption hydrocarbon refrigerants are desperately needed in Asia-Pacific markets. While hydrocarbon refrigerants would initially be applied to the automotive industry, their use has the potential to extend into large-scale multi-miIIion dollar industrial projects. Esanty has recently been acquired by Boral, one of Australia's leading companies. It is now part of a division of Boral Limited. Mr Colin Spencer, who heads Esanty, will this week meet with two coalition government ministers. I would like to place on the record my appreciation to those ministers for their willingness to hear what a locally based business from the Deakin electorate is achieving. The current international debate on Australia's greenhouse gas levels, together with the pressures being exerted by the European Union and the United States of America, provides us with an ideal opportunity to explore products such as those produced by my constituent for our nation's advantage. Let us not tear down such ingenuity, but applaud it, support it and exploit it to the benefit of both our environment and our economy. (Time expired) Legal System",77
186,Mr KERR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Last week I spoke in the grievance debate on the effects of the attitude of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) towards the National Crime Authority and the residue of the cowboy culture of the 1980s-Bond, Quinn, Skase and Elliott. In that debate I said that some went to gaol and some got lucky. Just how lucky John Elliott is was revealed in the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria's Court of Appeal case, Director of Public Prosecutions reference No.2, the decision of which was handed down on 26 September-just three days ago. The judgment was a unanimous one. The judge who wrote the key judgment was Mr Justice Brooking. He ruled in favour of the National Crime Authority on every appeal point. I will go quickly through the facts. The prosecution case against the defendantsincluding Elliott-was that in January and September of 1988 Elders IXL, controlled by John Elliott, paid a total of approximately $66 million to the Bank of New Zealand in purported settlement of foreign exchange hedging transactions supposedly entered into between Elders and the Bank of New Zealand. At or about the same time, the Bank of New Zealand paid most of this money to companies associated with alleged co-conspirator Alan Hawkins in purported settlement of foreign exchange hedging transactions supposedly entered into between companies associated with him and the bank. The prosecution alleged that there were no genuine foreign exchange transactions and that the money paid by Elders under this guise were payments to Hawkins of a fee for his assistance in May 1986 when a company associated with Hawkins-namely, Beid Pty Ltd-purchased about 4Y2 per cent of the share capital of Broken Hill Pty Ltd during the currency of a partial takeover offer for BHP by Bell Resources Ltd, a company associated with Robert Holmes-a-Court. The prosecution intended to say that this assistance prevented BRL from obtaining effective control of BHP and, ultimately, Elders. In the course of preparing, it was expected that Kenneth Charles Jarrett, a former director of Elders, would say that he had lied on oath at a hearing of the National Crime Authority on 19 December 1990 in stating that the foreign exchange transactions had been genuine. Jarrett was expected by the prosecution to swear that he had discussed in detail with the Elliott co-accused what he proposed to say at the hearing and that he had devised and formulated the false explanation that was to be given to the National Crime Authority in relation to these foreign exchange transactions. Jarrett was expected to say that he had discussed the false explanation of each of the Elders co-accused and, to a lesser extent, another of the accused. The evidence he was expected to give would, the prosecution was intending to say, show that all four of those persons were aware that the explanation was false. The problem the prosecution found was that there was argument from the outset about the admissibility of a number of discussions which had taken place with the National Crime Authority, and the judge ultimately accepted the defence's contention that the statements made by the accused were nonadmissible. The argument was conducted on the basis that there was a prior set of dealings before the notice under section 25 of the National Crime Authority Act was issued which coloured that notice and affected its interpretation. No jury was ever empanelled. The judges hearing this appeal said that basically this showed that justice in Victoria was out of control. Mr Justice Brooking said that it reinforced his view that criminal proceedings in Victoria are in some respects out of control. Let us look at how much so. The proceedings started in September 1993 in the full Federal Court, where Mr Elliott and his coaccused sought to prevent the laying of charges. Then there was a High Court application for special leave. There were 56 sitting days of committal hearings, where ultimately Mr Elliott and others were committed for trial on the basis that there was a prima facie case established; then eight mention hearings in the Supreme Court before trial; and then, as Mr Justice Brooking notes, from 29 January to 22 August 1996, the trial. He notes in brackets: not of course in the sense of trial by jury-that foundation of the system has never been anywhere to be seen. Then there were the ultimate proceedings that I have mentioned today where the Court of Appeal threw out Mr Elliott's legal case that he had asserted at the trial. This means that Mr Elliott has succeeded in getting a directed acquittal from a judge without ever going before a jury. We know that he gave evidence which was entirely inconsistent with his innocence when he was going before the National Crime Authority, ago. and evidence that certainly was inconsistent with that which he asserted later when he had his 'affronted injured innocence', claiming that he was the victim of some conspiracy by the National Crime Authority. We know that his previous business associate Mr Jarrett went to gaol after pleading guilty to these matters. We know that plainly Mr Elliott prepared to lie. He either lied to the National Crime Authority or lied subsequently. We know that we have witnessed one of the greatest corporate frauds in Australia's hisjustify tory, coupled with dishonesty and a contamia nation of the justice system which the VictoriHe an Court of Appeal has rightly recognised, bought by the millions of dollars that John Elliott was able to pay-unlike ordinary defendants-to bring the system to its knees. Why are we not seeing a reopening of the to defend him. investigation by the ASC in these circumstances? Why is it that those concerned with the administration of justice are not querying that a person cannot be subjected to trial after an acquittal in such circumstances? It was an acquittal which was only obtained by direction and without the jury being empanelled, where the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria basically says the trial judge got it entirely wrong. How offensive is it that we saw Mr John Elliott strut around before the parliament's committee, attacking Senator Conroy-who put on the record some of the assertions which are inconsistent with the present account of the truth that Mr Elliott was giving-seeking to say that Senator Conroy was acting improperly? How offensive is it to find that Liberal senators were complicit in seeking to sweep information under the carpet to cover up for this man who, in those circumstances, has so acted? It is plain that Mr Elliott still is a man of immense influence in the Australian Liberal Party. He is a person who is still bringing his malign influence to bear with the Attorney General, who has still not appointed a third member of the National Crime Authority over which the axe still stands. That is an appointment which has been vacant since the Attorney-General took office over 18 months We have a situation where Mr Elliott's attacks on the National Crime Authority have been supported by Premier Kennett in Victoria, notwithstanding the fact that it was the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, under his state's administration, who proceeded with the charges against Mr Elliott and is then maintained this appeal in the Supreme Court, which ultimately succeeded in absolutely shredding any possible defence that Mr Elliott might have contended that went to his argument that he was the victim of conspiracy. He is victim of no conspiracy. is the beneficiary of the most technical of acquittals that is possibly imaginable-an acquittal that does shame to the justice system and does shame to those who would come before this place or anywhere else and seek The argument that the acquittal in some sense speaks for his innocence is about as plausible as the argument that the Spanish court's judgment in relation to Skase is an accurate diagnosis of his state of health. The Australian public sees right through this. They see, as the Australian Institute of Criminology says, that white-collar crime costs this community hundreds of miIlions of dollars every year. We need to find more effective ways of dealing with it. We do not need people who are the luckiest people on the globe walking around this place saying that they were the victims of conspiracy. I think the Australian public would join with Joh Bjelke-Petersen who, when he was speaking of crows and socialists, said, 'If they fly like a crow, squark like a crow and look like a crow, they probably are a crow.' If you use the word 'crook' in the case of John Elliott, most of the Australian public would probably agree and think you are absolutely right. Bruce Highway: Service Centre",80
187,Mr BROUGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise tonight to speak about a section of road in my electorate of Longman: Deception Bay Road on the Bruce Highway through to the Caboolture-Bribie Island exit. It is a piece of road which is seeing enormous growth in its traffic flow due to the incredibly high growth within the communities of Narangba, Burpengary, Morayfield, Caboolture and Bribie Island. The reason I wish to bring this to the House's attention is simply that two state governments, both of different political persuasions, have sought to build a service centre-a service centre capable of handling motor transport such as cars, B-doubles, perhaps even B-triples, and coach traffic-on this section of the highway to obviously provide fuel and the like. The problem is that I think this particular section of road was very poorly thought out by both the previous Labor government and this National-Liberal Party state government. A horrendous number of accidents have occurred on that road. This section of road has no particular part in which it can meet either the national standards or the lower standards set by the state government. In the short time available, I wish to go back through some of the records and just show for the record how this piece of road should never have been determined to seek the needs of a service centre. First, back in 1995 the Queensland government, through the Queensland Department of Transport, wrote to one of the proprietors of a current service station on that road informing him that the road was so busy it was going to have to upgrade it to six lanes. I have no argument with that. This government has had the foresight to put $5 million into the acquisition of land and planning of that project. However, it said to him that safety and traffic flow were key considerations in this upgrading and,as part of that, it was going to have to deny him access to the highway for his service station. Obviously this has a dramatic impact upon a number of service stations on this part of the road. Being a reasonable man, he accepted that because he believes, like I believe, that safety is of the utmost importance and realised that his service station would cease to exist from about the year 2000. The letter also mentioned that it would have to look at unsafe road intersections, delays to through traffic, excessive noise to neighbouring properties, environmental downgrading of the area and conditions contrary to government policy. All of these things seemed to be reasonable at the time. The same gentleman was written to again in response to his letter. Once again I would like to quote, this time from that piece of correspondence. In a letter dated 10 July 1995, the department states: There always is a balance that needs to be made between designing a road for local access and through-traffic carrying functions. The Bruce Highway is part of the National Highway System and any proposal must meet relevant State and National guidelines for safe operation. In the case of the National Highway System, the first priority must be to ensure safe, efficient operations for highway traffic. Current policy is that the National Highway be constructed to an access-limited motorway standard. . The department went on further to make a number of dot points, three of which read: The existing entry and exit ramps near Junction Road do not conform to National Highway Standards because of the following deficiencies: a lengthened highway exit ramp would create a conflict with weaving traffic from the Uhlmann Road entry ramp which is to be constructed; the system does not meet current National Highway standards which require separation between intersections of at least 2 kilometres; and the current access spacing does not permit adequate advanced warning signs for all and exits. Once again, it supports what they have written in their earlier letter. The problem is that this piece of road between the Deception Bay exit and the Caboolture-Bribie Island exit, because of the number of overpasses, has no clear piece of roadway which actually meets these criteria. You need a minimum space of 4.5 kilometres between overpasses to allow such a development to go ahead. There is no section of that road which has a space of 4.5 kilometres. So it begs the question why they are so keen on having it there. If we go a little bit further, they start to change the tune and say, 'We don't have to meet the national highway standards, we can reduce it to 1.5 kilometres,' which obviously reduces the 4.5 kilometre requirement between overpasses. It still does not meet these requirements. So we do not meet the national standards. We do not meet the standards the state government has set forth as being safe. They then put forward a document which says, 'If you don't meet the national standards and if you don't meet the state standards, then we will look at other proposals that will then meet our standards if you have a development which is of a high enough standard.' If you are going to have a development which is of a high class-one which is going to have a MCDonald's, a Hungry Jacks or whatever else and is going to provide parking and all those other wonderful facilities-isn't that jolly, but at the end of the day, if it is going to create havoc in people's lives and deaths on the roads, are we making a horrible mistake here? I put it to the House that we are or, at least, that the state governments, both previous and current, are heading in that direction. This piece of road is not devoid of accidents. The same letter from the transport department in 1996 states: In the past ten years there have been sixty-eight recorded accidents involving southbound vehicles. Thirty-seven of these have occurred at, or within a short distance of, the current entry and exit ramps to the service road system. While not all are related to the ramps, it is clear that they contribute to an entries unsafe and undesirable situation. The point I would like to make to the House and would hope that the state government would take up is that there are some places which simply are not suitable for a service centre. This is a project that will take up several football fields. It will allow double and treble carrying prime movers to come within some 20 to 30 kilometres of the city. It is an area where there are no alternatives, according to the state government departments, for arterials roads to be built to take the short-haul traffic off the roads. So here we have a national highway system which is designed to carry long-haul traffic. We are forced, due to the growing population, to have short-haul traffic of immense proportions-and it is growing so quickly-forced to use this same piece of road. We already have a horrible situation where accidents and deaths have occurred on this stretch of road, yet we insist that we have to build a service centre to cater for trucks and buses. I put it to the state government that they would be best served and they would serve the needs of the population there and the motoring traffic if they elected to have this service centre placed north of the CabooltureBribie Island exit. In doing so they will get rid of that short-haul traffic, the density of the traffic on that section of the road would be halved and it would then cope with the custom it was designed for. Mr Guina, who is a developer, has already purchased land in this area to build such· a centre. His development-and he has numerous of them around Australia-is of a high quality. But anything that impacts upon residential areas, that is looking at enormous traffic flows and that is obviously going to disrupt traffic, both local and interstate, is totally inappropriate. It is my belief that due process has not been followed here and that the state government has looked inappropriately at measures to build such centres. The residents that I represent are more than concerned about this. Mr Steve Barber has worked for several months trying to get both the state minister and the various development organisations to come to the party and to listen to their concerns. The state government has stated in all of its planning requirements that it will deal with the people, that it will listen to their concerns and have consultation, yet earlier this month it called for expressions of interest to build a service centre. Those expressions of interest close on 17 November and at this point there has been no consultation with the residents of Burpengary, who will be most affected. I ask that the state government reconsider. If it needs a service station in this vicinity, all means there may be the means in which to build it, but let us not bring the B-doubles and B-triples into an area which carries shorthaul residential traffic in large quantitiespeople coming to and from work-on what will be a six-lane highway in an area that does not currently meet national standards and does not even meet the standards set by the state government. There must be a better way. I implore the state government to research, to go back to the drawing board, not to accept these expressions of interest and to look further afield to put such a service centre. . Small Business",82
188,Mr ROCHER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Howard government's small business statement More time for business contains a number of initiatives that will bring benefits to the small business community. However, it is unlikely that this package will go anywhere near to realising the coalition's election promise to have the bur-en of complian-e costs on small business dunng the term of thIS parliament. On 19 June 1996, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had this to say about the coalition's commitment to the small business sector: There was no constituency in Australia to which the policies of the coalition in the campaign - ere more directly pitched than the small busmess community. He continued: . . . we believe in the inherent contribution that small business has made and will continue to make to the economic strength of Australia . . . and because we believe very strongly that it is only through a powerful and growing small business sector that a permanent solution to the unemployment problem, particularly amongst the young, will be achieved. The government has made some progress in reducing the burden on small business by the partial exemption from unfair dismissal laws of small businesses with 15 or fewer staff and by way of the minor reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor. The decision to extend capital gains tax rollover relief on the sale of a small business if the proceeds are used for a retirement income or if another like business is purchased is also very worthy of mention. by However, these lesser conditions should not be allowed to camouflage the failure of the government to implement the more significant measures that were recommended to it by its own deregulation task force in its report of November 1996. In answer to my question in the House earlier this year about the number of regulations that impact on small business, the then Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser)-after a couple of tries-was at pai-s to point out that the government was comffiltted to reducing by 50 per cent the overall compliance burden on small business rather than the total number of regulations. In other words, it was the reduction in the aggregate compliance burden that was to be the measu-e of the government's success. Well, the coahtion has a long way to go to meet its own benchmark. As the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, the CCIWA, has made clear in its response to the More time for business report: Whilst numerically speaking the government has agreed to fully or partially implement over half the task force recommendations, it has in fact addressed only a small fraction of the regulatory problems confronting small businesses. The chamber went on to observe that the most important task force. recommendations, those that would have seen a substantial reduction in the burden of compliance, were those relating to tax compliance. If the coalition had been serious about a 50 per cent reduction in the compliance burden, it would have embraced the recommendations of the Bell committee on fringe benefits tax, sales tax and capital gains tax. Instead, the government's insistence that the recommendations be revenue neutral meant that even the 'full implementation of the 62 recommendations ... would not have seen this' - that is, 50 per cent-'target reached', according to the CCIWA. The same opinion was expressed in an editorial in the Business Review Weekly in February last. The editorial read in part: The unanimous view is that a 50 per cent reduction can be achieved only if the legislation that caused the paperwork-primarily tax legislation-is overhauled. Tinkering at the edges . . . will not even come close to achieving the coalition's promised revenue neutral 50 per cent reduction. Even the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report into the tax law improvement project in March 1997, indicated that the cost of compliance for business would not be reduced until all governments committed themselves to a comprehensive review of tax policy. The CCIW A report noted that the coalition deserved criticism for promoting a task force that comprehensively identified the major regulatory burdens faced by the small business sector. What is the value in sponsoring such an expansive report if the critical reform proposals are put in the too hard basket? It was poor judgment on the part of the government to tout a 50 per cent reduction in the compliance burden during the election campaign when its revenue neutral caveat was always part of the plan. The two are mutually exclusive. The reality is that the government would most likely have struggled to meet all the expectations of the small business community anyway. To inflate the hopes of businesses throughout Australia with a promise of a 50 per cent reduction in compliance within three years virtually guaranteed the ire and frustration that have been consistently reflected in small business surveys since the election of the coalition. It is unacceptable that the government continues to assert that it has honoured . its commitment to small business when clearly that is not the case. The government regularly cites two issues as being the most significant to the small business sector. It lists the previous Labor government's unfair dismissal laws as its primary concern and the burden of red tape as its secondary concern. For a government that lobbied small business relentlessly during the last election campaign, its record on both counts leaves much to be desired. The decision to partly exempt small businesses from the unfair dismissal laws is an important one, but if this move is to produce the sorts of lasting productivity gains that the coalition claims one has to wonder why it has not been extended across the whole business sector. Further, unless the federal legislation precludes the states from filling the gap its amendments have created, the changes to unfair dismissal will be of little or no consequence to many small businesses. In March this year the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants released a report that demonstrated that 80 per cent of all small businesses surveyed cited tax reform as what they most wanted to allow them to profit, grow and employ. Yet, of all the deregulation task force recommendations on tax reform, the government has chosen to act on only a few. The CCIWA observes that 'whilst each is welcome to some degree, they do not individually or as a group, represent significant reform'. The changes to fringe benefits tax, including a record-keeping exemption for employers who submit an FBT return in a base year of $5,000 or less will have a 'very limited practical application', according to the CCIW A. The chamber notes that one of the major shortcomings in the government's response to the Bell report is its failure to 'tackle the very considerable compliance problems associated with FBT on meals and car usage, and its refusal to review Australia's unwieldy sales tax system'. The impact of FBT on small business is well known by the coalition and all honourable members. In May 1996 the Institute of Chartered Accountants released a report that listed FBT as the No. 1 federal government regulation that had an adverse impact on small business. In the words of the CCIWA, which represents 5,000 small businesses in Western Australia: The critical issue for small business is not so much the payment of taxation but the difficulties, costs and risks involved in meeting associated administrative demands. Little has changed, despite the government's More time for business package. In addition to its criticisms of the government's small business policies, the CCIWA has been consistent in outlining alternative and, it asserts, more effective approaches to ensure that changes in regulation bring about a substantial net benefit to small businesses. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) would be well advised to take on board some of these criticisms and recommendations. Television Reception: Electorate of Swimming Pool Safety Macleay Valley: Medical Services Child Support Agency",84
189,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do not always feel happy about speaking in the grievance debate because I come to the point where you really are grieving about something that is of importance to a lot of your constituents. The first thing I would like to raise is the question of television reception. Those of us who live in cities or centres where there is perfect television reception do not realise what a problem it can be in many isolated areas of this country. For my electorate of Cowper, I would like to make a plea to the National Transmission Agency through the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) to consider the possibility of installing a translator on Mount Yarrahappini. There are transmissions coming from Mount Moombil, but there are many valleys going into the Great Dividing Range-wonderful places to live, but the topography means they get virtually no television reception whatsoever. Mount Yarrahappini is certainly used to transmit radio and I believe it could be a strong possibility for a TV translator. I have it on very good authority from a constituent of mine, Phillip Lane, who installs antennas all over that area, that places like Taylors Arm and Burrapine, Thumb Creek, Talarrn, North Arm, South Arm, out to Bowraville, Missabotti, Stuarts Point, some of the Macleay Valley and some of Nambucca Heads cannot get satisfactory TV reception. I would just like to make the plea that the NTA and the minister might consider some form of investigation into whether we can get transmission there. The second thing I would like to raise concerns something I spoke about five years ago, on 10 September 1992. At that time. I spoke about a very brave young man who was 19 then, Tony Leggett, from South West Rocks. He was a student at ANV. He dived into the pool in Canberra and happened to break his neck. He is a quadriplegic. He is a Cowper bright young man. As I said five years ago, he has got an indomitable spirit and he will survive-so much so that even though he is still a quadriplegic he has moved to Sydney and is doing a psychology degree, which I think is fantastic. The point I would like to make is that when I spoke five years ago I had been into the Canberra pool and at the shallow end there was no sign saying it was shallow. At many pools it is quite obvious which is the shallow end, but there are some around this country, and Canberra is one of them, where you cannot tell the depth, which is why he broke his neck. In a recent letter to me he makes the point: While it is most likely that ninety-nine percent of the time it is quite obvious which end is the shallow I would like to see that one in a hundred chance [of disaster] eliminated. Like Tony, I certainly agree with that. I was at the pool today and there is still no sign saying, 'This is the shallow end.' There were signs saying, 'Slow lane', 'Fast lane'. If they can put a sign up to say the speed of swimmers in each lane, surely there can be a clear indication that one end is the shallow end. This should happen not only at the Canberra pool-I am not just picking on them, for this is' where Tony broke his neck-but right around Australia. At pools where it is not immediately clear from the visual appearance which is the shallow end, there must be a sign. 1 say to all governments of Australia that we should do something about signpostinRswimming pools at the shallow end. Even one young life blighted into paraplegia or quadriplegia is too high a price to pay compared with the cost of a few signs. The third point I wanted to raise concerns the services of doctors in part of my electorate in the Macleay Valley, which is an incredibly beautiful valley. The local government headquarters is in Kempsey on the Macleay river itself. In the area are lovely places like South West Rocks, Hat Head, Crescent Head and a rainforest hinterland. It really is beautiful. But we have a situation of approaching crisis in the supply of GPs and specialists. I quote from a recent article in the Macleay Argus headed 'Kempsey to lose four GPS': Kempsey hospital will lose four of its six staff doctors within two weeksF-ur out of six goneGeneral rounds of the 11O-bed hospitalnot just a little village hospital, but 110 bedswill be covered by the two full-time staff doctors and one part-time doctor until replacement doctors are appointed . . . But where are the replacement doctors to come from? I know full well that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is really concerned about this and I know that the government is taking whatever action it can. But I need to take this opportunity to highlight to the parliament that we are not talking about outback Australia. This is on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, one of the fastest growing areas of Australia and one of the most closely settled, and we have this virtual crisis. As Mid-North Coast Area Health Services director of operations, Jeff Pattinson said: We are in the process of trying to recruit doctors ... we've been advertising for quite a while. But there has been nothing in the way of responses. They are: . . . trying to find two consultant obstetricians and a specialist anaesthetist to replace specialists who have left the hospital in the last two years. You go down the river to beautiful South West Rocks and we have a situation there where one of the local doctors is planning to close his practice if he cannot replace somebody who is leaving him shortly. He is working virtually seven days a week. He is on call every second night. He starts early in the morning and he finishes late at night. He has already said that he cannot take any new patients. He is concerned with the holiday season coming on that he will not be able to service holidaymakers who need medical treatment. This is in a beautiful place, South West Rocks. The citizens of that area are just as concerned as I am. We have a very high retired population and those people are naturally very concerned that their medical service should continue. So I would just like to assure the parliament I will be doing everything I can, as I know the Minister for Health will be full-time doing, to help solve that problem. The last point I want to raise concerns the Child Support Act. I have a close relationship with an organisation called DADs, which is Dads Against Discrimination. They have written to me saying that the fundamental flaw in the act as it currently stands is that it offers no incentive for a payer to work harder when most, if not all, the extra income goes in tax and maintenance. It also encourages payers on marginal incomes to become unemployed. Every member of this place knows that that is a true statement. We all know of people who have left their employment because the child support payment was so great it was not worth their while to stay in work. One of the things they say is that they believe we should allow payers to claim children from their second families as dependents for Child Support Agency purposes on the same criteria as they can be claimed for social security purposes. I think that is a very sensible and reasonable suggestion. Again, they say the philosophy of the legislation appears to be that the payer will pay no matter what. Unfortunately, the 'what' includes the right to properly feed and clothe themselves and their children on contact visits, to provide suitable accommodation and quality of life for the children when they are with them, the ability to rebuild their own lives and so on. The other point they make is that although it is called DADs it is important to remember that this is not a gender issue. This is not about men against women. There are 44,528 women across Australia who are actually paying child support maintenance. I would like to read part of a letter I have received from one of my constituents, which states: I firmly believe in paying child support to assist our children. It is a basic responsibility as a parent, but why can't the CSA formula be more fair and equitable and why doesn't the CSA listen to both parents. The paying parent is paying the money but has no rights. Like many non-custodial parents I am unable to make a new life for myself. I just can't afford it. I am financially unable to become involved in a relationship with anyone as I can't afford the expense of ""going out"". This constituent writing in this way is a woman. She is one of those 44,OOO-odd women who are actually paying child maintenance. She asks three very important questions: why is the CSA formula based on gross wages? Why doesn't the formula take into account both parents' true and proven living expenses? Why can't child support be means tested once the custodial parent remarries or lives de facto?

193,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This is the fourth occasion during the course of this parliament on which the Public Accounts Committee has been asked by the House to review bills. On each occasion the committee has been frustrated by the lack of time in which to carry out this task. However, I acknowledge the motions moved by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) allowing the JCPA two extensions of time of its original reporting period. The Public Service Bill is a very significant piece of legislation because it introduces new public service legislation after 75 years. It redefines the nature of the Public Service legislation and it embodies a new conceptual framework for public sector management. Notwithstanding the significance of the bill, I am allocated only five minutes to speak on 1996 the findings and conclusions of this important review. All other members who wish to speak have only 10 minutes between them to do so. This does not reflect well on the proper use of this chamber. While the JCPA supports the need for the 1922 act to be replaced and favours simplification, modernisation and the more accessible format of the bill, the review has identified a number of areas where improvements can be made. In the brief time available to me today I will highlight some of those areas. Firstly, let me say that the committee strongly agrees with the commitment given by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in his second reading speech that merit will remain a cornerstone of Public Service employment. In support of this, the committee believes that the definition of 'merit' should not be relegated to subordinate legislation as it is proposed but should be enshrined in the bill itself. The committee is pleased to say that the APS values have been spelt out in the bill. In some cases, however, the values do not go far enough. For example, values require that advice given by APS employees will be timely. The committee believes that advice needs to be more than timely. It needs to be frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate as well as timely. The committee therefore recommends that reference to these qualities be included in the values clause. On the issue of workplace diversity, the committee has made a number of recommendations about the reporting requirements for workplace diversity programs, which we believe will ensure that the programs fulfil their goals of ensuring that the APS is free from discrimination and recognises the diverse backgrounds of APS employees. On the issue of protection for whistlehlowers, the committee believes that there are considerable limitations to any whistleblower protection scheme being based within the Public Service Bill. No-one could argue that a public servant who discovered a fraud and exposed it was doing other than his or her duty. As things stand now, a departmental officer who exposes a fraud may be in contravention of the Crimes Act. If there were a proper procedure for a public servant who found fraud to report it through properly authorised channels and with appropriate protection, there would be less reason for a public servant to leak it by downloading departmental files, by informing the press or by any other means, as members would be aware given the events of the past week. The committee has recommended that the government should consider introducing whistleblower protection along similar lines to that which already exists for the public sector in other Australian jurisdictions. Were such legislation to be introduced, the whistleblowers clause should be removed from the Public Service Bill. Perhaps the most contentious clause in the bill was clause 33 which entitles an APS employee to a review of any APS action which relates to his or her employment. The committee found a high level of dissatisfaction with the proposed regulations as set out in the draft subordinate legislation. This dissatisfaction stems partly from the very detailed nature of the draft regulations which were considered by many witnesses to be confusing and partly from the role given to the Public Service Commissioner. There is a perception that the commissioner lacks independence in reviewing APS employment decisions. A review mechanism which builds on the current model of a separate statutory officer within the structure of the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission may offer a more independent review process than is proposed. In the JCPA's view, such a separation seems a sensible solution to a very complex issue. I should mention that the review revealed a number of issues on which JCPA members could not agree. These differences of opinion, which were the result, fundamentally, of divergent policy approaches, are highlighted in the report for the information of members and senators. On behalf of the committee, I extend our appreciation for the assistance given to this review by all who provided submissions and gave evidence at public hearings. I am personally indebted to my colleagues on the committee who dedicated so much time and effort to completing this review in the short time available to us. I would like to thank the Public Service Commissioner for agreeing to make one of his senior officers, Richard Collis, available to assist the committee and the secretariat in its review. As is usually the case, the secretariat of the JCPA has performed magnificently in a very short time frame to produce a first class report. I commend Gillian Gould particularly and every member of the secretariat who has been involved in the past few days in making sure we met this deadline. I commend the report to the House.",88
194,Mr BEDDALL,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I rise to add my remarks to the report of the inquiry of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Public Service Bill 1997. It is intended that the provision of the bill will enable the public sector to be placed on a similar footing to the private sector. The key component of this is the increase in power to the secretaries of departments and agency heads to have employment power in their own right. Essentially, we will see a radical change in the Australian Public Service. The bill aims to simplify the 1922 act and incorporates into the public sector the government's controversial industrial relations changes. The opposition acknowledges that it made significant changes to the Public Service when in government, but these changes go far beyond anything we had envisaged at that time. The overall effect will be to create a Public Service which is more easily influenced by the government of the day and less willing to offer critical advice. As has been mentioned, the Prime Minister and ministers will be able to negotiate salary and conditions for agency heads which will not be subject to public scrutiny. In tum, agency heads will have the power to hire and fire and determine salary conditions for agency employees. The committee accepted that placing necessary employment powers with agency heads is consistent with the government's broader policy on workplace relations. The APS will become less of a career service and the culture of the service will be radically different. The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act is being repealed and with it all the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. The procedures which will replace them are in-house, which is likely to lead to increased litigation. The committee strongly supports the principle that merit continues to be the primary basis for employment decisions in the APS. I would like to make some remarks regarding whistleblowers. A number of serious weaknesses have been identified in the schemes established by clause 16 of the bill. Although the committee felt that it was limited in the sorts of recommendations that it could make, I support the remarks that it would be preferable for the government to introduce whistleblower legislation along similar lines to that in other Australian jurisdictions. This is clearly an area which demands due attention and where protection ought to be strengthened. With all these changes, committee members differed in their view on how radical a change the bill represents. With many of these changes, we will see severe repercussions for the Public Service. Many of these changes will constitute significant departures from current practice. There has been a lot of concern expressed that the changes could lead to the Public Service being less prepared to give full and frank advice to ministers and agency heads. These concerns expressed by a number of witnesses need to be taken seriously. If a trend arises, then the government will need to revisit the issue. No doubt there will continue to be much debate over the future of the Australian Public Service as a result of this bill. I also put on record my appreciation of the secretariat's support.",90
195,Mr GEORGIOU,COMMITTEES,"Kooyong) (6.06 p.m.)by leave-The Public Service Bill is a piece of legislation which is of fundamental importance to the government of Australia and its administration. It is designed to supplant the Public Service Act 1922 which, for much of its existence, has served Australia well and provided us with a Public Service of high quality and commitment. However, there is a universal consensus that the 1922 act is not adequate for the demands of taking us into the 21st century. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts does support the need for the 1922 act to be replaced and it favours the simplification, modernisation and more accessible format of this bill. In its review, the committee has identified a series of areas where improvements can be made. In the very limited time available to me, I would like to focus on one particular improvement responding to a particular concern about the bill-namely, its impact on the provision of strong and effective advice by secretaries who, when I was younger, used to be called permanent heads and who in the future will be called agency heads. I do not believe that the significance of permanent heads, secretaries or agency heads can be overestimated. The contribution they make in terms of advice to ministers, the running of the departments and the delivery of public policies and programs is vital. Given this, I did look very seriously at the concern about secretaries' tenure impacting on their advice. This concern was most dramatically put by Sir Lennox Hewitt, who sees the provisions as destroying 'frank, fearless and honest advice'. I believe that this is excessive, but I also believe that there are some problems in the Public Service Commissioner's statement that advice is not a matter of tenure but of character. Character may not in a sense be paramount, but it is rather easier to give vent to one's character when one's professional survival is not at stake. But the fact isalthough one would not have recollected it from hearing the previous speaker, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall)that the current system of contract employment for secretaries is not something that this bill will introduce. It was instituted by Labor in 1993. There is a change in the formalities of appointing and terminating agency heads, and the committee did accept that the 'approach proposed by the bill reflects the reality that such matters rest with the Prime Minister of the day and, therefore, supports the proposed changes'. Nonetheless, strong and effective advice is of paramount importance and the committee has recommended that the Public Service values should embody a provision highlighting the commitment owed by the Public Service to frank, honest, comprehensive, accurate and timely advice. I believe this is important not only for the agency heads but also for the Public Service as a whole and for the public's view of the Public Service. As the report makes clear, the request by the government for the JCPA to report on such a significant bill in such a brief time was very demanding of the committee, and particularly so of the secretariat which did a superb job in preparing a draft of the report. I do commend the report to the House.",90
196,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I agree with the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) that the Public Service Bill is a very significant piece of legislation in terms of the future management of the Australian Public Service. In the brief time available to me today, I will concentrate on a number of the matters identified by the JCPA in its review of the bill as areas where improvements can be made. Firstly, while applauding the inclusion in the legislation of the APS values, the committee believes that some of the values need to be strengthened. Others have already noted the committee's concern that advice given by APS employees needs to be more than timely and our recommendation that the words 'frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate' be added in this value. Another of the values refers to accountability but does not say whom the APS is accountable to. The committee has also recommended that this value be amended so that it clearly states that the APS is accountable 'within the framework of ministerial responsibility, to government, the parliament and the public' . The member for Fairfax has already referred to the committee's recommendations in relation to merit and workplace diversity programs. In relation to merit, the committee believes that the inclusion of a clear and unambiguous definition of merit in the bill itself rather than in subordinate legislation will enhance community understanding of the importance of the merit principle in APS employment decisions. The committee has suggested a definition for inclusion in the bill which is based on the commonly accepted that CCH Australian and New Zealand Equal Opportunity Law and Practice definition. In relation to workplace diversity, the bill places the onus squarely on agency heads develop workplace diversity programs. committee's recommendations address the second reading. issue of the proper evaluation of these programs by agencies to ensure a focus outcomes and on enhancing the role of the Public Service Commissioner in monitoring agency programs. On the issue of the parliamentary departments, the committee has supported the creation of a separate parliamentary established under its own legislation. However, the committee also believes it is essential that reciprocal mobility arrangements introduced which will allow merit between the APS and the parliamentary service and for portability of relevant entitleview ments. The committee has also made recommendations in relation to the situation employees who wish to take up employment on the staff of members of parliament and other statutory appointments. I would like to mention briefly the question of subordinate legislation and the various regulations around the question of the operation of this bill. One thing that I think the committee found unsatisfactory was the very short period of time we had to consider those issues. Frankly, that in itself hampered a proper consideration of the bill. Finally, I would also like to echo the concerns expressed by the member for Fairfax and others about the inadequate amount of time that the committee was given to underI take this review and the limited amount time that has been allocated to speak about the committee's report. The fact is this is the first bill in this parliament where this committee has been given a very short period of time to consider major legislation. That, itself, is a problem that I think the governwar ment needs to think about because it is personnel impacting on the capacity of the committee properly to consider issues in the time. I will have more to say on this bill in consideration stage as it is passed through House. I would like to thank the JCPA staff and my colleagues on the committee for what I think was in difficult times a rather consimilar structive relationship. I am sure it will be the to situation where some of the differences are The highlighted more in the question of the on VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND COMPENSATION MEASURES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 September, on service motion by Mr Bruce Scott: That the bill be now read a second time. be upon which Mr Laurie Ferguson moved by for movement on way of amendment. That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second of APS reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its confused, secretive and inconsistent handling of repatriation benefits and awards for overseas service; (2) believes the Government should extend qualifying service status to personnel at RAAF Ubon Thailand from June 1965 to August 1968 and to RAN ships that served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan emergency; and (3) recommends that the Government should restore entitlements to Vietnam naval logistical support personnel for the journey to and from Australia and Vietnam"".",91
197,Mr NAIRN,COMMITTEES,"Eden-Monaro) (6.13 p.m.)When the debate was adjourned on Thursday, was giving some background to the bill in of relation to the various categories where pensions and benefits were applicable. I not referred to the two categories of operational service and qualifying service and I explained that 'operational service' refers to service in overseas in a clearly defined area during a or similar operation. Under this category, are eligible for a disability pension for injuries, disease or death where it can be fullness of attributed to that service. The second category is qualifying service. the Qualifying service entitles personnel to the this most comprehensive benefits. To be eligible, the service must not only have been overseas in a clearly defined area during a war or operation but also must have incurred danger from hostile forces. Under this category, personnel are entitled to a disability pension for injuries, disease or death due to their service, plus the income and assets tested service pension. Before the last election, we promised to review the circumstances of entitlements. That was done as a joint Veterans' Affairs and Department of Defence exercise, resulting in a report entitled A review of service entitlement anomalies. That report was considered by cabinet and thus we have this bill we are now debating. I heard in the debate last Thursday the opposition spokesperson on veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), complaining that the review was not all to his liking. I found it interesting the Labor Party were in government for 13 years, but what did they do in this area? Absolutely nothing. And it was not as if they would not have known that some changes were necessary. In just the 18 months I have been the member for Eden-Monaro, I have had numerous representations related to the issues addressed in this bill. I am sure my predecessor and the former Labor government had similar representations, but they sat on their hands and did nothing. Or was this yet another task they had earmarked for the 14th year? By gee, they would have had a busy time if they had been given a 14th year, wouldn't they? Time and time again, we have had those opposite jumping up and down about things they should have done while they were in government, and here we have yet another example. This bill does address a number of the inequities that existed. The new areas that will be regarded as operational service are the British Commonwealth occupation force in Japan, 3 January 1949 to 30 June 1951; Singapore during the Malayan Emergency, 29 June 1950 to 31 August 1957; the Far East Strategic Reserve of the Navy, 2 July 1955 to 27 May 1963; the demilitarised zone in Korea, 19 April 1956 onwards; HMAS ships Vampire and Quickmatch in Vietnam, 25 January 1962 to 29 January 1962; and northeast Thailand, including Ubon, 31 May 1962 to 31 August 1968. These are all well qualified to be included, and the many service personnel involved in each of these events will be relieved and grateful for these changes. North-east Thailand, including Ubon, is one that I had a fairly recent representation on. Mr Lyle Barker, of Narooma in my electorate, came to see me about the possible recognition of Ubon. He was a member of 79 Squadron stationed there and he related to me how, from 1965 through to 1968, Ubon air base was used by the US as a base from which to operate bombing runs into Vietnam. Planes from the US were coming and going at all hours of the day, and Mr Barker recalls very vividly all that went with such wartime that operations, as our troops were living on the base. I do not recall him telling me that the base was ever attacked during that time, but clearly this would be known by others. However, I assume it was not, as this bill includes this area as operational service not qualifying service. The clear distinction for all areas already included is that, for qualifying service, the personnel would have had to have incurred danger from hostile forces. That not being the case, operational service is the correct category. Similar supporting stories can apply to the other five categories that are being included, and I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) for their inclusion. As I said earlier, I have a large number of veterans in my electorate and they will welcome these changes. Besides some of the individual representations I have had, I know that these matters have been raised within the Returned Services League, the RSL. A person whom I and my office keep in touch with in this regard is Bill Davidson who also lives near Narooma. Bill does an excellent job representing veterans all over the south-east of New South Wales, and I commend him for his work. I have been involved with Bill in numerous sub-branches of the RSL in a variety of ways. More recently, I worked with him on the upgrade of war memorials, a program that was given funding by the minister in the last budget. It is a program that has been well received throughout Eden-Monaro in quite number of smaller communities that really find it difficult to scrape together those small amounts of money-and often it is only $1,000 or $2,000-to improve their memoriaround as. They have now been able to do so, and I commend the program that the minister introduced. I digress slightly from this bill in making those comments about the very positive things we are doing in veterans' affairs right across the board. Bill Davidson is very aware of sorts of matters contained in this bill because his members talk to him. He would be speaker pleased that these changes are finally occurthose ring. The other two amendments in this bill are, I believe, reasonably straightforward. Firstly, there is an extension of the $500 dollar sum advance to include not only service pensioners and income support supplement receivers but also those on a disability pensure sion and war widow or widower's pension under the act. The second matter, which will give protecmany tion to the Commonwealth in a liability sense, is that any death, incapacity or injury solely due to a serviceman or woman taking up smoking and using tobacco products after December 1997 or increasing the amount of cigarettes or other tobacco products used after 31 December 1997 will not be able to be blamed on the Commonwealth. I think this measure is self-explanatory and quite reasonbeing able under the circumstances. What I want to say in addition to what I all. said last Thursday in this debate is that the opposition spokesperson on veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Reid, contributed some sensible comments to the debate. I am sure a number of the matters he raised will checked and responded to by the minister before this bill is approved. But the good work in his contribution was unfortunately eliminated by his totally out of order attack the words he used in what can only be called his so-called amendment. I really cannot believe that he honestly condemns the government for what we are doing with this bill. Given he was part of former Labor government, he ought to feel a quite embarrassed that they never got around to recognising the service people whom we are effectively recognising in this bill. I know the Labor Party was probably going to get to that in their 14th year in government, but that is still no excuse. Rather than condemning this government for this excellent bill, they should be applauding our action and apologising for the fact that they were too slack to get around to it. Or they should admit that, while they were in government, veterans the did not rate too highly on their agenda. I support this bill. I notice that there is no available to continue the debate, but were the only comments that I had to add to my comments last week. I certainly support this bill right across the board and I reject the ungracious amendment that the lump member for Reid has moved. I look forward to some of the further comments that might be made in relation to his comments. I am that this bill will be passed with the full support of both sides of the House, because I think it is vitally important that we continue to recognise the excellent service that so people have given in a variety of ways. Often it is only with the passage of time that due recognition is totally understood in 31 a number of things that at the time did not seem like big events; well after the event they are seen in a different light. That is exactly the situation with a number of matters that have been raised in this bill and are now corrected after a very long period of time. I will leave my comments there. It is an excellent bill, which should be supported by",92
198,Unknown,COMMITTEES,Sitting suspended from 6.24 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.,94
199,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"I rise to be support the opposition's amendments to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997 . There are many issues raised in this in bill. The part that I am most interested in is related to the navy forces that were active during the Malayan emergency. On Monday last, my motion to have the House note that members of the Royal Austhe tralian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 was debated. It was made clear that navy personnel are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits for active service under the veterans' entitlements act. I asked, amongst other things, that these service personnel be recognised as having been allocated for duty in the Malayan theatre as per the letter from the Department of Navy to the Treasury of 11 November, 1955. This stated that: the date on which RAN ships were allotted for duty as the RAN component of the Strategic Reserve was I July, 1955. While I am happy that this government has taken note of the grave concerns of these veterans, and I welcome the budget concessions that were made granting operational service status involving access to disability pension and defence service home loans, it still treats our naval personnel less favourably than the army and air force counterparts. That is a real problem and bugbear for these ex-service men and women. It is really not enough. It really raises the question: on what basis was this decision made? Being granted operational status for access to those parts that I have mentioned means that they were in hazardous service and therefore would have been in danger from hostile forces. I also note from a. speech made by the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) when he spoke on my motion last week that he also believed that these forces were in a war zone. He stated that: the Far East Strategic Reserve did incur risk beyond that of normal peace time conditions. I agree entirely with him. They did. He gave parliament a nice bit of history in saying that the Reserve was established to defend Malaya, Singapore and their surrounding waters froni external communist aggression and that its secondary role was to assist in suppressing communist insurgency within Malaya, which also implied hazardous conditions. I am sure the member for Riverina would gain some Tuck-budt brownie points for pointing this out. I am sure there is a lot of merit in his speech, as you would be well aware, Madam Deputy Speaker. This emergency that took place in Malaysia was one of those wars that you have when you are not having a war. So they called it an emergency and said, 'This isn't a war.' I have read descriptions of why that was so. I think Churchill was still around in England in those days and did not want to have to' pay compensation to tin mines and other things. Calling it an emergency prevents the veterans of that campaign from gaining recognition of service at the time. The navy personnel are the ones that missed out-and they have missed out all together right through. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has found no written reasons for RAN exclusion in the act. They have not been able to find the reasons for these ex-servicemen being excluded from their entitlements. It appears that veterans who were allocated for operational service from July 1 1955 were then secretly unallocated to enable excluding legislation to be introduced. That seems to be what happened some years ago. The personnel were subjected to similar dangers to all other Australians serving overseas on active service. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications. So they were participating in all the fundamental acts of war that we would send our service people to. One of those veterans, Mr Bob Gibbs of Lilydale, Victoria, puts it this way when discussing this issue with many of us: ... those involved in the RAN bombardments of Malaya might think that if they were not on active service when they were trying to kill people while bombarding a foreign country, they would be war criminals or pirates. I think that Bob Gibbs has probably summed it up pretty well. To continue with what he said: Navy Office has decided that you have been in active service at the time of bombardment but you were not when the guns stopped firingthis is incredible stuffWhich means an infantry man is only on active service whilst shooting at an enemy, but not when he stops shooting or is being shot at. It is an incredible interpretation that has gone on for so long. It really is a nonsense. It is plain that it is a nonsense to retrospectively remove their reason for being in the area during the emergency. There were also RAN casualties; none of these appear on the roll of honour at the Australian War Memorial. That, I feel, is a very sad state of affairs. Hopefully, some time in the future that might be dealt with. While these changes to the act at least recognise the service these people have given, it is a mystery that they are not entitled to their full benefits. The act lists the overseas deployments regarded as operational service. This bill adds six new areas: the British Commonwealth Occupational Forces, Japan, 3 January 1949 to 30 June 1951 inclusive; Singapore during the Malayan Emergency, 29 June 1950 to 31 August 1957 inclusive; the Far East Strategic Reserve, Navy, 2 July 1955 to 27 May 1963 inclusive; the demilitarised zone, Korea, 29 April 1956 and onwards from that date; HMAS ships Vampire and Quickmatch, Vietnam, 25 January 1962 to 29 January 1962 inclusive; and north-east Thailand, including Ubon operational airport, 21 May 1962 to 31 August 1968 inclusive. The joint departmental report recommended that these operations be classified as equivalent to 'hazardous' service rather than 'operational' service. They qualify this by acknowledging that the same benefits would be paid under either definition. I am pleased to see the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) listening intently. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting",94
200,Mr ADAMS,COMMITTEES,"Just listen to what I am saying, Minister. What is not clear is whether 'hazardous' is considered under the definition as being 'warlike' conditions. They talk of the standard definition of warlike as being: ... those military activities where the application of force is authorised to pursue military objectives and there is an expectation of casualties. These definitions are important because they determine what additional allowances are payable for particular overseas deployments. By adopting the definitions 'warlike' and 'non-warlike', the Department of Veterans' Affairs is arguing that a determination by the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) automatically flows on to repatriation benefits without the need to further amend the veterans' act, although parliament will no longer have the opportunity to scrutinise additions to the operational list. As I read the legislation, it is quite within the power of the minister to make a decision to award full benefits to those people who have experienced service in a warlike zone. Therefore, as I read the proposed legislation, the minister will now have the power to grant full benefits to those navy personnel who served in the Far East Strategic Reserve in the navy between 2 July 1955 and 27 May 1963. There has been a lot of research carried out on this issue, particularly by some of the service personnel involved. Whatever is achieved, the work of Noel Payne and Bob Gibbs, who have been particularly energetic in ensuring that members of parliament have the full story, should be recognised. They should be rewarded for their efforts with a good decision by the minister. The work that they have done is excellent, and it has been done on behalf of their fellow ex-service personnel. My contacts in Tasmania have also been very helpful. I include Leo O'Donnell of New Norfolk, Joe Charlton of Devon Hills and other members of the Malayan and Borneo Veterans Association of Australia. All have approached me for support and to present petitions to the parliament. They have all been very active in endeavouring to get this issue before the parliament and the act amended. Both the Speaker (Mr Halverson) and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) have expressed support for a greater commitment to these veterans through that association. Senator Newman was particularly interested in a copy of a document signed by the Governor General of the day decreeing that all three services were posted to Malaya during the time period discussed and were on 'active service'. That document was taken by her to a meeting with some of the local members of the MABVA. It seems that the Liberal government has really been inconsistent in its dealings with this bill. Many of the answers people received were contradictory and secretive. No-one knew exactly what was in the bill and what the bill was going to deliver until the last minute. What we do know is that it is not going to give the navy veterans of the Malayan Emergency the full benefits to which they are entitled. I believe that the amendment put in by. the opposition is vital in having these people properly recognised. The amendment includes granting of qualifying service status for service at the RAAF Ubon station from June 1965 to August 1968; supporting the granting of qualifying service status for the RAN ships which served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency; and condemning the reduction of entitlements to Vietnam naval logistic support personnel. There were some 15 RAN ships which saw service with the Far East Strategic Reserve, involving 35 separate deployments. Some RAN personnel involved are covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act due to operational service in other campaigns in which they were involved. The department reckons that approximately 5,000 RAN personnel are newly eligible for assistance. If this bill is amended then many of them will be assisted for the first time. It was interesting to note that the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) informed the House in question time last week that the AASM would now be presented to those eligible who served in the Malayan emergency. However, this was a complete muddle because it was not what the veterans of that navy campaign requested. They asked to be treated in the same way as their counterparts in the air force and the army. Noel Payne of Nerang in Queensland wrote a letter which was published in the letters to the editor section of the Australian on Friday, 26 September 1997. It is headed 'Navy veterans of Malaya betrayed over decorations'. In the letter, Noel Payne says: DEFENCE Industry Science and Personnel Minister Bronwyn Bishop has announced the awarding of the Australian Active Again she has betrayed the navy veterans of the Malayan emergency (war). The army and the RAAF people who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960, now have two medals for their service. The navy men who were there at the same time, bombarding the shoreline, patrolling the coast and setting up a naval blockade, have nothing. The minister and her department said they would not issue the Imperial award because the British had 'advised that they could not confirm eligibility of Australian ships, Mrs Bishop knows that these men were there. She approved the Budget changes that acknowledges they were on operational service. She now has the opportunity to award an Australian medal, but has declined, preferring the previous British advice. The pity is that Mrs Bishop prefers taking this advice (which she will not show anybody) over the awarding of an Australian medal to all those Australians who deserve it. Malaya remains the only war after which members of only two of the three services that took part were rewarded by medals. I believe that that is an example of muddling through, making mistakes, not knowing how to treat this matter and being very secretive. I understand that a review was conducted at which there were no community representatives and the review team did not invite submissions. There were people who would have liked to put their views before that review committee. The review was conducted very secretively. The minister has handled this very inconsistently and very secretively. I believe that people are entitled to be recognised for the service they gave this country many years ago during that emergency which Australia was involved in. There has been a constant effort to deny the people who served in the navy contingent the same benefits, the same entitlements, the same recognition for their service as the service personnel from the RAAF and the army received. There is no doubt that the navy personnel were involved in bombardments, in attacking the mainland of Malaya and in intercepting information from the enemy. They were in a war zone-although the area was never actually declared a war zone for some strange reasons which were probably political. There has been some speculation on that over the Service Medal. years by some writers. If the government were to pick up the opposition's amendments it would certainly resolve some of these issues. I hope the government will do that. If it could do so, it would be a better bill. I support the general thrust of the bill because it improves some veterans' entitlements, gives some new veterans recognition and generally improves the lot of veterans. However, as I said, I ask that opposition amendment be incorporated in the bill to ensure that those who have waited so long for some recognition finally receIve the recognition they request and deserve from the people of Australia.",96
201,Mrs WEST,COMMITTEES,"The second budget of the Howard government was further evidence that this government cares for veterans and their families. It is proof positive that all members of this government see the need to look after those who looked after us. The government has put in place many programs to honour our returned service men and women, including the highly successful four-year 'Their Service-Our Heritage' commemorative program. This program-and I was honoured to be part of the Queensland state launch at the Redlands RSL in my electorate of Bowman-honours those who fought so valiantly to preserve life and freedom we enjoy in this country today. The real beauty of this program is its educational aspect. The Queensland launch coincided with Redlands RSL's education week. During that week the RSL invited local schools to bring their children to the club to view the many displays. The launch of the 'Their Service-Our Heritage' program allowed us to display the magnificent timeline board, which became a feature of the RSL's education week. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997, which we are debating tonight, goes further than just honouring the memory of our brave soldiers. It provides still living veterans with some much needed assistance. There are a number of aspects to this bill which will provide direct monetary assistance to a large number of veterans. The first of these measures is the move by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) to extend eligibility for disability pensions and access to repatriation health care arrangements. This means a further 10,500 veterans will be eligible. It also means some veterans will benefit by gaining eligibility for the service and defence service home loans. the This is not something that has been dreamt up overnight. These measures were outlined prior to the 2 March election of last year in the coalition's election policy statement 'Lest we forget'. Once these measures are passed, it will be yet another election promise fulfilled by the Howard government. By extending the eligibility for these benefits, the government has included a number of veterans previously ignored. They include veterans who had seagoing naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve between 1955 and 1963, veterans who served in north-east Thailand between 1962 and 1968, and veterans who served in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupational Forces between 1949 and 1951. This list is by no means exhaustive and goes on to include embassy guards and RAAF personnel who served in Vietnam between 1973 and 1975 and those who served in the demilitarised zone in Korea the standard of from 1956 onwards. Further to this, the bill allows for an automatic extension of eligibility for rehabilitation benefits to veterans for any overseas operational service determined to be warlike or non-warlike by the Minister for Defence. Again, this measure is being introduced as a result of the coalition's promise to review eligibility due to the perceived anomalies in the system. The new warlike and non-warlike classification system will ensure greater certainty for veterans and guarantee that the link between repatriation benefits and the nature of service is retained for any future overseas deployments. This will no doubt address the problems of further anomalies arising. The need for these changes is obvious. Like many of the acts this government is attempting to amend, this is an unwieldy piece of legislation that is confusing for all but those few experts who make it their life's work to write official documents in such a way that common folk cannot understand them. This specific subsection consists of 17 paragraphs which seem to follow no set path. Many are subject to later subsections, forcing the reader to flip backwards and forwards in an effort to make any sense out of the legislation. So the government is not only widening the eligibility but also making sure that those who are eligible do not need to be Rhodes scholars to realise it. A further benefit of this bill is that it will allow all disability pensioners, war widow and war widower pensioners access to a lump sum advance of their pension up to a maximum of $500 a year. In the past, this advance has been made available to only those on income support pensions. The amendments moved by the minister in relation to this bill will have an effect not only on the Veterans' Entitlements Act but also on the Social Security Act. They will provide a better link between services currently provided under these acts. One such change will link a veteran's eligibility for treatment at the department's expense to the pension calculation process. Presently this is done through separate income and assets tests. This will avoid the situation where a person may lose their entitlement to treatment at departmental expense should they have a small increase in their pension. Another change with regard to the DSS will be the transfer of carer service pensioners and carer income support supplement recipients from Veterans' Affairs to Social Security. When this change was first mooted, the Department of Veterans' Affairs paid carer pensions to only 100 people, while DSS paid more than 24,000 carers. Since first announcing this change, approximately half of the 100 carers with Veterans' Affairs have preempted the government's actions and transferred to DSS. It is important to stress that those transferring to DSS will not be financially disadvantaged. The department has advised that there is a small number of Veterans' Affairs pensioners who could be adversely affected by the transfer, and they will remain with Veterans' Affairs. I am sure those on the opposition benches will object to this aspect, but that is nothing new. By transferring the payments, all the government is proposing is that one department, instead of two, handles carer payments. It just means one less department for the veterans and their carers to deal with. Surely that should be seen as a good thing. While they are at the new Centrelink, the onestop shop, they will be able to take care of all other social security problems which they may have. The final aspect of this bill on which I will comment is the changes to the repatriation system with regard to the use of tobacco. The government has, in the past, accepted considerable responsibility for illness arising from the use by veterans of tobacco products. There was a time when members of the defence forces were encouraged to use tobacco products. In times of conflict, tobacco products were used to keep soldiers calm in the face of overwhelming odds. It was also a time when the dangers of such use were not widely known or accepted. This is certainly no longer the case. Today, tobacco companies are being forced to explain in some detail the inherent dangers of using their products. The general public is well aware of the dangers of smoking and can no longer claim ignorance of the facts. It is therefore quite reasonable for the Commonwealth to relinquish its responsibility for compensation for the future health problems of members of the defence forces who take up smoking after 31 December of this year. Members of the defence forces go through exhaustive training and are taught how to take care of themselves and their health. They must possess better than average intelligence to get through their training and would, therefore, be well aware of the dangers of tobacco products. With this in mind, the Commonwealth cannot remain liable for the health of those taking up the habit in the future. This is not to say that those veterans already suffering will be shunned. The Commonwealth will continue to assist those whose habit was formed prior to December of this year. As I stated at the outset, this government cares for our veterans. In my electorate of Bowman, I have a large and quite active veteran community. I appreciate the efforts of this government and, in particular, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to help these people. The minister has shown his dedication to the community by visiting my electorate on two occasions to date, and I believe he will visit in the near future. His efforts have not been lost on the local veteran community, which is evidenced by the warm and open welcome he has always received. I have no hesitation in commending this bill to the House.",98
202,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"Hunter) (8.31 p.m.)The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997 before the House tonight seeks to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to extend eligibility for certain benefits, including defence service home loans, to armed forces personnel who served in some overseas deployments, to allow all disability pensioners and war widowers to take as an advanced lump sum a payment of up to $500, and to limit the Commonwealth's liability for injury or death to service personnel due solely to tobacco use either begun or increased after 31 December 1997. Our shadow minister, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), has indicated that the opposition is happy to support the extension of eligibility for those payments and is happy to accept the restriction of the Commonwealth's liability with respect to smoking. But he has moved an amendment which expresses the opposition's concern as to the way the government has handled this bill. On that basis, I rise to support his amendments. As has been mentioned by many speakers before me, the bill seeks to extend those qualifications by including in the list: British Commonwealth Occupational Forces which served between 1949 and 1951 inclusive; Singapore during the Malayan Emergency between 1950 and 1957 inclusive; the Far East Strategic Reserve from July 1955 to May 1963 inclusive; the demilitarised zone in Korea from 19 April 1956 onwards; the HMA ships Vampire and Quickmatch serving in Vietnam from January 1962 and all those thereafter; and north-east Thailand, including Ubon, from 31 May 1962 until 31 August 1968 inclusive. The bill also makes a number of amendments aimed at giving some groups a service pension by including the following areas: the United Nations Commission on Korea; the United Nations India-Pakistan Observation Mission; the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon; and the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. The bill also seeks to change the way these matters are determined in the future by seeking to utilise the terms 'warlike' and 'nonwarlike'. I was rather intrigued by the description in the Bills Digest, which is very well prepared as usual, on this matter where the authors say with respect to defining the difference between 'warlike' and 'nonwarlike': In layman's terms, warlike operations are those where service personnel can expect to be shot at; non-warlike operations are those where service personnel may be shot at, but do not expect to be. That is rather interesting stuff. This is an important bill, the main thrust of which has been supported by the opposition, but it has been marred by the review process which underpins it and the shabby approach the government has adopted after promising so much prior to the election. It is a process which results in constituent letters like the letter I have before me, where the writer says: You may be aware that various veterans have achieved recognition for their service. This letter is not dated, but it goes on to explain its date because it says: Minister Bronwyn Bishop also featured on the 7.30 Report last night on the ABC. Those in the advisers box-maybe not the minister-might be able to give me the date, having been given that hint. The writer goes on to say: I still have some concern regarding the service by SYDNEYIPARRAMATTA & YARRA. The foot of the Press Release states that ""Eligibility for the AASM 1945-75 will be limited to personnel who received, or have an entitlement to ... a General Service Medal for service in . . . the Indonesian Confrontation 1962-66 ... "" I need to get confirmation that this INCLUDES the 3 ships SYDNEY/ P ARRAMATTA and YARRA. We have at least 30 membershe is referring to his local RSL sub-branchesof these ships who live in our electorate and one who has submitted and had a Comcare claim approved with no DV A entitlement to disability pension or service pension etc. He says that many representations have been made regarding this matter without any real satisfaction. I will be forwarding to the minister correspondence to that effect. I ask if he can address those matters. But these are the sorts of responses we can expect when such important reviews are undertaken without adequate consultation with the main stakeholders. The veteran community represents a significant stakeholder, deserving of the greatest attention and the greatest tation. I learned more about the men and women who served in our forces in the various theatres of war during the Australia Remembers year than I did in my previous 32 or so years. As the convener of the Australia Remembers committee, I had the opportunity to work closely with a number of local veterans. I am proud and happy to say that I became very close to them. You can read all you like about the horrors of war and the sacrifices our servicemen and women made on our behalf, but understanding those sacrifices is really impossible without having been given the opportunity of speaking with such people and hearing their first-hand accounts of events they experienced. Some of the people I came into contact with that year are amongst those who will continue to be confused about their entitlements following the passage of this bill. I think it is appropriate that I use this debate while I am referring to the Australia Remembers year to remind the House of the wonderful contribution of the former Minister fqr Veterans Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, who was· the architect of the Australia Remembers program. He was a great veterans affairs minister, as I am sure you will agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, and he developed a great relationship with the veteran community. I cannot imagine him allowing this bill to come into the House at this late stage with so many amendments and being surrounded by so much confusion. Con Sciacca certainly enjoyed the respect of the President of the Cessnock City Australia Remembers Committee, Wal Fisher, its Secretary, Allan Watson, and members Stan Browning, Jack Ellison, Ken Roberts, Robert Ross and all those who served on the committee. The President of the Cessnock RSL subbranch, Max Lewis, recently presented a number of those members and others with certificates for 50 years continuous membership of the Returned Services League. They were Messrs Wal Fisher, Stan Bainbridge, Ed Jackson, Alec Baird, Charlie Crossley, Harris Neville, Ken Astill, Peter Russell, Robert Tillot, Jim Stewart, Roy Harden, Robert Rae, consulAlan MCKluskey and Robert Hanbury-a most distinguished group of gentlemen, I am sure you would agree, Madam Deputy Speaker. The people I have referred to have rightly had their service to their nation recognised. Many others hitherto have not. Included amongst those are the RAAF personnel who served in Ubon and the other groups that our shadow minister has referred to. I am happy to enter the debate in support of the main thrust of the bill. It is something that I am sure is deserving of support from both sides of the House. But I do support the amendment of the shadow minister. There is one other issue I would like to raise; it is a matter submitted to me by the state member for Waratah in New South Wales, John Price, who served on a British ship off Vietnam in the lead-up to the Vietnam war. John Price was an engineer on that ship and hitherto has not had his service recognised. I know that it is not necessarily in the ambit of this particular bill, but I will also be Vl'riting to the minister and asking him to consider John Price's situation. It would not be a comfortable feeling to be sitting off Vietnam in a ship as an engineer in time of conflict. There is no doubt that people like John Price and others were at least feeling in a state of threat. I think there is a case for issuing some recognition for those marine engineers who were floating off the coast of Vietnam at the time. That is a matter I will be submitting to the minister at a later date. As I said, I am happy to support the main thrust of the bill but I am disappointed in the lack of consultation which has been undertaken with respect to the bill. Therefore, I commend the shadow minister's amendments to the House.",100
203,Mr MCDOUGALL,COMMITTEES,"Griffith) (8.42 p.m.)I see that the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) is at the table tonight. I hope he does not pull one of his stunts-as he did earlier this evening, which cut me short on time in speaking on a private member's bill-so that I can get through the contribution I want to make tonight. In addressing the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill, I am reminded of the great debt we owe to the service men and women in our community. While the amendments in this bill continue to ensure that our veterans are commemorated and cared for, there is one aspect of major significance; that is, the matter of nicotine addiction. I know that many members have addressed this question in debate on this bill. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Scott) are both to be commended for their concentrated campaign to educate the Australian public on the dangers of smoking. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is to be commended for his efforts in looking forward to the future veterans of this nation with regard to that problem. This government can never be accused of supporting or pandering to the tobacco industry. I think that reformed smokers are often the ones who can speak most freely on this subject. As a reformed smoker, I know that nicotine is a deadly addiction and one that even the most determined find extremely hard to break. Generations of people have been encouraged by advertising to smoke, and that did not start just recently. In years gone by the armed forces did not discourage its members from smoking. In fact, tobacco in its various forms was flown and shipped into the war zones along with the bully beef. This was during the days when we did not realise the extent of the damage caused by smoking. We certainly had not assessed its cost to the community. Things have changed and the health of the community, including that of our old and young diggers-men and women alike-is an important part of this government's policy. It is pointless to extend the eligibility for disability pension and benefits to veterans, as we are doing in this bill, if they are dying from emphysema and lung cancer as a result of smoking. It is pointless allowing all disability pensioners, war widows and war widower pensioners access to a lump sum advance of their pension, as seen in this bill, if they are ill and infirm due to smoking related diseases. We must continue to discourage smoking. And that is what we are doing in this bill. This government has determined that the Commonwealth will no longer be liable for compensation for ill health due to smoking. Obviously this cannot apply to the many thousands of men and women who unknowingly adopted a life-threatening and lifetime addiction. Public awareness of the dangers of smoking is now so great that anyone who lights up for the first time this year does so in the full knowledge that they are damaging their health. This also includes those veteran smokers who not only continue to smoke but increase their habit. There is a veteran in my community who has had emphysema for eight years. He walks around the house with tubes up his nose which are connected to his oxygen machine. He gave up his habit of 60 cigarettes a day only when he had trouble breathing. This is an example of the incredibly addictive power of nicotine. It is almost so strong that people find it easier to face ill health and possibly death rather than give up tobacco. This bill clearly sets out to discourage smoking within the defence forces. There is no doubt that this is a complete turnaround from attitudes of the past. People might remember that only in the last few days the Courier-Mail had an article on the death of Albert White, Queensland's last ANZAC. As a young soldier, Albert White was one of those brave Austritlians who fought at Gallipoli. In the article in the Courier-Mail there was a photograph of him, taken 80 years ago, in a crisp army uniform with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. A cigarette was part of that macho image, just as it has been a sign of sophistication to women. This amending bill makes it clear that any person in the services who takes up smoking at the end of this year does so without government support. This measure will not affect veterans who acquired a service related smoking habit before 1 January 1998. It must be pointed out that, if smoking is only one of the causes of ill health of a veteran, that person will still be eligible for compensation. This is a tough call, but one that had to happen. The cost in dollar terms to the nation due to the consumption of tobacco is $12.7 billion-billions, not mere millions. The cost to the veterans' budget is a massive $80 million a year. This is the greatest part of veterans compensation expenditure. That is a lot of money that could be better spent. The social cost is incalculable. On a happier note, this bill confirms our budget proposal to extend eligibility for the disability pension to another 10,500 veterans. The men and women who had seagoing naval service with the Far East Strategic Reserve between 1955 and 1963 will benefit from the disability pension and benefits. Also, those .veterans who served in north-east Thailand between 1962 and 1968 benefit, along with the members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces between 1949 and 1951. I know this has been to the advantage of several members of my community in the electorate of Griffith. I am also pleased to see that this bill extends the qualifying service guards and RAAF personnel who served in Vietnam between 1973 and 1975. This country must never forget the men and women who serve. The initiatives in the budget and the amendments in this bill demonstrate our continued commitment to these members of our community. In my experience, these people are not a vocal lot. They have a calmness and an ability to discuss issues and communicate with clarity. I do not know whether this is because their experiences in serving the nation have led them to a higher awareness of self, or whether it is because the Department of Veterans' Affairs is well run with a very effective minister. Either way, it is always a pleasure to meet with and enjoy the company of the veterans of my electorate. I support this bill because I believe these amendments, including the one to discourage smoking, will be of great benefit to veterans and their families, particularly in the future.",102
204,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"As has been outlined during the debate, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill extends operational service benefits to 11 groups of veterans, which means that they will have access to compensation in the form of disability pensions, treatment for diseases and injuries relating to service, and defence service home loans. Many of these veterans the have campaigned for years to have access to these benefits. Access comes following a review conducted jointly by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence. Unfortunately-it is to be much regretted-the government has not released the report that resulted from this review. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain how many of the recommendations are contained in this legislation and how far they go in remedying the perceived anomalies. By way of contrast, it is interesting to note that when the previous Labor government commissioned the Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence Related Awards and the Gration report on medals in 1994, the report was released publicly. One group of veterans who will benefit to to some extent from this legislation consists of those who served with the Royal Australian Navy in the Far East Strategic Reserve between 1955 and 1960 in Malaya. The veterans from this group in my electorate, who I have had dealings with, have said that, whilst they are happy with the decision to extend the disability pension to them, they regard the government's decision as only half a victory. They do have some valid points in making their claims because of some anomalies between the definitions of active service used for the various branches of the armed forces. By agreeing to extend the disability pension to these veterans, the government have to some extent admitted this. Royal Australian Navy personnel have been denied access to the service and disability pension and home loan benefits because of three arguments: first, they were never allotted for duty; second, they were not subject to military law; and, thirdly, they did not incur operational risk. This legislation means that the government have effectively given up on continuing to claim that they were not allotted for duty, although, as has been noted by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) as shadow minister, this piece of legislation introduces new terminology 'assigned for duty' which is of unclear definition. The legislation also perhaps dents the argument that this group of veterans was not subject to military law. However, the claim that these veterans did not incur additional operational risk still remains. When the actual conditions that the Far East Strategic Reserve were required to operate under and the demands made of them are examined, it is quite clear that the risk was implicit. The primary role of the reserve was to secure and defend the sea lanes and the coastline of Malaya. In addition, they were required to be part of operations against insurgent forces. Amongst the types of operations were escorting land troops through the harbour, enforcing a blockade of enemy positions, tracking the enemy and bombarding the communist positions as outlined in the previous CmDRA report. They were also required to undertake support functions for other Australian and Commonwealth personnel land and air forces, protecting merchant shipping, and be prepared at a level at least sufficient to undertake warlike operations at short notice. There are reports of Royal Australian Navy ships being fired on while undertaking troop movements and RAN personnel being caught up in a riot in 1957. The argument that the Royal Australian Navy personnel were not incurring any operational risk is undermined even further by the granting of full benefits RAAF and army personnel involved in the same theatre. Both army and RAAF personnel were eligible for qualifying service benefits after 24 hours service in the operational area. In August I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) putting to him some of the questions that veterans had put to me about his decision to deny them the service pension. These questions included what surface-to-air capability the enemy had against the aeroplanes of the RAAF, given the fact that the lack of surface-to-sea missiles is used as a reason to suggest the naval personnel faced no operational risk. To date I have not received a reply from the minister. In asking these questions, the Royal Australian Navy veterans do not seek to denigrate the efforts of the army or the RAAF personnel or to remove benefits from them to which they are entitled. They seek only to point out the anomalies involved in denying benefits to one branch of the services that are available to others. This is a question of equity and justice for the veterans. Another issue of great concern for some veterans and one that has been completely mishandled by the government is that of medals. Yet again, it highlights the gross incompetence of the government when put to task about such matters. Veterans from the Korean War, the Malaysian emergency, the Indonesian confrontation and some from the Vietnam war were not eligible to receive the Australian Service Medal 1945-75. The coalition's position on this was clear cut before the election. In their policy document 'Lest We Forget' before the election they stated that the veterans, except those who had already received the Australian Vietnam Service Medal, would be eligible for the Australian Service Medal 1945-75 with the appropriate clasp. In September last year the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) announced that the government's strategy was largely in place. Then in May this year the minister claimed that it had been discovered all of a sudden that to grant the Korean veterans their medals would be double medalling. As such she was going to break the to coalition's commitment to veterans given to them by the then shadow minister, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) before the election. There are two very disturbing aspects to the minister's May announcement not to grant the medal. Firstly, this government does not obviously consider veterans worthy enough of core promises. So they get the ordinary old promises which the government has shown no shame in breaking on a whole range of issues. Secondly, the minister claimed that she had suddenly discovered this double medalling issue-double dipping on awarding medals. For many yeats this was the reason that the department and the governments of the day had used to deny veterans the Australian Service Medal. It was clear cut. This was one of the prime reasons that these veterans had been denied an Australian award. It was nothing new but the minister attempted to portray it as such to get herself and the government out of its commitment to veterans. Fortunately for these veterans, the minister has since performed a backflip on the medals issue. Last week she announced that Korean veterans, Malayan emergency veterans, Indonesian confrontation veterans and eligible Vietnam veterans would be eligible for the new Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75. I stress that this is a new award. This issue has been solved by the creation of a new award. In some cases that sort of ingenuity in getting around a problem could be applauded, but it simply appears to be a device that, in this case, has managed to get around the intransigence, especially of some within the defence forces, of those who actively campaigned against the award to these people. While the representatives of Korean veterans' groups that I have dealt with have welcomed the announcement of last week, it still represents a significant difference to the position that the coalition outlined before the election. The whole sorry mess on the medals issue has shown the incompetence that this government demonstrates constantly. Whether it be changing Australia's system of nursing home care or the awarding of a medal that was promised before the election, the government cannot do anything without backflip, chaos, division and uncertainty. The honourable member for Reid has .outlined quite adequately a number of the concerns that the opposition has about outstanding matters. Of course, we acknowledge and welcome some of the improvements that will be made by this legislation. He has outlined the key and major concerns in the second reading amendment, a second reading amendment that I support. We should refer to that second reading amendment to ensure that the position of the opposition is clear in relation to a number of the outstanding matters. First of all, as I said earlier, we would have to underscore our concern that a number of these issues have been handled in a very secretive way. One of the characteristics· of the way in which Veterans' Affairs, and before that Repatriation, benefit matters have been carried out by previous governments of any persuasion is that there has been a great deal of consultation between government and organisations which act on behalf of the veteran community. I would hope that the minister will take on board the comments in the spirit in which they are meant. I do not think that this is the type of treatment the veteran community would expect in the future. I hope that they will see a continuation of the situation of the past, where there was full consultation that was transparent in which people could take part and have the feeling that the outcomes were based on the proper discussion of the matters at hand. I have raised some of the problems that I see about the failure to extend qualifying service status to the personnel on the RAN ships that served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan emergency. Our second reading amendment proposed by the honourable member for Reid also highlights the problems with the RAAF personnel in Ubon, Thailand. Through the honourable member for Reid, we have also highlighted the opposition's concern that the government is not acting upon the restoration of the entitlements to the Vietnam naval logistical support personnel for the journey to and from Australia and Vietnam. I understand that they are entitlements that have been withdrawn based on an interpretation of the legislation. Perhaps that is an unintended consequence of changes to the legislation that were made previously. I hope that the minister is able to take those matters on board. I finally mention one group of veterans that will have benefits extended to them by this legislation. I refer to the veterans that served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan between January 1949 and June 1951. Like other members, I have had a lot to do with veterans who served with that group from my local constituency. During the year of Australia Remembers, I was pleased that the local committee in Scullin was able to assist the Victorian group of the BCOF in installing an appropriate plaque in the gardens around the Shrine in Melbourne which commemorated those efforts. I was very pleased to be invited to a simple ceremony which commemorated that occasion and which meant a lot to those veterans that returned. People do not realise that, to a certain extent, in the postwar period there were conditions that prevailed in Japan that were unsettling to those people who served there. Yet again, there was this ambivalence based on whose control the Australian forces in that group were under which led to their not getting proper recognition for certain repatriation benefits and recognition for service medals. That situation is to be regretted. I am pleased to rise not only in support of the general thrust of the legislation but also in support of the second reading amendment which, as I have said, has outlined our concerns. I hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is able to have a look at those matters that we have raised and take action to rectify them.",103
205,Mr LEE,COMMITTEES,"I thank my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) for his assistance in the debate. I am grateful that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) is in the chamber tonight for the debate. I would like to briefly raise two particular cases of constituents that he and I have been corresponding on for a little while. I appreciate that, with the minister being in the chamber, it is an excellent opportunity for me to raise in the House and bring directly to his attention these two particular cases. I can say from the start that, naturally, I do not expect the minister to be able to respond in detail to these cases in his reply. If he would be willing to give me a written reply at some future occasion, I would be very grateful. But if he is willing to give me an immediate response tonight, I would be more than grateful. First of all, the first case involves a constituent of mine, Mr Norman Cotton. Mr Cotton is seeking a particular medal in part because it will give him access to a service pension. The brochure which is put out by Veterans' Affairs on service pensions makes the following statement about eligibility for service pensions: Service pension is an income support payment, similar to the age pension paid by the Department of Social Security. It may be paid to Australian veterans who have qualifying service, which is generally service during which a veteran incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy. Commonwealth and Allied veterans and mariners who served in conflicts in which Australian forces were involved and who have qualifying service may also be entitled to the service pension. The details of Mr Norman Cotton, a constituent of mine from Bateau Bay, are that he served with a group of British servicemen who defused unexploded bombs in the United Kingdom. He was involved in this work for a considerable period of time. I understand it was in the period from 1945 to 1949. While his work did not involve his carrying out that work outside the United Kingdom, he placed his life at risk on many occasions. Not only Mr Cotton was at risk, but all of the other people who carried out the work in seeking to defuse and, on some occasions, explode some of the unexploded ordnance that littered the British landscape, in particular some of the British cities. While Mr Cotton did not serve overseas, he certainly placed his life at risk on many occasions. In many ways, I think the allied servicemen who worked on unexploded ordnance probably required more courage and bravery than that of many people who have received service pensions for serving overseas. I know that rules have to be set and sometimes people can inadvertently be ineligible for entitlements, but this is an issue that I have written to the minister about on several occasions. In fact, on 21 August, I received the most recent reply from Stephen Edwards, the acting senior adviser to the minister. He said, and I quote from the letter: The Minister has arranged to look into your request that the General Service Medal (Bomb and Mine Clearance 1945-49) Clasp be included as a campaign medal under the VEA. A full response will be forwarded to you as soon as practicable. The most recent correspondence says the minister has agreed to look at this particular request. The reason why I am raising it tonight is to add my personal support, once again, to Mr Cotton's request that the government look at adding this particular clasp to the list of medals that entitles people to a service pension. If at the end of the day we say that Australians who are entitled to service pensions are those who were in the Australian forces and served overseas in a hostile theatre of war, that is fair enough. We say that if Australians served on Australian soil or in Australian waters and their lives were at risk because of hostile enemy action, that is fair enough. We say that if Commonwealth or allied veterans served outside their country of citizenship, their country of birth, and had their lives placed at risk, they should be entitled to a service pension. So surely an allied veteran who placed his life at risk on many occasions blowing up unexploded bombs or defusing bombs that were placing not only his life but the lives of all the others in his teams at risk should be entitled to consideration for a service pension. So that is the case. I would be very grateful if the minister, having already agreed to look at the matter, could give it his personal attention. Not only I but Mr Norman Cotton will be grateful for any sympathetic consideration which is forthcoming. The second case which I would like to raise involves a second constituent of mine also from Bateau Bay. There are a lot of good veterans living in beautiful Bateau Bay these days. This particular constituent of mine, Mr M.E. Flaxman, has written to me having served in Darwin. He served in Darwin for less than six months and, under the current rules, he is not entitled to receive the 1939 to 1945 star. As a result of that, Mr Flaxman has been quite disappointed. During the time he was serving in Darwin, the hostilities might have lasted for less than six months but he advises me that there were about 25 air raids. I think that someone who was serving in Darwin during a time when 25 air raids took place is probably entitled to some consideration for receiving that particular service medal, that particular recognition of placing his life at risk in a theatre of war when many other Australians were counting on people such as Mr Flaxman to do their duty. As I said before, I do not expect the minister to immediately respond to these particular cases. But, if he is willing to give an assurance to my two constituents that they will receive his personal attention, I would be very grateful. With those words, I will not hold the House up any longer.",106
206,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"First of all, I thank members on both sides of the House for their contribution to this very important piece of legislation, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill. I also take the opportunity just to remind the House and all Australians of the great debt of gratitude that we do owe to our veteran community. It is important that we continue to reiterate that whenever we have the opportunity so that future generations understand the importance of the veteran community, what they suffered and what they sacrificed for our freedom, our future and our children's future. This is a good news bill. It builds on the commitments we gave prior to the election. We said in our policy prior to the election that we would do certain things, and we are committed to implementing as many of those things as we can. Indeed, many of the initiatives in this bill were pre-election commitments. I must take issue with some of the members on the other side of the House and some of the points raised by the shadow minister, the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), and repeated by other members on that side of the House. It really is quite rich for the opposition to now claim that the Royal Australian Navy personnel who served in the Far East Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency should be granted qualifying service and receive a service pension. The Far East Strategic Reserve Act 1956 was repealed by the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986. If Labor had wanted to fix the anomaly that they have spoken about during the debate on this bill, they could have fixed it then. They could have also fixed it subsequent to the Veterans' Entitlement Act being introduced in 1986, because they had the opportunity when they amended the act in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1995, all of which amendments continued the exclusion of qualifying service for members of the Far East Strategic Reserve. There were four opportunities after 1986 when they amended the act for them to have done something about it. So for them to come into this House saying that we should have done something about it, when they had 13 years to do something about it, is really quite rich. You can contrast the action-not the words, but the action-of those on the other side of the House with what this government has done. We have given operational service status to the members of the Far East Strategic Reserve. That stands in stark contrast with the actions of the Labor Party when they had 13 years of government-13 years of opportunity-to do something about it. The shadow minister has made comments about the Royal Australian Air Force in relation to the Ubon air base in Thailand. If he has new documents or evidence, I invite him to tender them or pass them on to my department for investigation and review. We would be happy to look at that new evidence and see what it tenders. I should point out that operational service has also been granted to members of the Royal Australian Air Force who did serve at Ubon. In relation to Vietnam logistics and support, on 6 August this year I asked my office to meet with the Naval Association and the Vietnam Logistics and Support Association on the matter of port to port coverage. They brought their concerns to my attention and, as a result of that meeting, I have had discussions with my colleague the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop). The other issue that was raised in this debate was the report entitled A review of service entitlement anomalies. The opposition are claiming this has been a secret report which has not been made available to them. I have been advised by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel that a copy was sent to the shadow minister on 28 August this year. Perhaps it did go astray in the mail or in his mailing system, we are not quite sure. In any case, just to make sure he does have that report, I will table a copy of it. I trust this will clear up the issue, but let me assure the opposition that there was no secrecy about it. Tabling the copy here tonight will enable the opposition to further view the way the review was done and the recommendations that are contained within. In relation to the concerns raised by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) about his constituents, I certainly take them on board. I know only too well that constituents are extremely important to all members of parliament. Two issues have been raised by Mr Cotton and Mr Flaxman, and I think the member for Dobell has received a letter from my adviser in relation to Mr Cotton and the staff serving in Darwin from 1939 to 1945. I will certainly look at the issue. I am not quite sure of the fine details, so I could not give him an answer tonight, but I will give him a commitment that we will certainly look at those constituent inquiries. I think it would be best if the member for Dobell made sure he put that in writing and sent it to my office. We will look at the issue from there. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Laurie Ferguson's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [9.25 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr C.

I thank the opposition for their leave and consideration of the amendments that have been circulated. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Before I explain these amendments I would like to put the record straight on a number of issues that were raised by members on the other side of the House. The opposition really has quite a nerve claiming that the government cost veterans dearly because of the time delay in passing this legislation. In fact, it has been the opposition that had an unholy alliance with the Democrats in the upper house which has inconvenienced the veterans of this nation. This Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997 should have passed the House before we rose in the winter. But it was Labor who resorted to join with the Democrats in their cosy little coalition in the upper house in an attempt to open up debate on social security legislation that had already been passed in the Senate. Quite clearly, the Labor Party really must have been asleep when that social security legislation passed through the Senate. Otherwise, why did they attempt the tactics that they did in seeking to amend the bill? It is also particularly offensive to choose a veterans bill. I also note their lack of consideration of the fact that the Veterans' Entitlements Act and issues relating to the veterans has nearly always had bipartisan support in the past. It was indeed a very tacky measure of the Labor Party to seek to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act by talking up issues relating to social security on a bill had already passed the House. I urge the shadow minister to look at the issue of veterans quite separately from those other issues in future because, by not winning that debate, he did not do his party any good with those who perhaps might have been trying to seek to gain political points on a veterans issue in the upper house. I now tum to one of the main thrusts of the amendments. This is the rationalisation of payments between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. This reflects the government's commitment to administrative reform and to streamlining the delivery of government services. One of the amendments will allow age pensioners who also receive a disability pension to choose to be paid both pensions by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For the veterans and their eligible partners it will mean that they will need to deal with only one department. Thousands of veterans have already registered their intention to transfer their payments to my department. Many of them already have been very bitterly disappointed by the pointless delaying measures of the opposition. (Extension of time granted) Yet another amendment provides for the establishment of the vocational rehabilitation scheme for veterans. That is indeed a very good measure. In fact, it is one that the opposition sought to bring in whilst they were in government. It is one that particularly the younger veterans of our country have sought for many years to have implemented. It is an important measure. It is one that has bipartisan support, one that will bring immense benefits to the veterans, particularly the younger veterans. The scheme will provide for early intervention for younger veterans leaving the forces and support for the Vietnam veterans. It will assist veterans to find employment and to continue in employment. The development of the legislation for the scheme, and of the scheme itself, has been the subject of extensive consultation with the ex-service community. Once again, I want to thank the that veteran community for their assistance in developing this scheme, because it would not be possible to introduce this measure without the cooperation of the veterans themselves. I do thank them very sincerely for their cooperation as this scheme has been developed. The scheme will be available to all eligible veterans, but special provision has been made for those veterans who are receiving a disability pension or a service pension on the grounds that they are prevented by their incapacity from working full time. The legislation presents guarantees that those veterans who volunteer to take part in a rehabilitation program under the scheme will not have their pension reduced while participating in that program. The legislation also ensures that veterans will receive at least the same income from earnings and disability pension combined as he or she would have received as a disability pensioner and the veteran had not participated in the rehabilitation program and entered employment. If at any time the veteran ceases employment, he or she will revert to the rate of disability pension payable when the rehabilitation program was initially undertaken. These safeguards and guarantees remove disincentives for veterans to volunteer for rehabilitation back into the work force. The benefits veterans may obtain from participating in a rehabilitation program go well beyond financial advantages. These programs increase a person's self-reliance and their ability to cope with life's tasks. They provide opportunities for socialisation and can help markedly, in many instances, in improving the quality of the participant's life. Included with the other amendments moved in relation to this bill is the 1997-1998 budget initiative to streamline the determination of a service pensioner's eligibility for medical treatment at the expense of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As a result of this simplification and the associated removal of the anomalies, about 100 veterans will gain access to treatment benefits. This bill demonstrates this government's commitment to expanding and improving benefits to the veteran community. These measures are not a reward for those who served this country in war; they are benefits for veterans who have earned them by their sacrifices. I urge all members of this House to acknowledge the beneficial nature of this bill. I particularly urge the opposition to quit grandstanding when this bill gets to the Senate. The government remains absolutely committed to maintaining existing veterans' entitlements. As the bill demonstrates, benefits and services will continue to be reviewed to maintain their quality, their fairness and their appropriateness. Also, the government is committed to improving efficiency in the delivery of these benefits and services. The outcome will be a system that is responsive to the changing needs of the veterans and their families and one that directs resources to the greatest needs. I commend amendments Nos 1 to 17 to the House. I thank honourable members for their participation.",109
208,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PAIRS,"At the outset I express some amazement. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) goes around this country getting a grab bag of discontented groups together on many issues, whether it is in regard to veterans' conditions, whether it is fathers' discontent with the Child Support Agency or whether it is the gun lobby concerned that they might have to obey Australia's laws. I am very concerned that she did not have the decency to come into vote on the last measure, regardless of her views, either way. I certainly recall that one of the lead-ups to this debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997 was a question that she put on notice to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) about aspects of the bill that are being dealt with this evening. This is an instance of it being very easy to grandstand around the country getting, together groups of people who have concerns about an issue but then, at the death knell, her not even bothering to come in and vote. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) talks about the opposition having the effrontery to move a number of amendments in regard to this legislation. If anyone around here has a hide, it is the minister sitting opposite. He has been preoccupied in recent months with the question of travel allowance, to the point where there was the rather amazing situation of him issuing information on the travel arrangements of a Dr Killer. He then had to issue a press release apologising for the public disclosure of this man's travel arrangements. It certainly does show a preoccupation with the travel allowance issue. What has happened, unfortunately, is that because of this preoccupation with other matters he is taking his eye off the ball. The vocational rehabilitation scheme is, as the minister correctly noted, a concept of the previous government and is endorsed thoroughly by it. It includes measures that we all in this House agree with. The fact of life is that this week we have seen him finally come around, months later, to what the opposition advocated from the beginning. We indicated back in June that this matter should be released, should be separated, should be divided, from the more controversial measures relating to superannuation rollover and the attempt by the government to force people over 55 years of age to use their superannuation money before they get unemployment benefits. As we have seen in Newcastle and other parts of this country, there will be far more people facing that reality because of the policies of the current government. Whether it is the Public Service, whether it is lack of support for industry policy or whether it is cutbacks in research and development, in all areas more and more Australians over 55 years of age will face this quandary. The opposition indicated quite correctly right the beginning that we were not going to be intimidated, that we were not going to be pushed into endorsing those kinds of measures just to put this vocational legislation through the House. Not one opposition speaker has indicated a modicum of disagreement with this bill; it is fundamentally and totally supported by the opposition. The minister well knows that, yet he came in here this evening and alleged that the opposition is responsible for the mismanagement that he has accomplished in regard to this bill. We well know that with this bill we are talking about incompetence, negligence and a lack of clout by the government. This bill has been around the House for three months, but the minister came in here tonight and said that the opposition should somehow have solved his problems. This minister has had this bill lying around this House for three months. Talk about who is responsible around here! One would have thought that, if it was so important that he went out there and issued press releases attacking the opposition for obstruction and blockage, he might have persuaded the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to give him a bit more priority. I tum to another aspect of this legislation. Some people will be deprived of some time in backdating of their benefits through the other part of the bill simply because he did not get in early enough. They can only go back three months at maximum. Basically, he has been indulging himself in personal preoccupations over the last few monthsworrying about what might be the headline in the paper on travel or whether he is going to be asked questions-when he should have been in there pushing and struggling with the Leader of the House to make sure that this bill got to the House. It ill becomes him to allege that the opposition's refusal to be intimidated in linking this legislation with the legislation on the rollover for over 55-year-old unemployed people is really obstruction. (Extension of time granted) It was also interesting to hear the other major announcement which the minister from made this evening. He announced that he has had a talk with the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel on the question of the Vietnam Logistical Support Group rehabilitation and their rights. Once again this is an attempt to put it over the electorate, to put it over those veterans who are concerned with these matters in regard to responsibility on another aspect of this broad policy area. As the minister says in his press releases, supposedly the previous government, in the 1995 legislation, was responsible for reversing the 1993 Hawkins decision on the coverage of naval personnel from port to port. Isn't it interesting that they have actually waited for a full 18 months to put an instruction-or whatever they call it technically-to say that back in 1995 this legislation altered the meaning of those people who were deemed allotted and that they were deprived of that service? Once again it points to a lack of interest in the portfolio. The minister has allowed people in the department to say, 'This is what we have tried to accomplish for quite a while. We wish to reverse Hawkins and you are going to be the bunny who is going to essentially approve this.' His later attempt to defend it was by trying to say that an interpretation that he had allowed, that he facilitated, that he operated, was somehow the responsibility of legislation back in 1995. That was despite the fact that Con Sciacca and a number of other ministers made very public statements in this House and elsewhere that there was no attempt to reverse Hawkins. It is pretty rich for him to be manipulated by bureaucrats within the department in 1997 and to say that back in 1995, when it was not even mentioned in the bill, when there was no coverage of this aspect whatsoever, the intention was reversed. The debate has been a very wide-ranging debate. I note that the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) gave his assurances that the question of the Vietnam Logistical Support Group is finally going to be fixed up. It is quite welcome that, at last, the minister is apparently-that is, if the member for McPherson knows what is going on-going to get around to rectifying the problem he has created by essentially curtsying to the people in the department and allowing them to run policy. The other thing that has basically been a total shemozzle is the question of the medals-again because he has not been interested or concerned enough. He says it was not a secret report. It might not have been secret in the full sense, but it certainly had no public input, it did not allow representatives of the general public with a service background to have some input, it was not put out in the public domain for comment and it was not put out there for other people to have a look at and comment upon. Apparently I was sent a copy-which as far as I am concerned never arrived-but we had to write to the minister concerned to get a copy. Once again this area has been a total shemozzle because the minister has been too preoccupied with other areas. As part of the resolution that we considered earlier this evening, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel is making a fourth attempt to solve this medals problem. She had to create a new medal last week. After deciding a few months ago that there was some new capital offence in this country called 'double-medalling', she has actually had to create a new one to try to rectify the matter. The minister is going to be facing an avalanche of people who have been left out again. On the broad expanse of these amendments, they are not something that we oppose. Essentially, the amendments dropped on us in the last few days are going in the right direction. We support the vocational rehabilitation changes. They are for the good. They were instituted by the previous government. We hope they accomplish the aim of getting Vietnam veterans back in the labour market. (Time expired)",125
209,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"I wish to dwell briefly on aspects of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997 as they affect veterans of the Malayan conflict in which Australia took part in the mid to late 1950s. The extension of the service pension to those veterans who served this country in various theatres of war across the globe must be recognised by this House. I wish to draw the House's attention to the case of our Royal Australian Navy veterans who served in the Malayan conflict between 1955 and 1960. Australia had 15 ships involved in 35 deployments in this theatre of operation. The men who served us in the RAN during this conflict are still not eligible for the full service pension. The basis on which they are being deprived of the service pension is that they did not incur what is known as 'operational risk' and therefore do not gain the necessary qualifying status for the service pension. I have benefited from the service pension in a roundabout way because of my father's service in World War II, for which he received the pension. As such, I feel strongly about the right of all our veterans to gain the implicit recognition for their deeds and bravery that comes with the awarding of a full service pension as well as some degree of financial assistance and compensation which they deserve. The debate which surrounds this bill seems to be bogged down in pedantic detail over the terminology which is used to define levels of service and danger. A cursory reflection on the role of the Royal Australian Navy during the Malayan conflict makes it quite clear that their actions qualify for the appropriate reward. Actual operations of the Royal Australian Navy over the five years of the Malayan conflict included: escorting land troops through the harbour, which was believed at the time to be mined; enforcing an effective blockade and defending the harbour; preventing infiltration of the enemy through enforcing an embargo and isolating supplies; intercepting enemy signals and tracking the enemy; 'bombarding communist positions; running training exercises; performing general supportive functions for other Australian and Commonwealth personnel, including land forces; and protecting merchant shipping. In terms of the actual dangers that RAN personnel encountered, we had RAN personnel from several ships caught in a race riot in 1957 in which shots were fired, two RAN servicemen killed during service in Malaya, and RAN ships fired upon by the enemy whilst conducting troop movement and protection in the harbour. Surely this is ample evidence that RAN personnel serving in Malaya faced danger from hostile forces of the enemy and qualify, on this ground, for access to the service pension. In the 1997 budget, the government partly recognised the Royal Australian Navy service as operational and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recogeffect, nition. However, navy veterans are still fighting to achieve the same benefits as other veterans. The costs of allowing those in the navy in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 their full entitlements will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from age pensions, as paid by the Department of Social Security, to service pensions, as paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Mr Eoin Cameron- Mr Deputy Speaker, can we have an interpreter service?",127
210,Mr WILTON,PAIRS,"I am afraid that I do not speak Western Australian. As I outlined in my petition, naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personwhole nel serving overseas on active service. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications. Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service nel serving in Malaya. As I alluded to earlier, there are documentsqueeze. ed cases of RAN casualties while in service. The RAN was 'allotted' for operational service from 1 July 1955. This is documented in navy office minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The Royal Australian Navy was then apparently 'unallotted' secretly to enable excluding legislation to be introduced depriving them of their rights. I would like to mention two glaring double standards that show up the unfairness of the situation that these sailors currently face. The first double standard is that allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for service pensions under the act. Service by five countries in Vietnam was recognised after the Royal Australian Navy service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the SouthVietnamese armed forces are in receipt of Australian service pensions-571 on the married rate and 115 on the single rate. In 1,257 service pensions are being paid to people for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam. While I do not begrudge any of those ex-soldiers the benefits that they are now receiving, I do believe the same generosity should be extended to our own Malayan veterans in the navy. The other glaring double standard I wish to highlight is that members of both the army and the Royal Australian Air Force who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised after spending just 24 hours in Malaya. Again, I do not begrudge any of these veterans what is rightfully theirs. All I call for is that those in the navy also gain access to their service pension. Perhaps the most pernicious aspect of this episode is the motivation for depriving the navy veterans of the special pension. The thing that makes me so angry about this whole episode is that for well over 30 years veterans have been short-changed because the personMenzies government wanted to save some money during a particularly tight budget It has become increasingly clear over time that the Menzies government, in the face of a potential budget blow-out in 1956, took the cost-cutting measure of depriving our sailors of their rights. The costs of the confrontation in Malaya were large and the government had to fund the exercise somehow, but it is shocking'. to learn that in their efforts to save a penny the Liberals took money away from precisely those who were doing the nation's bidding in Malaya. We are fortunate enough to have living within my electorate of Isaacs some of those veterans who served Australia during this conflict in the navy. From my talks with them, I have been enlightened about an episode in Australian military history which many in our community have little knowledge of. (Extension of time granted) It is with some confidence that I assure the House that the very active veteran community within Isaacs-which centres around the RSL clubs in Mentone, Chelsea, Edithvale and Cranbourne-feels strongly about this issue. Within my electorate I have circulated a number of petitions on this issue that will be tabled in the House. Amongst others, I have received representations from Tom Pendleton, Ron Martin, Walter MCGoldrick, Frank Busswell and Eric Grant on this issue. All that these former servicemen are asking is that there be parity amongst those who served our country in this conflict. Sadly, that parity does not exist at the moment There is no greater sacrifice people can make than to serve their country in the theatre of war. For those who have undergone such an experience, it must be insulting in the extreme to be told that they did not really partake in a conflict, that they did not really risk their lives; they were just support crew with no real involvement in the fighting and defending their country's interests. Such views are both hurtful and wrong, and it is incumbent upon the government to change the law so that these offensive propositions can be laid to rest once and for all.

211,Dr NELSON,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,"The extent to which we nurture the idealism of young people and in particular the extent to which we protect our children are critical measures of any society. The Child Care Payments Bill 1997 gives effect to significant reforms that this government is undertaking to achieve that overall objective and fulfil our responsibilities to the current generation of children and their parents. The Child Care Payments Bill 1997 is about many things, but its essence is to transfer payments-and therein power-from the providers to the consumers of services and allow the integration of existing legislative and other arrangements necessary for child-care assistance. The rebate is to be paid through the new Commonwealth services delivery agencyCentrelink. Currently, child-care assistance is a grant to services that is paid monthly in advance. Under the arrangements to which this bill gives effect, child-care assistance will be paid fortnightly in advance to services based on the individual family's entitlement. But services will not any longer calculate individual family's child-care assistance, acquit child-care assistance or adjust entitlement where care changes. At present the rebate is paid in cash, by cheque or by direct credit after the care has been used and paid for-so much so that families can now claim the rebate for care used up to two years ago, which reminds me of some of the things we have seen recently in the House. Through the agency, the rebate will be paid fortnightly to families' bank accounts with a maximum backdating period of 13 weeks. Cash payment is not an option. Under the new arrangements, a family's entitlements will be based on their projected or expected use of care. From 1 January 1999 we will move to child-care payments stored electronically in a consumer-held card. There will be special arrangements for families whose use of care varies and where it may be difficult to predict such care. Families will with the agency, Centrelink, agree on what is the best estimate of care over a fixed period and as such child-care assistance will be paid on that basis. Families can also be paid in arrears on the basis of receipts if care is unpredictable. Hardship child-care assistance will be available for those families who are experiencing short-term difficulty in paying their fees. To qualify, a family must satisfy an available funds test which is formula based. Available funds will cover readily accessible moneys, for example cash or income from wages, moneys that might be due from a previous employer, bank accounts and payments from the Department of Social Security. For a couple with two children who are in care, for example, 50 hours a week, the limit will be $2,360. Having passed this test, the hardship payment will cover 100 per cent of the fee and be available for up to 13 weeks with extensions approved by the minister's delegate, Children at risk of abuse or neglect-which, unfortunately, are an increasing proportion of those in need of child care-who need immediate admission to child care will be covered by emergency child-care assistance. To be eligible, services apply to the agency and approval is automatic for payment to cover 100 per cent of the fee up to four weeks once a year. If ongoing payment is needed, families apply for the hardship payment during that particular four-week period. One critically important aspect of this is the linking of child-care assistance and rebate to the immunisation of children under the age of seven. Now claims to Centrelink for child-care assistance must be accompanied by evidence of immunisation or exemption on the grounds of a medical contraindication or conscientious objection. If a child is behind on their immunisation schedule, the family has 28 days to obtain the next vaccination or lose their entitlement. Then at the next annual child-care assistance review, the child that not immunised will lose his or her entitlement to child-care assistance. Those for whom a medical contraindication exists may backda-e a claim for 13 weeks. This measure in particular is something for which the government makes no apology. I understand it is also something that is supported in principle by the opposition. In recent years and in my previous life as the President of the Australian Medical Association campaigning for these sorts of measures I could never understand why the same parents who would be so concerned to restrain their children in cars, to see that they wore seat belts, to worry that they might be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke and all sorts of other things would fail to have their children vaccinated against preventable diseases from which children can and do die. It also struck me that I could not get my dog into a boarding kennel without having it vaccinated, but I could send my child along to child care and expose him or her to potentially serious diseases because others in such facilities had not been vaccinated. One of the problems that has developed in Australia over the last two decades is that many parents have become preoccupied with their rights and are far less concerned about their responsibilities. Parental neglect can take all forms. One of them is simply not having children vaccinated or immunised. Linking child-care payments, which are a responsibility of government, is a two-way street. We are linking immunisation or a requirement for parents to fulfil their obligations to their children to the payments for child-care assistance. This is something that is long overdue. If a number of Australian bill parents have their children immunised as a the result of this measure alone, then I think we will have done a great deal to protect our children. In the context of discussing this bill, I think it is important also to correct some of the nonsense that has been spread around in the community recently. One of the measures that was undertaken by the government was to withdraw subsidies to community based long day care centres. I think it is worth reminding is the House, the electorate and those hard working men and women of Australia who pay the taxes that support these things that taxpayers were subsidising child care to the tune of about $20 per child per week in the community based sector, which provides less than one-third of child care nationally. But average weekly fees were only $4 less than in private centres, which provide 70 per cent of the care. Private operators never received an operational subsidy. Additionally, in the 12 months to July 1997, before the removal of the operational subsidies, 21 community based long day care centres had closed. The majority closed because of declining utilisation and subsequent financial problems that these centres have had. As difficult as it may be, a part of what the government is doing is trying to rationalise a significant sector of the human services economy which has been growing at a disproportionate rate in some parts of Australia. The assistance given to one part of the industry, if that is what it might be called, has been unreasonable in the context of what has not been provided to other parts of it. The legacy of the unplanned, unchecked and clearly unsustainable child-care policies of the previous government is that we now, in a cruel sense, have an oversupply of centres in areas where there is not particularly strong demand and an undersupply in areas that are literally crying out for places. What we have done as a government is introduce a national planning framework which includes a cap on growth, continued accreditation and quality standards, and a redirection of child-care assistance to those families most in needthat is, low and middle income earners. Importantly, from 1 January 1999, we will move to the electronic card which families-I do not like to call them clients-will hold and which will store the money that will be used to purchase child-care services. Although it is another term I do not particularly like to use, I think the Labor people know what I am talking about when I say that it empowers parents; it puts more power into their hands so that they are much more able to make decisions about the kinds of child-care services they want to consume for their children, instead of simply providing all of the subsidy to the providers. A final point I would like to make is that the government has been accused of not doing the right thing in relation to child care, and· nothing could be further from the truth. It is worth reminding the House that 83,000 additional child-care places are planned to be established in this country over the next four years, along with 44,000 new private centre places and 39,000 new community based places, which will be a mix of long day care centres, family day care and outside school hours care. That means that an extra 140,000 additional children will have access to quality child care, taking the total number in formal care to almost 750,000. In one sense, that is something we celebrate-delivering more effective child-care policies to Australian parents-but in another sense it is with some sadness that one cites that sort of figure because it means that these are children who, for various reasons, need to spend time in the care of people other than their parents. But such is the nature of modem life. The other important initiative is a new national planning system that will be underpinned by the planning advisory committees that will include representatives from the Commonwealth, state and local governments, industry, consumers and small business. The committees are being established in each state and territory to identify areas of high demand for child care. The new system will provide parents with up-to-date, relevant information in relation to child-care places in their local area, fees and eligibility for government assistance. It will also improve the collection of information on where child-care places are needed and distribute information to childcare operators. One of the important initiatives is to make sure that those people who are planning to go into this industry, into this area of behaviour, have a real understanding of what the demand for these appropriate services are and that the services that grow up respond to a reasonable and consistent demand in the community. One of the problems as we go through this area of readjustment is that in parts of south-east Queensland, where we have seen quite a significant growth in the child-care sector, people who are effectively trying to run a small business have established a service where there is inadequate demand, and the policies of the previous government allowed that to happen. In one sense it is cruel. It is cruel for those people in other parts of Australia who have a demand for child-care places yet cannot find any. It is particularly cruel for those people who established a business, who did so by taking a risk and borrowing money and all the other things they had to do, then found that, unfortunately, the demand was not there. Within three or four years, I believe that we will have a: first-class child-care system in Australia, including a financing and planning system. Again, I think the minister can be congratulated for implementing reform which is necessary and is based on long-term vision.",129
212,Ms MACKLIN,CIDLD CARE PAYMENTS,"Jagajaga) (10.12 p.m.)Given the time and the fact that my remarks will have to be cut a little shorter than they might otherwise have been, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its cuts of $820 million to child care over two budgets, resulting in fee increases of up to $20 per child per week, lower quality child care, the closure of services and job losses--changes that are forcing some people to stop working, take their children out of child care, or rely on back-yard care; (2) calls on the Government to reverse its unfair decisions to cap childcare assistance at 50 hours, and to limit emergency childcare assistance to 4 weeks in any 12 month period; (3) deplores the Government's lack of consultation with the child care industry about implementation of the legislation and its failure to provide adequate information about regulations and guidelines to be made under the Act; (4) condemns the Government's attempts to rush this legislation through and implement its far-reaching changes by 1 January 1998 thus causing chaos in the child care sector"". This amendment summarises the disaster that this government has created in the area of child care. One thing that is clear to this community is that Labor has had, and still has, a very great commitment to and a great understanding of the importance to Australian families of child care. Initially it wasintroduced to support the entry of women into the work force, but child care now is recognised as being equally important in providing education and early childhood development. It is not something that people should feel sorry about but rather something that should be applauded. In Labor's period in office-1983 to 1996-there was a 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth funded child-care places. Labor's policies were about addressing needs, not about making budget cuts, which has been the hallmark of this government. In contrast, the Howard government has slashed more than $820 million from child care in its first two budgets. The Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) and the members of this government regularly like to use the words 'quality, affordable and accessible' in the same sentence with 'child care,' but it is the case that their constant repetition devalues these words, because you cannot slash more than $820 million from anything, let alone child care, and claim that you are making it better. The government has attempted to disguise the scale of its attack on child care by spreading the areas and the implementation of the cuts. Look at where and when these cuts have fallen. In the August 1996 budget the coalition announced: the abolition of additional income allowed for additional dependent children when assessing eligibility for child-care assistance, which was implemented from 1 April this year; the reduction of child-care assistance cut-offs for second and subsequent children, which was again implemented from 1 April this year; an extension in the range of fringe benefits for child-care assistance income testing, to be implemented from 1 January 1998; the capping of access to childcare assistance at 50 hours a week, which was implemented from 1 April this year; the freezing of child-care assistance and childcare cash rebate fee ceilings for two years, and that means no indexation on 1 April this year or 1 April next year; a reduction in the child-care cash rebate benefit to 20 per cent for families above the family tax initiative ceiling, which was implemented from 1 April this year; the removal of operational subsidies worth $100 million over four years from community based child-care centres, which started on 1 July this year; and the payment of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate through the shopfront agency, to be implemented from 1 January next year. Nine months later, in the May 1997 budget, we had another round of cuts which cut the supply of new child-care places to just 7,000 a year in 1998 and 1999, a saving of $207 million; it is always taken as a saving. It limited child-care assistance for non-work related care to 20 hours a week from 1 January 1998, a saving of $81 million. Payment of child-care assistance will be Changed from fortnightly in advance to fortnightly in arrears from 1 January 1999, saving $32 million. This word 'savings' means savings to the government but costs to parents. The sum of these cuts means that the government has taken more than $820 million from child care-$820 million that otherwise has to come out of parent's pockets. It is the case that Labor does support a planning system for new child-care places. The private centres have been the strongest advocates for such planning controls. Labor also. supports the reduction in child-care assistance for nonwork related child care to 20 hours a week. However, these two measures, while important in themselves, amount to tinkering at the edges when we consider the grave impact of the various cuts and slices to child care that we have seen in the short life of this government. These have all had the effect of making child care less affordable. For example, at a meeting in Melbourne of 40 private child-care providers, three weeks after the introduction of the 50-hour cap last April, almost all reported a reduction in usage with those in lower income areas reporting a drop of up to 25 per cent in full-time places. Usage dropped more in lower income areas because the cuts impacted most severely on low income families. That is why we are opposing and continuing to oppose the capping of assistance at 50 hours and why we are calling on the government, in this amendment, to reverse this unfair decision. These various cuts in child-care assistance have been exacerbated by the ending of operational subsidies to community based centres. In many centres the increase in costs is now reported to be $18 a week, confirmed in many newspapers last week with the release of survey material from the National Association of Community Based Child Care Centres. The survey revealed that more than 4,000 families have reduced the amount of child care they use or that they have withdrawn their children from child care altogether. Other important points made by the survey were that in four states the weekly fee for one child in full-time care is $170 a week, more than four families in each centre surveyed have reduced hours or have left the centre, more than 25 per cent of centres have reduced staff, 74 per cent of parents using existing care cited increased fees as the reason for leaving, 67 per cent of families leaving centres are using informal care, and 76 per cent of parents reported their fees were due to increase again before the end of the year-a very sorry state of affairs. I will give one example of the real result that this is having on families. I was out in Blacktown in western Sydney recently and met with a group of child-care workers. I was told of a family in that area which could no longer face the fee increases, the result of the two budgets from this Howard government. They had withdrawn their children from care and hired a teenager at $80 a week to mind the children at home. We have backyard care back in Australia. What an appalling indictment of this government! The minister must not sit·on her hands and watch our child-care system become out of the reach of parents. In recent newspaper reports she has tried to blame the child-care centres for the fee rises. From our point of view she needs look no further than her budget cuts. It is thanksto the budget cuts of this government that many centres are facing such deterioration in their affordability. In private centres many staff have already been laid off and proprietors and their families are battling to keep things going. I want to read from the letters a couple of private centres have written in. We have had thousands and thousands of letters. One private centre says: We can't plan for the future with confidence. The changes and cuts to the industry here have pushed up costs in ways that have seriously threatened afford ability. With all the restrictions and cut backs, this has had major effects on our businesse.g. non-indexation of hourly rate, 50% cut in child care assistance for holidays, rebate changes, 50 hour limit etc. A lot of centres have felt unable to increase further fees on families and have therefore absorbed these extra costs-because we are frightened to lose any more business. I do not think we can absorb any further cuts without severely damaging our businesses. Another private centre writes in: . . . I am more fearful of the future now than at any time in my thirteen years in the industry ... the very viability of thousands of small businesses and community services are threatened. Many jobs will be lost and the future of thousands of young people studying to be early childhood teachers and carers will be put under a dark cloud. Put under a dark cloud by this government, I might add. It is the case that community based centres have had to absorb all the costs that those private centres write about, as well as the cuts to operational subsidies. Again, our office has been inundated with letters detailing the effect of these cuts, particularly the effect on the families using them. Another letter from a centre, written to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), describes three different families in the centre. It states: Family one A single parent (A father) works full time with the RAAF and has 3 children, one child is at school and two children are in full time care. His fees will increase by $28.80 a week. Family three A two parent family the father is setting up his own sign writing business and the mother is in hospital ... with psychiatric problems ... Two children in full time care. The increase will be $31 a week. These are real stories about families who are undergoing major stresses on their budgets as a result of this government's cuts to child care. There is no doubt that child care has gone rapidly backwards since the Howard government came to power. In the last budget we have also seen significant changes to the out of school hours care program. We have seen significant changes occur to children in care under the age of five and now, as a result of this budget, we are seeing further significant changes to out of school hours care. In the last budget we had the axing of operational subsidies to out of school hours care. If the loss of operational subsidy was bad for community based long day care, it is going to be calamitous for out of school hours care. I have a letter here from the National Out of School Hours Services Association which details some of their concerns. They say, and I must say this is becoming a hallmark of this minister: There is .. . confusion and anxiety in Out of School Hours Services as the implications of administering the new Child Care Assistance become apparent. The new Child Care Assistance arrangements are totally overwhelming for services. The previous low income limits for Child Care Assistance in Out of School Hours Services resulted in few families receiving this form of assistance and so Out of School Hours Services have little knowledge of a system they are expected to administer from 1 January 1998. Holding fees and allowable absences for instance are new notions for many Out of School Hours Services. The tight timelines and the magnitude of the changes proposed will make it difficult for service management, or their sponsoring bodies, to absorb information and put into place appropriate management structures. The standard of premises from which Out of School Hours Services operate varies greatly. Many services have no formal administrative area set aside and no time out allocated for administrative tasks. Computerised records are virtually non-existent in Out of School Hours Services, indications are that the only alternative will be a large increase in administration time. There has been no recognition from the department that any additional administration time will be required. The stand taken by the department has been that parents will now have to take responsibility for their child care. They will be responsible for recording absences for sick leave, annual leave and RDOs, while services will be required to keep records that will verify such absences. However the reality is that parents will look to services for clarification and advice. The Departments involved have held briefing sessions in some States and Territories, however the information being provided at these sessions has been inconsistent. Written material made available has been written in bureaucratic terms and has not been user friendly adding to the confusion and anxiety. Not avote of support. The increase in child care assistance for parents using these services in no way compensates to the services for the loss of the stabilising backup that operational subsidy provided. Even more ominous is the fact that some state governments are reportedly reassessing their contribution and commitment to these out of school hours services in light of the cuts. Some of the out of school hours services are very concerned that they may have to close. So not only will we see young children in backyard care-a very serious turning back of the clock-but we will have school age children back on latchkeys. The National Out of School Hours Services Association goes on to ask me to try to have the implementation of the new policy delayed for six months so that they can at least have some time to cope with the changes. One specific example of the likely impact on an out of school hours service comes from a primary school in South Australia. This centre provides an essential service in an area where many families do not have the support of extended families nearby. Next year the centre will lose around $13,000 in operational subsidy and this loss will mean that to maintain viability fee increases of around $40 a week for a two-child family and $50 a week extra for vacation care are inevitable. These are the figures they have sent to me. These increases will be virtually impossible· for many families to carry-a difficulty com:"" pounded by the closure of the local Medicare office making it more difficult in the short term for families to access the child-care cash rebate. This primary school sees a number of unacceptable things developing from this government's child-care cuts. They state: Families will seek the alternatives of unwilling, unregulated and unprofessional back yard care with neighbours. Worse still, 'latch key' care will happen, where young children aged between 5 and 12 years will let themselves into their own homes to remain [unfortunately] unsafe and unsupervised for up to 4 hours per day. At best, parents will seize the cheaper opportunity of hiring untrained and inexperienced teenage baby sitters at much cheaper rates than we can possibly offer. Some parents may even have to give up work altogether. This is a view held by many of the most powerful in this government. I am sure it is not the case that the minister thinks that a woman's place is in the home. It is the case that for most women it is not a choice to go out to work; it is something that their families need to keep their budgets together. For other women it is a choice that they want to have. But you have to look at the nature of this government's policies because they make it clear that overall this government wants to see women out of the work force by whatever means, by increasing the price of child care to families to make it more and more difficult for those families to manage to keep both parents in the work force.

215,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Be very careful.,135
216,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am sure tonight you will understand that exceptions can be made for special circumstances. In fact, the Queensland members present will be delighted, I am sure, because of the Courier-Mail's wonderful front-page story and photographs. The papers across the country have captured a moment in history which has enormous implications. John Macdonald of the Australian said: There has never been, and can never be, a greater finale than Newcastle's win over Manly in the rugby league grand final at the Sydney Football Stadium yesterday. That probably says it all, but it does not say anywhere near enough. The quality of the football yesterday was superb. More importantly, the quality of the people playing it was outstanding. Yesterday afternoon the likes of Paul Harragon, the Johns brothers, Robbie O'Davis and all the others, together with their supporters and their club, reclaimed a sport for the community. I think that has much more serious implications for this country than people will understand in the short term. The recovery and recapture of rugby league by the community has enormous implications. Just as importantly, the recovery of a community's own spirit and sense of community is vital. We in Newcastle well understand that we have to make our own way in the world, and we have done that for a very long time. We do not expect favours, we do not expect things to be easy, but we expect them to be fair and we expect to have to work hard. The approach taken yesterday afternoon by those players was just that. The fact that they were successful says an awful lot about the kind of people they are and the kind of place they come from. Last night the fact that a crowd of somewhere around 30,000 people gathered until 10.30 before the players even came home was a fairly bizarre and fairly unusual experience. In trying to understand what brings people together in that kind of way, it was a sense of belonging, a sense of being part of something much bigger, being part of a community in a way that people do not often think about. It was a fairly spontaneous expression of a sense of pride and a sense of community. It is important to recognise that today at question time when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was asked about that game he referred to employment and to the economy and to his government's activities. I would like to remind the House of the comments of one of the player's fathers and the fact that some of the players have become fairly visible in supporting miners of the Hunter Valley mines. They have pointed out that they are part of the same community and part of the same people; they are not separate. In fact, the headline in the Australian- 'Working class heroes'-sums it up. They are working class heroes. The working-class people who need heroes and have heroes also need· support. The people who work at BHP need support. The people who work in the pits need support. The people who work in the Commonwealth Public Service need support. The people who work in a range of organisations in this country need support from governments and parliamentarians. After yesterday and in the weeks ahead, people in Newcastle will come to understand that eventually we need ourselves more than anybody else. Last night's coming together was an expression of that. We have to grapple with the future by ourselves because the government has made it clear that the future of steel is in BHP's hands, not theirs. The government has made it clear that 400 jobs can go in the Public Service in Newcastle and that does not matter to the government. The government has made it clear that it will make the strikes worse rather than better. It is not interested in getting solutions but in having arguments, whether it be on the wharves, whether it be in sea transport or whether it be in the mines or the pits. What is happening right now in Newcastle is a microcosm of Australia. I think the answer we are finding will be relevant to the nation. (Time expired) Adelaide Crows",135
217,Ms JEANES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to pay tribute to the phenomenon sweeping South Australia caused by the Adelaide Crows' history-making win on Saturday in the AFL grand final. In my lifetime I have rarely experienced anything like the public excitement surrounding the event. As a child I remember standing at the end of my street with thousands of other South Australians when the Beatles drove past. I remember the crowds when members of the Royal Family visited Adelaide at the height of their popularity. On Saturday night in South Australia, excitement hit a comparable level on the Richter scale. As I drove home after watching the match with friends, there were literally hundreds of young people on the streets waving balloons and scarves and singing and waving at passing traffic. Many Adelaide homes had red, yellow and blue balloons tied to their letterboxes and fences. My neighbours around the comer now have three totem poles in their front yard painted in the famous colours. We owe the Crows a considerable debt in our state. To Malcolm Blight, Mark Bickley, the great Shaun Rehn, Norm Smith medallist Andrew MCLeod and their team, all South Australians say a heartfelt thankyou. On behalf of my husband and his old mate John Voyzey, I pay tribute to the Glenelg Football Club for producing such fine footballers as Rod Jamieson, Kane Johnson, Matthew Liptak and Mark Visca as their contribution to the Crows' talented personnel. Right from the start there were great expectivity tations, to say the least, placed on the Crows' performance once they entered the AFL. Now, some six years later, together with the prior success of the West Coast Eagles, we truly have a national competition. If it were not the fact that I want the Crows to take the cup horrie every year, I would wish the Swans and the Lions good luck in order to indelibly enshrine the concept of a national league in the nation's psyche. South Australians do not like to be compared unfavourably with the other states. We do not like it when we are referred to as the rust bucket state. We do not like being ignored. We know we deserve our fair share and we know that we can mix it with the best of them, and sometimes we get a bit put out when this is not recognised. At times we do have a self-esteem problem and at times over the past six years we have taken some of our resentment out on the Crows when they have not met our expectations. Saturday'S victory met every expectation. We knew they could do it and they provided a major boost to our state's self-esteem. Such confidence is something that governments find difficult to foster. Confidence comes from feeling good about yourself and your place in the world. Today, South Australians feel very good about themselves and their place in the world. We know we can cut it on the big stage and we did just that on Saturday. The symbolism of this victory should not be lost on South Australians. Our football team can cut it and we can all cut it in whatever endeavour we choose. South. Australians are not lacking in a generosity of spirit. I believe that I can speak on behalf of all of us in expressing our sincere admiration of Nicky Winmar. His outstanding effort the day after the death of his father in fronting up for the match and playing a fair game was not rewarded in the way he would have wished for his father. For that, he has our deepest sympathy. South Australians and Victorians have a lot in common. We both rely heavily on our manufacturing sectors for our daily bread. Our joint cooperation in lobbying the federal government for an outcome from the ProducCommission's inquiry into the automotive industry that would ensure the future of the industry in Australia, so vital to both our states, was most constructive and effective. In the spirit of that cooperation, I feel it for would be most appropriate for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trans':' port and Regional Development, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), to publicly thank South Australia's Crows supporters for their outstanding contribution to the Ballarat economy over the past few weeks. We accepted your offer of hospitality and we paid you lots of money. In closing, I feel it is incumbent on me to mention the joy experienced by all South Australians due to the pain that a certain football commentator would have been feeling on Saturday night and will hopefully go on experiencing for some time. A plea to all Victorians: in the name of further cooperation between our great states, send Sam Newman to be your Agent General on the Island of Dr Moreau. Western Australian Government",136
218,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the public notice my concern about the integrity of some members of the Court government in Western Australia. One of my constituents, Mr Alan Ingham, has been representing a consortium of Western Australians who wanted to develop a resort on the North West Cape near the Ningaloo Reef. Originally, this resort development, known as Ningaloo Seastar Resort, had the support of state tourism minister, Norman Moore. Let me emphasise that Mr Ingham's consortium, Trade Centre Pty Ltd, was exclusively financed from within Western Australia and, as such, would have provided employment, tax revenue and redistribution of profits within Australia. Trade Centre also sought to undertake an environmental impact study to ensure that any development in the area had no negative effect on the Ningaloo Reef or any flora or fauna in the vicinity. Their concept was to develop an ecotourism resort that would allow Australians and foreign visitors to enjoy the pristine ment on the western side of North West Cape. I for one support their motives, as giving people controlled access to national parks and world heritage areas is now well accepted as the best method of guaranteeing their protection. For Ningaloo, I think this would have been even more important in the context of the state having now approved oil exploration in the immediate vicinity of the reef. The Court government, however, has decided to develop a marina on the mud flats of the east coast of the cape. The government's resort will be marketed by its own Landcorp in partnership with a foreign consortium, which I understand is wholly foreign owned and financed, although one of its directors is Mr Ken Court, the brother of the Premier of Western Australia. Ken Court is also the failed Liberal candidate for the federal seat of Curtin, which, I am glad to say, is still held by my good friend Mr Allan Rocher. Mr Ken Court has shown some amazing business acumen since his brother became Premier and successfully represented various consortia for government tenders. Ken Court's luck has not escaped the cynicism of the Western Australian public. They are sensitive to such matters, having been educated in political favouritism by the years of Labor's WA Inc. They showed their disgust through the ballot box and I believe that the Court government should keep this in mind. One small but typical example of public cynicism was shown in a call received by Dr Gallop, the state Labor leader in Western Australia, on a recent talkback radio program. A caller summed up the last decade and a half of government in WA by saying: 'You lot,' meaning Labor, 'gave all the money to your mates. This lot,' meaning the Court government, 'is giving it all to their relatives.; The people of Western Australia were almost universally dismayed at the levels of corruption that were uncovered by investigations into WA Inc. and the smaller but equally insidious Wanneroo Inc. scandals. The only real measures to prevent recurrence of this type of behaviour were the recommendations made by the WA Commission on Governenvironment. Unfortunately, by the time the commission's report was presented, the Court government had formed the view that the types of protection needed to prevent corrupt activity by government were in fact a barrier to the style of government it proposed to follow. As a result, almost every single recommendation has been ignored. In WA, the public have only taken one term of the Court government to learn that corruption is not necessarily limited to any particular party, despite claims by the Premier that his government does not have to take any special precautions to avoid the dangers of WA Inc. My main concern, however, is the lack of transparency in the process for choosing the successful project. I think that these circumstances are not far different from previous Labor cabinet decisions to bailout the Rothwells bank or to enter into a secret deal to circumvent the casino licensing tender process for the Burswood casino. Further, I believe that the state government has acted deceptively by making Landcorp a player in the project. This is little more than a protective and anti-competitive guarantee for the consortium. Supposedly to protect Landcorp, the state has granted these foreign investors exclusive rights to develop on the cape. If we have Australian investors seeking to develop a resort without putting state taxpayers' money at risk, why then secretly opt for foreign money propped up by the state and then guarantee they will not have to face any competition whatsoever? Foreign investment scrutiny is limited to the state government, which I believe has already shown itself to have an unacceptable interest both by the family relationship of Ken Court to Richard Court and by the involvement of public money through Landcorp. The other problem is that, who knows, in the future when the exclusive licence guaranteed to the Burswood casino expires this particular resort consortium may well end up having a casino licence also. I call on the state parliament in Western Australia to undertake a parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the granting of the project on North West Cape to the successful consortium. I believe that the decision to ignore the proposal by Trade Centre in favour of a foreign consortium desperately needs to be investigated. Craig-Gardiner, Mr John",137
219,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"Wide Bay) (10.45 p.m.)Maryborough and district is in mourning following the loss of one of its best loved citizens and strongest advocates, John CraigGardiner. John died suddenly and unexpectedly at just 43 years of age on the evening of Friday, 12 September. John was born in Maryborough and never ceased singing its praises. He came from a show business family, his mother having worked professionally in music theatre and radio productions and his father being one of the radio legends of the 1930s and 1940s as Greenbottle in the famous Yes, What? radio series. His older sister, Diana, was one of the early on-screen personalities when television came to Maryborough. John left school at 15 and, after working with the Bank of New South Wales, joined radio 4IP. He also worked in radio in Longreach, Charleville and Toowoomba before switching to SEQ8 television. My first contacts with John came through regional tourism. The concept of regional tourism was new and was experiencing a traumatic birth. Everywhere there seemed to be divisions, personality conflicts and a lack of foresight. John soon was appointed manager of what went on to become the Fraser Coast South Burnett Regional Tourism Board. John strongly believed in the tourism potential of the Fraser Coast and was instrumental in convincing the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation and the local community that tourism could be a major industry in the area. He also knew that, while each individual centre possessed notable tourist attractions, the area could not become a major tourist destination unless everyone worked together to promote the region. I had the privilege of working as chairman of the board with John for four years, during which time he was primarily instrumental in establishing the regional tourism board as a reliable, innovative and hard working organisation deserving community support. John and the organisation won the recognition and admiration of his peers. Tourism visitations to the Fraser Coast increased enormously, and the region's tourist industry became a major employer. John Craig-Gardiner had a dynamic enthusiasm for promoting his region and was able to convey his personal excitement to others. He was a true Maryborough boy who had a passionate ambition for his city and wanted everyone else to catch something of his great vision for Maryborough and the district. As his classmate Dr Ian Truscott said in the eulogy: John has been largely responsible for restoring a tarnished pride in our city. Perhaps that is why Maryborough loved him. He made us feel good about ourselves too, and now when we say ""I am from Maryborough"", it is with pride. After John decided it was time to leave the tourism board, he devoted his energies and organisational skills to a new project. This is Maryborough's sesquicentennial year and it was largely John's idea that the year should be celebrated with pride and style. The city council appointed him to coordinate the celebrations and, with his usual dedicated enthusiasm and meticulous attention to detail, he put together a program involving hundreds of events spreading through the whole of this year-street parties, a visit by tall ships, freedom of the city, parades, reunions, memorabilia, visits by dignitaries, including a visit last week by the Governor General, and everything that would make this an extraordinarily memorable year. Even though he will not see all the events he planned, John has left an enduring legacy in the hearts of the people of Maryborough and, especially, a new confidence and pride in their city. As Mayor Councillor Brown, said at John's funeral: His enthusiasm, motivation, and friendly nature made it easy for him to achieve a cohesive effort with other people involved with the fulfilment many projects he was an integral part of. Robert Olds, on behalf of his father, Peter, said: His professional manner and presentation was without equal. John would not want us to be sad for long, but rather continue with the work which he was involved for the city he loved. It is perhaps difficult to understand how man could so much change the way in which a city thinks about itself. It was not his own achievements but the people and things around him that he glorified. He gave every bUIlding, each place, each event-both past and present-a significance that others had long forgotten or would never know. John Craig-Gardiner achieved more for his community in his short life than most great people do in a normal lifetime. There are men of whom it can truly be said that they are irreplaceable, but John Craig-Gardiner surely one. I have only happy memories of working with John. I admired him enormousnot ly, and the whole city and community extends its sympathies to his widow, Val, and to John's mother and family. Avalon Airport",139
220,Mr OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"In several previous speeches to this House, have outlined the potential to the Geelong region and the nation of developing Avalon airport in my electorate as an airfreight for the export of perishable food products to Asia and elsewhere in the world. The proposal first surfaced in a report that was undertaken in 1994 and funded by the previous Labor government's Office of Labour Market Adjustment when the airport was still under Commonwealth control. It gained widespread support within the Geelong community from people anxious to diversify the city's ic base and to reduce the city's reliance on traditional manufacturing industries, such as textile, clothing and footwear and automotive manufacturing. The proposal has been enthusiastically taken up by the Habitat Trust-in particular, the trust's executive officer, Ross Mellor OBE, who more than anyone else has worked to develop the concept in a most practical way and to convince decision makers in state and federal governments of the of national economic significance of this exciting proposal. The Avalon project, in a nutshell, is an ambitious project to establish a dedicated airfreight hub specialising in the export of perishable horticulture, floriculture and aquain culture products to Asia and beyond, drawing that produce from a four-state hinterland of one Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Riverina in New South Wales. The project seeks to utilise the region'S quality transport assets-the Port of Geelong, the Princes Highway, the national standard gauge rail and Avalon airport itself-to propel a state-of-theart development which has the potential to generate thousands of jobs in the region. Utilising the Geelong region's highly skilled work force, its quality teaching and training few institutions-such as Deakin University and the Gordon TAFE-and its productive rural was hinterland, Avalon is uniquely positioned to generate a level of regional economic activity seen in the region for decades. Now that the Victorian Premier has abandoned his obsessive and stupid idea to locate the Coode Island chemicals complex at Point Lillias-which lies at the end of Avalon's runway-the way is open to establish a unique production zone and associated proI cessing facility at Avalon and Geelong and market the output as clean and green, Avalon fresh produce to receptive and burgeoning hub markets in Asia and beyond. The concept I have outlined has been embraced by trucking magnate Lindsay Fox who, in a joint venture with Serco Limited, won the lease of the airport from the current Commonwealth government. That company, Foxerco, now carries the onerous responsibility of developing the facility to the region's econombenefit and that of the nation. Recently I visited Fort Worth, Dallas in the United States, to inspect the Alliance Airport which has been developed as an air freight hub along the lines I have described. The Alliance airport· facility is an 8,300 acre complex which has been· developed in a unique· partnership between local, state and federal governments and the private sector. The development· is best described by the Alliance's own promotional material which has this to say: Alliance combines a visionary master plan with an intense commitment to the highest standards. Office, manufacturing, distribution, industrial and commercial/retail space are all offered in a campusstyle environment served by a multimodal transportation network of air, rail and highway systems. The brochure goes on to describe the vision: The developers of Alliance seized a rare opportunity .. Starting with a strategic geographic location, they envisioned an inland port-an important hub in the global economy, linked by a sophisticated multimodal transportation network to any market in the United States or the world. But this was the opportunity to define the community where economic vitality goes hand-in-hand with quality of life. That is the sort of vision we must have for Avalon and the Geelong region. I am pleased to note the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) in the chamber tonight. He has clung by his fingerbeen nails to the zero tariff concept, which would have decimated the textile, clothing and footwear industries and the automotive induspensioner's tries in Geelong. Thankfully, he was the man out in the coalition, rejected by his Prime children. Minister (Mr Howard) and the rest of the coalition backbench. Tonight I invite the honourable member to join me in developing this proposal and promoting it for the Geesive. long region. It is an exciting proposal and one of national significance. I hope even the honourable member for Corangamite with his limited ability to engineer any sort of ecoreceived nomic growth in his own electorate will join me in developing this facility for the benefit of the people of the Geelong region. (Time expired) Disability Support",140
221,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of House the plight of a constituent of mine, Lee Davis-a plight shared by a small group of constituents in similar circumstances. Lee suffers from multiple sclerosis. Before being forced to give up due to ill health, he was the proprietor of a small business which employed between two and six people at any one time. He is one of a number of people in my electorate who suffer from a disability and who have taken out private health insurance and an income protection policy while still in business and able-bodied. He never expected that one day this would become his only source of income. Unfortunately for those like Lee who have taken up the responsibility to ensure that provisions are made for themselves and their families in the future, there appears to be little assistance forthcoming from governments to give them a helping hand in their time of greatest need. Ironically, had Lee not taken also the responsibility to insure himself, he would easily have been eligible for a number of generous benefits. Few would disagree that Lee's initiative in providing for himself and his family has' saved the government enormous cost in various benefits. Had he been disabled and not in receipt of an income from his income protection policy there would have little doubt that he would have been ' easily eligible for the disability support pension, rent assistance, a health card and a concession card-to mention a odd few-as well as benefits for his wife and For those who suffer a chronic disability, the costs of insuring that their everyday needs are adequately met can be shockingly expenThe provision of appropriate equipment which helps to make their living a little more comfortable and meaningful plays a vital part in meeting those needs. The limited income from the protection policy is certainly nowhere near enough to ensure that one family is well-catered for let alone to cover the costs of ongoing needs. The following list of costs will give an indication of the approximate costs Lee incurred when his MS deteriorated further and he became wheelchair-bound. These costs do not include the the numerous other incidentals which he incurs Mr on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. His shower chair cost $1,200, his toilet chair cost $150. His incontinence aids create unlimited and ongoing costs. His manual wheelchair cost $1,200 and his electric wheelchair cost $7,000. Repairs and maintenance to his electric wheelchair cost $600 per annum. Batteries for his electric wheelchair cost $300 per· annum. Pressure relieving cushions cost $650 and pharmaceutical costs amount to $50 or more per month. There are a lot of taxi fares to be paid at well over $10 per trip. Lee has to make trips frequently to doctors and other health professionals as well as to various meetings. In addition, building adjustments had to be made to Lee's home, to accommodate his wheelchair when his body was no longer able to carry him. All doors had to be changed and ramps had to be added. Major adjustments had to be made to the bedroom and bathroom to ensure that Lee was able to get in and out without too much drama. As you may be aware, the necessary building adjustments I have mentioned were very expensive. They cost in excess of $50,000. Another point which is not usually raised and one which I believe is very important is that for those like Lee the numerous and constant repair and maintenance jobs to the family home, which are easily done when they are well, are now done at a high cost through hired labour. The plight of those with a chronic disability is certainly a long and difficult one. They frequently struggle with the acceptance of their illness, the loss of their stable and secure income and the fact that they are no longer in a position to adequately provide for their loved ones. To also contend with the constant problem of acute shortage of funds and resources complicates their lives and the lives of their spouses and children. That is a huge burden that they could certainly do without. Most people with chronic disabilities are quite fortunate as the government provides them with assistance. Few would disagree that it is a government's responsibility to ensure that people with disabilities are taken care of and well-provided for. However, it is also the responsibility of government that those people with disabilities who have made provisions for themselves should not be ignored and neglected. On the contrary, they should be encouraged, understood and commended for being responsible enough to make such.provisions. As Lee Davis's example illustrates, despite making provisions for themselves, many people with chronic disabilities experience enormous financial difficulties. I strongly believe that current government policy should be reviewed where disability services and social security benefits are concerned, with the view of more appropriately accommodating the needs of this community, particularly those who have made provisions for themselves and, as a consequence, saved the government enormous expense. Financial assistance should be. made available to this very small and neglected group, to help them with the purchase of their equipment and the cost of their medication and to help ease their burdens at times when they are desperately short of funds. Governments should look into doing whatever is necessary to ensure that the serious concerns of Lee Davis and others like him are properly addressed in the near future.",141
