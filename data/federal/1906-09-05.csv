5,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"In what way is the Board now sitting in Melbourne dealing with the report of the Imperial Defence Committee ? Is it criticising, the report of a body which the Prime Minister has assured us is the highest expert authority in the Empire, is it merely devising means to put the Committee's recommendations into effect?",13

8,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Yes . answers to the honourable member's The questions are these1906. The Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information :at 2.30 "" 1 . Officers of the Postmaster-General's Department in New South Wales are not compelled to work overtime till 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. ' special' work, and only receive tea money; when officers are so engaged on ordinary work, they are allowed tea money. 2. It is not known here what is the ' special' work referred to, or officers concerned; (a) under the Commonwealth Public Service regulations the . Commissioner may grant payment for overtime which from its character or special circumstances cannot be performed during prescribed hours, but no payment shall be made for overtime to officers employed bringing up As Mr arrears of work properly coming within the scope of their ordinary duties; (b) the regulations also prescribe that tea money may be allowed where an officer has been specially directed to attend after ordinary hours, and works for at leasttwo hours after the usual hours, but tea money shall not be allowed when overtime pay is given, and where it is practicable, equivalent time off must be granted in lieu of overtime payment."" 3.

HOLIDAYS, POSTAL DEPARTMENT.",13
14,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Has it been the practice of his Department low:to allow its officers certain holidays, and, in cases when it was not convenient to allow officers off duty on those days, then to permit them to take other time off in lieu thereof, and, if desired, to permit such time off to accumulate and to form an addition to annual leave? 2. Is it a fact that officers are now being charged the cost of relief for days taken from duty in lieu of holidays worked? 3. What is the objection to allowing days off in lieu of holidays worked to accumulate and be taken with annual leave, especially in the case of back-country officials?",14
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The following information has been furnished by the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, in answer to questions 1 and 2 :1. It has always been the practice of the Department in this State for as many officers as possible to be allowed off duty on public holidavs. In cases where they are compelled to work on such days, time off in lieu of holiday attendance is permitted. Prior to 1906 officials were allowed to accumulate days in lieu of public holidays worked, and add them to the statutory annual leave. 2. It is not a fact that officers are being charged with the cost of relief for days in lieu of public holidays; but some officials who have asked to'be allowed to employ casual assistance at their own expense during their absence from duty in lieu of certain holidays worked before the present rules came into force, have had their applications acceded to. The reply to question 3 is3. The practice now is to require officers to take leave in lieu of holidays during the public requirements and the convenience of the Department permit. To add to the statutory portedleave days for holidays worked would largely increase the cost of the service, encourage unnecessary work on holidays, and,, where there is a large number of officers, make it difficult, not impossible, to arrange for relief if an indefinite number of days were added to ters statutory leave. Officers in remote allowed an extra week's leave per annum, and can accumulate leave for two, and, - in special crises, three years. METHYLATED SPIRIT.  and Customs, upon notice I. On what date did his Department cease to collect Excise duty of 6d. per gallon on methylated spirits? 2. How many distillers of methylated spirits are there in New South Wales? 3. Are. the users of methylated spirits receiving anv benefit from the removal of the Exciseduty? * 4. Is it true that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are now charging as much for methylated spirits as they were before the duty was removed ? Mr jDEAKLN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. The duty of 6d. per gallon is still being collected pending passing of the Bill . 2. Spirits are first distilled as spirits, and the methylation subsequently effected. This is done only by one distiller in New South Wales, so far as is known at present. 3. The Department is not aware that any reduction has been made in the price to the consumer, and such is not likely till the reduction becomes law (but see reply to next question). 4. The general manager of the company distilling in New South Wales has informed the Department that the price to the consumer will be reduced as soon as the reduction becomes law to the entire extent of the duty taken off.

Before then, they were included in the figures relating to the imports and exports of agricultural implements. We have discovered that certain agricultural implements are not made in the Commonwealth. Among these are handwork rakes and ploughs combined, hay tedders, maize harvesters, maize binders, maize planters, mould-board plates in the rough and not cut into shape, and potato sorters. Potato raisers, or diggers, are reported to have been made at Colac, Woodend, and at Sydney; but it is uncertain whether they are now on the market, and the extent of the business done in them is not known.

'The wide range of values makes it almost impossible to deal satisfactorily with importations of these machines in any other way. The conflict of opinion which has occurred in regard to values is well known, and seems likely to last indefinitely. We have had official intimation from a British Consul in the United States that there is one obvious means whereby the returns made to us, though correct so far as the transit companies are concerned, may be rendered practically useless. There are 68 Tariff. so many opportunities for variation in the different methods of production, and also for the evasion of certificates, that the task of fixing fair ad valorem rates is felt to be one of increasing difficulty. As fast as correct information is obtained in one respect, some new device is brought into play, and an alteration has to be made in the amount of duty levied.",15
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In order to get over that difficulty, it is proposed to inflict a gross injustice.",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No ; in order to prevent injustice, we propose-a specific duty as fairest.",16
19,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does not the Minister's argument show that the valuation placed on the imported harvesters was an improper one?,16
20,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No .,16
21,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Prime Minister has spoken of the transit charges. Did not the Minister of Trade and Customs make a regulation that the transit charges were not to be deducted from the valuation of the harvesters at the port of shipment ?,16
22,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It was urged on behalf of the importers that they were entitled to consideration in respect of the heavy railway charges payable in respect to the conveyance of the machines through America. The British Consul showed, however, that after the implements had been placed on board the train, and had apparently been sealed up they were available at intermediate points. Parts of the implements could be removed and other parts substituted, and. in fact, changes might be made without detection unless we were to employ an armv of observers and informers. Under these circumstances, we consider it fair to impose a fixed duty. The Tariff Commission set out the historv of the development of the stripper harvester, with which, I hope, honourable members are acquainted. They point out that it is distinctly Australian in origin, ancl that the local manufacturers have a special claim upon the people of the Commonwealth.",16
23,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The report of the Commission does not show that the machine is of distinctly Australian origin.,16
24,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"A report signed by the Chairman sets out that fact, and the report of the dissenting members of the Commission does not, in any effective fashion, traverse it. In view of these particular circumstances of the case we are [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff. asking honourable members, if they accept the principle laid down in the report signed by the Chairman of the Commission, to subject the machines to a fixed duty instead of to the extremely variable duty levied upon an ad valorem basis.",16
25,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,A r e the reports of the British Consul available?,16
26,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am not in a position to say whether, or not, they were laid upon the table, but I have seen them. They relate to individual cases, and come not from a trade rival, but from an official who has no interest in the business. Let honourable members take into consideration the difficulties with which we have been beset, and those which we shall certainly have to face. They will then agree with the Government that the proper way in which to deal with these three classes of agricultural implements, and the only, way in which we can avoid conflicts in order to secure protection to the Australian manufacturer is by imposing a fixed duty instead of an ad valorem impost. When we come to the other implements I shall point out that it is proposed to levy a duty upon, the parts of implements at a rate of duty differing from that imposed upon the completed article.",16
27,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is as regardsonly a particular class of parts-malleabl e castings.,16
28,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,E x a c t l y . But in the opinion of the officers of the Department it is inadvisable to make a distinction between malleable castings and any other parts. The principle laid down in the Customs Act. and which has been followed hitherto is that all parts shall be charged at the same rate of duty that is levied on the completed machines. By this means difficulties in administration are avoided.,16
29,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is the 2jd. per lb. proposed to be levied on the parts equivalent to the rate of duty levied upon the completed machines?,16
30,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am told that the 2 d . 1 rate, taken all through, would work out in some cases at below £ 1 6 per machine, ancl in other cases at more than that amount, but, taking all the parts, 2§d. per lb. would average out at about £ 1 6 per machine.",16
31,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The evidence before the Commission shows that it would work out at about £ 2 5 per machine.,16
32,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is quite true in regard to some of the parts. They vary in value very considerably, some of them being much more expensive than others in proportion to weight. According to the evidence supplied to me the average is a fair one.",16
33,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Has the Minister any information as to the average weight of the machines ?,17
34,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is not ready to my hand at the present moment.,17
35,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They weigh 26 cwt. 1,17
36,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"This is probably the proper time at which to repeat to honourable members the conditions which we propose to attach to the imposition of these duties. In the first placeWith regard to stripper harvesters, the Bill will provide that the cash price of the 5 f t . harvester must be reduced by the end of 1906 to £70, and of the 5 f t . 6 in. harvester to with a further reduction by the end of rgo7 1 0 >£ 5 D m a £ 7 ° respectively. Failing such reductions, power will be taken to reduce the import duties by Proclamation or Resolution of the House to an amount to be determined by such Proclamation or Resolution not to be less than one-half of the new duties imposed. These are very extreme reductions indeed, bringing down the price of the local harvester to the value which has been put upon the imported harvesters. This condition should place it beyond all question that the same treatment-and , indeed, if allowance be made for the selling cost, more severe treatment-is being meted out to the Australian manufacturer as to the importer. Provision will also be made that additional protection shall be suspended if , after one year from the passing of the Act, fair wages are not being paid. This is in accordance with the report of the Commission, and is to be embodied in the Bill.",17
37,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is in accordance with one part of the report, but not with the report of the Commission.",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , the honourable and learned member is quite correct. I am referring to the report which was signed by the Chairman. There are two reports, signed by an equal number of the members of the Commission. I do not wish to be misunderstood! and shall in future refer to the report to which I am alluding as the "" Chairman's report.""",17
39,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Prime Minister should refer to it as one report of the Commission.,17
40,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"On e report is signed by the Chairman and certain members, and [139] 6 the other by other members equal in number. It is further proposedMalleable and other castings for agricultural implements (other than stripper harvesters and strippers) will be dutiable at the same rates as the complete implements, under section 140 of the Customs Act 1901. Wooden parts of harvesters and strippers will also be dealt with under section 140 of the Customs Act. I shall make other information available as soon as it reaches me. I have given honourable members the advantage of the information already prepared, and trust they will see that, under the conditions proposed to be enforced-cuttin g down of the prices of machines in this drastic fashion, and requiring fair wages to be paid within one year, or else the duty will be reduced by more than 50 per cent - w e shall be afforded an ample guarantee that £ 7 5 , the. manufacture of the Australian implements will be conducted on lines fait to all those engaged in the industry and to the purchasers.",17
41,Mr THOMAS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,How would the Prime Minister define reasonable wages ?,17
42,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"So far as Victoria is concerned, that point would be decided according to the decisions of the Wages Boards. In other cases, they would be determined according to the current rate of wages paid in the locality, under a power similar to that vested in the Minister of Trade and Customs with regard to the sugar industry in Queensland. The conditions to which I have referred are imposed in connection with no other industry, and afford the best possible proof that our proposals are made not in the interests of the manufacturers, or of their employees, bu? of the whole community. The purchaser will be protected in regard to prices, and the employees will be protected as regards their wages. We assess the value of the Australian machines at the gazetted price of the imported article.",17
43,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is the Prime Minister willing to give the employees the benefit of the whole of the proposed increase of duty ?,17
44,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Does the honourable member suppose, if that could be done, that we could reduce the price of the implements at the same time? The farmers will obtain the benefit of the proposed new airangement, because the prices will be reduced to a lower figure.",17
45,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The lowest price proposed to be fixed for the local manufactured implements is £ 2 higher than that at which machines were offered to the farmers of Murtoa four years ago.,17
46,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Thes e are not the same machines that were offered to the farmers four years ago. A difference has been made each year, and the improvement effected in four years is remarkable. The machines have been altered in size, their parts have been changed, and they are, in many respects, entirely different from those previously offered.",18
47,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member for Wannon would not know a stripper harvester from a cowbail.,18
48,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I fully understand that the honourable and learned member is not speaking from personal knowledge, but has been supplied with information, and that he is not to blame if it is incorrect.",18
49,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The information I have given was supplied by the Chairman.of the Farmers' Union at Murtoa.,18
50,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not Iknow the gentleman referred to, and I do not refer to that particular person when I say that many of those most active in the agitation against the proposed duties who are connected with farmers' organizations, have really been acting in the interests of the importers.",18
51,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is absolutely inunions. correct in regard to the gentleman to whom I referred. It is necessary to be a farmer in order to be a member of a farmers' union, and this gentleman has never been connected with any importers' organization.",18
52,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable and extraordinary learned member is not fair. I expressly stated at the outset that I did not know the person to whom he referred, and went on to allude to others who had been invariably actively agitating, in some cases by writing letters to the newspapers, not signed by ItheSr own name's. The honourable and learned member has stated that it is not necessary to be a farmer in order to be member of a farmers' association. I know it ",18
53,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I said that it was cessary.,18
54,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I know a number of individuals who are members of so-called farmers' unions who have never been, farof the Opposition? mers in any sense of the term. My desire has been to briefly submit the facts that I have had collected in response the requests of honourable members for formation, and to' explain the conditions which the Government propose to establish in connection with the levying of these new duties. For my own part-givin g my opinion for what it is worth, because I do not pretend to have special knowledge on the subject-afte r having read the report signed by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, I am very strongly of opinion that the circumstances of the case are to be met only by the imposition of a fixed duty, and trust the Committee will accept it .",18
55,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Wannon) [2.58] - I can see plainly that the Prime Minister is under a misapprehension as to' the nature of farmers' unions. They are composed of farmers only, who have united for the purpose of co-operative dealing. The Prime Minister probably had in his mind certain political bodies; but the farmers' unions to' which I refer consist of farmers who have united for the purpose of buying machines and implements, cornsacks, &c.",18
56,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member is quite right; but the organizations to which I referred are called by the same name.,18
57,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"- No; they are all called by a different name. They are absolutely distinct bodies, and the farmers' - unions, so far as I am aware, have no political colour-, but are mejrely trade I think that it is a matter for regret that we have not had the privilege of listening to an exposition by the Minister of Trade and Customs of the reasons which have actuated the Government to depart so widely from the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. It seems to me an circumstance that whenever we have a full-dress debate upon a matter affecting the Customs Department, the Minister of Trade and Customs is almost absent. When a question of this character is under consideration, it is proper that the Minister, who is charged with the administration of the Department, a should be in attendance in the House. It is greatly to be regretted that, so far, whenever Tariff debates have been in progress the honourable gentleman who presides ovei nethe Customs Department has been conspicuous by his absence.",18
58,Mr CHANTER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What about the leader Mr -""ROBINSON - The leader of the Opposition is not charged with the adminito stration of a Department. When an honinorable member is administering a Department, and is responsible for its administration, he should be present in the House when measures affecting his Department are being discussed. It is about two years since the Tariff Commission was appointed to inquire into complaints which were made in various quarters that certain industries in Victoria were languishing!-that they were being strangled",18
59,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The complaints were not confined to Victoria.,19
60,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Then I withdraw the word ""Victoria"" in deference to the wish of the honourable member. It was alleged that certain industries were languishing, and that unless they received, at the earliest possible moment, an increased measure of protection they would collapse. That is why the Tariff Commission was appointed. Its purpose was to inquire into the facts connected with particular trades, to ascertain whether those trades were languishing, and whether it was necessary to grant them extra protection in order to keep them alive. In the case of the distilling industry with which we dealt a few weeks ago, it was conclusively proved - bot h to the Commission and to this Committee-that unless some measure of protection in excess; of that which they ready enjoyed were granted to the manufacturers they could not continue operations. Consequently a unanimous report from the members of the Commission was presented to this House. But so far from the sworn evidence tendered to the Commission disclosing that the industry which we are now considering is a languishing one, an examination of that evidence reveals that it is one of the most virile and prosperous industries, from an employer's stand-point, that exists in the Commonwealth. At this stage, I intend to saynothing regarding its position 'from a wages point of view, because there are honourable members in this Committee who are entitled to speak with more authority on that subject than I am. But from an employer's stand-point the manufacture of stripper harvesters is one of the most fitable and growing industries that Australia has yet seen. ' Let us examine the position from the point of view of the growth which has taken' place in the manufacture of agricultural implements. I take my information from the latest Victorian figures which were published only a few days ago. Of course, these figures do not differentiate between the persons who are engaged in the manufacture of stripper havesters and those who are employed in [139]- 2 the manufacture of other agricultural implements. I find that in Victoria in 1902 there were 789 hands employed in the in-, dustry; in 1903, 1,114; in 1904, 1,496; and in 1905, 1,624. Thus, in an industry which is alleged to be languishing, and to have been more or less strangled through the want of adequate protection, there has been an increase in the labour employed within the short space of four years of more than 100 per cent.",19
61,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There were more than that number of hands employed in Victoria.,19
62,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have thefiguresrelating to Victoria in my possession. I am not like the honourable member, who relies upon his memory for his facts, and upon his imagination for his original illustrations. I hold in my hand the official re-, turns compiled by the Government Statist of Victoria. I find that in 1905 there were in Australia 2,799 persons employed in the agricultural implement trade- a distinct advance upon the number of those who were engaged in the industry prior to that year. When we see such a steady growth of emal- ployment in any industry, we may fairly conclude that it is progressing. But I would point out that there has also been a steady growth in the number of these implements exported. According to the figures supplied by the Prime Minister, there were 418 stripper-harvesters of Australian origin exported ""in 1905, whereas during the first six months of the present year no less than 484 of these machines were exported. I come now to the production and sale of the locallv-manufactured harvesters.",19
63,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What about the imports? Why does not the honourable and learned member give us the figures relating to them ?,19
64,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"'Perhaps the honourable member will permit me to develop my argument in my own way. ""I hold in my hand a report of an interview with Mr H . pro- V. MCKay, of the Sunshine Harvester Company Ballarat",19
65,Mr MALONEY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is it taken from a comic newspaper ?,19
66,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No newspaper could be half as comic as is the honourable member. The interview is headed "" Australian Industries.""",19
67,Mr RONALD,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,In what newspaper was it published?,19
68,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Melbourne Punch. The interview was supplied by Mr.. H . V. MCKay. That gentleman gives the following figures relating to the sale of locally-made harvesters: - 1901, 1,500; 1902, 500. Honourable members will recollect that 1902 was the year in which the great drought occurred, when orders for these machines were cancelled right and left. Mr MCKay asserts that in 1903 there were 2,000 machines of Australian manufacture sold, in 1904 3,500, and in 1905 4,000. These figures evidence a steady, growth in the sale of Australian harvesters, and show that since 1901 the sale of the machines made by Mr MCKay and his compeers in the trade has increased threefold.",19
69,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But the honourable and learned member must know that the machine of which he is speaking has displaced another machine, which was doing practically the same class of work.",20
70,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am aware that it has almost annihilated the stripper, and that it has superseded the binder in a great many directions.",20
71,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The figures which the honourable and learned member is quoting refer to the total output of machines by all makers?,20
72,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes . The steadygrowth in the sale of locally-made harvesters is an evidence that the industry is progressing, as is also the fact that more hands are employed, and that more machines have been exported. The figures which I have quoted relate to locally-made machines only. There were no machines imported prior to 190T or 1902. wish also to point out that the manager of Mr MCKay's works informed the Tariff Commission upon oath last vear he turned out 1,930 of these machines. That fact proves that the manufacturers engaged in this industryhave not been doing too badly. These figures effectually dispose of the claim the industry is a languishing one. They show that it is a progressive and virile in- ^ 4 3 ..ooo. dustry, and one of which we ought to be proud. In regard to the sales of imported machines, I find from the figures which were presented to the Tariff Commission that in 1902-whic h was the first year during which they were imported in anv quantity-ther e were 160 brought in . In 1903 there were 500 machines imported; in 1904, 1,700; and in 1905, 1,730, of which between 1,350 and 1,400 were sold. If honourable members will look at the imports for 1902 they will see that out of every four machines which were sold only about one was an imported machine. A perusal of the figures relating to 1905 will show that the same proportion is still preserved. Out of every four machines sold, last year only about one was imported, the other three being locally manufactured. I am well within the bounds of accuracy when I say that practically 70 per cent, of the harvesters sold are machines of local origin. The statistics which I have quoted establish the fact that there has been no displacement of locally manufactured harvesters. The machines which have been imported were brought into supplement the output of the local manufacturers, and were not supplanting them. The fact that the output has trebled within the last few years conclusively proves that the Australian industry has not been supplanted', and it also evidences that the machines imported were introduced to supply the demand which existed for them. In the absence of a demand there would not have been that importation. The trade of the local manufacturer has trebled within the last few years, and the importation of harvesters from Canada and America has been the means of supplementing the output of the trade, and of giving those upon the land a wider range of patterns from which to choose.",20
73,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Nonsense . What was the value of the harvesting machinery which was imported in 1900 outside of binders? It was practically nil. I Mr ROBINSON - I think that the honourable member is wrong. The Prime Minister has stated that last year the imthat ports of agricultural implements, n.e.i., were valued at ,£189,000 ; that the harvesters imported numbered 1,730, and were valued at ^114,000; that the binders imported were worth £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 , and that the that agricultural implements which were imported free of duty, were valued at",20
74,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Outsid e of binders, what was the value of the harvesting machinery imported in 1900?",20
75,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I cannot analyze the figures which have been presented by the Prime Minister. It is impossible for any honourable member to do that unless he has the complete run of the Customs Department. The facts which I have presented show that the industry exhibits every sign of virility, that it is characterized by progress, that it is employing a larger number of hands than it did formerly, and that it is yearly doing a larger trade. I think that an examination of the evidence given before the Tariff Commission shows that, not only has there been a large number of machines made locally, but that their manufacture has proved exceptionally profitable. After reading the evidence I venture to say that there have been of late years few industrial concerns in Australia that have proved so profitable as has the manufacture of harvesters. If honourable members will bear with me, I think that I shall be able to substantiate this statement. There is no evidence whatever that the local manufacturers are not making a profit-ever y shred of evidence is in the opposite direction. In answer to question 16820 Mr MCKay said, "" I can frankly admit that business has increased substantially."" Mr James Moore, manager of Robinson and Co., also said that ""none""-meanin g the local manufacturers- "" that I know of are losing."" Again he said, "" My firm is not suffering any loss through the Federal Tariff,"" while later on he said that they were making "" a little more profit"" than before Federation. All this evidence' shows that the trade is a profitable one. I do not desire to reflect on any individual connected with the trade, but I wish to mention the name of one of the largest manufacturers, Mr Hugh MCKay, in order to bring out two very striking facts. In 1897 that gentleman offered to sell his plant and business to the Massey-Harris Company for £10,000 and a position under the company, and two and a half years later he offered to sell to the International Harvester Company for £32,000. an increase within the short period of two and a half years does not indicate that Mr. MCKay's trade was languishing. If any honourable member could secure such a profit within that space of time, I am quite sure that he would be content to "" languish."" In 1899 Mr MCKay's output, according to his evidence before the Commission, was about 300 machines, and today it is somethink like six times greater. His manager says that his output last season consisted of about 1,930 machines. If with an output of less than 500 machines per annum Mr. MCKay was willing to sell his business for £32,000 a short rule-of-three sum shows that he would require something nearer £100,000 for it at ""the present time. I do not begrudge him his success; I only say that these facts show that his trade has not been strangled by foreign competition, but that it is, on the contrary, a very profitable one ",20
76,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If it were not paying, why did he refuse to produce his books when asked to do so by the Tariff Commission ?",21
77,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He was asked again and again to produce his books, but point blank refused to.do so. Witnesses from the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company offered to produce their books, and to lay the whole range of their business before the Commission, provided that Mr MCKay would do the same.",21
78,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hi s books could be tested, and those of the other firms could not.",21
79,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Thei r books could be tested in a case before the Court today, but the Government are doing their best to prevent anything of the kind.",21
80,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What kind of a test could be secured when they sell from themselves to themselves?,21
81,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"We are dealing with the cost of manufacture, and that may be easily tested.",21
82,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It is not such an easy matter as the honourable and learned member appears to imagine.,21
83,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If such a test could not be made no business man would be able to ascertain whether or not he was carrying on at a profit. The extent of the trade, its expansion, and its.general aspect of prosperity all go to prove that the industry is not languishing. It is within the power of the local manufacturers, who toSuch day have 70 per cent, of the trade, to secure 99 per cent, of it, and still make an excellent profit by selling to the farmers at a very much lower rate than they do. If there were any desire to conserve the interests of the farmers, that course would be adopted. The. present prices could be substantially reduced without destroying the opportunity of .the manufacturers to secure a substantia] profit. In paragraph 16 of their report the Commission estimate the merchandizing profit on the sale of one of these machines for £ 8 1 at a little over £ 1 8 . I hope to show that that estimate is a very modest one. Mr MCKay now turns out nearly 2,000 machines per annum, and, given a profit of £ 1 8 per machine, his annual profit must be something .like £36,000. That is not a bad return on a business which he was ready a few years ago to sell for £32,000. We are entitled to ask why these duties should be increased. Is there any reason why should grant an increased duty to protect a trade in which some persons must be making a cent, per cent, profit? Is there any justification for an increase in the Tariff relating to that trade? If the industryto could be described as a languishing then the same remark would apply to the shipping industry, the tobacco trade, other enterprises which are supposed to be very profitable. If the local manufac* turers of harvesters require more protecweight tion, then other industries carried on people who in some cases are reputed to be very wealthy also deserve greater proa tection. The only justification for the pointment of the Tariff Commission was that this and other industries were being strangled, and that it was necessary to make a thorough inquiry into the whole of be greater the facts relating to them, in order that steps might be taken to prevent destroyed by foreign importers. The Commission's estimate that the merchandizing profit on one of these machines is £ 1 8 is certainly a very low one. It is upon the assumption that it costs £ 4 1 to build one of these machines here. I think I can show that the cost to some manufacof turers carrying on business on a fairly large scale is considerably less. In the first place a Mr James MCGregor, who gave machines, evidence before the Tariff Commission, that Mr N . B. MCKay had assured him that it cost his firm' £ 3 0 to manufacture and place one of his machines in the field.",21
84,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What machine was he referring to?,22
85,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He was referring to From be a statement made three and a half years fairly ago by Mr N . B. MCKay.,22
86,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The machine then manufactured was a very different one from that now being produced.,22
87,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The only difference is that machines now being manufactured are of somewhat simpler construction, cost less to manufacture. Mr Weickhardt, who was formerly employed by Mr MCKay, said the cost was about .£30.",22
88,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Would the - honourable is J£ 7> and learned member accept the evidence a man whom he had had to discharge for his own protection?,22
89,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"When a witness was sent from MCKay's factory to rebut Mr. Weickhardt's evidence""' he was 'asked whether he proposed to deal with the question of cost, but very wisely declined to be drawn. Mr MCKay has not contradicted we any of these statements, but, since some honourable members appear to feel aggrieved when I refer to these witnesses, I shall refrain from making further , quotations from their evidence, and direct attention the testimony of Mr Rees Rees, manaone, ger for Hawke and Company. This witness was the only man who "" gave the .show and away."" When he was asked what was the cost of manufacture, he replied .that it was 3d. per lb. all round, and that the of one of his machines was between by 26 cwt. and 27 cwt. Assuming that the weight is 26 cwt., 3d., per lb. gives us 1 total cost of £ 3 7 2s. per machine. Here apwe have the evidence of a manager of a local manufactory having an output of fifty machines per annum-and with a restricted turnover the cost must necessarily",22
90,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the firm in question their being make any other machines?,22
91,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Yes .,22
92,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I understand that they based make other agricultural implements. Mr..ROBINSON - That is so, and the ..firm is a good one. We have the evidence the only witness who was incautious enough to "" let the cat out of the bag,"" that it cost 3d. per lb. to manufacture these or ,£37 2s. to turn out a machine said weighing 26 cwt. That is a shade less 1 than the valuation fixed by the MasseyHarrisCompany, but as they say that it includes ai merchandizing profit in respect of their Toronto house, this estimate is a confirmation of their original valuation. the evidence of Mr Rees it may a large way assumed that a manufacturer in of business would probably turn out these machines at a cost of £ 3 3 o r £S4On the question of the cost of sale there was a conflict of evidence. The International Company informed the Commission that it cost them £ 1 2 to sell a machine; the Massey-Harris Company said and that it cost them £ 1 7 ; whilst Mr. MCKav, although he did not sav definitely what the cost was to him, stated that £ 2 1 would cover it. The mean of the three T a T 1 d that is a very big price to of pay. I am prepared, however, to assume that that is the selling cost, and when we add it to the cost of manufacture, we find that, any price over £ 5 4 would give a profit to the local manufacturer. These figures show that, as a matter of fact, a man like Mr MCKay, who can turn out these machines at a low cost, would be able to secure a profit; at any price over £ 5 0 ; that the whole trade could be secured by a reduction of the selling price to a level which would still afford the local manufacturer a reasonable profit. If these machines were sold at £ 5 0 or £ 5 5 each, there would be no necessity for the firms concerned to advertise extensively, because it is the price after all that tickles the public fancy. With a reduction to something like £ 5 5 per machine a large proportion of the cost of selling incurred by Air. MCKay and others would disappear. They would secure the whole market, and it would be unnecessary for them as at present to publish large advertising cartoons in the Sydney press, or' interviews and paragraphs in every country newspaper. It would likewise be no longer necessary for them to employ artists of greati ability to draw, (excellent advertising pictures, and in other directions the selling cost' would be cut down. If the price were reduced in the way I suggest, there could be a great saving in advertising and other selling expenses, because the reduction would give a most effectual advertisement for which nothing would have to be paid. If the manufacturers were satisfied with a 'profit of £ 5 on each machine sold, the sale of 2,000 - whic h is the present output of one maker --woul d yield a profit of ,£10,000 per annum. Most of us could exist on an income as large as that. In my opinion, it is possible to reduce the prices of the locally-made machines enormously, and yet obtain a profit of £ 5 each. That is shown by the particulars as to cost of manufacture revealed by one maker. The cost of selling was variously estimated by several witnesses, but if the mean of the amount so stated is taken, and added to the cost of manufacture, it will be seen, on deducting the total from the price charged to the farmer, that the profit obtained is entirely disproportionate. The evidence put before the Tariff Commission shows that 99 per cent, of the Australian business could be secured by local makers without the aid of additional duties, and even without duties, if prices were reduced to a level which would give farmers the implements they need at a reasonable cost, and would return a substantial profit to the manufacturers. Mr MCKay stated that in 1899 his output was only 300 maohines, and the expansion of his industry has taken place under a duty of £ 5 4s. 7d. a machine. This shows that the local manufacturers could get practically the whole of the Australian trade into their hands and drive the importers out of the market, without getting the duties increased, or issuing a paper called the Dairy Farmer and branding it "" O.HMS.,"" or resorting to any other devious method, by taking the straightforward course of reducing their prices to amounts which would give them a fair profit. The Minister of Trade and Customs and the Prime Minister repeated today that prices are to be reduced. They spoke of this reduction as something wonderful, which would greatly benefit the farmers.",22
93,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am told that some of the manufacturers say that they cannot face it.,23
94,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I . shall show how they faced it in the past. The Prime Minister says that the cash price must be re duced to a certain sum, and I therefore ask him what he will do if , of . twenty manufacturers, fifteen reduce their prices and the remaining five do not? Will the duty be increased ? Or will it be reduced ? Or will it remain as it is?",23
95,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Government have not thought of that yet.,23
96,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I regret the nonattendance of the Minister of Trade and Customs when matters affecting his Department are being discussed, because we are entitled to know whether the Government have a scheme to meet this difficulty. What steps are to be taken if some of the manufacturers refuse to reduce their prices? Then, again, suppose that one manufacturer goes a mile or two beyond Braybrook, and evades the conditions imposed by the Victorian Wages Boards, what is to be done? Is the duty to be reduced or is it to be increased ?",23
97,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and le'arned member is looking round for trouble.,23
98,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am showing that the baits which are being held out to the farmers and workers respectively are merely sprats to catch mackerel, because any spry, progressive manufacturer, capable of writing the interviews I have here, could gallop through the proposed restrictions. Such a. man could put on the market what he might call his "" stripper-harvester, 1907 pattern,"" selling it at the Government price, but asking a higher price for an "" extra special harvester."" His ordinary harvester might meet the conditions as to 1 price; but might not be his best harvester. It might, indeed, be a deliberate impairment of his standard, being sold only to those who were foolish enough to buy it because of the price, the first quality machines being pushed and charged highly for. Another point I wish to make is that the proposed concessions are to ba given only to those who can pay spot cash. The majority of farmers buy on time, and there is nothing in the proposed conditions to benefit those who have to pay in two or three instalments.",23
99,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Tweedledee .,24
100,Mr ROEINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No doubt, the honourable member is in the happy position of being able to write a cheque for what he buys; but there are many farmers who have to get promissory notes, and to obtain fifteen to eighteen months' terms when they purchase machines. These persons are to receive no concession. If the Government are in earnest about this matter, and mean to give genuine concessions to the farmers, and to-, secure to the workers that which they have promised",24
101,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is not their intention.,24
102,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I doubt if it is. As regards the proposed reduction in price, I think that I shall be able to show,that it is a mere bluff, and a sham of the most hollow character. When speaking on 28th August, the Minister of Trade and Customs said-and his remarks are reported in Hansard, at page 3444The Bill , which I shall not prepare until the motion has been dealt with, will provide that the cash price of 5-feet stripper-harvesters must be reduced by the end of 1506 to £70. I wish to emphasize the point that the Tariff Commission recommended that the price should not exceed £ 8 1 . That, to my mind, would be an outrageous charge.",24
103,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then the honourable gentleman does not think that ^65 is a fair price for the imported machines ?,24
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have heard that statement so often that it is unnecessary for the honourable member to repeat /*.,24
105,Mr LONSDALE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But the two things * Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I listen again to a tirade of abuse such as to which I have been subjected. The Bill will also provide that the price of the 5 ft. 6 harvester .shall be reduced by the end of . £75i 0 Mr ROBINSON' - They can be bought for SirW ILLIAM LYNE - The honourable and learned member goes about the country talking machines can be bought for. in a blustering way of things about which he knows absolutely nothing. I shall show how little he knows of this subject. That, is what passes for debate with the Minister of Trade and Customs. The reduction of price referred to cannot take effect until the ist January, 1907.",24
106,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable and learned member cannot know what is happening today. If he did, he would not make that statement.",24
107,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Minister was dealing with cash prices throughout.,24
108,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable and learned member know that the reduced prices are in force today?,24
109,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have here some price lists which will show exactly what the present prices are. The Minister, when endeavouring to show that I knew nothing about this matter, read from the price list of Hugh Lennon, which he said bore out his statements, though, as a matter of fact, it bears out mine. Mr Lennon's price for a 5-ft. machine', type A, is £ 7 5 if paid for by a promissory note, due March, 1907. That' was the price the Minister quoted; but he failed to read a footnote stating that if cash in full settle ment is paid the day that the harvester is started a reduction of 5 per cent, will be made; which makes the cash price £ 7 1 ss. Then he told us that the price for 5 f t . 6 in. machines was £ 8 0 ; but a similar reduction for cash brings it down to £ 7 6 . The cash price of a 5 f t . machine is today therefore ,£71 5s., and the Minister next year is going to bring it down to £ 7 0 , a saving of the immense sum of 25s. Similarly, he is going to reduce the price of the 5 f t . 6 in. machine by the large sum of £ 1 . This is the bait held out to the farmers. Messrs. Nicholson and Morrow charge £ 7 0 for their 5-ft. machines, with a reduction of 2 per cent, 1 for cash within thirty days of delivery, or £ 6 8 5s. for cash. For a 5 f t . 6 in. machine their charge is £ 7 5 on terms, or £ 7 3 2.s. 6d. for cash.",24
110,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What is the date of the price list from which the honourable and do not fit. learned member is quoting ? have no wish to Mr ROBINSON - I am quoting from that the price list now being used by the firm's in. travellers. The price fixed by the Minister 1906 is £ 1 15s. more than the 5-ft. machines made by this firm can be bought for, and £ 7 1 . £ 1 17s. 6d. more than their 5 f t . 6 in. That fact shows the worth of this gop to the farmer. The manufacturers are to have a standard price fixed for them- a price which, in some cases, is absolutely higher than that for which machines can now be purchased. In other cases, such as that quoted by the Minister, the reduction upon one harvester will amount to 25s. and upon another to 20s.",24
111,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,When were those price lists issued ?,25
112,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Lennon' s price list, which was quoted by the Minister of Trade and Customs the other day, was issued on 31st July, 1906.",25
113,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What about others ?,25
114,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I did not intend to discuss the price of every machine. I have taken Lennon's price list, because the Minister laid great stress upon it, and endeavoured, by reference to it, to show that he was performing an act of virtue in reducing the price of machines, and that he was making an enormous concession to the farmers. But, according to the price list quoted by him, and which he did not read right through, the reduction proposed to be made is absolutely farcical. In 1901, when the manufacture of harvesters had not assumed anything like its present proportions, and when the methods of production were more costly and the article was not so good, Messrs. Martin and Company, of South Australia, advertised in the Kapunda Herald that they would sell their machines for £ 7 0 cash. They also quoted to the Murtoa Farmers' Union- a union composed of farmers only",25
115,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I think that that was a different machine.,25
116,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I stated that the machine had since been improved.,25
117,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , greatly improved.",25
118,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"And the cost of manufacture has also been reduced. Messrs. Martin and Company offered to sell their machines to the Murtoa Union at £ 6 3 each, if three machines were taken. Their price was £ 7 0 , less 10 per cent., or £ 6 3 . The lowest price, quoted by the Minister as that which would be reached in years to come is, therefore, higher than the lowest price charged in the past. In other words, the lowest price to be charged two years hence is £ 2 in advance of the lowest quotation of two years ago. Thus a nice sop is being offered to the farmers. The attempt to curry favour with them is absolutely farcical, because no reduction whatever is being made in the cost of the.machines. If the object be to confer benefit upon the farmer, the price of the 5-ft. ma. chines should be at once reduced to £ 6 5 , and in the two following years, to £ 6 0 . t and £ 5 5 respectively.",25
119,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why did the Tariff Commission say that the standard price was £81?,25
120,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They stated that at the time they were taking evidence the machines were being sold for £81.,25
121,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Minister stated that £ 8 1 was a monstrous price. the,25
122,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Jus t so. I believe that each and every one of the statements that I have made, except those relating to the quotations from two or three price lists, is supported by the evidence taken by the Tariff Commission. One of the price lists was quoted by the Minister of Trade and 1 Customs, and can, therefore, be accepted by members on both sides 'of the Chamber. We find, upon examination of the evidence ' to. which I refer, that the imported machines have not supplanted the Ideallymanufactured article, but have merely supplemented the supply furnished by Austra-lian manufacturers, and, further, that the importations have not crushed the local manufacture, which is rapidly advancing, and has been doing so for years past. I think, moreover, that the evidence establishes beyond any. chance of contradiction that the importation of harvesters could be absolutely prevented by a substantial reduction in the price of the Australian machines - a reduction which could be made without, precluding the manufacturers from deriving a good profit.",25
123,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,At what price arethe Australian machines sold in Argentina ?,25
124,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is a difficult' question to answer. The natural protection on stripper harvesters is very substantial. In paragraph 14 of the report of the Commission it is stated as a fact that, exclusive of the duty, it costs ^ 1 4 16s. 6d. to import a Massey-Harris machine, and £ 1 2 3s. 6d. to import an International Harvester Company's machine. Upon a cost of -'£38, which was fixed by Mr ""Rees, the import charges would represent a natural protection of over 30 per cent., and if we add to this a duty of £ 1 6 per machine, which is equivalent to an ad valorem duty of upwards of 40 per cent., the protection that is proposed to be given to the Austurers tralian manufacturers will amount to from 75 to 80 per cent. As some compensation for this, the Government are proposing give the farmers-wha t ?- a bounty for the production of peanuts. The wheat grown by our farmers has to be sold for what will fetch in the markets of the world, there is no means available to us for increasnumber ing the return obtained by them. farmers have to take the world's price, yet we are proposing to compel them to buy their machines .at the price fixed Mr MCKay. I do not consider that that is a fair deal. I have taken up a strong position in regard to this question, because repeated requests have been made to me by farmers and farmers' unions-union s composed solely of farmers-to oppose the duty, and because it has been represented to me that an increase of the duty would be detrimental to the farmers. The conleads sumers should receive our first consideration. The conditions proposed to be enforced with a view to safeguard their interests absolutely farcical. According to the price , list which the Minister quoted, they are obtain a reduction of from 20s. to 25s. 3 the price of certain machines, whilst gard to others, the prices of which the ister did not quote, they are to obtain no £59 . reduction at all. I wish to say a word or two with regard to the valuation of imported stripper harvesters, which was increased the Minister of Trade and Customs from £ 3 8 to £ 6 5 . The Minister declared, by his action, if not in words, that any man who attempted to import a harvester at a valuation of ,£38 would be dishonest. .1 do not wish to say anything with regard the action of the Minister in connection with the hearing of that case. It is true that promised to allow the importers to prove their case, but afterwards did his level best to prevent them from establishing the fact that ^38 was a fair valuation for their machines. - I think that the report of the Tariff Commission affords absolutely conarriving clusive evidence that the valuation I have mentioned is a fair one, and I defy any man who is accustomed to weigh evidence read the reports of the Commissioners and say that they convey any other impression.",25
125,Mr BRUCE SMITH,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is not a question of weighing evidence, because all the dence is upon the one side.",26
126,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"As the honourable and the deduction learned member says, ' there is practically no no evidence on the other side. Manufaccarrying on operations in different localities gave evidence independently of each other that £ 3 8 was a fair valuation, to and there can be no reasonable doubt that - their testimony is reliable. The honourable member for Wentworth has just handed to it me a return which was supplied in comand pliance with his request relating to the of stripper harvesters produced in Our Australia. From this it appears that in and 1905 the approximate number was 2,700, and it is added, "" It is believed that the by production is increasing."" That does not coincide with the statement made by Mr. MCKay. This is an official return furnished by the Government with regard to what is said to be a languishing industry. If the industry is being strangled, as has been stated, strangulation has a different effect upon the harvester industry than upon any other, because, apparently, it to an expansion of trade and more profit. Conclusive evidence as to the impropriety of. the Minister's action is - afare forded by the proposals now before us. to - He assessed the value of the imported upon machines at ,£65. He therefore assumed in rethat the wholesale price at the port of Minshipment, exclusive of all charges, was Now he says that the retail price in - Australia ought to be from £ 6 5 to ,£70. Does not that show conclusively that the by Minister feels that his valuation of £ 6 $ cannot be sustained. If the selling charges amount to £ 1 7 , whilst the import charges represent an additional £ 1 4 , it is ridiculous to say that £ 5 9 is a fair price to fix a? the wholesale cost at the port of shipto ment. From whatever aspect this question may be viewed, it must be seen that the ache tion of the Minister in raising the valuation of imported harvesters was most improper, and that his subsequent action in refusing to allow the question of value to be tested was even moire blameworthy. The Prime Minister has referred to the difficulty of at a fair estimate of value. There are difficulties in regard to the valuation of many implements, but the facts which to the Minister quoted had nothing to do with the case, because the honourable member for Gippsland, when he was Minister of Trade and Customs, went fully into the question of transit charges, and arrived at the coneviclusion that the time had come when we ought to value the machines according to price at the port of shipment, and that internal should be made in respect to transit charges. I do not think such deductions should be allowed, because it is undoubtedly to the advantage of British traders that the internal transit charges should not be taken into account. There is a great deal to be said in favour of imposing a fixed duty. I never thought simply be to grease the fat pig. that the time would come when I should be found advocating specific duties, but after the extraordinary action of the ister of Trade and Customs in endeavourduty. ing to prevent a fair valuation being placed upon imported harvesters, I think there a good deal of justification for imposing specific duties, which will restrict very largely the powers of a Minister havever ing neither discretion nor judgment. That is the only consideration would induce me to support ""a fixed instead of an ad valorem dujy. I think, however, that there is no justification for that. imposing a duty of £ 1 6 per machine. It is ridiculous to say that it represents same rate of duty that the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission proingenuity posed. Any one who makes such a statehave ment must have a considerable amount hardihood. Any man reading the report must be an extraordinary individual if comes to any other conclusion than that £ 4 1 is a fair valuation, and that valorem duty of 25 per cent, upon that amount would represent only £ 1 0 I am quite prepared-if I can extract the information-to ask those members of the Tariff Commission who signed the report in favour of an increased duty whether they do not consider that ^ 4 1 is a fair valuation for these machines, and whether the Tariff which they advocate is not equipractically valent to £ 1 0 5s. per machine? I do intend' to advocate a specific duty upon stripper harvesters, though I believe that - the imposition of such a duty would save considerable trouble. I do not believe in specific duties, but I do think that i levied a fixed duty in the present instance the Minister of Trade and Customs would be prevented from branding the importers of these machines as swindlers, and from denying them the opportunity of justifying themselves before a Court of law. To mind, that is the only thing which would justify the imposition of a specific duty upon these machines. There is - absolutely no necessity for an increase in the rate of duty. The evidence which was given before the'Tariff Commission clearly proves that the Government proposal not necessary to prevent the industry from being strangled. The very return which has been presented by the Prime Minister evidences that it is going ahead, and that it has made great progress. To grant it an increased measure of protection would The local manufacturers of harvesters can obtain the whole trade of the Commonwealth Minwithout any increase in the old rate of That being so, I hope that the Committee will not agree to this resolution. It is seems to me that the gentlemen who have engineered the agitation for an increased duty are a set of the cutest men who have taken part in a parliamentary struggle. I have never heard of an agitation which that has been so ably worked.",26
127,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member cannot blame them for,27
128,Mr ROBINSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly . . Whether the we agree with these proposals or nqt, we must bear testimony to the great skill and which the gentlemen to whom I referred have displayed in putting of their case before the public. They have never lost an opportunity of reviling their he trade competitors, of vilifying them, of stabbing them in the baok; and they have an ad drawn a ""poor mouth"" from the very commencement of the agitation. They have 5s. consistently claimed that the industry is languishing when all' the evidence goes to show that the profits which are being made in it are enormous, and that it is a growing and progressive industry. The Minister of Trade and Customs in submitting these resolutions of the 28th August said nothing in support of the pronot posal to levy an increased duty upon harvesters. The additional measure of protection which the ""Government wish to extend to the manufacturers of these machines will simply be in the nature of a free gift. f we I believe that there are industries which require an increased measure of protection if they are to be preserved. Thai was notablv the position of the distilling industry. But I say positively that this particular industry would yield the manufacmy turers a very big profit if no duty whatever was levied upon harvesters. For these reasons I hope that the Committee will not countenance the resolution, but will restore old the old duty of £ 5 4s. ?d. per machine, which was levied upon these machines prior to the arbitrary and very extraordinary acis tion which was taken by the Minister of Trade and Customs in increasing their valuation for Customs purposes. A",27
129,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Bendigo) [4.5] In the first place, I desire to compliment the Prime Minister upon the very moderate and business-like manner in which he initiated thjs discussion. I am sure that the cause will not suffer through being in his hands. It is not my intention to make such a long and elaborate speech as that which was delivered by the honourable and learned member who has just resumed his seat. Everything which fan be urged in favour of the recommendations submitted by the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission are fully set forth in their report, and I certainly could not improve the statement which is there presented by any speech which I might make here. It is naturally my determination and that of my colleagues who signed that report to stand by it, and to defend it in every legitimate manner. I would point out that' the report in favour of levying an increased duty on harvesters was signed by myself as Chairman of the Commission representing Victoria, by Mr Frank Clarke representing New South Wales, by Senator Higgs representing Queensland, and by Senator MCGregor representing South Australia. We are the four protectionist members of the Commission. I ' would point out that our recommendations commenced with the paragraph in which we suggestThat in trade between the States and with other countries combines and agreements between importers, manufacturers, and dealers in machinery and implements in restraint of trade, and fixing or regulating selling prices, clared illegal, and made a criminal offence. The reason underlying that recommendation is that in the course of our investigations we found that during 1904-5 there was, an agreement signed by the leading manufacturing firms in Australia, and also by the International Harvester Company and the Massey-Harris Company under which the selling price of harvesters was fixed at £ 8 1 . The effect of that agreement was to raise the price of harvesters in some cases from £ 7 0 to £ 8 1 , and in one case to lower it from £ 8 5 to £ 8 3 or £ 8 2 . Mr MCKay had the option of selling his machines at a little higher price than the standard fixed by the combine. We found that that agreement was calculated to be prejudicial to the interests of the public, and the recommendation which I ' have read was written long before *he initiation of the Australian InTariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff. . _ dustries Preservation Bill by the Ministry. As honourable members will recollect, I strongly supported a clause in that Bill which makes the establishment, of combines in restraint of trade an illegal act. Our second recommendation was(b) That the duty on stripper-harvesters be as follows :- . Stripper-harvester, existing duty to remain unaltered, ad valorem, 12^ per cent. Additional duty per machine, subject to conditions hereinafter provided, ad valorem, 12% per cent. That was arrived at by a consideration of the protective duty which was levied under the Victorian Tariff at the time of the establishment of the Federation. Speaking upon my own behalf, I say emphatically that I am not prepared to support a higher duty than 25 per cent. ad. valorem 0 upon the £ 3 8 machine. This proposed increase of duty was to be accompanied not only by the prohibition of combine agreements, but also by other conditions which read as follows:Provided that if , within two years after the passing of the Act, the retail price of stripper harvesters made in Australia has been raised above £ 8 1 ; or if , after the expiration of two years from the passing of the Act, the retail price of stripper-harvesters made in Australia has not been reduced to £ 7 0 ; or if , after the expiration of one year from the passing of the Act, the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters in Australia are not paying their workmen a fair and reasonable rate of wages, the Governor General may, upon the receipt of a joint A d dress fiom the Senate and the House of Representatives, certifying to the foregoing effect, by Proclamation, suspend the collection of such, additional duty of 12^ per cent, for such perio-i be deas ni iv be deemed advisable. In the first place there is a condition that there shall be no increase at any time above the price mentioned in the combine agreement, namely, £ 8 1 .",28
130,Mr MCLEAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is that combine still in existence ?,28
131,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No , it was dissolved towards the end of 1905. But I would point out that, under our recommendations, if the manufacturers at any time proposed to increase the price of these machines above £ 8 1 Parliament; could intervene to prevent it. But in addition to the prohibition against an increase in the price, a distinct condition is-imposed that there must be a reduction in the selling price of these machines withintwo years after the passing of the Acta reduction from £8.1 to £ 7 0 . Originally £ 7 0 was the price at which some of the lower class machines were sold.. We suggested that reduction because the manufacturers themselves undertook-if they received additional substantial protection-to reduce the selling price of the machines within two years from £ 8 1 to £ 7 0 . They voluntarily agreed to do so, and some of them offered to sign a bond to that effect. The reduction in question is not a mere arbitrary invention upon the part of the protectionist members of the Commission. We took the manufacturers at their word, and we made our recommendations conditional upon certain guarantees and concessions being made to the users of these machines and to the workmen who are engaged in their manufacture.",28
132,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"How , is the honourable and learned member going to bind the manufacturers to such conditions?",29
133,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I will deal with that aspect of the matter presently.,29
134,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What was the third condition imposed?,29
135,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It was that a fair and reasonable wage should be paid by the manufacturers to their workmen ; otherwise, upon the adoption of a joint address by both Houses of Parliament the additional duties might be suspended.",29
136,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What would happen if one firm of manufacturers paid fair wages whilst other firms did not?,29
137,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I assume that Parliament would not agree to continue the collection of the additional duties if it found that fair wages were not being paid to their employees by the bulk of the manufacturers. If Parliament, upon inquiry, found that the majority of those engaged in the trade were not being paid a fair and reasonable rate of wage, and that the duty was being pocketed by the manufacturers, it would pass the joint address to which I have referred. I assume that we should take a common sense view of the matter. I now wish to draw attention to a few. paragraphs in the report, in which the reason underlying the recommendations of the protectionist members of the Commission are summarized. The first reason will be found in paragraph 8 of our conclusions, which readsThat both the Canadian and American companies have imitated and copied Australian-made stripper-harvesters; that, in so doing, we cannot find any evidence that they have violated any patent rights. It is proved conclusively that the stripperharvester was invented in Australia-that it was evolved as the result of experience of, and the expenditure of money by, Australian agriculturists and inventors, and that it was copied by the representatives of American and Canadian manufacturers. We found that, as a matter of fact, these foreign firms did nothing illegal in copying these machines, and that there had been no violation of patent rights; but that, since they had taken this action, the Legislature might be fairly recommended to discriminate in the imposition of Customs duties in favour of the local manufacturers of machines that were invented and brought up-to-date here. The next reason for our recommendation will be found in paragraph 18, which reads as follows :1 That notwithstanding the heavy importing expenses, in addition to the duty which the Massey-Harris and the International Harvester Companies have had to pay in order to place their machines on the Australian market, it is quite evident they have been able to enter the field of Australian competition. That they have competed successfully with the Australian stripper-harvester makers, that Ihey are graduallygaining ground, and increasing their hold on the Australian market, are shown by the heavy increase in their imports of stripper-harvesters, which in 1900 were n i l , while in 1905 they were 1,730. That the explanation of such successful competition is the more favourable industrial conditions in the United States and Canada than in Australia; that in those countries labour, although in some instances more highly paid, is in reality cheaper, being based upon a system of piece-work, or payment by resultsWe then go on to show that the raw materials are also cheaper in Canada and America than they are in Australia. The next reason for our recommendation appears in paragraph 20That we are of opinion that the MasseyHarris and the International Harvester Companies make stripper-harvesters at a cheaper rate than the manufacturers in Australia, ancl that they are able, notwithstanding the natural protection of distance and shipping charges, as well as the duty, to go on increasing their imports to swamp, and eventually capture, the whole of the Australian trade in stripper-harvesters; that such a result would be a great calamity to Australian trade, commerce, and industry, and would in its ultimate consequences be most injurious and disastrous to .farmers, who would thereby be placed at the mercy of foreign organizations for their supplies; that such organizations, after having effaced local factories ancl industries, would be able to dictate terms and to name their own prices without the health) check of local competition; that we are, therefore, of opinion that the existing duty of i x i per cent, not having proved sufficient to shut out or limit the growing volume of importer! implements and machinery, it is desirable thai there should be an increase in the present duty : at the same time such increased duty should be accompanied by safeguards and securities foi the protecting of the interest of farmers as well as for the protection of workmen engaged in the manufacture of implements and machinery in Australia. The last reason is as follows: That we are of opinion that .the result of the proposed increased duty will be to reduce importations and to augment local production and output; that the greater the local production and output the less will be the prime factory cost; lhat therefore the selling price of stripper-harvesters will not necessarilyj and certainly ought not to, be raised by local manufacturers by reason of such increased duty. They say they do not hope or desire to take advantage of the increased duty, or to raise the price of the stripper-harvesters to consumers. I do not wish to repeat these arguments. They are already in black and white, and I merely draw attention to them as indicating the reasons on which we arrived at the conclusion that there should be an increased duty. Such being the case, the question arises as to whether the increased duty should be an ad valorem or a fixed one. We arrived at the determination that there should be an ad valorem rate. I frankly admit that the question is a debatable one, and I should not quarrel with the Government for proposing an alternative fixed duty, provided that it was based upon the ad valorem equivalent, and that there was no augmentation of the proposed protection of 25 per cent, ad valorem. The point that we have to consider is whether or not the duty of ,£16 per machine proposed by the Minister is equal to an ad valorem duty of. 25 per cent. I am. strongly of opinion that it is not. The Minister, whilst accepting our recommendation as to an ad valorem rate of 25 per cent., has refused to adopt our finding that, as a matter of fact, the value of these machines in the country of origin-and that is the Customs test-is ,£38 odd. Twenty-five per cent, on that valuation, with 10 per cent, added, yields, approximately, £ 1 0 per machine. I am prepared to accept a fixed duty of £ i o , which is equivalent to the ad valorem rate. I understand, however, that the Minister, while agreeing to the ad valorem rate of 25 per cent., does not accept the valuation of £ 3 8 'arrived at by us, and wishes the Committee to adopt his own estimate of £ 6 5 per machine. There was not a scintilla of evidence given before the Commission to sustain that rough and ready estimate arrived at by the Minister.",29
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was a sheer piece of departmental garrotting. Sir John Quick.,30
139,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It was arrived at upon a bare suggestion made to the Minister by Mr S. MCKay, but unsupported by evidence. As a matter of fact, that suggestion has been absolutely refuted by positive evidence. I believe that he told the Minister that machines! were being sold and delivered in Italy by the Massey-Harris Company at £ 6 5 ; that statement was embodied in an affidavit which! he filed in the Department, and another affidavit was also made to the effect that Messrs. Moore and Tudor, of Buenos Ay res, had bought a machine from the Massey-Harris Company at an invoice price of £ 4 6 4s. 8d. These statements were fully investigated by the Commission, and documentary evidence was submitted to it to the effectthat the Italian selling price of £ 6 5 represented what is called the c.i.f - the cost, insurance, and freight-pric e of the machine delivered at Genoa, whereas the cash equivalent at the Toronto factory of that same machineand only one machine was sold as an experiment-amounte d to only £ 3 8 os. 3d. That evidence was given on oath, and was not successfully refuted.",30
140,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Was any evidence other than that of a representative of the company concerned tendered to the Commission in connection with this question? . Sir JOHN QUICK - No ; the matter could be only within the 'knowledge of a representative of the company. It is obvious that £ 6 5 is not the price in the country of origin. The true test is the price in the markets of the country of origin, and we have evidence on oath that it is £38. We also discovered that the invoice price of £ 4 6 4s. 8d., at which a machine was sold and delivered to Messrs. Moore and Tudor, of Buenos Ayres, was the firm's price, f.o.b., at New York. The transaction was not a cash one-the money was to be paid at some future time.",30
141,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Where is the evidence of this?,30
142,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I decline to answer questions put to me in that way.,30
143,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member should tell us where we car. find the evidence on which He bases his statement.,30
144,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable and learned member could not have been following me. The net cash equivalent at factory of this f.o.b. price of £ 4 6 4s. 8d. was .£38 13s., or almost the same as the price of the machine sold in Italv. I have (riven two instances of the way in which the Minister's estimate was arrived at, whilst another relates to the price at which machines were sold and delivered to Messrs. Clutterbuck and Co., of Adelaide. It was stated that they had bought machines for £ 4 0 15s., and that was represented as the value in the country of origin. transpired, however, that the cash equivalent was only £ 3 9 14s. 2d., and that the difference between that amcjunt and the £ 3 8 standard represented the profit of the Melbourne agency. Therefore, it appears that in these three cases, in respect of which the Minister had probably been misled by the affidavit made by Mr S. MCKay, the factory value of the machine amounted approximately to £ 3 8 . The next important piece of evidence submitted to the Commission was a declaration, or statement, made by Mr F. W. MCMichael, chief inspector of the Customs Department, at Ottawa, Canada. An application for a valuation was made to the Canadian Commissioner of Customs, to whom Mr MCMichael reported in a letter dated 20th October, 1904In respect to the values shown in the invoice attached to the file, viz., 183 dollars, with 2 dollars extra for poles and adjustments, it appears that such values represent the price at which the machines in question are sold at wholesale by the Massey-Harris Company to such countries as require machines of this character, and that this wholesale price has been arrived at on a basis of similar percentage of advance over factory cost as in the case of other manufactured and sold by the Massey-Harris Company to Great Britain and other European countries, South Africa, South America, Manitoba, and the Canadian and Western territories. Upon careful investigation and examination of the books of the Massey-Harris Company, I am satisfied that the invoice price for stripper harvesters, viz., 183 dollars, with 2 dollars extra for poles and adjustments, represents a fair wholesale market value of these machines. In British coinage, $183 represents £ 3 8 2s. 6d. The statement which I have just read seems to supply prima facie evidence that the valuationof harvesters for duty here should not exceed £ 3 8 plus 10 per cent., and therefore the members of the Commission are unable to acquiesce in the Minister's valuation of £ 6 5 , which is evidently based on inaccurate information. He may be legally justified in what he has done, and may have acted in accordance with his lights. I believe that he has invited the-companies affected to take action against the Department with a view to testing the accuracy ot his valuation, and that the, High Court or the Supreme Court of Victoria has ordered a commission to be issued directing an examination into the subject in Canada - It is obvious that unless on cross-examination the information which I have placed before the Committee is upset, the valuation of £ 3 8 must be accepted. A duty of 25 per cent, would It be equivalent on that valuation to a fixed duty of about £ JO a machine. The Tariff Commission sav in paragraph 22 of their conclusions thati f the duty be raised from 12^ to 25 per cent. ad valorem on the invoice value of stripper harvesters, then an invoice value of ^38 odd will yield a duty of £ \ o gs. 2d.; but if the present valuation for duty fixed by the Minister of Customs at ^65 be sustained, which now yields a duty of £& 23. 6d., this, at 25 per cent., will give £16 5s. per machine. A fixed duty of £16 per machine is equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent, on a valuation of £38, which is practically the Minister's proposal. I, for my part, decline to follow his lead in this matter. With all respect to him, I say' that the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission whose conclusion I have read have investigated the subject even more closely than he has done. We heard a great deal of evidence, and formed the opinion that, whilst fair and substantial protection .should be given to allow local manufacturers to keep the Australian market, the duty should not be. made excessive. I see no justification for imposing machines a fixed duty of more than £10 each on machines whose invoiced value is only £3&",30
145,Mr THOMAS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What are these machines sold for?,31
146,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Before the Tariff Commission commenced its inquiries there was an agreement between the importers and the local manufacturers to sell at £ 8 1 . That agreement ceased shortlv after the Tariff Commission commenced its investigations, when the International Harvester Company reduced its price to £-,o. the local makers continuing to sell, at from £ 8 0 to £ 8 1 . I have been told, that since these proposals have been before Parliament the manufacturers have acquiesced in the conditions provided for securing a: reduction in price. I read with a considerable amount of uneasiness a letter which 1 appeared iii the Argus recently, in which it was stated that the proposed extra duty of i 2 per cent, on harvesters had already L resulted in an increase of prices, and that some of the leading manufacturers had raised the price of their machines contrary to the promises made to the Commission. That letter is-dated Wangaratta, 21st August, and is signed "" Farmer."" I have, however, evidence which I think is of more value than an anonymous communication sent to a newspaper, in the shape of a letter received from one of my constituents. It is dated Raywood, 30th August, and is as follows : Sir,- I notice in the speech of Sir William Lyne in the Argus of yesterday he states that the price of harvesters must be reduced to ^'70 and ^£75 by the end of this year, and, in reply to Mr Robinson, he doubted that Colonial machines could be obtained at £70. I beg to inform you that I have been offered the ordinary sized harvester by one of the leading Colonial makers' agents a new machine for the sum of ^'68, payable March, 1907, so therefore I should think that is the true value of same. As you are aware, I am a farmer on a fairly large scale, and, although not a protectionist, think it only faiT that the Colonial makers should have fair protection to make liarvesters on the condition that they pay a fair wage to both men and boys. You ""are at liberty to make whatever use you like of this letter. I think that the proposals of the Tariff Commission may be submitted in the confident belief that they will not result in in creasing the price of harvesters to the consumers. If I thought that the prices to consumers would be increased, I should not have been a party to the recommendation which has been made. I have done my best to surround the concession to the manufacturers with safeguards for the protection of the farmers as well as for the protection of the workmen engaged in the industry. If the recommendation of the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission is accepted by Parliament, the local manufacturers will be put on their metal, and it will demonstrate that protective duties properly adjusted and safeguarded 'do not tend to the increase of prices.",31
147,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"They , have to be surrounded with a lot of barbed wire.",32
148,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I hope that the Ministry will not consider that I have ceeded my proper functions, or that tend to embarrass them. I desire, however, that the recommendations of the Tariff Commission shall be carried into effect, and to give honourable members an opportunity Committee. to vote for a duty of 25 per cent., or, father, a fixed rate equivalent to it , I shall, later on, move the addition to the item ""stripper harvesters"" of the words "" o n and after 5th September, each £ 1 0 .

149,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The free-traders would have given us that three years ago.,32
150,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I supported it then, but I shall not go beyond that rate.",32
151,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"IlJawarr'a) [4.43] - The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has put forward as strongly as he could the arguments which prevailed with the protectionist members of the Tariff Commission in recommending higher duties on harvesters; but those who read the evidence will see that it does not justify their position. Although two reports relating to harvesters have been presented, each signed by four members of the Tariff Commission, it would appear from the statement of the honourable and learned member, and also from the manner in which the protectionist report, recommending an additional 12 per 1 cent, duty, subject to osrtain conditions, has been published throughout Australia, that it is the only report. But, whilst the Chairman and the three protectionist members of the Commission reported in favour of an increase in duty, the four free-trade mem Yours truly, bers of the Commission who had made just WM. GUNN. as careful and full an inquiry reported in quite an opposite direction. In addition to the report signed by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and three other protectionist members of the Commission, a report, to which I desire to direct special attention, was signed by the four free-trade members of the Commission. I , and those who thought with me, adopted as a summary of the evidence more or less relevant to the scope of the inouiry paragraphs 1 to 88 of the report. Honourable members will see how much these paragraphs embrace. We also adopted as substantially accurate the conclusions derived from such evidence, except 9, 18, .20, and 23, which we rejected(a) As being beyond the limits of our Commission ; or (b) not justified by the evidence; or (c) not practicable. I do not think that the honourable and exlearned member for Bendigo or the Prime I inMinister have in the course of their speeches shown that there is the slightest justification for presenting proposals such as those now under the consideration of the We urged, moreover, that the facts brought under our notice did not justify the special prominence given to the complaints with regard to the destructive effects of foreign competition upon the stripper-harvester industry. No facts have since been adduced that afford the slightest ground for the alarmist statements which have been made with""""reference to the dumping of foreign harvesters upon our market, and the strangling of the Australian industry. It appears that from beginning to end the agitation for increased duties has been carried on in the interests of Messrs. MCKay Brothers. No other Australian manufacturer is interested to aiw appreciable extent in the proposal to increase the duties upon stripper harvesters. Moreover, I challenge the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to show that any evidence has been adduced that would justify us in making any concessions to Messrs. MCKay and Company. What is the position? Mr MCKav is carrying on an industry which it is alleged is undergoing a process of strangulation-on e of the industries which the Commission was specially appointed to inquire into. MCKay was asked whether he would let the Commission know the position in which the industry stood, and he declined to give us the desired information. We did not wish to publish the particulars, so that the public outside might be made fully acquainted with Mr MCKay's affairs, but desired the information for our own guidance. I contend that when manufacturers come before the Tariff Commission, and ask for special consideration on the ground that - their industries are in danger of being destroyed, they should be perfectly frank, and tell us exactly how matters stand with them. When Mr MCKay refused to inform us as to the position of affairs. I said, "" If you refuse to let us know the position in which you stand, the only conclusion I can come to is that you are doing so. well that you do not want to let us, or the public, know what profits you are making."" That is practically the position of the harvester industry. Notwithstanding all that has been said by the honourable and learned member Bendigo, Mr MCKav is making a magnificent harvest out of the 'farmers of Australia.",32
152,Mr RONALD,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why should he not?,33
153,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am delighted to think that an Australian manufacturer carrying on business in Melbourne is doing so well.,33
154,Mr TUDOR,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He is not carrying on busiwould ness in Melbourne, because if he did he would be brought within the operation of the Factories Act, and would have to pay his workmen at rates fixed by the Wages Board.",33
155,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is a matter which I shall leave to the honourable member. I am delighted to know that Mr MCKay is doing so marvellously well, but as a repre1 sentative of the Commonwealth, I object to his being permitted to plunge his hands more deeply into the pockets of the Australian farmer. Our farmers labour under many serious disabilities. They have to sell their products in open competition in the markets of the world, and every additional charge that is imposed upon them in connection with the purchase of their machinery and other requisites adds to their already heavy burden. So far from the harvester industry being entitled to any further protection, I should be disposed to deprive it of the protection it already enjoys. If the cost of production is, as has been stated, only about £ 3 8 or £ 4 1 per machine, Mr. Mr MCKay must be making a very handsome profit. If he were content to take a fair profit, the Massey-Harris Company and other foreign competitors would be driven out of the market. They were induced to come here because Mr MCKay and others were so greedy, and wanted such a big profit, that a good margin was afforded for outside competitors. I challenge the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to answer me upon the points which I have raised.",33
156,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Angas) [4.55] - I was very pleased to hear the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, because I think that the fact that he has taken a moderate view of the duties that ought to be imposed affords the strongest possible evidence that could be adduced against the proposal of the Government. It is a significant commentary upon the extravagant demands of some of the manufacturers that the duty recommended by the protectionist members of the Commission is 25 per cent, ad valorem, for whilst that proposed by the Government would be equivalent to a 40 per cent, ad valorem impost. Some of the witnesses who spoke on behalf of the manufacturers advocated a duty of 65 per cent. But the strongest possible testimony as to the weakness of th'eir evidence is afforded by the report of the protectionist members of the Commission, because their leanings naturally be in favour of imposing high duties, rather than otherwise. It i? 86 Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] true, as the honourable and learned member for Illawarra has stated, that we should first consider those industries! which do not at present enjoy any protection. Some honourable members seem to entertain the idea that manufactures alone form the basis of industrial prosperity. What, however, would be the position of our manufacturers! if a serious blow were struck at our agricultural industry, or at our pastoral industry, as the result of reciprocal Tariff arrangements or other conditions? Honourable members must agree that it is to our primary industries we must first look for any stimulus to our industrial prosperity. No protection is now afforded to them, although some pretence has been made to confer a benefit upon them by the imposition of import duties. We have an overflowing supply of wheat, and yet a duty is imposed upon that product, which becomes operative only when it ""ought to be suspended, namely, when famine prices prevail.  contribute thousands of pounds by way of a duty upon wheat.",33
157,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"-That is my point-that a wheat or fodder duty becomes operative only when it should cease to exist-whe n a few members of the producing interests derive an immense profit at the expense of the bulk of the consumers. I say, therefore, that we ought not, while desirous of considering them, to be always hammering away at the interests of the manufacturers only. Some honourable members appear to think that the only barometer to the industrial state of the Commonwealth is supplied by the answer which is given to the question "" How are the manufacturers of Victoria getting along?"" For instance, in reference to the firm in this State whose operations have been frequently mentioned by honourable members, the question has been asked, "" Why should not its members make a big profit ? "" But - the real point is - Why should Parliament be asked to make them better off than they are at the expense of the rest of the community? To my mind, the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo that a trial ought to be made of a sort of compromise duty of about £ 1 0 per machine is a very sensible one.",34
158,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why not fix a lower duty ?,34
159,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No doubt reason suggests that a lower duty should be imposed, and if the honourable member will move in Tariff. that direction I shall support him. But in all these matters it seems to me that we must act in a spirit of compromise.",34
160,Mr WILKS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"At the same time, the honourable and learned member admits that the increased measure of protection proposed would represent a free gift to Mr MCKay.",34
161,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do. ',34
162,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable and learned member for Bendigo cannot justify the position which he has taken up.,34
163,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"At any rate, I welcome the suggestion as one which he has made in a spirit of moderation.",34
164,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He cannot point to any evidence which would justify his suggestion.,34
165,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The only light that I have had thrown upon the question has been gained by a perusal of a portion of the evidence tendered to the Commission, and by a careful reading of the two reports which have been presented. It seems to me perfectly plain that the variations of prosperity which have been experienced by the agricultural implement manufacturers are entirely due to the seasons. Since the establishment of Federation, they appear to have done very well. From one of the reports of the Commission dealing with agricultural implements and machinery, including harvesters, I find that whereas in 1899 the total number of hands employed in the industry was 1,580, in 1905 it was 2,799. In South Australia, where some of the electors are pressing for the imposition of a higher duty, there were, according to the report, only 242 hands employed in the industry in 1899, as against 723 last year. It is significant that in South Australia the increase in the number of hands employed has been most marked since the duty upon agricultural implements was reduced from 15 per cent, to 12 per cent. That 1 fact, I think, proves that the reduction, if the relation of cause and effect can at all be alleged, has produced an increased prosperity rather than an imaginary decay. These variations of prosperity are really due to the state of our primary industries. The local manufacturers of these implements, like the importers, experience better times when we enjoy good seasons. I think that the figures which I have in my possession sufficiently indicate the reasonableness of my remarks. That the state of the primary industries is the principal index of the prosperity or otherwise of the manufacturers of agricultural implements is evidenced by the fact that during the drought of 1901-2 one Victorian firm alone had a thousand orders cancelled. Consequently, its distribution of these machines depended not upon the variation of the fiscal duty, but upon the demand created by a good harvest.",34
166,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The farmers cancelled the orders.,35
167,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Exactly . The fluctuations in our imports follow the state of our agricultural and pastoral prosperity. For example, whereas the value of the Victorian' imports of agricultural implements increased from £111,880 in 1899 to £252,256 in 1904, it declined in 1905 to £118,370. The principal evidence in favour of the imposition of higher duties upon agricultural implements appears to have been given by some Victorian manufacturers.",35
168,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,And by manufacturers in South Australia and New South Wales. The evidence in favour of an increased duty was obtained in three of the States.,35
169,Mr GLYNN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I quite accept the statement of the honourable and learned member. I read the evidence given by Mr Moore, and a portion of that tendered by Mr. MCKay. Mr Moore, of Messrs. Robinson and Company was put forward as the representative of the manufacturers of Victoria, if not of the Commonwealth. His evidence justifies the following summary of the position of the Victorian implement makers, which will be found upon page 11 of the Fifth Progress Report of the Tariff Commission. Victorian implement and machinery makers have derived a great benefit and advantage by the establishment of Inter-State free-trade. S'nce rgor the transfer of manufactures of this kind, of Victorian origin, from Victoria into the States of the Commonwealth, has increased by leaps and bounds, and has largely exceeded transfers into Victoria of similar goods from other States. There is an array of figures given in proof of that statement which I do not intend to quote. They show that in 1899 the value of the Inter-State transfers of agricultural implements into Victoria was £3.301, whereas the value of the transfers from this State to others £92,861. They further show that though the value of the Inter-State transfers into Victoria in 1905 had increased to £23,563, those frpm Victoria were valued at £157,689. These figures show a rapidly increasing prosperity in the manufacture of agricultural implements. The report which I have quoted deals with harvesters, but I have been supplied with some figures which 'are not contained in that report. They were submitted to me by a person upon whose accuracy I think I can rely. The figures show that if the South Australian manufacturers entertain any fear of competition it is not the competition of the importer that they need apprehend, but that of the manufacturers in the other States. The South ^Australian manufacturers, it seems to me, need not fear Inter-State competition, because whilst it is true that a great many machines are sent into their State from Victoria they in turn also export to the other States, and, for enterprise and efficiency, are able to hold thekii own under conditions of Inter-State free-trade. The total number of stripper-harvesters sold in South Australia during the years 1900 to 1905 inclusive was 2,972. Of these the South Australian manufacturers supplied 540, the importers 969, and the Victorian manufacturers 1,463. In those years the Massey-Harris Company sold in South Australia 844 machines, the International Harvester Company 125, and the MCKay Brothers 975. We are constantly hearing of the competition of the International Harvester Company, which supplied only 125 machines. In view of the proposals which we shall shortly be called upon to consider regarding preferential trade, the circumstance to which I have referred is a very curious one, because we must recollect that duties of this character will strike at the MasseyHarris Company rather than at the International Harvester Company. I will leave it to the Government to reconcile their policy with thefigureswhich I have quoted. What really does handicap some of the exporters of these machines, as between State and State, and particularly the South Australian manufacturers, are the heavy shipping freights between the various ports. For instance, the freight which is levied, say, between Fremantle and Melbourne is actually more than that charged between New York and Melbourne. I know from inquiry which I made about a year ago was that the South Australian manufacturers are subjected to a very severe handicap by reason of the stiff freights which are charged by the shipping companies engaged in our coastal trade. If , under a duty of 12I per cent., which represents upon a £38 valuation of these machines, conditions of prosperity have been realized by the manufacturers of agricultural implements during the last five or six years, and if those conditions have been maintained even though the imports were slightly checked under the' operation of a similar duty upon a £65 valuation, which is equivalent to a charge of £8 2s. 6d., it seems to me that we do not require to levy a specific duty of £16 upon them. ought, I think, to compliment the chairman of the Tariff Commission upon the fairness of his views as a protectionist. I do not say that his proposal represents the proper deduction from the evidence as to the duty that should be levied; the honourable and learned member for Illawarra has had something to say on that point. But we must compliment the honourable and learned member for Bendigo upon the reasonableness of his suggestion that, even from the point of view of the protectionists, the duty ought not to exceed £10 per machine. Since, on a. valuation of ,£38, 12 per cent - the duty prevailing 1 prior to the introduction of these proposals - would 'amount to £5 4s. 6d.; and, on a valuation of £65, would amount to £8 2S. 6d., surely the members of the protectionist party will not object to the proposal that a specific duty of £10 shall be imposed. I cannot understand on what ground any reasonable protectionist could object to the amendment suggested by the honourable ancl learned member for - Bendigo, although, as a free-trader, I should prefer a duty approximating more nearly to free-trade views of what the evidence suggested. The Prime Minister said to-daythat the Minister was forced to propose a specific duty, owing to difficulties experienced in arriving at a true valuation. Those difficulties have been removed by the Chairman of the Tariff Commission who points out that, according to the evidence, the valuation of £38, which was challenged by the Minister of Trade and Customs, ought to be adopted. If the difficulty experienced in arriving at a true valuation is responsible for the action of the Government in proposing a specific rather than an ad valorem duty, why do they not say that they will take the local cost of production as an approximate indication of the cost at the American or Canadian port of exportation ? They could do Mr Glynn. so if they secured the co-operation of the 4s. 7d. local manufacturers. Why should notthese manufacturers-som e of whom are very anxious to supply the Minister with what we are now told was mistaken testimony when their personal interests are strongly involved-in the interests of the Commonwealth, afford some guidance to the Government? We are led to understand that one of the MCKay Brothers supplied the Minister with an affidavit suggesting that the value of these We imported machines in the country of origin is £ 6 5 , less the 10 per cent. Let him give the Prime Minister evidence as to the local cost of production. According to the reports now under consideration, the conditions of production here are not so different from those prevailing in Canada or the United States that they cannot be taken as an approximate guide. We are not driven from sneer necessity' to 1 adopt the Government proposal. By taking the cost of local production, we can arrive at an approximately correct basis of valuation, and if that were done we should also have the advantage of knowing something of what was ""oing on locally. I am afraid, however, that we shall not obtain this information. I would again remind the Committee of the fact that if we strike an average of the duties prevailing prior to the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff of 1901, we arrive at a rate much lower than the specific duty of £ 1 0 which has been suggested. I need only refer to the evidence upon that point supplied by the two reports now under consideration. In South Australia the'duty was only 15 per cent. ad valorem, whilst in America and Canada the rate was 20 per cent. It would be unfair, however, to refer, for the purposes of comparison, to the duty prevailing in the last-named country, since these machines are not used there, and there is no importation for local purposes. Evidence was given showing that if the duty of £ 2 5 were accepted, it would mean prohibition. If the cost of landing these machines in Australia from the ports of exportation on the American Continent is j£i4 12s. 6d., then a duty of £ 2 5 , - plus that cost, would give a protection of practically £ 4 0 in respect of machines which, according to the best evidence before us, can be manufactured locally for less than £ 4 0 each. That is a class of protection which, if we were willing to impose it, the farmers would not relish. At page 21 the report, it is shown that it was admitted that some of the specific duties asked for would be very high; that on a vester invoiced at ^38 would be nearly cent, ad valorem, and that on a stripper of same value would be about the same percentage duty. It seems, also, that if we impose too high a duty-and I am again viewing this represented matter from a general stand-point-w might affect the efficiency of the matheThey chinery. By the imposition of a duty of £ 2 5 we should remove one of the guaranthat tees of the manufacture of machines of the best class, which is supplied by reasonable and competition from all parts of the world. That would not be beneficial to the freights farmers. Then, again, a severe duty selling might induce some of the American or goods Canadian manufacturers to manufacture farms here. I should like to know what would no be the position of some of the smaller manufacturers here who are now asking for a duty of £'25, if , for instance, International Harvester Company estaba lished a branch manufactory in Victoria or able membersin any other State of the Union. That was the result of some of the high' the duties on other articles imposed under for the Victorian Tariff. Under cover of (Q.66210.) those duties manufacturers from abroad came in, established branches here, creased and successfully competed against' the local in men, with the result that a demand was made for still more protection. As to the general condition of the industry, I would refer honourable members to a summary the position given at page 36 of the report of the Commission on Agricultural Machinery and Implements. It is stated in paragraph 10That notwithstanding the loss of trade these directions, the agricultural implement industry in Victoria is not in a languishing condition; that the representatives of the largest firms admitted that they have, on the whole, suffered 110 loss through the Commonthe wealth Tariff; that what they have lost ploughs and other implements they have made up in making harvesters and drills, and in other goods; that they have gained by Inter-State trade; that their princitial grievance cause of anxiety is that they have not extended their business as they ought to have done; the opposition ancl competition of foreign ancl corporations is growing, and year by year is becoming more formidable ancl dangerous; that they will before long be overwhelmed, will go down in the struggle, unless they more substantial protection at the Custom House. The general effect of that paragraph is indicate a developing prosperity rather Commission. of than a weakening under foreign competition calling for practically prohibitive duties. As to the effect of these proposals harupon the farming community, I propose to 65 per make a quotation from page 18 of the the same report, because I think it desirable that it should be put upon record. Dealing with the evidence given by witnesses who the agriculturists of Victoria, e the report sets forth thatparticularly objected to any increase in duty on harvesters (see Special Report on Harvesters). They drew attention to the fact as producers they had to compete in the markets of the world with their produce, that they had to compete with the cheapest labour the cheapest land, besides being handicapped by having to pay high railway ancl shipping on their produce before it reached the market -(Q . 65956.) They had also to pay high railway and shipping freight on the they bought and required for use on their -(Q . 65967.) The farmers themselves had protection against foreign competition, the duties on imported grain, such as wheat and oats, were practically inoperativethe That is the point that I was endeavouring few moments ago to impress upon honoras farmers are exporters. They contend that higher the duties were upon agricultural implements the less they would have available labour and improvements upon their lands "" On every occasion,"" said Mir.. James MCGregor, "" when duties have been inI have found that the price has increased proportion; that is my practical experience. I could give you an instance of it in the purchase of a plough. A plough that I could get for £ i \ was, when some years ago the Tariff was raised, increased at once to ^22 ios "" ; of and so forth. Two interests were represented. On the one hand, it was said that the farmers would be looted by a duty which would mean prohibition, whilst, on the other hand, a demand was made for in that duty in the face of testimony which points in the direction of free-trade, and which has induced the protectionist memtwo bers of the Tariff Commission to say that proposal of the Government is practiin cally a monstrous one. In these circumstances, I desire to say with all respect selling that the moderate members of the protecand tionist party are in duty bound to support the suggestion made by the honourable and that learned member for Bendigo, that the duty trusts proposed by the Government should be reduced to £ 1 0 . So far as the free-trade ancl party are concerned, they find that the receive case they have put forward from time to time for the retention of the present duty to has been strengthened by the report of the",35
170,Mr MCLEAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Gippsland) [5.28] But for the fact that I have paired on this question, I should not have risen to dress the Committee. I may say at once that I am ready, as I have always been, to accord to every manufacturer in an dustry that is worth preserving, in the terests of the Commonweailth, as substantial a duty as will enable him to pay fair wages and to make a fair trade profit. But I am not prepared to extend to any manuenough. facturer such a duty as would enable him to levy blackmail upon the primary ducer. It certainly does seem to me that duty. the proposal of the Government to increase the duty to £ 1 6 per machine comes within that category. I believe, moreover, that duty. we should not have heard of this proposal but for what, in my opinion, was the somewhat arbitrary act of the Minister Trade and Customs in increasing, on very imperfect evidence, the valuation of the ""bluff.""

They should be high enough to enable the local manufacturers to make a fair profit; but if they are so high that the local facturers can form a ring, and thus create a monopoly, they lead to an increase in prices, just as the importers' rings formed under free-trade do. When reapers and binders were being admitted to the State free of duty, our farmers were being charged £ 7 0 to £So for machines which the farmers in the country of origin could buy at from £ 1 7 to £ 1 8 .

But the Tariff Commission also took evidence which shows that the charges incidental to importation inare something like £ 1 4 , which gives the inlocal manufacturer an advantage to that amount in regard to every machine.

This is a left-handed way of annexing the country, and such practices I should be prohibited. We should encourage the local industry in order to prevent farmer from falling into the hands ot importers. If the consumers are left to the tender mercies of a ring of importers, they will be bled to a prettv tune. If , on the other hand, a body of local manufacturers create a monopoly, they will also the create and take an unfair advantage of In those who are depending upon them for their supplies. We can, however, adopt measures to control any internal combine that is operating with pernicious effects upon our primary industries. It is perfectly safe us to adopt the policy of affording a fair degree of protection to our local manubecause the competition among them will have the effect of keeping down prices. I have paired with the honourable member for Gippsland, but I shall give my hearty support to the proposal of the Government, which I consider will afford reasonable protection to the local manufacturer, and prevent our markets from being exploited by foreign rings over which we have no control.",40
205,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Lang} [5.55] - After listening to some of the arguments put forward in support of the Government proposal, I am impelled to condemn it as a scheme for robbing the taxpayer. It is proposed to perpetrate a diabolical outrage upon the primary producers of this country -^-to commit absolute daylight robbery.",41
206,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member must not refer to proposed legislation in those terms.,41
207,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am speaking of the principle which underlies the proposal, namely, that of taking money from the pockets of one section of the taxpayers, not for the purpose of paying it into the Treasury for public purposes, but with the object of enriching' another section of the community. That is tantamount to robbery.",41
208,The CHAIRMAN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I understood the honourable member to say that the proposal of the Government would amount to robbery. The honourable member must .not refer to pioposed legislation in that wav.,41
209,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Ver y well. It maybe unparliamentary to express myself in that way, but my opinion and the facts remain unaltered. Such a proposal could not be justified, even if the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, for the appointment of which some members of the present Government loudly clamoured, showed that the harvester manufacturing industry was in a languishing condition. Ministers have not been even content to adopt the recommendations of the protectionist members of the Commission-and even those recommendations were made in the teeth of the evidence-bu t have brought down proposals for which not an atom of justification, can be found. It is apparent that the desire of the Government is. not to assist a languishing industry, but by hook or by crook to increase the Tariff. Notwithstanding the fact that they have not the slightest pretext for doing so. that the evidence shows ever increasing expansion of business, they are piling up the taxation upon a section of the community which, above all others should receive the utmost consideration at our hands. I am speaking of our primarv producers, who are necessariliy the backbone of the country. They have to produce under the most adverse conditions; and they are not able to participate in many of the advantages conferred by civilization-advantage s which are within the reach of the secondary producers. If consideration is to be extended to any section of the community, it should be extended to the primary producers.",41
210,Mr EWING,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,B y the imposition of a land tax?,41
211,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Onl y that the Chairman would rule.me out of order if I pursued that paint, I could easily show the Vice-President of the Executive Council that under an equitable system of land values taxation, coupled with the reduction of other taxation and railway fares and freights, the farmers would reap a distinct benefit. At the present time, however, I am pointing out that, whilst pretending to be most solicitous for the welfare of the primary producers, the Government are anxious to pile fresh burdens upon them. Apparently, they wish to increase the cost of agricultural implements to the consumers. Why ? Is it to confer a benefit upon the rest of the community? Certainly not. They merelv desire to benefit a small section of the community- a section which is almost confined to Victoria. These proposals are intended chiefly to advantage Victorian manufacturers at the expense of the other States. It is high time that the representatives of the other States raised a united protest against legislation of this character. Personally, I shall never cease to raise my voice in opposition to it. We are to be asked to pay through the nose all the time for the gain of Victorian manufacturers.",41
212,Mr MCCAY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No State has made greater sacrifices as the result of Federation than has Victoria.,41
213,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I disagree with the honourable and learned member. New South Wales has made greater sacrifices than any State, and Victoria has benefited more than has any other State. The consumers in the other States, and particularly in New South Wales, are continually being bled in the interests of Victorian manufacturers. I sincerely hope that the people of the State from which I hail will speedily awaken to a proper appreciation of their position. Personally, I shall not hesitate to put that position before them in the plainest possible language. The agricultural implement industry has been represented by honourable members opposite, and particularly by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Attorney-General, to be in a languishing condition. Yet I find, upon the evidence which is before me, that since 'the establishment of the Federation, it has been one of the most flourishing industries in the Commonwealth.",41
214,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There are fewer men employed in that industry now than were engaged in it prior to Federation.,42
215,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I can quote figures from the report of the Tariff Commission which will absolutely disprove the honourable member's statement. For instance, "" I find that the total number of hands emThe following return prepared for toria shows the number of hands employed in Machinery in the several States of the Year. N.S W. Victoria.

Consequently it was not to be expected that during that period there would exist a great demand for 'agricultural machinery. But in T903 and 1904 good harvests were experienced, with the result that the demand for this class of machinery increased to such an extent that the local manufacturers were unable to supply it. The result was a considerable increase in the importations of agricultural implements.",42
216,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Who savs that the local manufacturers were unable to meet the demand ?,42
217,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That statement is based upon the evidence which was submitted by several farmers and others to the Tariff Commission. The excessive importations which took place in 1903 and 1904 were due to the increased demand, and were supplementary to the output of the local manufacturers, which in no way suffered the slightest diminution from such importations. Since those years the local manufacturers have been adding to their plant, and increasing the number of their hands. That fact can be seen by a glance at the table which I have quoted, and imports have declined. Last year the total number of hands employed in the industry ployed in the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery in the several States increased between the years 1899 and 1905 by 1,219.",42
218,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I spoke of the industry in Victoria.,42
219,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the honourable member will turn to page 8 of the Tariff Commission's Progress Report, No. 5, he will find these particularsthe Commission by the Government Statist of Victhe manufacture of Agricultural Implements and Commonwealth from the year 1899 to 1905 :STATES .

220,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"In Victoria alone, under the operation of the old State Tariff, there were 300 more hands employed in the industry.",42
221,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I have quoted a table which was prepared by the! Government Statist of Victoria. Surelv the honourable member does not question his figures.,42
222,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I intend to quote the figures of the Victorian Government Statist with a view to showing that the honourable member has not gone back far enough.,42
223,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I cannot go back further than 1901 for Federal figures. I repeat that since 1899 the number of hands employed in the manufacture of agricultural implements in Australia has increased by 1,219. ' in l8 9 9 the hands who were engaged in the industry in Victoria numbered 1,107, and in 1905 1,624, an increase of 517 for Victoria alone.",42
224,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is there not room for a still further increase?,42
225,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is not the point. As a matter of fact, the number of hands engaged in the industry is constantly increasing. The plea was put forward that an increased duty upon agricultural implements was required because the industry was languishing, whereas the figures which I have quoted prove that it is making amazing * progress. of increasing the Tariff, we should endeavour to reduce it. As a matter of fact, it has been shown conclusively that Mr MCKay-o n whose behalf chiefly these proposals have beer* submitted by the Government-is now making a clear annual profit of about £30,000. It is an absolute outrage that we should be asked by a Ministry which has not a straight-out following strong enough to give it an independent majority, to impose these duties, on the eve of a general election, in order to bolster up this industry. Not the slightest reason has been shown by the Government for legislation of this kind, and the electors may well be afforded an opportunity of saying whether they are prepared to still further bolster up an industry which is at present in such a flourishing condition. I propose to show by reference to the evidence, given very unwillingly by the manufacturers themselves, and first of all to that given by Mr H . V. iMCKay, that they are doing a satisfactory business. Atpage 1624 of the Minutes of Evidence, Vol. 4, we have the following report of Mr MCKay's examination :Can you tell me what was your output machines prior to 1901 ?-It has ""teen increasing ever since we began business. If I had received found in reply to queries 17443-9. notice, I could have brought the figures. Perhaps that statement will satisfy the honourable member for Melbourne PortsPrior to 1901, was the output more than machines ?-Yes . Was it much more?- I should say so. Was it more than a fifth of last year's put?-Goin g back, we were doing about seventyfrom five machines in 1897the industry was then working under the high Victorian Tariffabout 150 machines in 1898; and about 301 1899. What was your output last year, in prohad done a larger turnover. portion to your output in 1901 ?- I have not you the figures for 1901. As that is rather too close to the present evidence on the same point. time, will you give me, in your own way, fair comparison of the increase in your output between any year between 1901 and 1896 and last year?- I can admit frankly that the business has increased substantially. It would be a reahonorable' members sonable thing to say that the business in harvesters is three times what it was in 1901. f u l ly expected all that, because the machine is gave similar evidence. an exceptionally fine one for the users. This evidence, given grudgingly by Mr. MCKay himself, shows that his business has been on the up grade from the Instead date of its establishment. This is the evidence of the man on whose behalf, above that of all others, we are asked to impose these duties, and he declares that at no time has the industry been languishing. His own evidence is sufficient to condemn the Government proposal."" There is ample evidence from other sources to support that view. Mr MCKay's manager, Mr George Bult, in answer to questions 66566-7, pointed out that the output of "" Sunshine "" harvesters in 1905- a year of comparatively small sales-wa s 1,930, and was nearly as great in 1904. Mr James Moore's evidence on this point was given in reply to questions 15895 to 15901 A, and was to the effect that the average number of hands employed by him under the existing Tariff was greater than under the previous Victorian Tariff; that this was largely due to his increased Inter-State trade; and that this trade had been profitable. The same witness, in answer to questions 16172-5, stated that the' general condition of the agricultural implement business in 1905 was considerably better than it was prior to 1901-whe n the Federal Tariff was imposed-and that the profit was also larger. Mr John Mitchell's evidence dealing with the improved of condition of the industry since the imposition of the Federal Tariff, is to be 1 1 * s to the effect that since the introduction of the Federal Tariff his trade has expanded. Then, again, Mr John A. Bagshaw, of 200 South Australia, gave evidence in reply to queries 48540-2, to the effect that the agricultural implement-making trade is not a outlanguishing industry, but is ""very far it . "" Mr David Shearer, also of South Australia, gave evidence in reply to queries 47069-72, to the effect that his business had generally been increasing in during the last three or four years, and that he had been making more profit, and Mr James given B. Garde, representing the Australian Implement Manufacturing Association, .gave In answer to some questions 65896-9,' he made statements to the effect that in some lines there had been since 1899 a great increase of trade. If turn to questions We 47911-12 they will see that Mr Rees Rees This expansion of trade is also admitted in the reports, of ing Commissioners. On page 36 of No. 5, paragraph 4, it is stated that during the first two years under the Commonattempt wealth Tariff the number of hands emthe Australian market, ployed in the manufacture of agricultural implements in Victoria fell from 1,151 in 1900, to 789 in 1902; that they increased to 1,114 in 1903, 1,496 in 1904, and 1,624 in 1905; that in South Australia there was an increase from 242 in 1899 to 723 in 1905; and that the decline in Victoria in 1901 and 1902 may be attributable in some measure to the prevailing drought and consequent dulness in trade in years. The expansion of trade referred to has been due to the removal of the Inter-State duties, which has given these firms a. largely increased trade all over Australia. It is as the result of trade between the States, and not because of any protective Tariff that this industry has made such rapid strides. Sittiri"" suspended from 6.28 to 7.30 p.m.",42
226,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable memmore ber for Gippsland, although a protectionist, has condemned in unmeasured terms the unforgivable proposal to increase the duty on harveslation ters. No one can accuse him of leaning towards free-trade. He has confessed that although, when Minister of Tradie and Customs, he had every desire to find dustry needs further protection? an excuse to increase the valuation of ported harvesters in the interests of the local manufacturers, he was unable, after the most careful inquiry, to do so, having been thoroughly satisfied that the valulaTariff tion of £ 3 8 was the true one. Since then no tittle of evidence has been adduced show that that valuation is incorrect. the contrary, reference to the authorities in Canada and elsewhere has proved it be correct, and has left the present Minissays ter without a shred of justification for action in raising the valuation from ,£38 to £ 6 5 , or raising it by a single fraction, That increase was made by him on the word of an interested trade rival, upon being shown the copy of a copy of a letter alleged to have been written by some I think, in Italy. It was not proved such a letter had been written, ar:d even the copy said to have been seni here was not among the papers placed in the library, a copy of that copv only being produced. Upon evidence which no other man in the universe would have accepted, the Minister took this drastic, cruel, unwarrantable step.",44
227,Mr EWING,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The machines were sellreport ing locally at ^ 8 1 each.,44
228,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That showed that no was being made to dump them on,44
229,Mr EWING,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"A person who is sailing a thing for twice what tit is worth should not be an object of sympathy,",44
230,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What is MCKay doing? The honourable member for Gippsland has shown that he is selling his machines at an enormous advance on the cost of production, nearly, if not quite, double the cost of production and selling exthose penses, and that the proposed increase of duty will enable him to bleed the unfortunate farmers still more freely. for his private enrichment. Those who 1I have been sent here to represent the taxfreepayers, and particularly those who represent the farmers, should unite solidly to resist this proposal. But I am disgusted to find some farmers' representatives voting for these heavier duties. MCKay already has than half of the Australian harvester business, and it would be a dastardly and crime to perpetrate such leg,is as would increase his monopoly. If the figures given before the Tariff Commission are not correct, why does he not produce his books to show that - his inAs 1 imhave already shown, his business has been steadily increasing,, the increase of late years being beyond reasonable expectations, According to figures placed before the Commission, his output increased from seventy-five machines in 1897 to 301 to machines in 1899, so that it quadrupled On i two years, while the output in 1904 n was five times that of 1899, being 1,500 to machines, and his manager, Mr Bult, that 1,930 machines were produced in his 1905, an increase of 430 in one year, When a man appeals for more protection, and asks that his industry shall be bolstered mere up by taking money from the pockets of the people to put into his private banking account, he should produce his books, so one, that they may be examined, with a view that to the substantiation of his complaints about the effect of competition. If a defendant in a Court case refused to produce proof of his allegations, although he declared that he had it in his possession, the jury would at once give a verdict against him. The Minister of Trade and and Customs, however, thought that the production of a copy of a copy of an alleged letter was sufficient to justify him in increasing the valuation of imported harvesters, and in proposing an increase of duty which will further entrench MCKay in the monopoly which he enjoys at such great profit to himself and at such an immense disadvantage to his customers. I believe that an Australian harvester combine or trust was for a time in existence, and that both importers and local manufacturers, including Mr MCKay, were members of it. It was through his agency,' I understand, that the price of harvesters was increased. The trust came to an end because one firm left it, and then the price of harvesters was reduced again. Yet we are asked to pass legislation to assist MCKay, who was one of this ring to put up prices to the farmer. With regard to the charges of piracy which have been made against foreign manufacturers, the evidence placed before the Tariff Commission shows that if there has been any piracy, it has been on the part of the Australian manufacturers, who have copied foreign inventions.",44
231,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I understand that it is alleged that harvesters of some kind were in existence at the time of Julius,45
232,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Tariff Commission's report quotes a passage from Pliny, in which an invention of the kind is mentioned. I do not blame Australian manufacturers for taking advantage of the brains of the world. But what I do object to is that whilst they are copying the designs of manufacturers in other parts of the world, they are accusing them of appropriating inventions to which they have a prior claim. They are arrogating to themselves the exclusive right to manufacture certain machines, whereas the improvements which they claim as their own existed before they entered into business. Therefore, if there is any piracy, it is on the part of the local, rather than the foreign, manufacturer. Mr Weickhardt's evidence showed that the labour conditions that existed in Mr MCKay's factory were anything but satisfactory. It is well known that, in order to escape from the operation of Wages Boards. Mr. MCKay removed his factory beyond the sphere of their influence. Did he do this with a view to increasing the wages of his operatives? Certainlv not. He , wished to escape the necessity of complying with fair and reasonable conditions of employment. I propose to quote one or two passages from. the statement made by Mr Weickhardt, given at page 1826 of the minutes of evidence. Mr Weickhardt says:To show how MCKay crushes opposition, and gets other people's brains, I also want to show the Commission the manner in which the farmer has been victimized in being charged extortionate prices for a stripper-harvester, and the way the men employed have been sweated. This evidence is supposed to have been contradicted by Mr Bu'lt, and also by Mr. Porteous, but if their carefully-prepared statements are examined, it will be found that the main charges levelled against Mr. MCKay are left untouched. Mr Weickhardt continues:The tools and the plant are up-to-date in all respects at the Sunshine Works. Ideas are seized on, no matter what source derived from, and no thanks or recompense to the inventors, so far as my experience goes. For instance, four men employed making cups or buckets for lift ing grain at 8s. per day; one boy placing on belts, ios. per week. I invent a machine to make same on-dispens e with the services of three men and the boy, ancl make the man accept 20s. per week. His name is Francis, sole support of widowed mother. Tom Hale's casedoing eight screens in eight hours-put him on piece-work, he uses his brains, invents a way of cutting the screws-ca n make 20s. a day, and better work. Take his idea-sac k him, and get them done by a boy, young George Lamprell, at 6s. a week, and a man has to solder them in, and do his own work also. I also had the cups cut nut by the bull-dozer, which did more in one day than a man could do in a month. This machine is also the result of another man's brains- Mr . Moule, who was head pattern maker for Mr H . V. MCKay, attends to all classes of labour-saving appliances and ideas conveyed to him. The Massey-Harris grain box, now in use on the Sunshine harvesters, I made by copying from Massey-Harris machine, at the instigation of H . V. MCKay himself, and Mr Moule* assisting me. Yet this is the man who has the audacity to accuse others of piracy. The statement proceeds:Re the men and boys employed, a finer body does not exist. They are smart, active, and intelligent, and the system at MCKay's is equal to any American factory. It is not exactly a wages system or a piece-work one-bu t the cruellest and most daring robbery of human life that could be devised, and shows the need that exists for factory legislation. This employer, who wants increased protec tion, according to Mr Weickhardt, carries on a system of the cruellest and most daring robbery of human life that could be devised. The statement continues :The principle is this : Rush the men at top speed, no time to breathe or straighten your back. If you do you are marked; you get back in your work, the task is set, and must pleted, otherwise you keep the next man waiting. The order is given, six machines per day; must be done-eve n if half-finished, they rushed out of the factory to make room next six. When the men get that expert they manage it, the order comes^ try them with eight. Mr MCKay is not satisfied with turning out six machines per day, but after his employees have been induced to work at a high rate of speed, he gives orders that they are to try and turn out eight machines daily. Thus the work goes on in this den of sweaters in Victoria.",45
233,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There is no sweating going on there. Mr MCKay pays as good wages as are given in the Commonwealth.,46
234,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Why did he run away from the Wages Board?,46
235,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He did not do anything of the kind. He wants to be brought under a Wages Board.,46
236,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,He shifted his factory to Braybrook in order to get away from the Wages Board.,46
237,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Nothin g of the k in d ; considerations in relation to transport induced him to remove his works.,46
238,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I prefer to rely upon the evidence, rather than upon the statements of politicians, who are interested on account of the support that they hope to secure at the next election. Mr Weickhardt goes on to say:Then the rush starts again, all hands get behind, then a man is put on here or there where it is utterly impossible to do the task set out, then it works up to ten or twelve. Then, when you get to twelve by long hours night and day, it is deemed advisable to try and rush ""twelve machines through in eight hours instead of nine. Then green timber goes in, and all the tacks fall out, and it is to do over again. No allowance is made on ordinary time if you worked all night. Man or boy the wages is the ordinary rate. Young Harwbod, getting ios. per week, of my knowledge, worked from 7 till 6, less 1 hour dinner, 6.30 to 10 at night, and broke down after a few weeks. In packing for the Argentine it was all hours, and exhausted the men, but the pace is set, and stragglers are passed out In sanitary matters the state of affairs in 1904 was beyond all decency, and defies description. It was kept in this state purposely, and also all light excluded, and not sufficient ventilation. men would suffer almost any pains before venturing inlo the "" Black Hole of Calcutta."" The firm gains so much time, the conditions are imposed, thanks to the visit of Mr Duff; but to make up for the loss of the other mode of chasing the men out quickly, the back of the seat is so constructed that vou have to back into the seat, and you are kept In a recumbent position, and cannot straighten yourself until you crouch out again. be com Mr Weickhardt also deals with the questhey tion of wages, but I do not propose to are quote any more of his statement at the prefor the sent moment. He shows that Mr MCKay that is systematically sweating his employees, after having been assisted to carry on his industry by means of high protective duties. This statement was evidently prepared by Mr Weickhardt without any assistance, because the language is such as to indicate that it was not the production of an educated man. On the other hand, statements made by Mr Bult, the man were carefully prepared; but they do not touch Mr Weickhardt's main indictments. Now I wish to refer to the price of the local harvesters. They are sold to the farmers for £ 8 1 cash. If the purchaser wants termSj he has to pay a higher price, according to the accommodation that he requires. It is well known that Mr MCKay carries on a very large export trade, and that, after paying freight and insurance, and other incidental charges, he is able to sell his harvesters in Argentina and other parts of the world at lower rates than those charged to local farmers. He has to reduce his prices in other countries to meet foreign competition. It is reasonable to assume that he makes a profit upon the machines that he exports, and to the extent to which he demands a higher price than that receives for the exported machines he is imposing on the Australian farmer. Now, what is the cost of the production? Details are given upon this matter on page 1826 of the Minutes of EvidenceI t is shown that the harvesters do not cost more than £ 3 0 each. If we allow the large sum of £ 2 0 for selling expenses, the gross cost of the machines to Mr MCKay is not more than . £ 5 0 . It is safe to assume that they do not cost anything like that amount; but, even if they did, there would still be the enormous profit of £ 3 1 made upon every machine that was sold. How Ministers can submit a proposal of this kind I cannot understand. I am filled with disgust to think that any body of men can reconcile such a course The of action with their own consciences, and with their duty to their country.",46
239,Mr KELLY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"What about the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is not present?",46
240,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I suppose that he is engaged in touring his electorate as is customary with him when important Bills are before the House of which he should be in charge. In order to test the sincerity of honourable members who are so solicitous about the welfare of the workmen engaged in this industry, and who urge that a further measure of protection is necessary to enable increased wages to the paid to them,, I move That af ter the word "" follows,"" line 5, the following proviso be added : - Provided that - every manufacturing firm engaged in industries within the Commonwealth, the products of are protected by duties, shall distribute in increased remuneration to their employees the full torate ? amount of the duties imposed."" If it be true that the manufacturers require additional protection to enable them to pay better wages to their employees, by all means let us insist that the increased duty sliaill find its way into the pockets of the workmen, and not into those of men like Mr MCKay, who already makes ,£30,000 annually out of sweating his employees. Here is an opportunity for honourable members opposite to exhibit their sincerity. If the amendment be agreed to, I will undertake to say that we shall no longer hear an outcry on the part of manufacturers for increased duties.",46
241,Mr EWING,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the Government accept the amendment, will the honourable member vote for their proposals ?",47
242,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am not a protectionist ; but, if I were accustomed to indulge in whining upon the floor of the House and addressing meal-hour meetings of factory employees about the distressed condition of the workers, and the need of protective duties to give them better wages, I would vote for them. hold, however, that there is no necessity for any increased duty whatever or for any duty at all. I repeat that, if my amendment be carried, Mr MCKay will no longer be anxious that increased, duties should be imposed upon agricultural implements. We shall then have no more of the lobbying which has been so sedulously practised by men who desire to obtain access to the taxpayers' .pockets. I shall oppose the proposals of the Government, because they are not warranted by existing conditions, because they are opposed to the sworn evidence given betfore the Tariff Commission, because they are opposed to the Commission's report, and because they involve an unjust burden upon the farmers of Australia.",47

246,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They are responsible to their constituents.,47
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"But they occupy a very different position in relation to their constituents from that which the Minister occupies in relation to the country at large. He is responsible for the introduction of these proposals. He merely threw them upon the table, and immediately rushed off upon an electioneering campaign"", leaving other Ministers to take charge of them. Of course, I admit that they have not suffered on that account so far as their presentation is concerned, because in this House it is not customary to explain any proposals, or even to attempt to defend them. They are simply formulated somewhere else, and are submitted upon the understanding that there is to be no debate upon them, but that honourable members behind the Government are to sit tight I until they have been agreed to. This is no longer a deliberative Chamber. It has abdicated that function for some considerable period, and I think it is just as well that the public should be made acquainted with the way in which important proposals are rushed through, without the slightest consideration being given to them by those who are in charge of them. The proposals under consideration largely affect the primary industries of Australia. Yet they were introduced by the Minister in a speech of ten minutes' duration, and one which occupies only a single page of Hansard. That is all the justification which the Government have to offer for proposing so grave a departure from the recommendations of t h i Tariff 'Commission, which was specially appointed to inquire into this very matter. Some of the members of that bodv suggested the imposition of an ad valorem duty, which would be equivalent to a fixed duty of about jQio per machine. Others declared that no change in the rate levied under the Tariff should be,made. The Commission were equaly divided upon that point. But the Government, without the slightest attempt to justify their action, now propose to increase the rate of duty from £ 1 0 to £ 1 6 per machine. In this way are the interests of all classes considered in this Parliament. It would almost seem as though we were playing with toys instead of dealing with the interests of Australia. At the present moment there are only three honourable members upon the Government benches listening to whatever criticism may be brought to bear upon these proposals. This is the wav in which these imposts are fastened upon the people of the country.",47
248,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,We have heard that remark before.,48
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member may have heard it before. A ll that he does is to laugh when these proposals are being considered. Of course they do not concern him, because harvesters are not usedin Tasmania. I venture to say that if they affected that State, he would laughupon the other side of his face. But because he is not interested in them, he is most unintelligently grinning at a proposal to fasten upon the farmers of Australia a duty averaging 40 per cent, in relation to one of their tools of trade.",48
250,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,We have heard that statement so very often.,48
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not suppose that any body wishes to hear the honourable member very often.,48
252,Mr STORRER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Not upon that side of the Chamber.,48
253,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No r upon any other. I really must advise the honourable member to curb his tongue a little. seems to have taken upon himself the special task of championing the proposals of the Government, and he does so the more readily because they do not affect Tasmania. Last week, when we were discussing matters which did affect that State, he sang a very different tune. In my judgment, the proposals of the Government are wicked and scandalous. The Ministry has decided, despite the evidence which was tendered to the Commission, to levy an impost of 40 per cent, upon one of the tools of trade of our primary producers. The fixed duty which they suggest is equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent.",48
254,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I find that I underestimated it. It works out at 42 per cent.,48
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am obliged to the honourable member for correcting me. Upon one of the tools of trade of the farmers of Australia it is seriously proposed to levy a fixed duty which is equivalent to 42 per cent.  tion, which represents another 25 per cent.",48
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Of course. I trust that honourable members who represent the great farming constituencies of Australia in which harvesters are used will oppose these proposals as strongly as possible. The operation of the duty proposed to be levied upon these machines will not affect me personally. I could just as readily afford to laugh at the Government proposals as can the honourable member for Bass. I am speaking purely in the interests of others than my own constituents, and I deem it my duty to enter my protest as emphatically as I can against what I regard as a wicked imposition attempted to be practised by the present Government upon the farmers of Australia. So far as we have seen, throughout this Parliament there has been a steadfast adherence on the part of the Government to anything relating to the great centres of population, and a careless, reckless disregard of the primary producers of Australiai who, after all, are the backbone of the Commonwealth, and furnish the basis of all our expanding prosperity. The primary producer in the back-blocks seems to be the very last person thought of by the Government. A ll their proposals seem to concentre in the interests of those in the centres of population. If there is an industry in Melbourne employing a dozen hands this Government is He readv to rush to its rescue. All that the manufacturers have to do is to say that they want more duty. There is nothing easier than to ask and to receive at the hands of the Ministry. Manufacturers have not even to make out a good case. I believe that no case has been made out for disturbing the duty imposed on harvesters prior to the introduction of. this motion. So far as I can see all the evidence adduced before the Commission goes to prove most conclusively that if ever there was an industry expanding and flourishing steadily and continuously it is the harvester-making trade. There is nothing to show that it has been strangled-that it is languishing or suffering because of outside competition. There is nothing to show anything, but that it is prospering steadily and growing with the increase in the natural prosperity of the country. There is nothing to warrant the imposition of an increased duty of even one farthing upon harvesters. The local manufacturers alreadv enjoy a duty «f 2 per cent.j together with the natural protection, which is a very large item when spread over the importation of these machines. What we have been able to gather furnishes the best of all reasons why no further impost should be placed on them. Commission has put before us the interesting fact that the harvester manufacturers of Australia are able, not only to hold their own against foreign imports, but successfully to challenge foreign makers in their own markets abroad, and to compete with them there. Last year, Mr MCKay alone exported 419 machines of the value of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 , and for the first seven months of 1 this year he exported 484 machines of the value of £ 3 2 , 0 0 0 . When a firm is able successfully to compete with its foreign rivals in their own markets--whe n it has already begun successfully to invade those markets-surel y that fact affords clear evidence that it is not being strangled in its own market, and prevented from earning an honest livelihood under Australian conditions. The moment a firm like that of the MCKay Bros, begins to export, and to export successfully-and the number of machines which it is sending away is increasing almost every month-it affords the best of all reasons for the conclusion that it is doing well, and that we ought to let well alone. What is the genesis of this proposal ? One fine morning the statement was made that Mr MCKay, who carried on business in the Prime Minister's own electorate, had discharged a number of. his employees. This immediately gave rise to alarm-a n alarm that would have been justifiable had the statement fairly represented the facts of But the inference which us hastily drew from that statement proved to be a false one. were certainly discharged from the Ballarat works, but it was because the busy season was over. Increasing numbers have since been employed, but the fact that some men were discharged formed the basis of the claim for these increased duties. Mr. [140] MCKay is one of the Prime Minister's constituents, and, therefore, has ready access to him, and is, no doubt, able to pour tales of distress into his ears. He is able to convince the honourable and learned gentleman that he is being injured by foreigns competition.",48
257,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not know that Mr MCKay has spoken to me twice on this; T 1 subject during the last year or two. He has been out of the country for some time.,49
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I presume that he did net require more than a couple of interviews to pump, as it were, all these The stories into the mhiu j f he Prime Minis+ ter. If he had any sense, after he had given the honourable and learned gentleman the facts on which he relied, he would keep as far away from him as possible.",49
259,Mr DEAKIN,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I do not remember a single fact that he ever communicated to me.,49
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Mr MCKay's position illustrates the advantage which those bring in the cities enjoy in being able to approach the Government. The man on the plains of Australia-thousand s of miles away from the capital-is not able to approach the Government as the manufacturers in the towns are able to do. Consequently, his view cannot be poured directly into the ears of Ministers in the same effective way as are the views of those who dwell in the large centres of population. And so it comes about that this proposal had its genesis in Ballarat-the Prime Minister's own constituency-and was initiated- I was going to say "" engineered,"" but I do not wish to use that word-by one of the Prime Minister's own constituents. I do not think that any one will dispute the cleverness of the MCKay Brothers. I have only one feeling concerning them ; I wish to see them succeed to the extent of their hearts' desire. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see them hunt every foreign rival the case. out of the Australian market if they are some of able to do it fair l y ; but I do not think it is our duty, as an Australian ParMen liament, to help them to do that at the cost of the primary producers of Australia. A motion for a duty of 42 per cent, upon an article which is of vital importance to the primary industries of Australia is neither more nor less than an indecent political proposal. That is my opinion, expressed very emphatically I admit, but offered because I believe that it is more in accord with the facts thlan any mealymouthed or finessing statement would be. May I refer, in passing, the way in which we have with tools of trade. When the Tariff was under consideration, we made it a rule to exempt, as far as possible, all such tools. It will be found that a. very large number of tools of trade connected with industrial enterprises are on the free list. House decided almost uanimously that they should not be taxed. I should like to inquire what is a harvester but a. tool of trade 1 to the farmer ? Does the size of such a tool make a radical difference in the principle to be applied? If small men are to have their tools of trade exempt because they are small, the farmer has a still stronger claim to have his tool of trade, which is large and expensive, and to procure which involves much trouble, free of duty. I wish to revert to another preliminary inquiry : What were the terms of this Commission which was sent upon its duty something like two years ago? It was charged to inquire into the effect of the Commonwealth Tariff on Australian industries and the working of the Tariff generally. That was the inquiry which it was specially appointed to make. I should like to hear some of the members of the Commission deal with this point. One wonders why, among the first of their reports is one concerning an industry which, at the outset, was obviously neither strangled nor laguishing.",49
261,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It was represented toria to be languishing.,50
262,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I dare say it was. That is where the trouble begins. It seems to me that one has only to cry loud enough here, and to be backed up by a certain Victorian newspaper, to force any ^laim, no matter how unfair at may be, upon the attention of the Government of Australia to the exclusion of the tion of the general interests and welfare'of the Commonwealth. One of the very reports submitted by the Commission relates, not to a strangled industry, but to which the Commissioners declare spering, and which, therefore, does not come within the categorv of those into conditions of which it was appointed specially to inciuire. All the available is to the effect that the industry is in a most flourishing condition.",50
263,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Mr MCKay is the most prosperous looking man in Australia.,50
264,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is it a crime that an Australian should be prosperous?,50
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"No one grumbles to at Mr MCKay's prosperity. My hope is dealt that he may enjoy still greater success. The question before us, however, is not whether we object to a man prospering, but whether we are going to ask the farmers of Australia, in vulgar parlance, to "" grease the fat p i g . "" Let Mr MCKay prosper The under healthy rivalry and in competition with other Australian producers ; let him go ahead if he can, but when he is prospering and building up a large business-enrichin g himself, as he has every right to do under fair and free competition-let him not come to the Federal Parliament with . the story that he is not prospering, but that, on the contrary, his industry is strangled and languishing. The facts show that nothing of the kind is taking place. On the contrary, all the evidence we have is to the effect that MCKay's business is in a very flourishing state, and that he is doing exceedingly well. I believe that, according to his own sworn statement, he, in 1897, manufactured 75 machines; in 1898, 150; and in 1.899, 301. Then came Federation, and, in 1904, his output was 1,500, and, in 1905, 1,930. Those figures do not show that his industry is being strangled. In fact, he seems to be outstripping his competitors. Why, on these facts, the Tariff Commission has recommended that the existing duty be doubled passes my'comprehension, and I in Victhink that of any reasonable man.",50
266,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Commission has not made that recommendation; it came from only a section of the Commission.,50
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I meant the protectionist section of the Commission.  mission's report, the output for 1905 means consideraa profit of over ,£30,000.",50
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is a very first pleasant wav of languishing.,50
269,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is MCKay the only one manufacturer of whom the members of the to be proOpposition have heard?,50
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He is the the largest manufacturer of harvesters, and is at the head and front of this movement. evidence That is why he has been singled out; it is because he represents the others. There are makers in South Australia, but I do not think that they would have asked for a larger duty had not MCKay led the way.",50
271,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The most sensible protectionists in Australia are in South Australia.,51
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"-The most sensible protectionists are those who are satisfied with moderate duties. I do not call those who asked for the present duties sensible, and it is my firm conviction that, although this moribund Parliament may impose a rate equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 42 per cent., a more sensible Parliament will subsequently reduce it . According to Mr John Mitchell's, evidence, MCKay's business has expanded since the imposition of the Federal Tariff. Mr John A. Bagshaw, of-South Australia, gave evidence to the effect that the agricultural plement making business is not a languishing industry, ""but very far from it , "" to use operate than ever before. his own words. Mr David Shearer, of South Australia, gave evidence to the effect that his business generally has been increasing during the last three or four years, his profits having been greater, and his turnover larger.",51
273,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,B y adopting new lines and patenting a plough of his own.,51
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Is that a reason why he should ask for higher duties? If he is doing well, he may be let alone.",51
275,Mr HUTCHISON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"He could not manufacture plough-shares until he got a duty, and then he reduced his price from 12s. 6d. to 3s. ' Mr. JOSEPH CO.OK - I cannot believe that that is so.",51
276,Mr HUME COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Protectio n works out in that way.,51
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is an old gag, but it works out only in Parliament ; it does not work out when one goes into a protected market to purchase. Mr James B . Garde, representing the Australian Implement Manufacturing Association, showed that upon some lines there has been a great increase since 1899, and Mr Rees Rees gave similar evidence. Indeed, the members of the Commission had to admit that there has been a great expansion of trade. The facts are so clear of doubt that they were compelled to do so. However much the protectionist members of the Commission might have wished to make out a case for protection, they were compelled to recognise that this business has expanded and is successful. When the Commission was appointed its investigations were intended to discover what in[140]- 2 dustries were languishing and being strangled, with a view to their relief, but their inquiries proved that the agricultural implement industry is prospering almost beyond the dreams of avarice. Any fluctuations in trade have corresponded with fluctuations of season. When times have been prosperous the demand has increased, and the falling off in output has been due to bad seasons. Increase and decrease have corresponded with the prosperity or adversity of the primary industries, which shows that the Tariff has not injured this business. On the contrary, there has been a continuous expansion of trade. Mr J. Moore said that there have been more hands emim- ployed, more work to do, and more profit obtained since the Federal duties began to Mr John Mitchell admitted that his trade, taken as a whole, has expanded greatly under Inter-State free-trade. Figures have already been quoted to-night to show that the increase of hands in this industry has been considerable. In 1899 there were 1,580 employed, and in 1905 2,799, a n increase of x,2jg. However this question is viewed, whether in regard to the value of imports, or in reference to the statements of those engaged in the industry as to their output, and the value of their production, it is seen that there is no warrant for interfering with the present duties on agricultural machinery. Mr MCKay, who has so strenuously advocated the increase of duties, apparently with success, has the largest output, charges the highest prices, and pays the lowest wages. The evidence was given always on oath, by, I presume, reliable witnesses.",51
278,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Whose evidence was it?,51
279,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Several witnesses have testified to those facts. Mr. Weickhardt was one of them.,51
280,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,An ex-employg.,51
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does it therefore follow that what he says is untrue?,51
282,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,No one would take the evidence of a discharged employ^.,51
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is a man who has had the misfortune to lose his employment to be branded as a liar? Because he is unfortunate enough to be discharged must he therefore be regarded as having lost his honesty and integrity?,51
284,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Hi s statements were ex parte, and have been contradicted over and over again, as the honourable member knows.  fore us.",51
285,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They have been contradicted by men who are working at the factory.,52
286,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Can the honourable member quote evidence to that effect?,52
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There are in the - evidence much stronger statements than I have quoted, but, inasmuch as they reflect upon Mr MCKay as an employer, I have refrained from alluding to them. I am, how-ever, justified in pointing out that it is - stated in the evidence that the man who - charges the highest price for his machines, and has the largest output, pays the lowest wages. These facts show that there is no justification for increasing the duty on harvesters. I wonder why there should be such a general desire to impose a fixed duty instead of an ad. valorem impost.",52
288,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"There will be much less prevarication, and perhaps less perjury, with a fixed duty than with an ad valorem duty. That has Been the experience everywhere. I do not refer to this particular ens©",52
289,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not know about that. All that has been urged is that it will be more difficult to collect an ad valorem duty. But I have yet to learn that in order to get over a small difficulty such as that indicated, any Government is justified in perpetrating an obvious injustice.",52
290,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Most traders prefer fixed duties, because they then know the exact terms upon which they are'eompeting.",52
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I should think that those whose goods were of the greatest value would prefer a fixed duty, but that those whose goods were of low value would prefer an ad valorem charge. In spite of the fact that there is a wide difference between the values of the harvesters imported, they are all deemed to be of eoual value for the purposes of the duty. Why should a machine valued at £ 2 0 be subjected to the same fixed duty as one valued at £ 3 0 ?",52
292,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,They are nearly of the standard value.,52
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I do not think that the evidence bears out that statement. It would appear that the Massey-Harris machine is of much higher value than that made by the International Harvester Company. It certainly costs very much more to make than do some of the other machines. Therefore, this proposal to rough all the machines up, and charge the same duty, irrespective of values, is a species of socialization that I regard „ as veryunjust.",52
294,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The honourable member has got Socialism on the brain.,52
295,Mr TOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have it on the brain to this extent: that the expression that I have used seems to be an apt one. Since the honourable member does not seem to like the reference to Socialism, I shall withdraw the term - I used.",52
296,Mr WATSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I am very much amused.,52
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The nearer we approach the general elections the more restive the honourable member becomes under any mention of Socialism. It was not so twelve months ago. However, I do not wish to lacerate the honourable member's feelings. This is a proposal to make equal those things which are unequal. Machines of different value are to be regarded as of the same value for the purposes of levying the duty. The trouble with all fixed duties is that however the price may decrease, the duty remains a fixed quantity. It may seem paradoxical, but a fixed duty is a constantly increasing duty. As the^prices of goods decrease, the fixed duties Increase ad valorem. That, of course, is an argument against all fixed duties. When we were discussing the Tariff, we abolished fixed duties as far as we could, and adopted percentage duties which would rise and f a ll in keeping with the fluctuations in value. Now it is proposed to again resort to the vicious method of adopting fixed duties-dutie s which in Victoria were the means of fleecing the people of thousands of pounds of their hard-earned money.",52
298,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Who m did they fleece, and when?",52
299,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Victorian farmer.,52
300,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Giv e us. a case in point?,52
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I cannot be bothered with the honourable member; he is not open to conviction. I have a very strong objection to fixed duties of any all kind, because they are vicious, and operate entirely against those who have to pay them. They are not in keeping with the principle which would guide Parliament in imposing a fair duty, because they tend to increase as values are reduced. Two systems of valuation have been adopted in connection with stripper harvesters-on e by the Tariff Commission, and one by the Minister of Trade and Customs. The Minister says that the machines should be valued at £ 6 5 , whereas the Commission say that £ 4 1 is the true valuation. Notwithstanding that the protectionist and free-trade members of the Commission .agree that £ 4 1 is the proper valuation, the Government sail airily along and propose to impose a duty of £ 1 6 upon a machine which they say is valued M £&5They claim that they are imposing a duty equivalent to an ad valorem impost of 25 per cent.; but the Chairman of the Commission points out that the proposed fixed duty of £ 1 6 amounts to an ad valorem charge of 42 per cent. Government seem to regard every recommendation of the Commission as radically wrong, and consider it their duty to propose something entirely different. Government are, in effect, ignoring the work that has occupied the Commission for the last two years, of course, they arc supreme. have behind them supporters who do not seem prepared to quetetion anything that they propose. They are quite content to sit tight and permit the Government to take money arbitrarily from the producers and traders of Australia. All the sworn evidence is to the effect that the valuation adopted by the Government is a fictitious one. Neither the Minister of Trade and Customs nor the Prime Minister attempted to explain how he arrives at a valuation of £ 6 5 . Their motto is, "" Clap it on, and make them pay,"" or, to use the expression of the Minister of Trade and Customs, "" Make them sit up . "" It is such .unintelligent methods that unfair taxes are being imposed upon the people. One would have thought that the Government would pay some attention to the sworn evidence given before the Commission with regard to the value of the stripper-harvesters. But the Government have absolutely set on one side the report of the Commission, and the evidence which they have gathered so laboriously, and which they have considered on the whole so studiously and so fairly. It is graceful that - the Commission should have its report thrown back in its teeth in this contemptuous way by a Government which has its own political ends and immediate political purposes to serve. I could understand Ministers questioning interested evidence given by traders, or ignoring testimony furnished ijn this 'House or by the press; but they have no justification for setting aside the results of the inquiry so exhaustively conducted by the members of the Commission. Freetrader and protectionist Commissioners alike agree that £ 4 1 is a fair value for these harvesters.",52
302,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,£ 3 8 .,53
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Yes , ^ 3 8 - plus 10 per cent. Yet, in spite of that, the Government say that the value is £ 6 5 , and upon that basis assess the duty.",53
304,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Prime Minister looks The sick enough; do not rub it into him too much.,53
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I never knew a Prime Minister to be sick whilst he had The so stolid and solid a majority behind him.,53
306,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The solid position of the Government is what is making the Opand, position feel unwell. They Mr. JOSEPH COOK - It is time for the Opposition to feel unwell when they see the public money thrown away in this unintelligent and reckless manner. I ask the Minister to show how he makes up his valuation of £ 6 5 , in the face of the evidence given before the Commission. If the honourable member for Moira were not sitting behind the Government, he would be the first to see the reasonableness of my request.",53
307,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What evidence has been adduced that was not previously in the possession of the Minister of Trade and Customs and his predecessor?,53
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honby- orable member suggest that two years ago the Government had in their possession all the information gathered by the Tariff Commission ?,53
309,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Judgin g from the re- . port, the Commission did not obtain any evidence beyond that previously the possession of the Minister of Trade and Customs with regard to the valuation of harvesters.",53
310,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Oh , yes we did. We dis- obtained evidence from 'Euenos Ayres and Milan.",53
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If what the honourable member for Moira has said is correct, very little credit is due to the Tariff Commission. I have no hesitation in saying that the Tariff Commission have collected a mass of very valuable evidence.",53
312,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is not the question. „ Mr. JOSEPH COOK' - It is the question. We have a right to (know from the Government why they differ so radically from the Commission in the matter of assessing the value of these machines. We must recollect that Ministers argue that they are adhering to the 25 per cent, duty recommended by the 'Commission, but that where they differ from the Commission is in regard to the valuation upon which that duty is levied. Since there is such difference as to the valuation of these harvesters, it is only fair that we should ask the Government, before the duty is increased from £ 1 0 to £ 1 6 per machine, why that difference exists.",53
313,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Government have given no reason whatever.,54
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Absolutely none. All that we have had iri justification of their action is a ten minutes' speech from the Minister of Trade and Customs, who introduced these proposals, and another ten minutes' speech from the Prime Minister. This afternoon I described the action of the Government in assessing the value of these machines at ^65 as a piece of departmental garotting. I can find no other expression which' adequately fits the case.",54
315,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It is not departmental, but Ministerial garotting.",54
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is what I intended to convey. Since the valuation of these harvesters for Customs purposes was arbitrarily fixed by the Minister at ^65, nobody has been able to obtain from him an explanation of the reasons which prompted his action. I do not believe that he has one to offer, except that which he gave to the newspaper representatives when he said that he intended to make the importers of foreign harvesters sit up. I am surprised at the action of the Prime Minister in allowing his colleague to ride rough-shod over the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, and over the sworn evidence which that body has collected. I should like to point out that, although Mr MCKay was asked wlvthe duty upon these machines should be increased, he steadfastly refused to give the slightest information as to the cost of tion. He asked for a further measure of protection because he affirmed that he could not compete with the imported machines unless he got it. But when he was questioned as to the reason why he could not compete with them, he replied that he was not at liberty to say. He stated that his firm was a proprietary company, and therefore he preferred not to give any reasons. This fact is made clear by a reference to the evidence. At question No. 16668, Mr. Clarke asked Mr MCKayHas your output increased or diminished since the operation of the Federal Tariff? His reply wasI t has increased. a radical The witness was then askedHas it increased in consequence of an expansion of your trade in the Commonwealth, or because you have exported to other countries? The reply given by Mr MCKay wasFor both reasons. Both the export and Inter-State trade have increased. At the time the Federal Tariff was enforced we were in the position of having perfected a very good invention. Our machines had made a name for themselves, and the trade had to follow. I should not think that that was a reason for the imposition of increased duties but rather a reason against the adoption of that course. If the trade has to go to Mr MCKay at a remunerative rate, why does he want an increased measure of protection? He continued The reason for our expansion is that the people in other parts of the world were not then prepared to supply the demand for the right article. There is the deliberate statement of Mr. MCKay that he produces a better article than can be produced elsewhere. That - is the evidence of a man who, in the same breath, asks for further duties. It is the testimony of one whom the Government allege ought to be protected to the extent of 42 per cent, against the competition of individuals whom he has declared' have already been beaten out of the market. Mr MCKay was further askedYou particularly refer to the Sunshine harvesters ? His reply wasYes. He was then askedCan you tell me what was your output of machines prior to 1901 ? His reply wasI t has been increasing ever since we began business. If I had received notice I could have their produc- brought the figures. These are ihe sworn statements made by Mr MCKay before the Tariff Commission. I think they should be placed upon record in Hansard, so that the public may be able to see the basis upon which the Government have proceeded in offering him such a huge increase of duty. on he was askedCan you give me the average proportion of the cost of selling and distributing your machines ? To that he repliedI would rather not go too closely details. E v i d e n t l y it might have been a very bad thing for ""him to do so. Evidently he had something which he desired to keep back from the Commission. Every other witness who appeared before that body gave the totals of the cost incurred in distributing these machines. Accordingly, Mr. MCKay was askedIs there any reason why you should be. more reticent than other witnesses have been? His answer wasI do not think it is fair that I should expose the whole of my business to this trust which wishes to smother me. Only a little while previously he had informed the Commission that he had the trust beaten because he produced a better article. To my mind, his statements are not only inconsistent but contradictory. After all this questioning; the Chairman of the Commission inquired of - Mr. MCKayI presume that you will not tell prime cost? His reply wasI would rather not. He wanted the increased duty all the same. In my judgment, Mr MCKay acted perfectly within his rights in declining to expose his business, but we are acting equally within our rights in refusing to give him the advantage of increased duties unless he first establishes his case. The Government, it appears, do not require him to do that. They are content to accept his statement that he requires higher duties, and, hey presto, the thing is done. There will be no difficulty in giving effect to his wish in a House constituted as this is. Honourable members have merely to sit tight. I wonder, after all, whether Mr MCKay has favoured the Prime Minister and his Government confidentially with a statement as to the primary cost of producing these harvesters. Maybe there have been interviews between Ministers and private individuals, upon the strength of which these proposals are made to the Committee. obligation is upon the former to advance some reason to justify their proposals. I Later do not wish to pursue this matter any further. There is abundant evidence to show that no - further duty is required upon harvesters, which already enjoy a very high measure of protection. I understand, from the evidence given before the Tariff into Commission, that the natural differentiation in favour of Australian harvesters averages about ,£14 ios. per machine. That is to say, the cost of landing, harvesters in our market amounts to that sum. Mr MCKay already has that natural protection. In addition to that, under the existing Tariff he enjoys a protection amounting to £>5 4 - 6d. per machine. In these s circumstances he and the rest of the Australian manufacturers of harvesters enjoy a protection of £ 2 0 per machine. It that is not sufficient, I for one shall - not grant any increase. I do not willingly consent to grant him an increase of even ' one halfpenny in the protection he enjoys. We must remember that the Australianmanufacturers of these machines are not competing against the"" pauper labour of Europe. One of the strongest arguments repeated almost ad nauseum in favour of the imposition of protective duties is that in other quarters of the globe many gocds are produced under sweated labour condime your tions. Honourable members may gram,Jf_. they please, that our civilization in these southern seas demands some protection from the products of such inferior industrial conditions, but evidence was given before the Commission that the wages paid in the manufacture of these machines in Canada are higher than those prevailing in Australia. Evidence was given that the cost of iron and steel is not less in Canada than it isi here; that on the contrary the cost of the raw material, and of the workmanship is higher there than here. Under these conditions, and having regard to the fact that the local manufacturers enjoy a protection amounting to £ 2 0 per machine, what possible excuse could there be for increasing the existing duty on a machine which is of vital importance to the farmers of Australia? I do not see my way to subscribe to even a fractional increase in the existing duty. If any case has been made out it points to the necessity of reducing, rather than increasing the duty. When we remember that the The whole of the grain raisers of Australia have to do with these machines, and that they vitally affect their industrial occupations and productions, we ought to hesitate before increasing the duties for the purpose of enabling the manufacturers to swell their profits. I know that a limit is to be imposed upon the price of these machines. But we have had evidence this afternoon that the price proposed to be fixed from the beginning of next year is that at which they are actually being' sold by some traders at the present time. Some are selling these machines at only a small fraction in excess of the maximum_ price which we propose to provide by legislation shall be charged from the beginning of next year. This price is to be maintained apparently for all time; the farmers of Australia are not to be allowed to secure these machines ""JUfe anything below it . Meantime, the local manufacturers will enjoy a duty, if the Government proposal be carried, amounting to 42 per cent, plus £ 1 4 . ios., the cost of landing a machine here from the American continent. The farmer has to fight his way in the markets of the world without any of these advantages. Nothing save the rates prevailing in the markets' of the world can affect the price which he secures for his exports, arid yet a Legislature which is supposed to have regard to his hi^ier and better interests is to fix the price _whch he shall pay for the implements necessary to enable him to produce his goods at the cheapest possible rate. The sooner a stop is put to the cant we hear about helping the primary industries of Australia by this Government the better. If this is all that we can do for them it is w'Orse than nothing. It would be far better for us to let them alone of proposing to keep up the prices that they have to pay in respect of one of their tools of trade. The farmer away in the interior of Australia, who today is holding the whole social superstructure above him. is already handicapped sufficiently. His handicaps are natural ones. In the first place, his distance from the markets of the world is a very heavy handicap; in the next place, he has to fight against droughts",54

319,Mr MAUGER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The income-tax returns do not show that the primary producer is struggling in the wav that the honourable member would have us believe.,56
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The least we can 'do is to take care that we do not increase the imposts which the farmer already has to bear. After all, he is at the bedrock of our social and industrial prosperity. If he is all right, we may very well be certain that our secondary industries are also right, because we may be sure that they, too, are healthy and are expanding in proportion to the expansion of his* industry. He is building, broad and deep, the base of the industrial pyramid, and we should not hamper him with any of these fettering imposts whilst he is engaged in the work of erecting the national superstructure. Let us leave him alone, so far as proposals of this kind""are concerned; let us make his tools sharper rather than blunt them by these unnecessary duties. If we make it more difficult for him to get nearer the range of his market and of his competition in regard to all those things from which he derives his profit, we practically blunt his tools, since he has nothing to protect him from the competition of the world in relation to his, finished products. Our very isolation-ou r distance from the markets of the world-shoul d lead us to give the farmer ' every encouragement Ave can, and should cause us to refrain from interfering in this high-handed way with his industry. The prosperity of Australia rests upon the facilities which we afford the farmer for sending his products to market. I shall do nothing that will hinder him in building up his own prosperity, since upon that foundation we may build every kind of secondary prosperity. For the reasons I have given, I feel that there is no justifiinstead cation for the duties which the Government propose, or for those which the protectionist members of the Commission have set before us. The evidence in this regard is in the teeth of their proposal. I prefer to a.dhere to the evidence which has been furnished, and, making mv own deductions from it , mv attitude will be one of opposition to any further increase of these duties.",56

395,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Does the honourable inmember think that the Chairman and the inother seven members of the Tariff Commission came to a wrong conclusion in respect of the price of these machines?,61

397,Sir JOHN QUICK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Chief Inspector the of Customs in Canada states that he has the whole matter, and that he. has examined the books of the company.",61
398,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The letter which I have quoted is on record in Hansard. It . was that information which governed the: action taken by the honourable member for Gippsland when he occupied the position! of Minister of Trade and Customs,61

407,Mr WILSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If it is possible facture harvesters here for £ 3 7 , why Mr KENNEDY should not the Massey-Harris Company be able to produce them for that amount?",62
408,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If the honourable vester member will read the evidence taken by the. Tariff Commission he will find - that when Mr MCKay entered into the busitwo ness he paid -£50 each for the manufacthe ture of these machines, and sold them from £ 9 0 to .£100. But in spite of that duty will be repealed. fact-accordin g to the testimony of shareholder in the company, who is a proported nounced free-trader-the company became defunct. There is another point to which I desire to direct attention. It is admitted by honourable members that these harvesters as they leave the Canadian factory, are not complete machines. The parts have been completed, but they are simply ""bunched,"" and they are landed here that form. After their arrival have to be put together. Is it fair to regard the bare cost of manufacturing the component parts of a machine as the actual cost of its production?",62
409,Mr FULLER,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Do not the machines require to be set up here, and does not that give employment?",62
410,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,That is not the question which I am arguing.,62
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Who says that the cost of setting up the machines is omitted from their valuation for Customs purposes ?,62
412,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I say that it is kept out of that valuation, and that that is not a proper procedure. now to the respective merits ' of a duty and an ad valorem duty. which If we impose a specific duty upon we shall obviate' all possibility deof fraud at the Customs House. I need the scarcely point out that in the case of as well as of farm products, such as grain, butter, cheese, hams, bacon, meat,, potatoes, and fruit, fixed duties are realready in operation. I do not say that of those who are engaged in the importation of harvesters are more immoral than are other sections of the community, but I do urge that we should remove all possibility an of fraud by levying a specific duty upon them. For the first time in the history of fiscal legislation in Australia we are afforded an opportunity of proving to that the effect of protection is not to in the cost of an article to its user.",62
413,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable to manumember has not proved that. - I think that I can prove it . The Tariff Commission admit that the cost of the standard type of harto the farmer is about . £ 8 1 . Accompanying their recommendation for an increased duty is a stipulation that within years from the passing of the Act cost of these machines must be reat duced to £ 7 0 , otherwise the increased This afternoon a the honourable member for Wannon purto quote from a trade circular issued by Messrs. Lennon and Co., with a view to showing that the full-sized machine, which is at present being sold for ^ 8 1 , was quoted by that firm at . £ 7 0 for cash and £ 7 5 for terms. I challenge him to produce a price list of that firm which shows anything of the sort. I hold in my in hand a copy of their price list of last those parts year, which saysThis cancels all previous quotations, and until further notice the following are the various terms on which we are offering the Lennon "" Austral "" latest improved harvester to ootid fide farmers on extended terms contract :-(a) £85 ; (b) £go. I cannot understand why honourable members should persist in making statements for which there is no justification. I cannot imagine that they would do this deliberately, and my only alternative is to assume that they have been supplied with absolutely misleading information, which they have not taken the precaution to verify. H a d the honourable member referred to this trade circular he would have obtained the figures I come I have quoted. By means of a price list he has sought to show that the object which the Government have in view in making these proposals has already been secured. As a matter of fact it has not. The card which he exhibited is really a list which was published after the recommendations of the Commission had been made public. It was known at the time that the Commission had recommended that a higher duty should be imposed, with a view to conserving the market for the Australian manufacture. The publication of that price list bears evidence that the local manufacturers are going to give the farmers some of the benefits which will accrue from the opportunity promised to them to specialize in the manufacture of agricultural machinery. Pointed reference has been made to the position in which the Australian farmer was placed when he 'had to rely for his supplies entirely upon the foreign manufacturer. I wish to put before the Committee my own personal experience, when, years ago, I used a reaper and binder. I found at that time that a man who attempted to build up a reaper and binder by acquiring duplicate parts had to pay nearlv four times the price charged for the complete machine. The same policy is being pursued by the firms who import harvesters today. On the other .hand, the Australian manufacturers of those machines and other implements practically supply duplicate parts at the rate charged for those in the original machine. I propose to give some figures, which cannot be questioned, showing the prices charged for duplicate parts by the Massey-Harris Company. If the farmer wishes to replace the three carrying wheels of one of these imported machines, he has to pay, according to the catalogue issued by the Massey-Harris Company, £ 2 0 5s. for them, whereas the price for exactlv the same duplicates for the Australian machine is £ 1 4 - The evidence of farmers-free-trader s and protectionists alike-wh o appeared before the Commission was that the Australian-made machine is the better ..one.",62
414,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Shoul d not that be an argument in favour of its use?,63
415,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I shall deal later on with that point.,63
416,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Accordin g to ithe honourable member, there is a difference of £ 6 between the price charged for duplicate carrying wheels for an imported machine and that charged for the same parts of an Australian-made machine.",63
417,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is so. We have the evidence of the representatives of the company in support of that statement. The foreign manufacturers say, "" Let us send our surplus stock of binders, cultivators, and ploughs to Australia; our home market is conserved to us by means of a duty, not of 12% per cent., but of 40 per cent.''",63
418,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Are not the local manufacturers charging a higher price in foreign markets than they charge here ?,63
419,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"That is not the question under consideration. The foreign manufacturers say in effect, ' We have our 1 home market conserved to us. Let us sell our machines in Australia at the bare cost of manufacture, and we shall make our profit out of the sale of duplicate parts to the Australian farmers.""",63
420,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Will not the farmer see through that device?,63
421,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Certainl y he will ; but what will be his position when we have no local manufacturers ? Honourable members opposite, who cry out that they are anxious to conserve the interests of the farmer, forget where they are leading him.",63
422,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"They will ,get plenty of m anuf actures",63
423,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The farmer in New South Wales used to a large extent get his implements from Victorian manufacturers.,63
424,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The farmers in the Riverina might have done so, but those in other parts of New South Wales did nothing of the kind.",63
425,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"If they did not,, then they obtained the same class of implement that the Victorian farmer secured prior to the establishment of the local industry-a n implement which made it impossible for him to keep in the van of industrial progress. I wish, however, to give some additional figures in regard to the cost of the duplicate parts of these machines. An intermediate spur wheel for the imported machine costs £ 1 . whereas such a part for an Australian machine costs 12s. 6d. A spur geair wheel for an imported machine costs 25s., as against a charge of £ 1 made for exactly the same class of duplicate for an Australian machine, and a comb, complete, for the imported machine costs £ 5 , ' whereas the charge in the case of the Australian article is £ 4 ios. Then, again, the main axle for an imported machine costs £ 3 2s. 6d., as against £ 2 5s. charged for the Australian axle.",63
426,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,I suppose the travellers never point out these facts to the farmers?,64
427,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The agents for the importers carefully keep them in the background.,64
428,Mr LEE,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What about the travellers for local manufacturers?,64
429,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am quoting now from one of the lists circulated by - them. The cost of a cavings riddle, complete, for an imported machine is ,17s. 6d., as compared with a charge of .12s. 6d. for a like part for the Australian machine; whilst the price of a wheat riddle, complete, for an imported machine is 15s., as against 123. 6d. in the case of the Australian article: These facts prove that in every instance the cost of duplicate parts for an imported machine is much greater than is that of duplicate parts for the Australian machine. I wish now to refer briefly to the practice of those engaged today in importing these machines. A good deal has been said as to the way in which Australian inventions have been pirated. Machines have been manufactured abroad from pirated designs, under conditions that are not entirely Australian, and sold here as surplus stock in competition"" with Australian productions. As one ""who is engaged in farming putsuits, I say without fear of contradiction, that cereal cultivation as we know it in Australia today would not have attained its present proportions but for the inventive genius, and the enterprise of the Australian manufacturer.",64
430,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then why do local manufacturers require such high - duties ?,64
431,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I have already said that cereal cultivation, by means of up-todate mechanical appliances, in the drier parts of our territorv. was rendered possible only by the establishment of the agricultural implement industry in Victoria and South Australia. As to the standard of morality of those competing with the Australian manufacturers, what do we find? Nob only did they carry to America copies of the Australian harvester, but they actual lv took there a copy of the catalogue of the firm that was manufacturing it here.",64
432,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Have we never improved upon implements made elsewhere?,64
433,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I shall deal_ with that point when reviewing the position in regard to other implements. discussing what is a purely Australian machine, and am attempting to show that those who have devoted so much enterprise and energy to the establishment of this industry have been a material factor in the development of cereal production in Australia, and are entitled to some consideration, although not at the cost of the man engaged upon the land. An Australian designed and Australian-made machine was taken to America and copied there, and the firm which copied it had the audacity to send the copies back to this market under the same name as that of the Australian machine, accompanied with a catalogue which was an exact copy of the Australian catalogue.",64
434,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The Australians' got their design originally from America. The Commissioners draw'attention to that fact in their report.,64
435,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The honourable member is in ignorance of the true facts. In this catalogue are the printed testimonials obtained by the makers of the Australian machine, it being made to appear by the makers of the American machine that the testimonials relate to that, and not to the Australian machine. Is that the standard of morality which the Opposition supports?",64
436,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"It was a very dishonest business, and we do not justify it .",64
437,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,In what year was it done?,64

439,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The catalogue to which I refer was published, not by the Massey-Harris or the International Harvester Company, but by the Union Harvester Company of America. It contained testimonials given by neighbours of mine in the northern district of Victoria to Messrs. Nicholson and Company, cf Melbourne, the makers of the Australian Union Harvester. These testimonials were, published by the American firm in such a way to lead the public to believe that they related to the American machines.",64

442,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The Anderson BamI am now grover Manufacturing Co., San Jcse, California.",64
443,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What the honourable member speaks of is a fraud.,65
444,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Is the existence of such a fraud a reason why the farmers should be required to pay exorbitant prices for harvesters ?,65
445,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The statement that they will have to do so is a fallacy to which the Tariff Commission has given credence.,65
446,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,There is no help for it ; the evidence is overwhelming.,65
447,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"M u c h stress has been laid on the contention that the agricultural implement industry is not languishing, and that its business has gradually increased, especially in regard to harvesters. I ask however, what was the value of importations of harvesting machinery apart from reapers and binders, in 1900? Not j £ i worth was imported.",65
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What has do with the point at issue?,65
449,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,It has been said that the Australian agricultural implement industry is developing.,65
450,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The manufacturers say so-MCKa y and the others.,65
451,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"T e n vears ago the harvester was not generally used in Australia; but the inventive genius and ability of our people has so perfected that machine that today no farmer has any doubt as to its adaptability to his requirements under given climatic conditions. The old method of harvesting has consequently become obsolete and there has been a considerable expansion of cereal cultivation in Northern Victoria and Southern and Western New South Wales. within the last twelve years that the production of wheat has increased in New South Wales. That is due to the improvement of agricultural machinery. Although it has been said that in the pre-Federal clays the Victorian farmer was impoverished by protective duties, the wheat prcduction of Victoria was greater then than that of New South Wales, notwithstanding that (he latter State has the larger area of country suitable for the growth of wheat.",65
452,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,The New South Wales were able to make money in other employments..,65
453,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The increase of cultivation has been brought about largely by the improvement of harvesting machinery. As soon as foreign firms, whose distributing organizations were largely developed, found that there was a field for their enterprise in Australia, they sought to take advantage of it . The literature of the world relating to protection contains no statement more strongly supporting the beneficial effects of that policy than a proposal made by the Australian representative of the Massey-Harris Company in 1902. It was put forward in connection with an attempt to bring the manufacturers into line. I do not know that it is necessary fo? me to read the whole of it, because it is printed in the minutes of evidence at page 1853, and is embodied in a letter which was forwarded to Mr Lennon upon some business matter. It contains the following statement: The manufacturers in the countries from which Australian competitive imports are drawn, have already established facilities sufficient for producing all their home requirements that 10 in seven or eight months of the year. They have also taken advantage of modern combination, complete organization, abundant capital, convenient and cheap raw materials, long working hours, extensive factories, and the latest labour-saving machinery and appliances, consequently the necessity for seeking new markets, where they can dispose of their surplus stock. Unfortunately, these facts are not generally known. Under these circumstances, Australian manufacturers, occupy an unenviable position, and need not hope to retain their limited trade, to say nothing of expansion or foreign trade, unless their competitors are checkmated without delay. The great masses of the people have little knowledge and no means of ascertaining the true effect of recent economic changes in rival countries. The people are trusting the daily press and their representatives in the Federal Parliament to watch the course of events in the outside It is only world, and to indicate and frame legislation required to safeguard Australian interest. The Australian people, however, occupy a unique position, and now have a splendid opportunity for leading the world on a home productive policy, before the baneful effects of the all-absorbing and unrestricted combines and trusts are felt and established on our shores. This statement was annexed to a proposal submitted by the Massey-Harris Company before the formation of the International Harvester Company.",65
454,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,What is the people of point ?,65
455,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"The representative of the Massey-Harris Company was attempting to form an Australian combine for manufacturing purposes, with a view to forestalling the American combine, and controlling the Australian market.",65
456,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,W as that the bine of which Mr MCKay was a member?,66
457,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Frequen t reference for use in the corning harvest. has been made to the combine with which Mr MCKay was connected, and I cheer- £ full y make honourable members a present of all the capital they can make out of it . Who were the authors; whence did the original proposition emanate? usual source-the importers, who always want to create a monopoly. I have atbut tempted to deal with the assertions that had no languishing Australian industries, that there was no undue importation of agthe public. ricultural machinery, and that there was no possibility of undue competition from abroad. I have referred to the fact that at a certain, period practically not £ \ worth of harvesting machinery, reapers and binders, which were not made here, was imported into Australia. There were no importations of the stripper, was supplanted by the harvester. The free-trade market of New South Wales was open to the world, but the Americans not then perfected their organization, the Victorian manufacturer, under a protective duty, was able to sell his machines and implements in the open market of New South Wales for exactly the same prices that he was receiving in the protected market of Victoria. At that in price. time there was not one manufacturer. of that particular class of implements in South Wales, and there is very little that if it had not been for the fact that the Victorian manufacturer had his home market protected, he would not have been able to establish his industry. We had this advantage over New South Wales, we were able to provide employment in connection with the manufacture of impletion ments here, and we were able to develop implements ? the manufacture of machinery, without which the cultivation of our arable lands existence then. upon an extensive scale would have been impossible. Those who say that there has been no displacement of trade will have prove that it is not possible for our facturers to produce every machine that required without involving the consumers in increased cost. I venture to say that the proposal of the Government proves yond a shadow of doubt the soundness the position that has always been taken by protectionists, namely, that an effective - Victorian Tariff? protective duty does not increase the cost of the article produced. I have here the consumer ? trade list of a manufacturer of implements comwhich is dated the ist September, 1906, and is intended to apply to machines sold The machine, which was sold last year for 8 \ , or its equivalent, is offered this year ft >r £ l $ .

462,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Martin' s machine cannot come into competition, with what I had may call the standard machines, which and have, been selling for £ S i . If the operating local manufacturers act fairly in their trading relations with the public, it f o l lows as a matter of course that the machine which they are selling today for £ 6 3 will suffer a corresponding reduction",66
463,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Messrs . Nicholson New and Morrow were selling their machines doubt in 1902 for £ 7 2 13s. 9d.,66

468,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am not discussing vest. that aspect of the matter. My point is that when the Minister increased the valuatheir tion of those machines for Customs poses from . £ 3 8 to . £ 6 5 , their price to the consumer was almost immediately duced by ,£10.",67
469,Mr HENRY WILLIS,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,If we imposed prohibitive duty upon them. I suppose that we should get them for nothing?,67
470,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"I am merely dealing with facts.

If these proposals be carried those engaged in the industry here will be able to specialize, and to reduce the cost of marketing these machines. They will have to cater for the i nmarket of Australia under a healthy condition of local competition, and will also be able to seek a market h i other parts of the In be these circumstances it is the duty of the Parliament when the opportunity offers to develop industries that are natural to Ausprice tralian conditions. When an .attempt is made, as suggested by the deputy leader of Opposition, to increase the cost of tools who of trade, honourable members have every justification for throwing out a challenge, and closely questioning every step taken in that direction. But in this case it is proposed to provide by law that the price of these machines, within the next two years, r shall be reduced by at least 14 per cent. n these circumstances the onus of proving that the Government proposal will prejudicially affect the users of harvesters is There are many other points to which I should like to * , refer, but I . do not wish to unduly occupy the time of the Committee. Although in the course of these debates insinuations are sometimes made, I think that they are often an levelled at honourable members on the spur enof the moment, and sometimes unwittingly. We are prone to allow our imagination to t run riot at times. It has been said that, in regard to matters of this kind, we should move in easy stages. I was among the those who at the lastgeneral election V. 1 were practically pledged to fiscal during the life of this Parliament. cumstances over which I have had no conengaged trol have . forced me from the position then took up. In giving that pledge, at a time when I did not know that a Tariff Commission was to be appointed, tinctly stated that if I was forced to take action, my vote would be cast every time for protection. The late Prime appointed a Tariff Commission, which has had a very serious and responsible cast upon it. I respect and admire the patience and ability shown by the members of the Commission, and the sacrifices they have made. I have no quarrel with differences of opinion. They all are of repute, who have the respect and conditions. fidence of every member of this Parliament. Those who challenge the conclumember sions of any honourable member ought to p:ice of harvesters? exhibit that spirit of toleration which they may fairly expect of others. It has stated' that the manufacturers who support the establishment of manufacpoverish, turing industries in Australia are, so. speak, filching money out of the pockets those engaged in primary production. one who is employed ..year in and year out in farming pursuits, I claim to have some knowledge of the industry in two States. I have no pecuniary advantage, to gain from any manufacturing industry, repeat, without fear of successful diction, that cereal production in Australia would not have achieved its present dimendutv. sions but for the inventive genius and enterprise of the Australian makers. I go further, and say that that fact is proven by the public utterances the leader of the Opposition-one ablest exponents of free-trade in Australia - as well as by those made in pre-Federal days by the honourable member for Gippsnot land. In Victoria and New South Wales we have two farming populations moved from the same starting point. vided only by a river, we have soil of exactly similar quality, which was devoted farmers. originally to pastoral pursuits, and eventually, as necessity demanded, tural purposes. It has been, and is becalled moderate. ing, tilled in each State by the same class of people, and the position of those on Victorian side furnishes an illustration the advantages which a protective confers upon the man on. the land. admitted by the leader of the Opposition as well as by the honourable member for Mr Kennedy. peace Gippsland, who is a well recognised Cirauthority upon the interests of those upon the soil, that in the protecI tive State, land occupied under conditions exactly similar to those prevailing in the free-trade State of .

It has been said by some honourable members that they are willing to vote for a moderate duty, but, as I interjected, moderation means nothing. and I We cannot apply that qualification.  - more than ,£30 per machine is not a small",68
482,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Unles s a duty is high implement enough to effectively keep the home market for the Australian manufacturer it win be of useless. The men who get the benefit of of the any reduction of duties are the importers, not the farmers. What we require is, not a moderate, but an effective duty. I am able to sav exactly what the rates should be, but if effect is given to the proposal who of the Government, and a fixed rate of Di- £ 1 6 per harvester is imposed, it will not increase the cost of these machines to the  to agricul- .£30 16s. 66. on each machine cannot be",68
483,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"T do not look at the the auestion from that point of view. I think of that the Australian farmer will get his policy harvesting machines at the lowest possible It is price only if the Australian market is kept for the Australian manufacturer. I say here, as I have said before my constituents, that I will vote, not for duties of 10 or 20 per cent., but for whatever duties will have that result.",68
484,Mr JOHNSON,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,Then the honourable member believes in the establishment of monopolies ?,69
485,Mr KENNEDY,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Thank s to the foresight and judgment of the Government, we have on the statute-book a measure which will enable us to deal effectively with any monopolies that mav arise in Australia. The obligation rests upon thos.: who say that the proposed duty will increase the cost of harvesters to the Australian farmer to prove the statement, and to show that the result of the action of the Government will not be to reduce the price. That has been the experience of protective duties in Victoria, and all over the world. I ask those who wish to develop that national sentiment by which alone a great people can - be welded together to consider .this auestion from every stand-point. The alteration of a Tariff ought not to be and cannot be undertaken in every session of Parliament. Australia have attempted to create ideal conditions for our industrialTCpulation.I understand that the Australian worker is in an even better position than is the Canadian worker, his hours being shorter, while the task system is practically unknown here, in the agricultural implement manufacture at least. We desire to do all that is possible to improve the conditions of life in Australia, and to make the country attractive to our people. The experience of the world shows that most progress is being made today, even in agricultural production, by protected countries. If we are to develop, we must diversify the avenues of employment, both on the land and in the factories, and give fair conditions to those who embark their capital in manufacturing enterprise. Having con. sidered the interests of the manufacturers, the workers, the primary producers, and the consumers inrelation to the proposal of the Government, I feel that I have ample justification for supporting it ",69
486,Mr MCCOLL,AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND,"Echuca) [11.17] - I do not desire to give a silent .vote upon this question, because of its great importance to the people whom I reuresent. ' Like the honourable member for Moira. I represent a farming division, and have done so for the last twenty-one years. During that time. I have had to fight many elections, and have always been opoosed by free-traders. I dare say that I could at times have won more easily as a free-trader than as a protectionist; but I have always found the farmers ready to concede reasonable protection to the manufacturing industries, even when their own supplies were affected, although it has always been felt that, as the primary producers do not benefit by protection as largely as do other consumers, high duties should not be placed upon their implements and tools of trade. Under the Victorian Tariff the duty nn agricultural implements was 15 per cent., and in New Zealand, so careful have the authorities been that no burden should be placed on the farmers, agricultural implements are admitted duty free. When it was feared that foreign competitors would monopolize the local ' market, the late Mr Seddon would not propose a protective duty, but, instead, gave bounties to the local implement makers. The point upon which the whole discussion has turned, and the one that we shall have to settle, is: what is the value of the stripWe in per-harvesters? The honourable member for Moira stated that it did not matter what duty was imposed, provided that precautions were taken against the price to the consumer being increased. We must, however, remember that if we impose a duty upon one set of farming implements, and protect the farmer against an increase in price, we may be called upon to levy higher duties upon other materials also used by farmers, but in regard to which we cannot protect them against an increase in the cost. I desire to hold the balance fairly between those who make implements and those who use them. I agree that invention should be stimulated, and that our manufacturing industries should be encouraged, so that we may be able to find employment for our youths. If we adopt that policy we shall provide a larger market for the products of the soil, and thus - give our primary producers that which they most need. The experience that I have gained during my recent travels leads me to the conclusion that those countries which have adopted a protective policy are the most prosperous, and have less poverty within their borders than is to be found in those which .are still adhering to the principle of free-trade. I was inclined early this evening to agree with the Government proposal to impose a fixed duty, but such _ a wide divergence of opinion appears to exist ' as to the value of the machines that I am beginning to doubt whether that would be the best course to adopt. We should have some idea of the value of the article which is to be made the subject of the duty before levying a specific impost. The Minister of Trade and Customs rather arbitrarily assessed the value of imported harvesters at ,£65, whereas the sworn testimony given before the Tariff Commission would lead one to the conclusion that the valuation could not be fixed at more than ,£41. I propose to continue my remarks tomorrow. Progress reported. NA (STATES DEBTS) BILL. Bill' presented by Mr DEAKIN, and read a first time. NA PRESERVATION BILL. Bill returned from the Senate, with amendments. ADJOURNMENT. ORDER OF BUSINESS.",69
487,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [11.26] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I would ask honourable members to assist the Government in closing the discussion upon the whole of the proposals in relation to harvesters and agricultural implements as soon as possible tomorrow.",70
488,Mr MCCOLL,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Echuca) [11.27] - I am sure that honourable members will be very glad to help the Government in the manner suggested, but I would ask the Prime Minister to consent to the House meeting at half-past 3 instead of^half-past 2 tomorrow. Honourable members will not be able to get out to the show and meet their friends if the House meets at the usual hour.",70
489,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs [11.27] - I should have been very glad to agree to the suggestion of the honourable member, but I would point out that a number of honourable members do not desire to attend the show, and that it will not be necessary for those who wish to go out to the Agricultural Society's grounds to attend here before half past 4, because a division is not likely to take place before that time.",70
490,Mr MCCAY,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,Will the Prime Minister promise that?,70
491,Mr DEAKIN,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,I think that I can safely do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.28 p.m. 1,70
