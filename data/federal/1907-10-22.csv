PETITIONS.  from certain electors of South Australia, one containing fifty-seven and the other thirty-four signatures, praying the House to reduce the duties on agricultural and mining machinery. Mr LIVINGSTON presented three similar petitions, .containing - twenty-six, thirty-nine, and forty signatures. Mr COON' presented a petition from 483 workers in the confectionery trade, praying the House to agree to the proposed duties on confectionery. Petitions received. PORT DAVY LIGHT. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In view of the ever-increasing number of wrecks on the west coast of Tasmania, and the great suffering inflicted thereby on the passengers and crews of ships, will the Government, for humanity's sake, assist the State of Tasmania to erect shelter, provide food, and build and maintain a lighthouse at Port Davy?",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The question'of lighting that portion of the Tasmanian coast is under consideration,' because of the probable early transfer of. the control of marine lights to the Commonwealth... Proposals in connection with it are now in the office of the Treasurer. I understand that, and their reason for improving the lighting of that part of the coast, is .that the honourable member represents it. TARIFF. NA AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT.",14
2,Mr FOWLER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"I should like to know, Mr Speaker, whether copies of the correspondence respecting a resolution passed by the Western Australian Parliament concerning the Tariff, which has taken place between yourself, as representing this House, and the Government of Western Australia, can be laid on the table.",14
3,Mr SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"If the House desires that the papers should-be laid on the table, I shall have much pleasure in presenting themi tomorrow, because by that time the latest letter will have reached Perth. PREFERENTIAL TRADE.",15
4,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Australian correspondent of the London Times was correct in informing that journal, on the 16th August, that the Prime Minister had sent through him a message to British merchants and the supporters of preference on the subject of the Government's intention in reference to that policy? If so, does the honourable and learned member not think that the members of this Legislature are now entitled to the fullest, or, at the same information? Will he explain the meaning of his statement to the British merchants that "" the Government is determined to make preference effective,"" and state whether, in his opinion, it is in keeping with that determination that the Government proposed a preference equivalent to 16.2/3 °n wire netting, which, under pressure, they changed to a preference equivalent to 33.1/3 per cent., and finally voted for an amendment making it 50 per cent. ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is this essay ?",15
5,Mr SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"The honourable and learned member is approaching very near to-if he is not entering on- a debate on the Tariff, which is now under consider a. tion in the Committee of Ways and Means.",15
6,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"I shall make my question shorter, so as not to touch on debatable matter. Will the Prime Minister explain the meaning of his statement to the British merchants that the Government is determined to make preference effective? Will he inform the Parliament what he means by his statement to the British merchants, through the Times correspondent, that the present arrangements are only a first step, and state what other step is contemplated, so as to enable the Committee now sitting to understand the Government policy ?",15
7,Mr SPEAKER,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"An answer to those questions must necessarily be"" part of a debate on a matter referred to the Committee of Ways and Means, and I could not allow the Prime Minister to make such a reply.",15
8,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"May I ask for an answer to the first question, whether the Australian correspondent of - the London Times was correct in informing that journal, on 16th August, that the Prime Minister had sent through him a message to British merchants, and the supporters of preference, on the subject of the Government's intentions in' regard to that policy. If so, does he not think that the members of this Legislature are now entitled to the fullest, or at least the same, information?",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,"On my way northwards, about the date mentioned, the correspondent of the London Times met me in Sydney. To his request for some statement regarding the Tariff, I raised the objection that there was nothing new at least, that - time. He then asked a question or two, adding that he thought even the shortest answers would be of great interest at that time to merchants and others in Great Britain concerned in the preferential question. Accordingly, I replied, practically in terms which differ only in trifling verbal construction from the summary - which the honourable and learned member hasjust read. The correspondent had mentioned at the commencement of the interview that he thought my replies would be of interest to merchants and preferentialists, but they an were given by me as answers rather than messages to any particular class of persons. The statements are correctly given. I hope, if the debate advances far enough, to have' an opportunity to touch upon this very question this evening. Mr B'RUCE SMITH-Arisin g out of my question, I beg to ask the Prime Minister whether the Times' correspondent is. right in saying, "" Mr Deakin sends this message to British, merchants and supporters of preference,"" and then quoting as coming from the honourable gentleman these wordsThe preferential schedule of the Tariff has been compiled after a careful study of foreign impoTts, and will , on close examination, be found to be much more favourable than it appears at first sight. It shows that the Federal Government is determined to make preference effective, and regards the present arrangement only as a first step.",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,RESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTERN,That is a perfectly correct statement. NA CORRESPONDENTS.,15
11,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"At page 273 of the report of the debates of the Imperial ference appears a statement by Mr Lloyd George, to the effect that he was consulting the Prime Minister in reference to the pointment of six correspondents in tralia to the Board of Trade, and' as their personnel and duties. I wish know from the honourable and learned genand tleman if he has been consulted, and the appointments have been made on his recommendation.",16
12,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The six corresponof dents of the British Government were pointed before we arrived in England. consultation which Mr Lloyd George posed did not follow, so far as I remember, Customs. because I had already had an interview with the head of the branch of ment charged with the nominations. I learned from him at first that they had been finally confirmed, and at a later that they were practically confirmed. The correspondents were appointed without recommendation from this Government.",16
13,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"Arisin g hand out of the reply to the question honourable * member for Corio, I desire to ask the Prime Minister if any claim has been put forward that there should be a consultation in regard to the appointment of correspondents of the Board of Trade, and if so, does it involve our submitting a claim, if made, by the British GovernEurope, ment thaf they should be consulted in retime ' ference to the appointment of Agentstion? General ?",16
14,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Without putting it as an official claim, it is in the highest desirable that the British Government, fore making appointments of. this kind, should give the Government of the Commonwealth an opportunity of knowing is proposed to appoint, and of making any representations they think necessary. A similar practice, of course, would be adopted oh the first intimation from the vernment of the Mother Country that they desired information in regard to any similar appointments in England that we proposed to make.",16
15,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"If a in claim for consultation is put forward from this side in regard to the appointment such comparatively unimportant persons as stamp. the correspondents of the Board of Trade, will not that involve a claim that the British authorities should be consulted in reference to the appointment of much more important persons, such as the AgentsConGeneral or the High Commissioner ?",16
16,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable member will see that there is no parallel beaptween the cases mentioned. In this case Auswe appoint an Australian to proceed from to Australia to Great Britain as an officer of to the Government to carry out its directions the policy of the country. In the other if cases the appointments which are made in Great Britain are of a comparatively minor character from persons selected here, agents the Government for special duties, which apbring them in contact with certain DepartThe ments of the Federal Government, notably, profor instance, the Department of Trade and",16
17,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Whic h occurs his Departwith the Agents-General.,16
18,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,I fail to follow that not parallel; in fact 1 understood the first date part of the honourable member's statement to set it aside. It does appear to me that any it would have been a courteous and also a wise act if we had been informed beforeof the names of the persons proposed of the to be appointed correspondents. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE.,16

21,Mr FRAZER,BOARD OF TRADE,"In this morning's newsGopapers it is announced that the committee appointed to consider a design for a Commonwealth stamp have submitted a report in which it is stated that the first important recommendation is - fully concurred by the Postmaster-General, and that it is to the effect that a representation of the of King's head must appear on the new I wish to ask the Postmaster General if it is his intention to afford to the Parliament an opportunity to decide - whether the stamp shall bear a representation of the King's head or something emblematic of Australia?",16
22,Mr MAUGER,BOARD OF TRADE,"I see no obstacle to having on the stamp a good emblem of Australia, and also a representation of the King's head. That is my intention.",17
23,Mr FRAZER,BOARD OF TRADE,Has the honourable gentleman any objection to saying whether pr not the Parliament will be afforded an opportunity of expressing an opinion with regard to the design approved by him?,17
24,Mr MAUGER,BOARD OF TRADE,"It is my intention to instruct that a part bf the design shall be a representation of the King's head, and the Parliament can overrule that decision at any time if it thinks fit. KALGOORLIE-PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY SURVEY.",17
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,BOARD OF TRADE,"I desire to ascertain from the Prime Minister whether the Government has received any information as to the approval by the Parliament of South Australia rendered necessary by the Act for a survey of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta? A considerable interval has elapsed since a copy of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Sur.vey Act was forwarded to the Government of the State, and as it will be much more dimcult to make a survey in the summer than in the cooler parts of the year, I would suggest to the honourable gentleman that he might with advantage urge upon the Government of South Australia that valuable time is being lost, and that the Parliament and the Government of the Commonwealth will be very glad if they will deal with the matter as promptly as possible.",17
26,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"My recollection is that within the last week or so we have received from the South Australian Government a reply to our inquiries, the effect upon noticeof which is that as soon as the business immediately before the House of Assembly is disposed of the question will be dealt with. POST AND TELEGRAPH ACT.",17
27,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has' any ground for supposing that persons other than Mr Wren and Mr Oxenham, in respect of whom an order was recently made forbidding the transmission of postal matter, are engaged in the practice mentioned in section 57 of the Post and Telegraph Act of 1901; and, if so, whether the ground of his suspicion is reasonable within the meaning of the section?",17
28,Mr MAUGER,BOARD OF TRADE,"To say that I have no ground of suspicion in the cases, to which the honourable member has referred would be to say what is not correct. But I .do say that the cases mentioned are the only ones of the kind which have been brought under my notice.' I have taken action in regard to them, after consultation with the Crown Law officers, and in accordance with the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act. I have not discriminated between persons, and will not discriminate in any way. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until 5 p.m. tomorrow.

30,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The answer to the honoroble member's question is as follows- . Inquiry will be made, and if it is found that any such charges are being made under the provisions of the Commerce Act, request will be made for their discontinuance. PAPUA: APPOINTMENTS. GOVERNMENT AGENT, RIGO, AND COMMANDANT OF POLICE.",17
31,Mr MCDONALD,BOARD OF TRADE,"for Mr MALONEY) asked the Minister of External Affairs, 1. Is it a fact that the position of - Government agent at Rigo, Papua, is now held by a Samoan who has a Papuan wife and is regarded by the natives as one of themselves ? 2. Does not such an appointment militate against the natives' respect for the white man's Government ? 3. Is it a fact that the abolition of the position of commandant of police in New Guinea was dictated by animus against W. B. Bruce, the late commandant? 4. Is it a fact that the abolition of the office has led to the demoralization of the police force and the consequent weakening of control over the natives, and if so, will the Minister consider the necessity of reinstating the position? .",17
32,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The answers to the desire honourable member's questions are low :t and 2. Not that I am aware of. The Ashurry ? sistant Resident Magistrate stationed at Rigo, Mr Boucher, is at present absent from the Territory on sick leave. A despatch received - only yesterdav says :- "" Mr Belford to continue to act as caretaker at Rigo until the return to visions. - duty of Mr Boucher, Assistant Resident Magistrate."" Mr Belford is, I believe, a white <man. 3. The position was abolished on the recommendation of the Papua Royal Commission for - reasons given on page C 11 of their report. 4. No reports to this effect have been received, but special inquiry will be made. MARINE INSURANCE BILL. '",18
33,Mr GROOM,BOARD OF TRADE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [3.22] - I move That leave be granted to bring in a Bill for .an Act relating to marine insurance. In submitting this motion, I desire to say that it will not be proceeded with for a few weeks, as it is desirable to allow the parties who are interested in the measure an opportunity to peruse it, and to make any representations that they may deem to be necessary. The Bill purports to embody a codification of the law. In the six States of the Commonwealth at the present time, the law relating to marine insurance is based upon what is known as the common law, and in order to ascertain what the common law is it is necessary to consult something like 2,000 decisions of the various Courts. In England, Sir M. D. Chalmers, the ""famous draftsman, who drafted the Bills of Exchange Act, codified the law in respect of marine insurance, after having spent a considerable - time upon it. 1894 and 1906 the measure which he drafted came before; itihe Imperial Parliament several times, and was carefully considered by expert Committees. Lajst year-afte r it had undergone several modifications-it became the law of Great Britain. It is proposed to adapt that law to the conditions of Australia, and, accordingly, we desire to afford those who are interested in the measure every opportunity to see how far the provisions of the British Act are applicable. My advice is that the Bill is suitable to Australian conditions, but, inasmuch as it relates to a matter which concerns particular interests, it is highly desirable that those who will be affected by it should have an opportunity of becoming familiar with its provisions before its second reading is carried. to have the measure circulated at the as folearliest possible moment.

37,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Angas) [3.27] - Upon this item I desire to test the feeling of the Committee on the general question of whether or not any preference should be - extended to the Mother Country. I do not intend to labour the matter, as upon two previous occasions I have advanced reasons for the excision of the second column of this Tariff. These reasons really amount to this: that I believe the initiation of a policy of preference will make against, rather than for, the integrity of the Empire. I therefore desire to moveBetween That after the figure ""2d."" the words ""and on and after 23rd October, 1907 (United Kingdom), free,"" be inserted. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume)-Trea surer-[3.28] - In dealing with this matter I do not propose to occupy the time of the Committee at any length. From events which have occurred during the past two or three years-and particularly during the past six or twelve months-the desire of the Government in. reference to the extension of a preference as between Australia and Great Britain must be very clear to honourable members. If they desire to obtain further information upon that question, they need only read the Hansard report of the debate which took place in this Chamber a little more than two years ago, and also the report of the proceedings of I the Imperial Conference.",18
38,Mr JOHNSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"The proposal submitted to the Conference was to extend a preference to the Empire. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The Prime Minister and myself dealt with this matter so far as Australia was concerned. had no authority to deal with - it from any other stand-point. In the official report of the debates of the Conference, honourable members will find set out in detail the tion which the Government have taken up regarding this question, and they will also discover that the proposals which were there foreshadowed have been honestly embodied in this Tariff. I intend to quote from a few English journals, because, I regret to say, that owing to the formation of the cable syndicate, the public of Australia obtain only news which has been censored by its representative in London.",19
39,Mr WILKS,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable gentleman - managed to get his "" stuff"" through all right.",19
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"Because it was worth sending, although both the Prime Minister's observations and mine were curtailed. They did not send anything more than they desired to. send. In some of the newspapers which I have had an opportunity to read, extracts from which I shall quote in the course of my speech, it. is shown that what has been represented in Australia through the cables published in the newspapers, to the effect that Great Britain is against a policy of preference is not warranted-that what has been published here is not a true interpretation of British feeling today.",19
41,Mr WILKS,BOARD OF TRADE,What about the last general election in Great Britain?,19
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I do not desire to make a speech which will lead to almost interminable debate, and that is why I have referred honourable members to what took place when the Prime Minister and myself were in Great Britain. We then stated that this question would be settled, and that we could settle it readily enough when we were dealing with the Tariff. There is, of course, a great' temptation to make a lengthy speech, but I shall not embrace the present opportunity to do so. It had been intended. I think, to commence a debate upon the subject on Thursday,' but the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Angas today affords a better opportunity than we should then have had, because, under the circumstances which then prevailed, the question might have been mixed up with matters arising in connection 1 with the general tariff. I think the honourable member's amendment now before the Committee will have the effect! of shortening the debate. It has been said by honWe orable members opposite, and by other people outside, that the preference proposals of the Government are made by way of bargaining. Nothing of the kind posiis the case. There is no bargain of any sort.",19
43,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"Unfortunately , no.",19
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I cannot help saying, in reply to the interjection of the honourable member, that I should have liked very much to see our proposals reciprocated by Great Britain.",19
45,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,That is what the honourable gentleman said at the last general election.,19
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"And I should . like to see them reciprocated now. I said the same in Great Britain, where my argu-. ment went to show that the policy of preference would do a great deal of good in the development of our agricultural resources in Australia, and' also in cementing all parts of the Empire together. But to say so much was not to advocate this policy by way of bargaining. The Government, as I shall show by references to the Prime Minister's speeches, said at the Imperial Conference that a policy of preference would be proposed, but that nothing in the nature of a bargain would be put forward. There is no understanding, there is no bargalin of any kind as between Great Britain and Australia. Tlierefore the statement that there has been any bargaining is absolutely without foundation.",19
47,Mr WILKS,BOARD OF TRADE,There could not be a bargain without two parties to it.,19
48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,That is what I say. The proposal of the Government is simply to extend a preference to Great Britain. I shall show presently that the preference proposed in this Tariff is not the mythical preference that some honourable members seek to make out. It is a substantial preference.,19
49,Mr BRUCE SMITH,BOARD OF TRADE,"Does the honourable gentleman .mean the 16 per cent, preference which the Government proposed, or the 50 per cent, which the Committee adopted.",19
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable member is surely going "" ratty."" He should ask more sensible questions. The proposals of the Government are of such a character as to be absolutely substantial. The question was asked last week- "" Upon what basis is this proposal made ? '"" The basis is to take the large foreign imtracts. portations as shown by the figures in Globe, which saysthe .papers circulated in connection with the Tariff, and to give a preference is But in respect of those importations in theinCommonwealthplain favour of Great Britain. That is the main basis. I shall presently quote some "" figures to show to what extent carried out. The principle upon which the Government has acted has been to have gard to the immense foreign trade which undermining British importations to AusMinister, tralia today, and leading to an increased foreign trade.",19
51,Mr HEDGES,BOARD OF TRADE,That is denied.,20
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"Where there is .a large importation from foreign countries, part of which, at any rate, we think could been published. be transferred to Great Britain, our principle is to endeavour to so divert that trade or a portion of it. The Government wish to see a change from foreign trade to British trade. It must not be thought for a single continuesmoment that anything which I say is to be interpreted to mean that we do not intend to protect our own industries. It would be commercial a most absurd thing to so lower our Tariff and as to lead to an increased importation from the 'Mother Country of goods which we ourdisabilities."" selves can manufacture. I say that we, in a young country like this, have to tect our own industries, or we shall not doing justice to Australia; and one pf great objects of this new Tariff is to justice to Australian manufacturers and producers of raw material-to give them increased opportunities of converting that material into manufactured goods. But our object is at the same time so to arrange Tariff as to secure that a greater portion the large importations from foreign counand, tries shall be transferred and enter Austo tralia through British channels. , Let have these goods, as far as possible, brought from Great Britain. To secure that will be to do an immense amount of good to British trade, and to British manufacwhile turers, while at the same time conserving - to a very great extent our trade within British Empire.",20
53,Mr JOHNSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Does the honourable gentleman really believe that?,20
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"The member ought to know perfectly well that I am always earnest in anything I say, and that I always mean it. I mean this absolutely. On the question of what press think, and what a very large section of the public hi Great Britain think, I may perhaps be permitted to read a few exI shall first quote from the London the main principle of the Australian Tariff conformity with the declarations of delegates to the Conference. "" Our first consideration,"" said Mr Deakin, will be that of the circumstances of Australia it has been and its demands."" That is what was said at the Conference; reand yet there are honourable members and is people outside who have attacked the Prime the Government, and myself for going back upon what was said at the Conference. What I have quoted were the words uttered by the Prime Miniater. But we have not seen anything of that in the telegrams from Great Britain which have",20
55,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,The Times said that the proposals of the Government were derisory ,20
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"This article "" The next will be the possibility of giving a preference, and therefore entering into closer relations with the Mother Country our sister dominions. The third will be how far and in what degree it shall apply to - foreign countries who single us out for special proI have heard a good many people say that be the Government proposals are calculated to the do injury to our commerce, inasmuch as do our raw materials will be excluded by Germany, the United States, and other nations. ""As a matter of fact, Germany taxes almost raw everything possible at the present moment. That country does not take our wool, wneab the minerals, or other raw materials - for the of sake of 'Australia^ but for her own sake; therefore, the argument as to injury our commerce in this connection is nonus sensical. Then, again, the United States imposes a duty on every commodity we export, but, nevertheless, that country will accept what raw material she requires, at the same time most effectively protecting her own industries. Under the the circumstances, the argument about our making enemies of great nations is not worth a moment's consideration.",20
57,Mr JOHNSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Do not all nations trade honourable for their own benefit?,20
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"Australi a and Great Britain should trade, not only for their mutual commercial benefit, but in order the to promote the sentiment of a unity of Empire. That is what the Government are trying to bring about now. leading article we readAnd even under the new Tariff we receive something for nothing-r-w e cannot blame Australia for any steps she may consider it necessary to take in her own interests.

I say that is true; and that that would be the result if we had the whole, or nearly the whole, of the British market for our foodstuffs. Let me rive one other quotation from the Bristol Times and MirrorI t is understood on all hands that Australia, like Canada, is definitely committed to a protectionist policy. No one will deny that, I .think-nb t even honourable members opposite-and yet the Government are blamed for introducing a protectionist Tariff. The article from the Bristol - Times and Mirror proceeds'But the essence of the Tariff reformer's plea is that the 10 per cent - accordin g to some figures of; Sir, William Lyne's yesterday it is really 13 per cent - migh t be indefinitely extended under a widely comprehensive Imperial scheme. A preference of 13 per cent, is very considerable.",20
59,Mr JOHNSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Is that the percentage of preference on candles?,21
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"-rW e have not yet dealt with the preference on candles, but that, I think, will amount to 25 per cent., and so the average will be raised. In the Commercial Intelligence, Markets of the World, A'ew and Old, there appears the followingSo, in regard to the Australian Tariff, of which particulars had just come to hand when we went to press with our issue of 14th August, we pointed out that there was "" assuredly no intention to put British manufacturers on a level with local producers, but to keep them in front of their foreign competitors"" That is the true positionthough we maintained that the preference given was not a ""sham,"" as some politicians would have us believe. Further study of the Tariff-of which we published a fortnight ago all the details that are evMi yet available in this country-doe s not incline us to qualify our first expression of opinion. the Westminster Gazette acknowledges that "" Sir William Lyne and his school have been In another absolutely frank about their intentions since the question of preference was started."" They; have never made any secret of the fact that their first object was the fostering of their home manufactures, and that nothing would be done for the Mother Country which interfered with it. If , therefore, they think, as they undoubtedly do, that the proper way toencourage and aid home industries is to impose But a high Tariff on competing imports, how can. we blame them if their policy is shaped in> accordance with their beliefs? And since something like two-thirds of the Australian over-sea commerce is with the United Kingdom, howcouldthey carry out their policy unless they protected their own manufacturers against the competition of British firms, since they alonehad so large a share of the trade? That is the position which the Government have always taken up. Our object is to. restrict foreign competition with our own, manufactures, and, as far as possible, transfer the existing foreign trade to Great Britain.",21
61,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Has the honourable gentleman what was said by the London Times, the great advocate of preference?",21
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"No ; but I amnot bound by what the Times says. That newspaper is hot read so much in Great Britain as it is by the Tory readers of Australia. The London Times may be thought much of in Australia, but its circulation did"" not seem, to me to be as large as that of some other London newspapers.",21

70,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I should like to,get reciprocity if I could, but I am not prepared to play "" dog in the manger,"" and, because we can get nothing, give nothing. The following is from the article in the Birmingham Post:Really Australia is but following the course - which from the first they have predicted.",22
71,Mr ATKINSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Are these extracts from articles published since the introduction of the Tariff ?,22
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I think so; I received them only lately. Here is another paragraph from the Birmingham PostI t pleases free-traders to sneer at the preference given; to depreciate its importance, and to regard it as Australia's "" last w o r d "" on the subject. A more mistaken view can hardly be conceived. Let all who desire to discuss the question be perfectly candid and endeavour to realise things as they are. It would not have been surprising if after the Colonial Conference there had been no preference; but Australia has given one without bargaining,"" and on the basis of present conditions. The Westminster Gazette, referring to the question to which I alluded a few moments ago, writesThese complaints are very unreasonable. Sir William promised to give preference; he never promised not to raise the Tariff before he gave preference; he never promised not to make the Tariff prohibitive before he gave preference. . . . Sir William Lyne and his school have been absolutely frank about their intentions since the question of preference was started. They have told us that the fostering of their home manufactures was their first object, and that nothing would be done for the Mother Country which interfered with it. . . But they are free to alter their Tariff as they think' fit, and they have been perfectly frank with us. It is therefore useless and unjust to complain of deception on their part. The Financier of Friday, August 23rd in referring to myself, wrote- All he proposed to do was to raise the duties against foreigners, while leaving the duties which British importers would have to pay at a level which would confer complete protection to the Australian manufacturer. These are a few paragraphs which I have selected from a number recently sent to me from Great Britain. They indicate that there is on the part of a large section of the people of Great Britain a feeling that we are carrying out our promise, and there has been no deception. Every one clearly understood what we proposed to do. They recognise that although we failed in our efforts to induce the British Government to enter into a reciprocal agreement, we did not decline for that reason to grant any (preference to the old country. We are granting her a preference, asking for nothing in return, and are content to wait until she is prepared to reciprocate, if that time should ever come. It is all .very well to urge that we have attempted to interfere with the free-trade policy of Great Britain. I do not intend to discuss that question, except in passing to inquire why our Australian wines could not be admitted duty free into the United Kingdom without raising the price of bread and foodstuffs generally.' The wine industry in Australia is a very large one, but our wines to a large extent are purchased by French people, carried to France, and after being blended, there with much lighter wines, a large proportion of them probably find 'their way into Great Britain. It would be very much better if we were in .a position to secure the direct introduction of our wines free or nearly free into Great Britain.",22
73,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,Did not the honourable gentleman ask for that at the Imperial Conference ?,22
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,Yes .,22
75,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"And although the British Government would not agree to that proposal, the Commonwealth Government, are now offering' Great 'Britain'this preference.",22
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,Yes . I raised the point when Mr Asquith was dealing with the question of free-trade versus protection.,22
77,Sir JOHN,BOARD OF TRADE,FORREST - Wine s from France are not admitted free into the United Kingdom.,22
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I think that there is a duty of 4s. per gallon on wine, but I am not quite sure.",22
79,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,There is a duty of 4s. per gallon on sparkling wines and 3s. per gallon'on other wines'.,22
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"Vigneron s on the Murray have standing agreements, entered into at the date. :of the Paris Exhibition, under which they are still sending wines to France and making a fair profit.",22
81,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,That owing to a difference in the duty. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Does the honourable member mean to say that we should not send our wines direct to Great Britain if they were admitted free of duty?,23
82,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Probably some would be sent to France in the same way as they are now and then re-exported to England.,23
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"When I was in London I tried at the Hotel Cecil for three days to obtain a few bottles of some of the wines produced at the vineyard of the honourable member for Grampians, but could not buy it ih smaller quantities than two gallons.

85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I know that the figures I have given are not very pleasing to some honourable members, but there they are, and they can.be analyzed to ascertain whether or not they are correct. They bear the imprint of the Department. They are not my figures at all. I shall read another statement, comparing the preference offered by us; with that offered by the Canadian Tariff. A number of items are shown with the percentage of preference that each of them carries.",24
86,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"What was 71 per cent, which the honourable gentleman mentioned?",24
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is the percentage proportion of foreign imports on which preference is given to the total foreign imports. The total foreign imports amounted in value to ;£i 1,417,809, on .£8,115,294 of which preference is offered, or a proportion of 71 per cent.

The 5 per cent, duty is but little protection to us, but still there is a preference given in each of those cases of 5 per cent, to the article from the United Kingdom as against the foreign article.  preference on wire netting on that basis.",24
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I do not wish to discuss wire netting now, or to criticise the honourable member's vote on it. . Mr HUGHES - Thos e figures tell us the nothing unless against each one is shown the amount of imports involved. We might have a preference of 100 per cent, where the imports totalled only £ 5 , and a preference of only 5 per cent, where the imports totalled £1,000.",24
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,Honourable members will find that the items taken are the larger items of foreign imports.,24
90,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"A preference of J per cent, might mean a proportional preference of 100 per cent.",24
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"It might, but in every case I am giving a comparison between the two Tariffs. I have also this - statement- Instances where same items are traceable in - Canadian Tariff, 187. Deductions from above - figures :- : - (a) Practically every item in the Canadian - preference is over 20 per cent. - (4) Approximately one-half of Common5 - wealth items show preference of over 3 20 per cent. - That is what honourable memberssay is 2 not a substantial preference- The Canadian preference averages 34* per 12 cent. This is a true average, because it will 1 be noticed that the majority of the items cluster 7 around the 31 per cent, to 40 per cent. mark. 23 The Commonwealth preference items show an 60 average of 44 per cent I draw special attention to this, because 23 4 I do not wish to mislead honourable mem3 bersbut this is inflated by the inclusion of 76 items 4 21 each 100 per cent. The goods enumerated in these 76 items are free if of United Kingdom origin, but low ad valorem rates have been imposed against the imports other than those for 8 the United Kingdom (66 items, 5 per cent, ad valorem; 10 items, 10 per cent, ad valorem). Excluding these 76 items, the Commonwealth average is 194 per cent. However, a reasonable allowance should be made for these items, and the 187 placing them at 33$ per cent, results in a general average of 2.^ per cent., which, from the figures above, seems to fairly represent the case.",24
92,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,The Minister stated just now that the average of our preference was 13 per cent. Can he give the average of the Canadian Tariff on the same basis?,25
93,Sir AVILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is quite adifferent matter, but I have here a statement that has reference to it. It is as follows- , The preference concessions will , on the basis of our present imports, represent ^1,250,000, or 11* per cent. That is to say, th*t amount reprepresents the difference in duty between the general Tariff and the preference Tariff; but as it is expected that the imports from Great Britain will increase in consequence of these preference proposals, it will not be improper to estimate that the concession will amount to, say, ^1,500,000, or 13* per cent.",25
94,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Plo w did Minister arrive at his statement that the concession offered by the Government is a percentage of 1.3 per cent. ?,25
95,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"That was a calculation on a different basis, which did not include the whole of the items. In the last table I read I included a number of items with a percentage preference of 100 per cent. If . the honourable member will go through the figures when they are printed, I shall be glad to hear every criticism that he has to offer upon them, because I have instructed the officers to be exceptionally careful in this matter, and to give me all the particulars, so that I might lay them ibefore the Committee. My main object was to get from independent individuals who understand this question thoroughly-and no one understands the preference proposals better than does the Comptroller-General of Customs, under, whose direction these figures were prepared by one of his officers - a true comparison of the percentages of preference offered by Canada and Australia, showing as a whole the advantage that we propose to give to Great Britain. I have given that information to honourable members, and I shall be very glad to hear what holes they can pick in it.",25
96,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"We do doubt that, but we cannot understand the contradictions without some explanation.",25
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I ask the honourable member to look at the figures carefully, and he will find there are no contradictions. The other evening certain honourable members said that I was giving away the preference in connection with biscuits, anc! I think also in connection with blue. The preference proposed in connection with those items amounts practically to nothing. Neither the Prime Minister nor myself attach much importance to the preference proposed in connection with small items. What we are concerned about are the proposals in connection with the main items which give a considerable and important preference to Great Britain.",25
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,For instance?  items ?,25
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I have only just now referred to the main items"" of foreign importations.  man read a jumble of figures.",25
100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,I read no jumble of figures. I referred honourable the members to the main items. ,25
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"Thos e to which I referred as representing large foreign importations. I am not to blame if the honourable member could not follow them. If the debate on preference is not concluded to-night, honourable members will have an opportunity to see the figures to which I have referred in print. I hope they will go through the various calculations carefullv, to see how they have been worked out by the officers of the Department, when I have no doubt they will find that the figures I have quoted are correct. I wish particularly to impress - upon honourable members that in what I am saying I believe I am giving expression to the very strong feelings entertained by the Prime Minister in regard' to this matter. It will be admitted that the honourable gentleman would be placed in a very unenviable position were the Committee, to refuse to grant the preference submitted after he had given his word that preference to Great Britain would be proposed. The newspaper extracts I have made show that some of the press writers understand exactly what was said, and have correctly interpreted what was stated by the Prime Minister. The Government have brought not - down proposals which will give a substantial preference to British manufacturers in respect of the main items affected, representing at the present time large importations from foreign countries. We desire that a certain proportion of those articles should be manufactured by ourselves, and that the 1 balance should be imported from Great Britain rather than from foreign countries. I have no doubt that a considerable importa-. tion of these articles will continue to be made from foreign countries, but at the same time. I believe that a substantial proportion of them will, under the Government proposals, be imported in future from Great Britain. If we carry, not a halfand-half, but a truly protectionist Tariff, as the country intended, British manufacturers will obtain a share of our present trade with foreign countries, whilst there will still be ample room for the local manufacture and production of many of the articles now imported from foreign countries. Australia is a continent nearly equal in area to the United States, and yet in spite of its great possibilities and mineral wealth, we can. never expect that it will be populated as we desire, unless we establish our own manufactures for the production of articles which we are at present importing from foreign countries. Whilst we desire that our own kith ancl kin in Great Britain should supply us with what we are unable to manufacture and* produce locally, we hope under this Tariff to induce our own people to do a great deal more-than they are now doing to supply Australian requirements in the manufacture of the raw materials we produce. That should be the object of every Australian. Whatever he may call himself, I do not call any man an Australian who encourages the importation of articles which are the production of the cheap labour of the Continent of Europe, to the detriment of our own people. That very thing is being done by some members of the Committee who still call themselves protectionists. If we do nothing else we should at least stand by Australia and the development of Australian industries - the object being that this may be made a self-contained country. When Federation was established, Victoria, by reason of the policv she had adopted, was the only self-contained State in the Union, whilst the State that was least self-contained was New South Wales, the wealthiest State in the Union.",25

103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"The State that was borrowing more money, and paying bigger interest for it than other States. Fortunately, we have not been compelled to borrow money since the establishment of Federation. Free-trade representatives of New South Wales will very soon find that the old Tariff has done good for that State, and that if the hew Tariff is passed in the form the Government desire, manufactures and employment will increase to a greater extent in New South Wales than in any other State, because she possesses such immense latent wealth. They will also find that Australia will become, I hope during my lifetime, a self-contained country of which we can all be proud.",26

105,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Angas) [4.17] - The Tariff, as amended, contains a duty of 2d. per lb. under the general Tariff, and a similar duty is imposed on goods from the United Kingdom. I desire to move the excision of the second duty. The duty on candles would then be 2d. all round. We must come to some understanding as to what the Ministry will, do as a result of the voting on the amendment. What I suggest is that we should test the question whether there should be any preference 1 by a vote for or against my amendment. If , however, the duty is left in, the same object will be accomplished, as there will be no preference given, seeing that the duty proposed will be the same under the general Tariff as under the special Tariff. But if it is struck out, the Ministry can take that as an intimation from the Committee that there is to be no preference given at all, and can re-construct the Tariff on that understanding.",26

111,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"We are now talking of the practice to be followed, and I Contend that if this Committee decides that there shall be no preference in the way I suggest, the Ministry will be bound to amend the second column of the Tariff throughout, or allow it to remain as a perfect anomaly and contradiction.

122,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"I do not suggest that there has been any verbal communication between the Minister and the honourable I member; but the statements made by the Minister to the Committee were equivalent asking him to move the amendment. A number of honourable members who are opposed to preference do not wish to vote for any reduction, while an honourable member like the honourable member for who,, no doubt, would like to see candles admitted as cheaply as posand yet is in favour of giving preference to the United Kingdom, would be placed in a difficulty, because he would either have to vote for a higher duty, or against preference.

If the anti-preferentialists in a majority, they could thus destroy the preference. That, it seems to me, is to the only way to separate the question of preference from the question of figures. We have* often taken a test vote on the first way of ob-word of an amendment. If the Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.37] - The amendment suggested by the leader of the the Opposition is open to a slight objection. We have to remember that the imports from England are collected at the lower rates, and that if the question of preference be tested in that way, or in accordance with suggestion, the Government must still co-operate, either by promising not to sue who have imported at the lower rates for the difference, or by putting in words to the effect that, notwithstanding the alteration, goods imported before the abolition of preference at the lower rate are not to be charged the extra duty. That is the reason why I ask the Government to cooperate with me. Any intelligent Governrate. ment would get the Committee out of its present difficulty by making the necessary provision afterwards. If I were to move to strike out the heading of the column, that would raise the whole question, but, as the Chairman has stated, we have already passed some figures under that heading, and it would be inconvenient to go back now and deal with the heading. M we strike out the second figure there will be no preference given, and the Government can provide subsequently that, notwithstanding that goods were imported at the lower rates, no further duty will be charged.  question before the Committee is that on and after tomorrow the duty should be i j d . per lb. Can we not obtain a fair test on the question of preference if an honourable member will move to strike out of the amendment the words ""and on and after""?",28
138,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is what I have just suggested.  against the grant of preference would vote for the omission of the words "" and on and after."" If they were defeated in the division those words would remain, and we could still deal with the rate of duty. Otherwise I and others would be placed in an awkward position. I do not intend to move, if I can help it, against a reduction of the duty. The test vote ought to be taken in such a way as to preclude the possibility of any honourable members being charged afterwards with having voted against a reduction of the duty. If a test division were taken in the way I have suggested no complication could arise in dealing with the item afterwards, because it would leave the Committee with a free hand as regards the rate of the duty.",29
139,The CHAIRMAN,BOARD OF TRADE,"It will be quite competent for any honourable member to move that the amendment be amended by the omission of the words "" and on and after.""",29
140,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Angas) [4.39] - To bring the discussion to a point, and relying upon the good sense of the Government to make the necessary alteration to protect those who have imported the goods at the lower rate, I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" and on and after."" That, I think, will meet the desire of the Committee.' Sir-WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.40] - I desire to say that it isscarcely fair to attack me for attempting, to do other than to carry out the arrangement which was made the other evening. It was then clearly understood that the honourable member tor Cowper intended totest this question by moving a reduction in the duty proposed to be levied upon, candles imported from the United Kingdom. The honourable member for Angaswished to eliminate the preference altogether, but I objected to that suggestion at the time and it was not' persevered with. What I then said was that I was quite prepared to give the Committee an opportunity to vote upon this question to-night. I do not care in what direction the proposal is made so long as it does not result in any complication of the issue. Why I raised the question in the first instance was that if the original proposal of the honourable member for Angas had been submitted in the form in which such proposals are usually submitted, the proposed preference would, in any case, have been eliminated. I do not withdrawi from the position which I took up the other evening. ",29
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable member for Cowper has moved to reduce the duty upon candles imported from the United! Kingdom by Jd. per lb., and upon his proposal the honourable member for Angas has. moved the omission of the words "" and onand after.'-' I take it that if those wordsare excised the effect will be to destroy the preference proposed to be granted to the United Kingdom right through theschedule. It will probably destroy the Government too. ",29
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I am not cracking the whip. The question is onewhich has to be determined by the Prime Minister. If the words in question are not struck out the amendment will stand as- it does at present, and the duty can bereduced to i j d . in the case of goods imported from the United Kingdom.",29
143,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"East Sydney) [4.42] - I think that fewer references to possibilities as the result of the vote of the Committee would be more desirable in the interests of that independence which every Parliament ought to have in discharging its publicduties. If Ministers, prematurely-o n the first breath of opposition-thro w such decisive statements across the table, in many cases they practically close the debate before it has :begun. I think that such expressions should be avoided in a House which is supposed to be composed of independent, representatives of the people. am very glad that upon the present occasion we may hope to have the satisfaction of hearing a statement from the Prime Minister upon this important question. I propose therefore to deal with it much more fully* than I should have done under other circumstances. The Treasurer concluded his remarks with a very patriotic peroration, in which he aspired to the time when Australia will be a self-contained country. It is a noble ambition, but an impossible one. There is no country in the world which has ever been, or which ever, can be, self-contained.. If we settled fifty persons in the centre of .the most abundant natural resources, with every product capable of satisfying their pleasures, or tastes, or industrial dispositions, there would still remain something wanting without which the whole of their wealth would lead not to happiness but to misery- I refer to intercourse with other intelligent human beings in other countries. Take the case of the United Staites, with their marvellous natural resources, marvellous population, and with the most rigid protective policy the world has ever seen. If honourable members study the statistics of that country, they will find that in spite of their enormous export trade they have an enormous import trade, which is valued at several hundred millions sterling, or more than $1,000,000,000 dollars annually. These sentiments are often unsound. Man was not created to live in isolation from his fellow man in different parts of the One would think that the human being in a state of isolation, who had everything that he could desire, would reach the highest pitch of happiness and wealth. But he would not. He would be the most melancholy and miserable individual in the world unless he had the freest intercourse with his fellow man. We ought to feel deeply impressed by the eloquent aspirations of the leading protectionists in Australia for a closer commercial intercourse with the greatest free trade country in the world. It is one of the most striking developments of Australian protection that we find the eloquence of its leading advocates devoted to an exjaression of the most profound desire to cultivate closer commercial relations with the greatest free-trade nation in the world, which happens to be the mother country. How can there be closer commercial intercourse without an increase in the exchange I bf commodities between the two countries? Would it be commercial intercourse to exchange sovereigns for goods-for Great Britain to send out her millions of pounds in coin or bullion each year in exchange for Australian meat or wheat ? Would that be commercial exchange ? No ! The expression conveys the idea of the exchange of commodities which are produced in the respective countries.",29
144,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,"Gol d is also a commodity. Mr Reid' - But when we talk of commercial interchange, we do not speak of gold as a commercial commodity. It is used to pay for an article which has been transmitted.",30
145,Mr MATHEWS,BOARD OF TRADE,"It is something more than an ordinary commodity, in that its value never depreciates.",30
146,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"It is a medium of ex- ' change, but it is not a medium of interchange. There is a great difference between the two expressions. But I wish to direct the attention of the Committee, first, to the fact that the perorations of the greatest protectionists in Australia are now being devoted to a development of commercial interchange between the great markets and the great manufacturing powers of the Mother 'Country and the great markets and producing centres of Australia. Apart from the patriotic consideration, this fact represents a striking development in the political attitude of leading protectionists. The theory of protection itself is absolutely opposed to any such arrangement. The theory upon which Australian: protection world. has been founded always has been that there are industries in Australia which in their period of infancy must be protected from the pressure of outside competition on the part of older nations in a more advanced industrial condition. Well, that policy is entirely opposed to the policy of increasing the hold of British manufactures upon the markets of Australia. The two policies do not harmonise. They are absolutely opposed one to the other. The first question that I want to ask on this Tariff is - Are those duties in the second schedule - whic h form the offer of a preference to the Mother Country-suppose d to be a sufficient protection for Australian industries, or not ? If they are not a sufficient protection for Australian industries, the Ministry are not f a it h f u l to the mandate which, . according to their own statement, they received from, the people. We are told-and I have never denied it-that the result of the general election has shown a distinct desire on the part of the people for a protectionist policy. Did that mean a sufficient protection or an insufficient protection? Was it a verdict for real protection or not? Does this Tariff-in the second column-represen t the views of the Government as to rates of duties which are sufficient for Australian industries? they are sufficient for Australian industries, there is no real preference given. If they are not sufficient for Australian industries, there is a preference given at the expense of the main principle of the Administration and of honourable members opposite. It is impossible to reconcile those two things.",30
147,Mr SAMPSON,BOARD OF TRADE,What about diverting foreign trade into British channels?,31
148,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I want first to start with a broad view of the tests which weought to apply in this discussion. That is the dilemma which the Government are in - eithe r these duties against the Mother Country are sufficient to protect Australia or they are not. If they are sufficient to protect Australia, the suggested preference is a sham. If they are not sufficient to protect Australia, the protectionist policy of the Administration is a sham. That is the issue which I put. My honourable friend the member for Wimmera puts a very fair question to me. He asks whether something cannot be done which would change the current of foreign trade. is an aspect of the matter which is well worthy of consideration. But I want first to take the broad aspect of the policy of British preference, and then deal with it in detail. I shall not overlook the honourable member's question, I hope. But let us endeavour to know where we are, and what this thing means. Take the rates in the second column. If they have safeguarded Australian manufacturers from British competition,, then I say the preference is a sham to that extent. Mr HUTCHISON.^-The right honourable member is assuming that the rates fixed the second column will shut out all impicture! portations.",31
149,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I am asking questions; I am not assuming anything. It is sible for me to say whether the rates duty will or will not shut out importations. Perhaps the Government, as the authors the Tariff, could say whether they think it will or will not have that effect. But if the duties are sufficient to shut out foreign and British competition in manufactures, there is nothing in them from a preference point of view. If they are insufficient to shut out British competition, there is a good deal in them that is hostile to the main principle of this Tariff. That is the dilemma which I put If to the Government. I admit at once that there is a great deal to be said apart altogether from that'dilemma and on the point suggested ' by the honourable member for Wimmera. I wish to say parenthetically that, much as I differ from the views of the Prime Minister, so far as ability ancl force are concerned he was a perfectly worthy representative of Australia at the Conference. So that I hope it will be understood that my criticisms have no personal bearing. The impression which the Prime Minister made upon the people of the Mother Country was-evidently a very strong one. To us in Australia there was the difficulty of quite grasping the change which had come over the Prime Minister in his ardour to encourage closer commercial intercourse with Great Britain. If it were a mere desire, under cover of a cloud of beautiful words, to entice the people of the Mother Country into a policy which would simply yield a large return for Australia, that would be an attempt of which I am sure no one would feel the slightest approval. There must be a serious purpose beneath this Now, that policy. But while the Treasurer pictured Australia as a country which is to be peopled by means of a protectionist policy, the Prime Minister in his brilliant visions pictured Australia as peopled owing to the consumption of Australian wheat by the millions of the peqple of the Mother Country. The Prime Minister over and over again has pointed out that if there were a preference to wheat grown in countries like Australia and Canada, such an enormous impetus would be given to our farming enterprise that Australia would indeed enter upon a career of unexampled industry and prosperity. These pictures can in scarcely be made to hang together. The one suggests that a Tariff wall will enable Australia to be peopled and developed, while the other picture suggests a .imposfree interchange between the manufacturers of of England and the primary producers of Australia. In what other way can we enof courage British industry except byl opening our doors to the manufactures of the Mother Country? If you talk to the people of England of opening the door to their wheat or their turnips they will laugh at you.. You can offer a trading inducement to the people of England only by opening your doors to the enterprise of their manufacturers. If you are prepared to sacrifice your manufacturers for the benefit of your farmers, say so. Because if this is to be an honest bargain, it is not something for nothing. It is something for something. It must mean that or it is as'ham. Well, this something for something must mean more than an interference with' the current of foreign trade. At the present moment the Mother Country, in spite of yourprotective Tariff and your barriers, sends more than £26,000.00 0 worth of goods per annum into Australia. The whole of the foreign trade of the world with Australia is only about one half of that, and one half of that trade would be impossible to the Mother Country if you opened your ports tomorrow, because it consists of articles which could not be produced in that country. In other words, one-half of your foreign trade is a trade which you could not divert in that direction. Let me just show by reference to two or three items only the magnificent hold which this ""decaying"" Mother Country has in the markets of Australia. Having no preference here, having to compete on equal terms with ' the mighty enterprise of an awakened Germany and of the magnificent United States on this impartial battle ground, what is the position of the Mother Country ? In respect to three items-piec e goods, cotton and linen, woollens, and iron plates, corrugated and galvanized-pro ducts to the value of £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 sterling year come into Australia from the Mother Country. How much from all the other countries in the world? Only £ 2 9 8 , 0 0 0 fro m France, Germany, and the United States-from - the cheap white and coloured labour of the world, to whom our market had been as free as it was to the people of the Mother Country. What sort of. substantial advantage would Great Britain ' reap if we wiped out that £ 2 9 8 , 0 0 0 of foreign-trade altogether? It is not by wiping out the 'foreign trade that we can give Great Britain a substantial advantage ; that must be done by wiping out our Australian manufactures.",31
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"Does the honorvernment, able and learned member desire to wipe out Australian manufactures?",32
151,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"No j I am only talking ot a policy, and not expressing any personal wishes. But we owe to the people of the Mother Country straight plain talk. We are told that the Treasurer, at the Conference, deplored the fact that the lifeblood of England was being sucked out of her by. foreign trade. I have been looking at Australian figures in regard fo this neutral battle-ground. I find that, during the four years from 1902 to 1906, the increase of imports from the Mother Country was £2,700,00 0 worth, as against an increase of under £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth from France, Germany, and the United States combined, there being a positive decrease in the case of France and the. United States. Whether protectionists or free-traders, we are glad to see, written in the undeniable figures of our own trade statistics, the marvellous energy and success which still remain with the industries of the Mother Country. Those results have not been won by favouritism or preferential trade. The Treasurer, at the Imperial Conference, not only deplored the sucking of the life-blood out of the Mother Country, but said that, in spite of his having a father and a grandfather from the old land, something more was wanted-that some further link was required. What was it? The missing link he longed for was a closer unity of commerce between the Mother Country and the rest of the Empire. What a strange utterance from this rabid protectionist Treasurer !",32
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"Hear , hear.",32
153,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"And I heartily applaud that noble sentiment. But we cannot have much closer commerce with the manufaca turing millions of England, without impinging on the developing industries of protected Australia; we cannot have a displacement in favour of one force, without injuriously affecting another force. The Prime Minister at the Conference, in a burst of eloquence which, happily, never costs him an effort, made this statementI am assured by an authority that a substantial preference to the goods of Great Britain Let me stop there. In 1902, there was a resolution in favour of substantial preference ; and, in April and May of this year, the Imperial Conference, after debate, and in spite of the attitude of the British Godeliberately re-affirmed the substantial preference of 1902. Consequently, the Commonwealth Government stands pledged in honour to a substantial preference - not only a preference, but a substantial preference - an unconditional, substantial preference without any bargaining for something in return. The Government stand pledged twice over to an unconditional substantial preference. Can we be surprised at the attitude of the British Government, although our Prime Minister, with his great eloquence and ability, brought all his genius to bear on their position? Was there ever a more extraordinary, expedition outside the pages of Don Quixote than that in which the Prime Minister engaged when he went to the Mother Country to upset a free-trade policy which had just been affirmed by millions of the electors of Great Britain, and which, in the House of Commons, had been further affirmed by about 500 votes to 98? Was there ever anything more, I shall not say ridiculous, but anything more chivalrous in the region of practical, politics, than for a practical statesman to go to the people and Ministers of the Mother Country, with the enormous mass of parliamentary support behind them, and expect, by the charm of Australian eloquence, to melt awav those solid battlements behind which millions of the people stood-to charm away the solemn faith of the British Government, and destroy, with a breath, the policy on which, for good or evil, the destinies of the Mother Country solidly rest today ? It was one of the most extraordinary positions. Can we be surprised that the British Government had to say "" no "" ? What would our Prime Minister have thought had the British Ministry said "" yes "" ? How unfair, as the Treasurer practically did, to put the Ministers of the old country in a false position, as if they were ungracious and offensive in their attitude of negation. What would have been said if we had had an. overwhelming protectionist vote at our elections, affirming the policy of protection, and British statesmen had come here, and at a Conference board, thundered with all. their eloquence, asking the Ministers of Australia to abandon their protectionist policy as a fetish-as a thing which had no real sense or substance in it? What would have been said of such British Ministers? What would our newspapers have said of them? I think that Mr Asquith made one of the manliest expositions p f the question I have ever seen in a heated controversy.",32
154,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Hear, hear. Mr Reid.",33
155,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"This is what Mr Asquith saidWhat is the good of protecting and fostering the growth of native industries, if at the same time you are going to admit against them into the market the most dangerous competitor in the whole world-becaus e that is what the British manufacturer is? That is what the British manufacturers are, and it is the sort of talk we would expect from a protectionist. But Mr Asquith had the manliness to realise what the policy of protection in Australia meant. He saidYou are not going to admit anybody, British or foreign, to compete on level terms in your markets in respect of the industries which you desire to protect. You could not do it. It is a negation of protection. Obviously the thing itself is contradictory. I will not go into the question whether the British manufacturer will remain the most dangerous. I think at this moment he still is, at any rate, very dangerous, and you cannot have him in. You know you cannot without abandoning Drotection. Is that not a straightforward statement of the case from a protectionist's point of view? I think it is- a straightforward recognition of the view of protectionists. If the protectionists say to the Mother Country, "" We are going to give up our policy of shutting you out; we see you can do us a great deal of good if we cripple our manufactures for the benefit of our farmers,"" they will make the only substantial offer that can be made. Listen to the words of General Botha, who was one of the bitterest, although one of the bravest and straightest, enemies the British race ever had. Sitting at the Conference table; he made a very short speech, from which I shall quote: a few words. He saidThe resolution of 1902 should continue to stand as it does That is the unconditional substantial preference proposal. I do not see any chance of pressing upon the Mother Country any addition to that resolution. The position that we take in the Transvaal now that we have responsible government, is that the Mother Country ought to leave us alone as much as possible to regulate our own affairs, and, therefore, it is all the more difficult for me to come here and interfere with matters concerning the Mother Country. So far-as I can judge it appears to me that the British people made their voices and opinion heard on this matter during the last general election in England. . . . Although no preference is given by the Mother Country to the Transvaal, the bond beween the Transvaal and theMother Country wiU nbt thereby be weakened. That is a ll i have to say. That erstwhile bitter enemy of Englandnow one of the Ministers of the British Crown-manfull y says in effect, "" Just as we claim the right to regulate our own affairs, so we leave to the Mother Country the same right. We respect her decisions, and whether she gives us this or refrains from doing so, our attachment to her will not be weakened."" The unconditional preference which the Commonwealth Ministers propose to give is one to which, if substantial, no human being ought, I think,' to object. I look upon the idea of giving an unconditional preference to the Mother Country as a generous one, and to the extent to which the Ministry fight for it, I am not one to criticise them. If they carry out their pledge of a substantial preferential treatment, I shall be the first to applaud their efforts. It is a generous policy, and, havpreference! ing regard to the facts of the case, one which ought to commend itself. It is all tha more striking, coming as it does from public men who are protectionists; since it is much easier for free-traders to support preferential trade, as incidentally reducing, or seeming to reduce, the height of protectionist duties. I have no word of criticism to offer against the conduct of new a Ministry in standing up as the champions .of substantial preference; but the question is: Have Ministers fulfilled their promise? What would have been the shock to that august assemblage in London if , after the impassioned speech delivered by the Prime Minister of Australia, an anticipatory draft of the Tariff now before us had been laid on the table of the Conference? What would have been the shock of astonishment that would have run - through the British Isles if the people had heard then of what was to be done by. those who were clamouring for the imposition of taxes on the very bread and meat of struggling millions-unde r a glorious programme of lightening the burdens of competition and opening the bright gates of Australia to the depressed, 'oppressed, and decaying British manufacturers? What would have been said if , immediately after the Prime Minister's speech at the Conference, the people of Great Britain had been told that on the main lines of British industry the Australian duties, in some cases, were to be doubled? When the oratory of the Prime Minister was gushing so freely there was a duty of 15 per cent, on woollen piece goods - We have now a duty of 30 per cent, against such imrjorts from the Mother Countrv. The duty has been doubled. The duty on machinery was, in. respect to a number of lines, 12 per cent. ; 1 it is now. 20 and 25 per cent. I am not quite sure whether the duty on cotor that ton and linen piece goods has been varied. If I remember rightly, it was 5 per cent, under the old Tariff, and that duty remains as against British imports, whilst those from foreign countries are dutiable at 10 per cent. But let us look for a moment at the main lines of British export. Cotton manufactures, £100,000,000; woollen manufactures, £32,000,000; linen, jute, and apparel, £19,000,000. I think that we now have duties ranging from 25 to 40 per cent, on apparel imported from the Mother Country. ",33
156,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"This is a first instalment> there is more to follow. The Prime Minister, through a newspaper reporter, sent a cablegram to the merchants of Great Britain, saying "" There is more to come.""' Did he mean another 20 per cent, on apparel-anothe r message of brotherly love? The British export of metals, including ships, are of the value of £40,0001,000, and the exports of machinery are valued at ,£20,000,000. We have a total value of £217,000,000 in respect of these five items. Has the duty on a single line been altered in favour of the Mother Country ? Not one'; in four cases the duties have been either doubled or substantially increased. That does not fit in with the glorious position which the Prime Minister took up at that distinguished gathering at Home. We can readily give a substantial preference if we begin by doubling the duty on imports from theMother Country. This decaying MotherCountry, whose expiring energies elicited thewarmest sympathy of the.Treasurer of Australia, has, during the last ten years, increased her trade by £322,000,000, or 43 1 per cent. May I remind honourable members that these figures do not relate merely to imports. Great Britain, in tenyears, had an increased importation of the value of £156,000,000, but an increasein exports of £166,000,000. That is the position of the poor decaying Mother Country! Her trade has now risen to£1,000,000,000. In order to show thather marvellous position as a countrythrough which products are exchanged by other countries is in no waydamaged, may I remind the Treasurer that, during this ten years'"" period, the increase in her imports which were re-exported was £25,000,000. only are her great internal industries expanding at an unprecedented rate, but that marvellous, that wonderful feature of her commerce, which must excite the envy of all nations-the fact that, although she is situated in a remote and corner of the globe, she has a re-export trade in respect of imported articles of nearly £100,000,000 a year - is well maintained. The pity and anxiety of Commonwealth Ministers at Home for the condition of England was rather away. They hit upon 'a time when the Mother Country had never seemed so majestic in her power and strength. on wheat and raw materials were asked for. Do honourable members forget that in those three little kingdoms there is a larger area under crop than there is in the whole continent of Australia? We hear men speak of the declining, decaying agricultural industries on a little spot of earth which has been cultivated for 1,000 years, yet there are more acres under crop today in the United Kingdom than there are in Australia. The product of the crops of the United Kingdom in a 256,500,000 bushels, in addition about 26,000,000 tons of potatoes and turnips. Surely when talk bf a tax on food, they must think of beginning with some protection the farmers of England. What ordinary spectacle would be presented by the adoption of a policy which excluded the farmers of the Mother Country in favour of the farmers of her great The fact of the matter is that this policy of putting taxes on food is not a policy that ever came out of any Liberal camp in - the world. It is the old desperate policy .of the land-owners of the Mother Country. We ought to remember that. down to sixty or seventy years ago, were - half-starved, in order to promote the comfort of a few rich landlords. the effect of the food duties in the Mother Country, and all the Tories of England are - behind the Radicals of Australia in order that a tax may be placed on food to inflate the value of their agricultural lands. That is the influence which brings this embattled array behind the Prime Minister, Was it not an extraordinary spectacle to find all the Tory squires of England arrayed behind the Prime Minister and Treasurer of the Australian Commonwealth? What a grand entourage Mr Reid. they had in all those people, whose preNot decessors, in old days, fattened on the miseries of the poor 1 The fact is that a horror of taxation upon food is in the very spinal marrow of the children of the people, who were so deeply wronged in days gone by. inconvenient Mr MCDOUGALL - B y whom?",34
157,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"B y the very interests which the suggested duties on food would help again today. Who is it that owns those farms in England? They are mainly owned by men who have enough without thrown the advantage of a duty. May I suggest to honourable members that even the decaying agriculture of England has more hands Duties engaged in it than all the hands in all the industries of Australia-farming , pastoral, and manufacturing?",35
158,Mr JH CATTS,BOARD OF TRADE,Whic h shows that we want a good land tax.,35
159,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is a local matter. It is well in politics to have more than one idea. That decaying country has engaged in agriculture-it s most decaying interest2,200,000 persons. There is an aspect of this matter which, I think must appeal to honourable members. The Mother Counyear is try has never been slow to respond to the to wishes of the people of any of her dependencies. Australia has had-as Canada protectionists has had-man y proofs of the readiness of the Mother Country to meet their every for wish and every desire to the fullest posan'extra- sible extent. Why is it that Britain stands so staunchly against these proposals? I think for obvious reasons. In the first place, we are thanked for any dependencies. generous preference which we give' to the Mother Country unconditionally. In the second place, the people of the Mother Country have not yet realized-and I think never will-that by putting duties on food they would increase the cheapness of the Englishmen, necessaries of life. The bitter experience of their ancestors taught them differently. Ministers like the Prime Minister and That was Treasurer of the Commonwealth, if they really believe that duties would make food cheaper for the people of the Mother Country, may be full of sympathy and humanity for those people. They say: "" If you would only carry out our ideas of managing the affairs Australian of the Mother Country, you would give your people bread cheaper than ever, and enter upon a new lease of prosperity in a sympathetic, practical relationship with the vast self-governing dependencies of the Empire."" But the people of England, Tariff [22 OCTOBER, 1907.] rightly or wrongly, do not believe that. They believe that taxes on food would make food dearer. They believe that taxes on raw material would cripple the manufacturing strength of' the Mother 'Country. A self-contained people! Where would England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales be if they were a self-contained people? What a miserable insignificant remnant they would be if their power were limited by their geographical boundaries 1 In that remote little spot, far removed from the currents of the great oceans of the world, there is a power which extends its grasp and control over the whole surface of the globe ! Leaving out the self-governing States altogether, there are 400,000,000 human beings in direct and absolute subjection to the power of ' Great Britain. There are 11,000,000 square miles of the earth's surface over which floats the flag the British Isles as a token of supremacy irresistible power. A self-containecf country ! Why, the glory of Great Britain is that she draws from all climes and all races nourishment to renew the marvellous vitality of her majestic strength. to her of the closed ports of the world, ancl she will say, "" They have been closed against me for a long time, and my people are still thriving."" The people of the Mother Country find that those who shut themselves in give to those who do not an opportunity they would not otherwise have. What would be the position of the Mother Country in twenty years' time if the United States opened their doors to the abundance and the resources of the world? Where would the Mother Country be if free-trade were the policy of the world? It is the fact that her manufacturers can bring every resource from all countries of the world without a toll or a tax, which constitutes one of the secrets of her marvellous greatness,",35
160,Mr TUDOR,BOARD OF TRADE,Where would she be if she paid a 'living wage to her workers ?,36
161,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Is it not a wonderful thing that she pays so much? If the people of England do not get a living wage, had we not better let their bread alone? Has the honourable member enough acquaintance with history to know that seventy or eighty years ago, when England had protection in its most absolute form, her people were a writhing mass of poverty and starvation?",36
162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,So they are now. They are the most impoverished people in the world today. {Item 40). 4977 Mr 'REID - Her e is patriotism !

165,Mr SAMPSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"Does not the right honourable member think that we are living, all round now, in more enlightened times than were the people of eighty years ago?",36
166,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Can it be so if there are 12,000,000 people starving in the richest of country for its size in the world? Can we and be improving if that be the fact?",36
167,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,Honourable members are all apparently advocating Socialism.,36
168,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Migh t I suggest to those Talk who say these 42,000,000 of our English, Scotch, and Irish brethren are a miserable race of starving paupers, that if there are 12,000,000 of starving people in Great Britain, they should, at least, allow the bread of the world to enter freely into British ports. What a marvellous thing it is that the workers of Australia should shut their ears to the appeals of the workers of England. Surely if there is a prescriptive right to statesmanship in a man's position as a member of a Labour Party, those distinguished gentlemen who are members of the Labour Party of Great Britain are worthy of some respect. Can we forget the appeal which Labour members in England have made to their fellow workmen in Australia? And if so many people are starving, can we not understand it? Who clamours to be taxed on bread when he is starving, when he has not enough food for himself, his wife, and children ? Who clamours for a tax on raw ' materials that would interfere with the chance of raw materials being imported from all over the world, ancl with the facility and freedom'with which they could be brought into e his ports to be converted into articles of human ingenuity ? If you injure the British worker in this respect, will you not increase his misery ?",36
169,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"Nobod y advocates a tax. It is a duty, and there is a great distinction between the two. 4978 Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.]",36
170,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I think that the honourable member for Corio, even as a protectionist, will admit that if a country is not able to produce enough for its requirements, then such a duty as is suggested has all elements of a tax. It maiy be a matter controversy in large countries where sparse populations are able easily to supply own wants. For instance, I admit that duty on cereals here would be like the humour of a Christmas pantomime so far as any real benefit to the fairmers of tralia would be concerned; bub 'in Eng-' land, where they cannot produce sufficient food for themselves,, surely such a duty must be a tax. It seems to me that that ought to be pretty obvious. What magic can be iworked in such conditions? should like also to point out.that the trade of the self-governing dependencies of the Empire, from which this urgent appeal comes, is a very valuable trade, factures. and compared per head is probably the most valuable trade with the Mother Country- I think there is very little doubt Excise. about that-stil l as a matter of actual employment at present, as represented, at any rate, in British exports, this is the relationwith ship of the trade of the self-governing minions to the trade of the Mother Country The trade of the Mother Country with other Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand amounts to have £""53,000,000 a year. The trade with British dependencies other than these amounts to £60,000,000 a year. dependencies that are not self-governed posals take a larger share of British exports than eign countries do the self-governing dependencies of the Empire. Foreign countries take British trade to the value of ,£216,000,000 a year, so. that we have £276,000,000 of trade between England and countries that are not self-governing dependencies of the British Empire. When £276,000,000 are compared with £53,000,000, honourable meml>ers will understand that it is a matter of grave interest to the people of the Mother Countrv not to endanger the stability of a trade which is so very important as this trade with other parts of the Empire and with other parts of the'world is shown to be.  other £r,000.000 under these proposals ",37
171,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That will help them. Let us take the case of India. That country has an open market. The Mother Country the sells to India £46,000,000 worth of goods, of Australia and all the other countries of the world (Candles, <&c). together sell to India only £20,000,000 worth of goods. In the free and open contest of enterprise in the East Great Britain sends to India goods to more than the double the value of those sent by all the of rest of the people of the world. It is an extraordinary fact that whilst foreign countheir tries send only £20,000,000 worth of a goods a year to India they buy from India £73,000,000 worth a year. The position is this: The excess of purchases by India Ausfrom the United Kingdom amounts in value to £19,000,000, whilst the excess of sales to other countries is £53,000,000. Hon- orable members will see that Great Britain has the lion's share of selling to India, while it is left to other countries of the I world to perform the ""useful operation of whilst buying Indian products.",37
172,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,Because India puts an Excise duty on goods which England manu,37
173,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I ami talking of foreign trade, and that has nothing to do with 1",37
174,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"Where India competes England she imposes special duties. do Mr Reid - I am not talking of the : competition of India with England or with countries, but with the sales of India to other countries with which Excise duties nothing to do. Foreign countries send to India £20,000,000 worth of goods a year and buy £73,000,000 worth. That The shows that the people of India must think twice before they favourably consider profor preferential trade. It is the foroutside the Empire that form the backbone of India's 'trade. They ask her to buy little and they buy much. The Mother Country sells much and buys little. This is only one of those problems which men who have the responsible custody of the affairs of the Empire have to consider. In Australia there is a desire to help our farmers and a fear that we may injure our manufacturers. That is what paralyzes preferential trade when its practical phases are considered. When the Prime Minister was so beautifully eloquent in the Mother Country at the table of the Imperial Conference we had in. force a duty of 15 per cent, on exports of apoarel from the Mother anCountry. We have now added to it 25 per cent, and made it 40 per cent. What would have been said by General Botha, who cannot talk much English but who has a sagacious brain, if on the conclusion of eloquent oration of the Prime Minister he had been told that the honourable gentleman had the intention when he got back to Australia to make the duty on a large line of British exports 40 cent, instead of 15 per cent.? Honourable members will perceive the divided The makers of apparel in Australia were knocking at the door; they got in, and Mother Country was shut out. Was the 15 per cent, fence put up to a 40 per cent, selves."" elevation out of love for the Mother try or out of a desire to promote the dustrial interests of manufacturers parel in the Commonwealth? We cannot do both; we must make a choice. The duty on woollen piece goods under the Tariff was 15 per cent. . I wonder what fence of the Commonwealth? the gentlemen who were present at the perial Conference would have said i they had been told that that duty was to be increased to 30 per cent. If they had been told that the Mother Country was to get 5 per cent, preference out of the additional percentage, what sensation of disgust would be created amongst the millions of - British people. Great Britain has to buy her wool from and to carry it across the oceans of the globe to the mills in which it is manufacnations tured into piece goods. She takes our material, and returns to us the finished product. Surely if there is room for application of this benign policy, it not necessary to double the duty. Yet duty has been doubled in respect to tations from the Mother Country. I have already spoken about the machinery duties. I ask .honourable members to recollect - whilst the position of Great Britain is grand one, the enormous Empire under her flag entails vast responsibilities. 42,000,000 human beings who constitute v the population of Great Britain are responand siblefor the security and protection .420,000,000 scattered over the face of earth, and for the integrity of 11,000,000 square miles of territory in all parts globe. Just think of the "" starving "" lation of the Mother Country being called upon to raise £73,000,000 a year for ° defence of Australia and other parts the Empire. The ordinary annual expenBritain diture of the United Kingdom upon its Army ancl Navy is £66,000,000, and capital expenditure for the last year which I could obtain the figures- I think 1906-wa s £7,000,000. Great spends £73,000,000 a year in protecting the British Empire, and we are to draw our little contribution of £200,000. We are to break the agreement made by the people of Australia with the Mother Country. We are to say to the ""starving"" per 12,000,000 of the old land, who contribute towards the £73,000,000 paid for duty. our protection, "" Give us back our £200,000. We are not rich enough with the out it to buy a few torpedo boats for our ports, and want to spend the money ourThe whole of the Customs and CounExcise revenue of the United Kingdominabout £66,500,000-is absorbed in expenof apditure on the Army and Navy. What would be thought if it were proposed that Australia should spend the whole of her old Customs and Excise revenue on the deIn addiImtion to Ithe vital necessity of free-trade f in food products, even to the injury of her own farmers, and in raw material, another consideration stands for a great deal with the British people. If the conquests of Great Britain had meant the exa clusion of the peoples of the other nations of the world from the conquered territories, Great Britain would not have the us, Empire which she has today. Of course, the British fleets have helped to keep other quiet ; but these earth-hungry raw nations have allowed Great Britain to annex territory after territory, because her the' - policy of an open door gives free entry was to them as well as to her own people. That the wonderful fact is one of the pillars on imporwhich the security of the British Empire rests. The inducement to attack a country whose territories are open to your trade, that, and who is a large consumer of your proa ducts, is not so strong as the inducement to attack ai country which shuts her ports The and territories against you. The sentiment of friendship between the United States the Mother Country is steadily growing. of Has the fact that Great Britain buys from the the United States £130,000,000 worth of goods a year nothing to do with that ? Do of the not honourable members think that Ameripopucans look upon this marvellous fact as a strong reason for not cultivating unfriendly the feelings? According to the protectionist of idea, what a marvellous convenience Great is to the United States, from which every year she buys £130,6*00,000 worth of its goods, and to which she sends only about for £25,000,000 worth in exchange. According to the protectionist idea, Great 'Eritain Britain is beggaring herself to the extent of £100,000,000 a year, which is the balance withof trade in favour of the United States. But that and other facts in connection with the open door policy of the Mother Country are a guarantee for a great deal. now to refer to one or two of the ances of the Prime Minister at the ferenceAustralia obtains fair play from no foreign country. What an extraordinary complaint! can a protectionist country expect anything from another protectionist country? Have think it would. we been coddling, the manufacturers Germany ? Have we been earning gratitude by giving them specially con-' siderate treatment? I think not. the duties on our protectionist Tariff are much directed against Germany as against the Mother Country. Preferential trade will enable Australia secure a large proportion of the British trade. Sir WILLIAM LYNE:-Hear , hear.",37

183,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I hope that we are not wasting time. What is the use of our cudgelling our brains over preferential trade in respect of 150 or 300 items i there is going to be put in a condition Mother Country, its object being to induce which will make the Bill waste paper? My honourable friends can offer as many preferences as they like if they put in postscript which makes it impossible for the Mother Country to accept them. In spite of her alleged decay she carries more than half the cargoes of the world; she sells £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of Britishpound made' ships to other countries every year. Australia, we are told, I wish to gain by preferential treatment. I utterdo not want to deny that at all . ConDuties on raw material would never be agreed to. But supposing that Great Britain could arrive at a stage at which she thought it was possible to impose duties upon her How foodstuffs, I do not. say that that might not be of substantial advantage to Australia. I The amount of the of advantage might be problematical, but their look what it means. It means a two-story preference. In the first place, the duty All would operate as a protection to the as 250,000,000 bushels of agricultural, produce which are cropped in Great Britain every year. That would be the immediate result to so far as these 250,000,000 bushels are concerned. Then there would be another story of a special character intended to discourage the import of foreign foods. Thus we get two stories in this preference proto posal, both of which are directed against and the free and untaxed supply of food to I am sure that no honourable member upon the other side of the Chamber would wish to give a penny in the name of patriotism or of preference in order to get 5s. from the "" starving "" millions of the Mother Country. I do not think that my honourable friends have reached that depth of meanness. In dealing with the 42,000,000 of people swarming on that little surface-12,000,00 0 of whom are said to the in want-surel y the of Australia have not descended to such a depth of meanness and exhypocrisv as to wish to put burdens upon What I the food of those millions without intending to give them shilling for shilling and pound for pound. I do not think that any . honourable member would approach this l l with the question in that spirit.",39
184,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,"Then , why make the sug",39
185,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Because I wish to draw a conclusion from it . My honourable friend's vision does not go far enough. This is not a matter for argument-it is supposed to be f a business suggestion to the people of the 1 ihem to rebuild the foundations of their fiscal policy. That, in itself, is no light a matter. Unless protectionists are prepared to give substantial entry to British manufactures into Australia, preferential trade can never 'become a reality, because, when ic comes to a matter of payment, pound for will be wanted by the people of the' Mother Country. They will not be content has much to give us a pound and accept in exchange a. peroration from our Prime Minister. He can exchange perorations upon the subject of preference by the ton, but when it comes to a business transaction the people of Great Britain will not accept his perorations as our share of payment. They will want the preference. No man knows better than does the Prime Minister that if Mr. Chamberlain-and we all deplore the illness of that distinguished man-ha d been seated at the table of the Imperial Conference as the head of a Government which had won at the British elections upon the question of preference, and if he had said to our Prime Minister, "" Mr Deakin, we have all had the pleasure of listening to you before, and we know what a brilliant speaker you are. But it is not necessary to indulge in speech-making now. The question before us is one upon which, we wish to arrive at an agreement; therefore, let us get to business. Now, I am prepared, under a reciprocal arrangement with you, to impose a tax upon British foodstuffs and on raw materials imported into the Mother Country. What will you do upon your side ?""",39
186,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,Mr Chamberlain would perhaps do as he did at Glasgow-firs t make a speech upon preference and afterwards correct it.,40
187,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"How could the Prime Minister face his party in Australia if he had said to Mr Chamberlain, "" I will give you substance for substance. If you open your"" ports to our wheat, I will open our ports to your manufactures?"" How, in the first place, could he say such a thing ?",40
188,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,Mr Chamberlain is the root and branch of the whole policy.,40
189,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Probably . But the honourable member must recollect that we have responsible statesmen-apar t from Mr. Chamberlain-makin g suggestions and proposing schemes. This Committee must recognise that our Prime Minister could not say; to Mr Chamberlain, "" We will allow you to make substantial inroads upon our manufactures if you grant our wheat substantial entry into your markets."" That is the point upon which all these reciprocal arrangements are shipwrecked. All sorts of attempts have been made, but they have always broken down because of the rival interests. The reciprocal arrangement with New Zealand was no sooner made than it was repudiated. It was practically stillborn. But that agreement was one of slight importance as compared with an arrangement with the Mother Country. I ask. honourable members to listen to these words of the Prime Minister- Australia has much to gain by preferential treatment, nor is it obvious what it is possible for her to lose if she in her turn gave preference to the produce of Great Britain. What can that mean? If it meant a genuine, substantial relaxing of the obstacles in the way of British competition in Australia, how could the statement be made? Of course it could have been made in regard to Australian farmers, inasmuch as they .would not be injured by such an - arrangement. But how could it be said of Australian manufacturers, assuming, of course, that the preference was to be substantial? If we only intended to pick out a bit of foreign trade here and there, and to say to Great Britain, "" We will impose heavy duties upon that trade with foreign countries so that you may ultimately get it , "" that would be another matter. But if the preference were to be substantial - if it were intended to help great industries, such as the machinery, woollen and apparel industries-grea t lines of British production which are also important lines of Australian manufacture-if it were to injure the infant industries of Australia, it is very questionable whether the Prime Minister could carry his party with him to that extent. Here is a sublime sentenceI t is a case of all for each and each for all. What a magnificent sentiment! One would think that it came out of the New Testament. The Treasurer glowed in the hope for a time when Australians will be a self-contained people. That ideail is the very opposite of the sentiment of "" All for each and each for all."" The two Ministers do not keep step.",40
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"At any rate, I am . consistent.",40
191,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,I admit that when the honourable member does not indulge in flights of oratory he is much safer than when he does.,40
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I am not "" Yesno.""",40
193,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The sentence which I have just quoted embodies the biggest "" yes-no "" ever constructed in this world.

195,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I said "" No-yes."" That frayed. was a logical position. I ask honourable members to note the difference from the stand-point of logic. The transition from "" no "" to "" yes "" is! an operation which specially distinguishes men who make .bargains. But it is only the fool who at the beginning of a bargain says "" y e s "" and winds up with "" n o .

221,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I beg the honourable gentlethe man's pardon; I cannot say it is because he has any fascination for me. Let honourable members note the significance of that peroration. An increase of 50 per cent, on a trade of £26,000,000 is equal to £13,000.000. Could Great Britain get additional importations of that value into Australia without affecting our protected industries? The fact of the matter is if not one-half, a large proportion of foreign trade consists of articles which could not, under any circumstances, expect England to send us if our ports were opened to her.",42
222,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,"That might have been embellishment of the speech. Mr 'REID - It was the peroration. Let honourable members listen sageThis would be the effect of substantial preferences, and substantial preferences are templated by the third resolution of the ference of 1902. Honourable members will see that Prime Minister not only voted for that proposition, but said, and very properly said, that substantial preferences were tended. Instead of giving the Mother Country a substantial preference the Treathe surer has brought in a Tariffwhich has made the wall against the Mother Country very much higher than ever it was.",42

I want to show honourable members the. details of the trade of the. three' great countries which are supposed to be sucking the industrial blood of the people of the - United Kingdom. So according to these figures, they have been equal: they have had no preference. substanGermany and the United States enjoyed just the same rates as Great Britain had. of In 1902 the United States had a trade of £4,991,000, and in 1906 a trade of into £47633,000, showing a decrease of increase of £358,000 in four years.",42

Putting those three togetherthose three mighty competitors of England an - thei r trade increased by only £128,000 in the four years-o r i j per cent.",42
227,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"The trade of Germany to this pasincreased by 21 per cent. Mr .REID - There is a difference of con- £549,000 in the case of Germany against Conan increase in the case of Great Britain of £2,725,000. I admit that the German in the crease is greater proportionately.",42
228,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,That was inevitable.,42
229,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"It was, of course, ineviintable. That sort of argument-it was pushed rather far by the Treasurer-seem s to me to be really silly. A young man is bound to grow more rapidly than a fullgrown man. It is in the course of nature. Great Britain had a phenomenal, an unnatural, predominance over the commerce of the world forty or fifty years ago. Where was the law of nature.to keep the great peoples of Germany and of the United States in the background? Their trade was bound to grow. Suppose that in a race, one horse being at the winning post, another is half-a-mile away. The second horse may have gained a quarterof-a-mile in the last mile. But should we, therefore, admire the horse that gains most in the last mile? I think it is the winner that we should a'dmire most all the time. You have to look at this matter from every point of view. Look at the task set to Great Britain,, with a trade of £24,000,000, to increase it at all. It is an infinitely greater burden on her to increase her trade from £24,000,000 to nearly £27,000,000 than for Germany to increase her trade from £2,600,000 to £3,200,000. But instead of that she has increased her trade eight times more rapidly than the combined trade of those other great nations increased.",42
230,Mr FISHEE,BOARD OF TRADE,"If a foreign nation were sending goods to the amount of 1 per cent, of our whole trade in one year, and next year increased her trade by 1 per cent., that would be said to be an increase of 100 per cent.",43
231,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is so. Now I should like to quote a sentence from the very able speech made at the Conference by Mr. Lloyd George. My honourable friend, the member for Dalley, practically expressed the same idea in different words on Friday last. I have quoted Mr Asquith's fair and manly view of the protectionists of Australia. Now I wish to quote the view of the British Government, in connection with a system of arranged or reciprocal preference. Mr Lloyd George says-and says very frankly and ably-- We are not in a position to pledge ourselves to anything which will involve the setting UD of a Tariff on foodstuffs and raw material in this country. The Prime Minister, at the Conference, made the interjectionWithout the Tariff we do not get the opportunity of preference. The same idea was expressed by the Treasurer the other day on an item before this Committee. He was asked-""Why are you going to put these duties on animalshorses, sheep, and pigs? There was no duty before, and we have had very few imports."" The Treasurer said- "" I wish to put them .on, because I want to have something to give away to New Zealand when negotiating."" Are we to take it, then, in regard to a good deal of this preference scheme, that the Government propose to put on duties in order to have something to give back when negotiating? If so, it lets a lot of light into the position. Mr Lloyd George went on to sayWe are not here to endeavour to manceuvre each other info false positions, A very pregnant observation. but to discharge the practical business of the Empire. A very pregnant observation also. We are in perfect accord as to the objects we would strive to promote. . . . We are in complete agreement with the colonial, delegates in their belief that the attainment of this object would be assisted by any scheme or system which would develop Inter-Imperial trade, provided such a scheme did not inflict sacrifices on any individual community so great as to produce a sense of grievance with the conditions of the Empire, so deep as to introduce elements of discontent and discord into the Confederation, and thus imperil its efficiency, and, may be, its continual existence as an organization. That puts a view which has been put more than once- a view put there very forcibly - of the tangled skein which British statesmen have to unwind. British statesmen have to consider large questions of policy affecting their relations with one or other of the parts of the Empire. There are al multitude of considerations which they must take into account. When, for instance, Australia comes forward enthu-* siastically with some definite proposal, or when Canada submits a matter of policy, the Mother Country, with the vast weight of responsibility upon her shoulders, has a multitude of other considerations to take into account. But my view of the grievance which the Mother Country has against Australia is this-that Australia, in the person of her representatives, does not mean business. I think that one of the greatest possible wrongs in the higher sphere of Imperial statesmanship is done when ardent and impassioned appeals are made at the centre of Imperial power to re-arrange a system upon which, perhaps, the stability of the Empire depends, not in response to a genuine offer intended to give pound for pound, but in response to an appeal which is not backed up by a readiness to give a fair exchange. The Prime Minister said that this isentry only a beginning. If it is only a ginning, I should lrke to know whether the Prime Minister's party endorses that view. I should like to know that, because even the ablest Prime Minister has to tain the support of his party, and party of . the honourable gentleman is not a very numerous one, although I admit that on the question of prothink tection it is comparatively It is a matter of great consequence to public-to the people of the old country and of the Empire-if the attitude which the Prime Minister describes in that statepreserve ment, which was made a message to BritEere tish merchants, is adhered to, that even preference in this Tariff is only a beginning - to know to what extent and in what direction other steps are to be taken. Are That, of course, was absurd. the protectionists of Australia ready to carry the principle of preferential trade the extent of endangering the growth Australian manufacturing industries?",43
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,It is not necessarily implied in the Prime Minister's vague statement that this is a* beginning: it be a beginning only of this sort of preferunder any circumstances. ence.,44
233,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"F o r the time. I am taking that as an expression which has a substannot tial meaning behind it, in harmony with the resolution which, was passed at the I m perial Conference, where the same expresburning sion was used.' Are [protectionists prepared to endanger the growth of Australian manupolicv facturing industries in order to help Ausestablished tralian farmers? Are they prepared, in order to smooth the path of Australian fanners into the markets of the Mother the general election. Countrv, to make the path of Australian manufacturing more difficult? Are they prepared to endanger the growth of Ausshirked, tralian manufactures by making the commajority petition of British manufactures a reality? I think I interpret fairly the views great many protectionists when I say they are not so prepared. If the preferimpossible. ence that is to be offered will not affect manufacturing industries of Australia, i is not worth the serious attention of any man. That would be an absurd basis which to appeal to the people of the Mother Country to disarrange their present fiscal system- a ludicrous basis. I remind honorthey able members that Mr Chamberlain, in early stages of this great controversy in the protectionists may be graded. Mother Country, so lost himself in an quent peroration as to depict the time British manufactures would have a free else. [176] into the markets of the self-governbeing Dominions. He painted a bright pic1 ture of the opportunity that would be presented, when this door was opened, for British manufacture under some preferential obarrangement. But there was a storm at the once; and Mr Chamberlain, great man and resolute as he is, had to climb down a great deal, and in an official statement. I he went so far.as to say that he did large. not wish to interfere with any colonial in the dustries then in existence, but that the effect of his policv would in the future be this-that Australia, for instance, might the little infants she had, but that were to be no more infants in the the manufacturing future of this country-that under the new policy the British manufacturer would provide what was wanted. Imagine a young and already great country tieing its tc hands in regard to its industrial developof ment ! Mr Chamberlain had to move from that point of view, - and say that he did not expect to seriously, interfere with Australian manufactures. But, first of all, may I regard this project as a waste of time Of course, the next election may show a marvellous change of feeling in the did country, though I do anticipate such a. change. I think that, from present prospects, at the next election - public attention will be occupied-with more questions than that of preferential trade, and, so far as we can see, the fiscal of the Mother Country is fnore firmly than ever. That division in the House of Commons of, I think, 498 votes to 90 was a tremendous fact so soon after The question then decided was put in the most plain and Straightforward fashion; it could not be and there was an overwhelming, in favour of the existing policy. Honourable members can see that, soof a long as that policv is maintained, the that project of a reciprocal arrangement is Of course, I do not for the get that there are different kinds of prot tectionists as there are different kinds of free-traders. There are some free-traders on who would not have any duties at all, and, as a rule, those are gentlemen who have another scheme of taxation which prefer infinitely, absolute free-trade the being one means to that end; ancl even There is elothe prohibitionist, which the Treasurer is when in his speeches, at any rate, if nowhere The prohibitionist is a man who will .have nothing short of shutting out all products which can be made in this country. Then there is the high tariffist, who looks-on a Tariff such as we have had as a very milk-and-water production, and who regardsany duties under 40 or 50 per cent, as by no means the real thing. Then there is another section, who, I am glad to think, have great weight both in this House and in the country-thos e who, in adjusting the duties, have some anxiety with regard to other than the manufacturing industries of Australia. I think I may fairly point out the difference between what I call the natural or primary industries of Australia and the - industries to which a Tariff is essential, by saying that I call the latter Tariff industries, while I consider Australian industries those which are born - and which can expand and strike their.'roots in their natural atmosphere ",44
234,Mr MCDOUGALL,BOARD OF TRADE,Did not the industries - of England first develop under protection?',45
235,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I think it is likely, just as I. think it is extremely likely that, if the honourable member were an advocate of measles, he' could put forward a most convincing argument in the fact that he had never .known a nation which, at some time or other, had not had the measles. That argument, however, would not necessarily mean that it is a blessing to a nation to have the measles. In the Mother Country there was a marvellous appetite for nourishment even among "" infantile "" industries that had been flourishing for 200 years. It is one of the marvels of protected industries that their infancy is eternal. Their appetite becomes manly, but their appeals for consideration are always those of a weakling, of a child who will die if it is not nourished and sheltered. The moderate protectionistdraws a distinction between duties which have sole reference to the interests of the industries for the benefit of which they aie imposed and the interests of people engaged in other industries of Australia. ' Mr MATHEWS - In other words, he is a revenue tariffist?",45
236,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,No ; I have in view a genuine protectionist.,45
237,Unknown,BOARD OF TRADE,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5,45
238,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I wish now to refer to the operation of the new Tariff in reference to fhree very large lines to which I alluded before we adjourned for dinner. Take the item of cotton and linen piece goods. The duty, as against imports of such goods from the United Kingdom, is the same asthat under the old Tariff, but to show the 'wonderful command which the. UnitedKingdom has in respect of that line over the markets of Australia, I would point out that her exports to this country in one year were of the value of over £3,000,000. In the markets of Australia Great Britain has to meet on equal terms the competition of the rest of the world, and yet her proportion of the trade is £3,000,000 as against only £160,000 for foreign countries. Cotton goods comprise most of the articles coming under the heading of "" Linen and cotton piece goods."" And yet that decaying country, Great Britain, is able to import cotton from the farthest ends of the earth to supply her r own wants in cotton manufactures, and toannually export ,£100,000,000 worth of manufactures, the raw material of which is mainly produced in the United States and in India. Great Britain obtains cotton from the United States and India, transforms it into manufactured articles,. a.nd sends out every year a surplus of £.100,000,000 worth of those manufactures. What is the use of describing as a decaying people a community that is able to take away every year from the United States £100,000,000 worth of trade in respect of manufactures, the raw material of which is produced in unparalleled abundance in a part of the States where any quantity of black labour is available. I do not think that we need be very nervous about the position of Great Britain in regard to its industries. Imaginewhat would be said if Germany could pointto this one achievement. The whole world would ring with the story of the decadence of the Mother Country ; it would be said that she was ruined, that her doom was sealed. The old country, with its little bit of earth, which, has been ploughed over and over for a thousand years, with its mineral resources,' so far as iron is concerned, giving out to such an extent that she spends millions on imports of iron ore from all parts of the world, still sends out this enormous export of cotton and linen goods the raw material of which is not produced within her own borders. What is the use of talkp.m. ing about preferential trade regarding a line bf this kind, in respect of which, with the exception of imports of the value of £160,000, she holds the whole of our trade? Another wonderful achievement on her part is that she imports wool from all parts of the world, and in one year sends to Australia woollens valued at £1,820,000 whilst the rest of the world sends here only £78,000. Great Britain is one of the largest buyers of our wool, and yet we find that the duty on woollens is raised against her from 15 to 30 per cent - that is, by 100 per cent. That is the treatment we extend to her in respect to a line manufactures, the raw material of which produce ourselves. It is idle to talk of little items to which the Treasurer referred.",45
239,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,Sh e largely gained her position in regard to the manufacture woollens by what may be described as system of compulsory preferential trade. She forced the Irish people to send their woollens only to England.,46
240,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"When the blissful policy of protection was in force in England, Irish ference. produce could not be sent there, because it was said to be the result of pauper labour. The history of protection in Engthe land is a beautiful one !",46
241,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,Of preferential trade.,46
242,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Preferentia l trade was then dreamt of. In those clays of protection England would not allow a foreign nation to send even £ 1 0 0 worth of goods to a British Colony unless they were first, sent to an English port. Tha.t was protecin tion hot and strong! Before America gained her independence-whe n Great Britain had Colonies scattered all over the r l d - if a merchant in the United States wished to import some French commodity WO it was necessary to have that commodity sent first of all to one of the ports Mother Country.",46
243,Mr WATSON,BOARD OF TRADE,We have the same treatforeign ment now under the Shipping Combine at Brisbane.,46
244,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The system to which have referred prevailed under the same policy of protection as we have today. The principle was the same, although the manifestations of it were different What a magnificent spectacle free-trade Great Britain, with her liberal policy, now presents compared with the Great Britain of the Tory, days, when prowould tection was rampant, when - she tramtween pled on the people of Ireland and of every country over which the British flag flew,- in order to maintain the most iniquiduty to us advantages at the expense of the people of her dependencies. She now gives political liberty. She gives even, the terriIt tories themselves to the self-governing parts [ l 6 ] -2 7 of the Empire. She says to the self-governing Dominions and Colonies, "" If you think it is wise to tax us we are prepared to endure any taxation you may choose to put upon us."" That is a magnificently unselfish position for a dominant power to occupy. We do not hear of Germany, France, or any other nation acting in the same way. of The duty on iron plates, corrugated and we galvanized, has been increased, and out of the a tota.l trade of £1,068,000 done in one has year in this line with Australia Great Britain has £1,028,000 worth. Is it not strange that, having regard to the developof ment of the United States and Germany in a respect of metals, Great Britain, meeting foreign competitors' here on equal terms, has nearly the whole trade in respect of this item?",46
245,Mr ATKINSON,BOARD OF TRADE,There was no pre,46
246,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"There was no preference at the time. I am speaking of. What is use of giving a preference in respect of goods where no preference is required, whilst at the same time we increase duties not at the rale of from 100 to 150 per 'Cent, where the pinch isfelt ? Where there is a pinch between the trade of the Mother Country and the protectionist interests of Australia-suc h as there is, for instance, respect of apparel and woollen piece goods-ther e is no friendly, generous consideration extended to Great Britain. She is treated like a foreign country. .When the Prime Minister,,speaks of ""further steps"" in this direction one cannot help asking whether they are to be like those already of the taken: A duty put up against the old country by 100 per cent, ancl as against the countries by 150 per cent. Take the duty on apparel. Under the old Tariff there was a duty of 25 per cent. We now have a duty of 45 per cent, against foreign I countries and 40 per cent, against Great Britain. In other words, a preference of one-ninth is given to the Mother Countrv; 5 per cent, in 45 per cent. Is the next step to be the imposition of a duty of 60 per cent, against foreign imports and of 50 per cent, against British imports? That would be another advantage to England ! It mean a difference of 10 per cent, be the duties on foreign and British imports, instead of a difference of only 5 per cent. But it would at the same time mean a of 50 per cent, instead of 40 per cent, against British imports. That sort of an - ascending scale really means no preference. is worse than nothing, because it is the very opposite of what we profess to do. The Treasurer, by interjection this afternoon, attributed to the Prime Minister of England a statement which I cannot believe he used in its literal sense. It was to the effect that there are 12,000,000 starving people in Great Britain. I cannot speak of the statistics of the United Kingdom, because they have only been kept properly with reference to England and Wales, but the number of able-bodied paupers in England and Wales fifty years ago, when the population was, perhaps, half what it is now, was very much greater than it is today. It ran up to something like a million in those days, when the population of England and Wales was about 17,000,000. figures refer to people who are capable of working, but are unable to get work to provide them with the means of living. Their number has marvellously diminished, according to the records of the last fifty years. Just think what 12,000,000 starving people, out of a population of 43,000,000, would mean in a country like Great Britain !",46
247,Mr WATSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"The investigations of Charles Booth and Rowntree show thatsense there are 12,000,000 people in England on the poverty line. That is the quotation which Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman used.",47
248,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The "" poverty line "" is a vague expression.",47
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,"We were on the "" poverty line "" at £ 4 0 0 a, year.",47
250,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I think that is a sentiment with which honourable members in the MinSurely isterial corner w i ll heartily agree. Consider for a moment the enormous amount of money that those "" starving "" people spend on drink.",47
251,Mr WATSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Charle s Booth proves that to be altogether incorrect.,47

253,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Sometime s it is the cause of not drinking as much as one otherwise would - I should like to quote from a little publication, for which I am indebted to the honourable member for Barrier, a few facts, in view of what I call the disgracef u l statement which has been attributed to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. How many people are on the poverty line in Australia ? If the poverty line is in the sense of people not having all the proper comforts of life",47
254,Mr TUDOR,BOARD OF TRADE,That is not the definition of those who have dealt with the matter in England. They mean J £ I a week for five persons.,47
255,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I would rather have a downright enemy than a professed friend of Great Britain who uttered such a slander upon the people of the Mother Country. It is a thing'our worse enemies have never said of us. They have made many false statements about the British people, but our worse enemies have never been insane or mean enough to make such an accusation as that quoted by the Treasurer this afternoon. It is a vile falsehood to say that Those 12,000,000 people in England have not the necessaries of life.",47
256,Mr FRAZER,BOARD OF TRADE,Who made that statement ?,47
257,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,I care not who first made it. I apply the same expression l o any one who makes it.,47
258,Mr FRAZER,BOARD OF TRADE,It was the Prime Minister of England who made it.,47
259,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"If he used it in the in which the Treasurer used it this afternoon, he ought to be hurled from office as the vilest slanderer of his country. I do not believe that he did so use it.",47

261,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable member does not know enough about the matter to have anything attributed to him. He was only in England on a visit of a few days. he does not want to be placed in the same class as the many persons who come here for a few days aiid profess to know more about Australia and about Australian conditions than we know who have lived here all our lives? If there are 12,000,000 starving people in England now, nearly the whole population must have been in dethat state fifty years ago,"" because the people of England are infinitely better off I wonder if there is an honourable member opposite who will have the audacity to say that the general condition of the British people is worse thaln it was sixty or seventy or eighty years ago.",47
262,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,Henry George says so in Progress and Poverty.,47
263,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,I am not asking Henry George; he is gone. Is there a man in this House who has the courage to say that taken the conditions of the people of England are worse now than they were then? I should hope that not one would say so. much more now.

I cannot use language strong enough to express my opinion of that statetives of the working classes. ment.",48

268,Mr FOSTER,BOARD OF TRADE,Does the right honourable member include old-age pensions?,48
269,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I always hope that old-age pensions system will never be assoand ciated with the idea of charity. That one of my reasons for wanting to see certain proportion of the money required to provide the pensions taken from the pockets of those who are to enjoy the benethe fit, so that no one can afterwards sneer at them and say that they did not find for themselves. Mo matter what our views are as to how the money ought to be raised, once the old-age pensions system is looked upon as a charity, I would rather not it established here. I do .not want any systematized charity of that sort. ' The CHAIRMAN - The right honourable member must not proceed on that line.",48

He is very generous in making that acknowledgment. As I have said, over I ancl over' again, the superfine inhumanity disof people who try to put taxes on the bread of starving millions excites my But if there is any truth in it, those who want to engineer taxes upon the bread of those starving people are in a queer position-especiall y those who are supposed to be representaI t shows how self-interest will work as against flesh every and blood. My honourable and learned as friend, the member for Parkes, has of given me the exact figures to which 1 wished to refer. In round numbers, the total population in England and Wales in was 32,500,000 as compared with 29,000,000 in 1891, ten years before. The total number of paupers receiving relief on ist January, 1901, was 956,000, being a decrease of 5,000 on the previous the year. When the population of England Wales was only half what it was later, is there was an equal number of paupers to a provide for. The luxury of the rich few does not come to much when we are dealing with national figures, arid I find that total expenditure of the United Kingdom is set down at £878,000,00 0 a year it in 1882, whilst in X903, twenty-one years later, it was reckoned at £1,386,000,000. The total yearly expenditure in the twenty-one years from 1882 to 1903 increased by see more than £500,000,000 : That does not look as if the millions of England had a smaller purchasing power.",48
277,Mr JH CATTS,BOARD OF TRADE,What had production increased by ?,48
278,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I am on the question of to pauperism. I might admit that numbers do not get enough of production, but I am talking of what the people spend. They not spend a larger amount if they had not got it to spend, and I have shown that the expenditure of the Mother Countryincreased to a total of £1,386,000,00 0 per in year in 1903. That is a fair expenditure for a population of about 42,000,000. with four big groups of industries-building , coal-mining, engineering, ancl lextiles- I find that the movement in money wages was from 82.8 in 1877 up to the 100 in 1900. That was an increase of 17 per cent, between those years. The fall in the price .of corn, which is the staple of life-whea t is called "" c o r n "" in England-is shown by the fact that whilst in 1871 the price was represented by the figure 100, the price to the "" starving"" millions in England in 1902 was represented by the figures 63.7, a fall of nearly 37 per cent, in the price of bread. That is a tremendous fail in the price of that necessary of life. The fall in the price of meat was not so great; it amounted to not more than 6 per cent.",48
279,Mr HUTCHISON,BOARD OF TRADE,Can the right honourable gentleman give figures with respect to house rent?,49
280,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I can only give totals. In 1882 the' figure set down as representing expenditure on house rent, including furniture, coal, gas, and - water, was £121,700,000. In 1903 the expenditure on this account amounted to £223,000,000.",49
281,Mr HUTCHISON,BOARD OF TRADE,"The right honourable gentlemansbould now tell us how many families occupy, one room.",49
282,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,How can I tell the honourable member that? ' I am giving him all the information I can at the present time. Surely honourable members will see that an increase of nearly double the amount spent on house rent is not a sign of ruination?,49
283,Mr HUTCHISON,BOARD OF TRADE,"Yes ; it is a sign that the landlordshave taken more from the people, thus making them poorer.",49
284,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The point is that they have had it to pay. You cannot take the breeches off a countryman of ours, you know. When the people paid £100,000,000 more than they had previously paid on this account they had to get it and earn it somehow. On. food and drink they spent nearly £468,000,000 a year, and the prices of - sugar and tea, and articles of that sort, which are amongst the necessaries of life, .went down from the index, figure of 100 in 1871 to the figure 46.1 in 1902, a decrease of about 54 per cent, in the period named. Taking the whole of these, groups referred to, prices went down from the indexfigure of 100 to 78.8 per cent., or a decrease of 21.2 per cent.",49
285,Mr HUTCHISON,BOARD OF TRADE,"Whils t thousands could not get separate rooms for their families to live in. . Mr Reid - Is that a very strange thing? I .have known people in Australia who could not get proper accommodation for their families. That is true of every country in the world. But I am not talking of 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 unfortunates, but of 12,000,000 of alleged paupers. That is the monstrous statement with which I am dealing.",49
286,Mr HUTCHISON,BOARD OF TRADE,"They must come to pretty nearly 12,000,000.",49
287,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,The ' honourable member ought to take some anti-bilious pills.,49
288,Mr HUTCHISON,BOARD OF TRADE,I notice that the right honourable gentleman did not quote the particulars to which I referred.,49
289,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon for the remark I have just made, but really his contentions do seem to suggest a disordered liver. With reference to all this talk about Germany, I wish to point out that whilst the average wages in fifteen skilled trades in the capital cities of the United. Kingdom were 42s. a week in Germany they were 24s. a week. Air. HALL - But they have insurance funds running there.",49
290,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I have no doubt they have many wonderful things there, but I am talking only, about the wages, and I remind the honourable member that in Germany the workers pay out of the wages I have quoted for a share of the benefits they get.",49
291,Mr HALL,BOARD OF TRADE,The employers pay.,49
292,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The employers pay part, the State part, and the workmen part. The workman is not a pauper since he contri-butes to the allowance he receives.",49
293,Mr HALL,BOARD OF TRADE,In the majority of cases it is only the employer who pays to the fund.,49
294,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Le t us admit that. It is 'the 12,000,000 of "" starving "" people of the United Kingdom that I am referring to. I . desire only to refute that astounding and abominable calumny. The difference in the wages paid in Germany and in England in connection with skilled trades in the capital cities is the difference between 24s. and 42s. per week. In cities other than capital cities the average wage is 36s. per week in the United Kingdom 'and 22s. 6d. per week in. Germany. That is a difference of 13s. 6d. per week. That is not all that requires to be considered. I would point out that the longest hours have to be worked inGermany. Of the four ""countries, Germany, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the longest hours are worked in Germany, the next longest in France, the next in the United States, and in this country, wliere there are said to be 12,000,000 starving people, the shortest (hours are worked. In that old country, with itsteeming millions on a little spot of earth, surely it will be considered a merit by our honourable friends opposite that the workers have to work shorter - hours than are worked in the United States? Surely that is something to be proud of? Any one who has the slightest regard for the old country must feel proud that when she has - stood the storm and strain of universal protection in other parts of the world against her-includin g the ports of her own daughter-lands-sh e is able to pierce these universal barricades, and with her open ports to give her millions shorter hours of - labour than are given to the people behind these protective systems, including the people of the United States. There is no doubt that wages are . immenselyhigher in the United States than in England, but the cost of living in. the American - States takes a great deal out of that. Some authorities say that although wages have uncloubtedly gone up since the Dihgley Tariff, the cost of living has also gone up at such a rate that the increase in wages has practically beenof no benefit io the workers in the .United States. Let us compare Germany and - Great Britain on another important point. I am indebted to the honourable member for Barrier for the figures which. I am giving; they have been taken from a work published in the old country. During the period between 1871: and 1881, the cost of food in a German workman'-s family might be represented by the figures 11,2, and in an English workman's family by the figures 140; but during the four years between 1897 and 1901 the cost of the German family, instead of being 112, was 100, and that of the British family had made the marvellous improvement of. from 140 to 100. - Mr HALL - What is the name of the book from which the right honourable member has been reading?",49
295,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"It was written by Mr. .Morrison Davidson, a very well-known man. I look upon any genuine, unconditional .preference to the Mother Country as something of which I must heartily approve. Tn my opinion, it would be a wise and patriotic step to grant such a preference, '-and I shall be only too pleased to do what I can to make our preference as substantial as possible. I draw the sharpest possible line between a generous unconditional preference and an agreement between the Mother Country and the self-governing dependencies of the Empire. We must all. be profoundly sensible that, whilst Aus-' tralia can afford to make mistakes which may cost her very little, a country like the United Kingdom, with the pressure of Empire responsibility upon her, cannot afford to do so. She is not in the position of a youth in the full possession of his powers and energies, who can. afford to bungle along the path of life, ultimately, despite his mistakes, becoming a successful man. ""With the enormous strain upon her to which I have referred, Great Britain finds all the problems which affect her trade' and ber fiscal policy of the greatest magnitude and Goncern. There should not be the slightest feeling of soreness on our part if the Mother Country regards this matter in thelight of the interests of its own people. We, too, must look at it from both sides, and I have never concealed the opinion that, from the 'point of view of the Mother Country, it would be a vital mistake to abandon the system upon which her trade and industry rest - Therefore, I have ' no grievance against the people of the United Kingdom for refusing to enter into reciprocal arrangements. ' I believe that, in doing so they are. consulting their best interests, and that such arrangements would not make their bread cheaper', or the conditions of their masses better, but, on the contrary, would make' things, worse fpr them. The honourable member for' Corio has made an interjection which was 'frequently uttered by the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference. When speakers, notably members of the British' Government, used the expression "" tax '.' m relation to imposts. on food, he' interjected more than once, "" Not a tax,' but a duty."" Even a protectionist must admit that if goods subject to the Customs_ impost cannot be produced entirely in the country in which they are subject to taxation, the duty on them must have the effect of increasing their price. That has' been brought home to us clearly.",50
296,Mr SAMPSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"Does it not depend largely on the ratio of the importations? . . Mr Reid - No . If the United Kingdom could supply all the foodstuffs she wants, the .effect of the duty on foodstuffs would be to stimulate production to the extent of making the importations, .of Australian wheat unnecessary. . If . Great Britain could produce its own requirements, what would be the use of our talking about getting there"" a market for Australian wheat ?",50
297,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,"There was a duty in 1894., and the price of wheat in Great Britain then went down.",51
298,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable member's interjection reminds me of the story of the young man who, after some trouble, obtained, his father's permission to go to Paris. When he got there it was raining heavily, so that he had to remain indoors, but whenever he looked out of the window of the hotel, a fair-haired young woman passed. Accordingly he wrote home, "" Father, this is no place for me. It is always raining, and all the women have red hair."" Faulty generalizations of that sort are often made fromi imperfect data. It does not follow, because prices went down in England in 1894, that that was due to the imposition of a duty. The fluctuation of prices is brought about by a thousand conditions. If , owing to a drought, the production of wheat in the United States shows a falling off, prices harden, while if there are good harvests, prices drop. It is an elementary fallacy to attribute a falling wheat market to the imposition of a duty. Therefore I do not think 'that the honourable member for Corio is sound on the point.",51
299,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,The price of wheat fell outside the duty.,51
300,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,I think that it fell below the duty. The fluctuations of the markets of the world are so familiar to honourable members that they know that the fact that a commodity was at a certain price in one year and at another price in another year is. no proof that its value has been affected by an Act of Parliament.,51
301,Mr LIVINGSTON,BOARD OF TRADE,Act s of Parliament have not had much to do with the rise in the price of wheat here.,51
302,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"My honourable friend has brought me back to the point from which I was straying. Up to a certain point, the wheat duty may have had some protective incidence when Victoria was a separate State. But take Australia.'now, with her enormous wheat production and her small population. The price of Australian wheat is not regulated by the Tariff, but by the markets of the world. Every bushel of wheat that is sold on the farm in Australia is sold at a price which leaves to the buyer a margin of profit after allowing for. the expense of conveyance and shipment and the chances of the market based on the quotations. A fall of a fraction in Mark-lane will affect the wheat market all over the world.",51
303,Mr SAMPSON,BOARD OF TRADE,On what basis are these prices regulated?,51
304,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"They are regulated by the demand. I should be just as foolish as I was tempted to suggest somebody elsewas if I endeavoured to assign all the causes' for a fall in price in Mark-:lane. There may be many causes. For instance, on the share market, though not so acutely, without any rhyme or reason sometimes the value of shares will go up and down in the most extraordinary way. The market is sensitive and may be frightened. All sorts of elements seem to affect quotations, even in the wheat market.",51
305,Mr MATHEWS,BOARD OF TRADE,The act of the millers in holding wheat will send up the price.,51
306,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is so, but what will be the use of their holding wheat if there is no prospect of a shortage?",51
307,Mr MATHEWS,BOARD OF TRADE,They are holding.,51
308,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That means that there is a drought coming on. If it was thought we were going to have a magnificent season that Wheat would be . got rid of before the abundant harvest was reaped. What possible benefit would a duty on wool be to the pastoral industry ? None whatever. If we put a duty of 100 per cent, on wool, the price would still be regulated by the demand in the markets of the world. With reference to the proposed duties on food in England, those who believe that they will not increase the prices areat liberty to enter into these projects in the gayest possible spirit. But I honestly believe that, situated as the people of the Mother Country are, any barrier between them ancl the abundance of the world would inflict serious loss upon them. Therefore, I support the view which has been so ably expressed by British Ministers, and so emphatically endorsed by the British people, that a preferential treaty would not be a good thing for the Mother Country. No Australian can want to injure the Mother Country, and, what is more,, no Australian can want to interfere with her liberty in fixing her own domestic policy. Sometimes a cruel strain has been put on the people of the Mother Country and their statesmen by insinuations of the sort which I am going to mention, and which' I have not noticed in any speeches by the Prime Minister. In this respect I acquit the honourable gentleman."" It has been insinuated that if the people of the Mother Country do not change their minds, and do not give this project a more friendly reception, the ties between the Mother Country and the self-governing Dominions will be weakened.. I think it is cruel and unjust to ask the people of the Mother Country to choose between the affections of the people of Australia and Canada and a reversal of their conscientious belief as to the best policy for their own government.",51
309,Mr JH CATTS,BOARD OF TRADE,"Who said that, anyhow ?",52
310,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"If the honourable member will accept my assurance, I have seen the statement made often, and General Botha referred very strongly to it in the opposite direction. I have expressly acquitted the Prime Minister of making any such statement, but it has been made repeatedly by over-zealous champions, probably more so in the Mother Country than here. During the great electoral struggle between the Liberals and the Conservatives, this was the most ordinary argument to use:.""Oh, you are alienating the affections of the people of the self-governingStates. you do not go in for this preference, you will weaken the ties between the self-governing Dominions, such as Australia and Canada, and the Mother Country."" heartily agree-becaus e I have expressed the same sentiment over and over againwith Mr Lloyd George in this view, that perhaps the simple secret of the phenomenally harmonious relations which prevail between the self-governing Dominions ancl the Mother Country might be summed up in a very simple phrase- "" This attachment, this harmony, these magnificent aspects of our British Empire, mainly have come from the assertion and the enjoyment of liberty ""-libert y in each of the self governing Dominions of the Empire. This is the life-blood of the strength of the British Empire. Give any of the self-governing Dominions an honest grievance : let the Imperial power, backed up as it is with its mighty fleets, endeavour ih the smallest particular to encroach on the freedom of our political institutions, to make upon us demands which it is in a position to enforce, ancl , to Ave clo not see our way to accede, ancl it will create a crisis which will more imperil the majestic strength of this tie than any other conceivable situation. It is a marvellous thing, but it seems absolutely true, that the frailer, the more elastic, the tie which unites the Mother Country with her great self-governing Dominions, the more powerful, enduring, and reliable it becomes. When times of adversity break upon us, and the old flag is flying in troubled skies,, then we lay aside our fiscal differences, ' forget our views about this form or that form of policy, and an elec? trie thrill of sympathy passes to the? farthest extremities of the Empire, which shows that there is a living connection existing between the great Imperial heart and the farthest Dominions, such as those in these Australasian seas. I believe that to maintain that system, to preserve the marvellous harmony and stability of the Empire, the fewer ties and bargains - we have the better. In those circumstances, whilst I hail with delight any generous unconditional preference which is given to the Mother Country, and which she so richly deserves, so long as she honestly and fearlessly believes in the policy which she has adopted, a policy which I regard as being essential to her stability and her strength, I hope that Australia will be found none the less loyal because the Mother Country asserts, on If her part, the independence we claim for ourselves.",52

It will only be possible for me in the briefest way to attempt in a conversational manner to deal with some of the points he has raised which - relate to the fiscal policy of the Government, and especially to my statement of that policy made in Great Britain, comparing it with the actual proposals now submitted. I hope, by frequent quotations, in an incidental manner to touch upon most, if not all, of the issues which the right honourable member has raised that appear to me to be vital to the question before us. To enter upon a discussion of the different degrees of social progress, rates of wages, or conditions of poverty, which obtain amongst which modern nations would launch us upon a sad survey of a vast subject-on e far too profound to attempt to drop a plummet line casually into its depths. But we cannot fail to be struck by one contrast. We have heard to-night an impassioned plea from the right honourable member for a grant of preference to the Mother Country 499'4 Tariff [REPRESENTATIVES.] from her Dominions, but based upon an angry refutation of a statement made bj' the present Prime Minister of England, shortly before he attained, that office, exactly the opposite purpose. It was reply to Mr Chamberlain, and in order to weight the English refusal to listen to his - plea for preferential trade, that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman gave as one of the reasons why it could not and should not lie considered that some 12,000,000 or .1.3,000,000 of the people of Great 'Britain being constantly upon the verge of starva.tion, they could not afford the risk of ing prices ever so little. That statement was afterwards interpreted' by that right honourable gentleman as referring to that large class who are dependent upon their dailv labour without any security for its continuance, and who from time to time, therefore, have to face starvation. statement included all those classes not in settled employment and not provided with the means to face the want of settled employment. The assertion was used by him as the basis for a plea against preferential trade. Curiouslv enough, it has been absolutely repudiated to-night by my right honourable friend as fatal to the very plea for which it was originally asserted.",52
312,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Agains t the imposition of duties upon foods.,53
313,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Agains t the particular of That, form which it was assumed Mr Chamberthose. (lain's proposals must necessarily take. The right honorahje member for .East Sydstances ney then proceeded to indulge in a series - Kingdom. of verbal antitheses, to which I . shall merely allude in passing.

To lend stances permit."" any force to this argument he must imply such a degree of protection as would secure tions. to us practically the whole of the trade is any particular commodity. That goes.beright yond protection to prohibition. a full measure of prohibition, according to him, we must sacrifice the whole of our respectfully industries to free imports from the Mother Country and elsewhere. Such an antithesis would oniy.be possible if prohibition were beingcontrasted with free imports. It emption has no relevance to protection. . As. honourable members are aware, there may be a protection of a ,trifling character conresolutions. ferred by a duty of 5 per cent, 10 per cent., still more protection is conferred'.by a duty of 15 or 20 per cent., and so on, though prohibition may not be - {Candles, &c.). reachable even with a duty of 100 per cent. The right honourable member's antitheses go wide of the doctrine we uphold, to which for he ought to have directed his word-play. in When he went on to say that we were compelled to choose between - the sacrifice of Australian industries to British manufac- ' tures or the exclusion of preference altogether, he again used a short and convenient summary justifiable in a few particulars, but wholly false when applied to industries generally grouped under a single title-as , for example, woollens, textiles, raisor iron - which in themselves embrace dozens of industries with specialproducts. Some of .these may be dealt with by one rate, .and the rest by other rates of duty; some may bear only a light duty, others be subject to a heavy duty; some bearing noduty at His all, whilst others need no preference. The general statement that protection must necessarily be exclusive of preference applies to a very limited number of cases, and to avery small' area indeed. When the honourable member passed from such antitheses to the resolutions of 1902,- to which he pointed as pledging us to a policy of preference of a substantial character, he used only a part of the third resolution re-affirmed at the recent Imperial Conferencewith a view to promoting the increase . trade within the Empire, it-is desirable that colonies which have not already adopted such a policy should, as-far. as their circumpermit, give substantial preference to the products and manufactures of the United to The right honourable member omitted the words "" should, as far as their circum' ..

Besides, so far as Australia is concerned, the whole situation is transformed by the fact that, prior to attending that Conference, we had given notice of a proposal to omit from the fourth resolution the qualification embodied in the words "" either by exemption or by a reduction of the duties now or hereafter imposed."" We struck out those words. The effect of this is that the offer of a substantial preference on our side was made subject to the condition that we received an eciual and similar preference from the Mother Country. Again the right honourable member's shot goes wide.",53
317,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,Did not the honourable gentleman vote for the resolution about giving substantial preference?,54

As the proceedings of the Conference disclosed, I voted for the resolutions as they, stood rather than have no resolution passed on the subject of preference from the Mother Country. ter preference by exemption or reduction of duties than no preference at all. when my right honourable friend seeks to impeach us for inconsistency, it is Tight to point out that substantial preference on our part was always made subject to a substantial preference on theirs. We may have lieen wrong, but at least we were consistent.",54
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,"Whil e the able gentleman is on' that point, may I ask what he meant when he spoke about the "" Dominions oyer sea "" ?",54

321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,Onl y those?,54
322,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Yes . Then, again, the right honourable the leader of the Opposition complained that we approached the Mother Country with the offer of a shilling and a request for a pound. Again and again he put that illustration, as if it were possible for us, by some manner of means unknown to me, to coerce the Parliament of Great Britain into an unequal exchange. Now. as a matter of fact, we proposecl a business bargain on a business basis, in which, each party was to be the judge of what it would grant in. return for the preference Offered by the other.",54
323,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,That must always be so.,54
324,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"It must always be so, and, therefore, the imputation of the riglit honourable member disappears. No one can coerce the British Government into giving a sovereign for a shilling. We pointed out from the first that any engagement of this kind must be absolutely free and spontaneous, and, hence there was never a possibility of our imposing upon them the onerous burdens to which the right honourable member alluded several times. I have now to point to a portion of his speech which I repudiate in the most abso lute terms. The right honourable member more than insinuated, he almost directly charged me with having taken up an attitude directly or indirectly in the interest of the present Opposition in Great Britain. As a matter of fact, I declined every invitation to every gathering of a party character. There were some apparent exceptions, as when we werethe guests of the Eighty Club, of the National Liberal Club, the Palmerston and other clubs, representing the Ministerial Party; or when we were the guests of the Nineteen Hun'Eetdred Club, a powerful organization of the Opposition party. But Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What about that . Baltic meeting?",54
325,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"That I declined to attend until officially assured by those charged with its promotion that it was a ; non-party meeting of merchants, including supporters of the Government, as well as supporters of the Opposition, freehonor- traders as well as Tariff reformers. I was assured that the meeting was one of highly representative men, having no party complexion; a fact indicated in the course of that great influential and enthusiastic meeting-by cheers and other indications that it was not the gathering of a single party.",54
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable gentleman heard them crying "" S h a m e "" with regard to the attitude of the Government at that meeting ?",54
327,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Not that I remember. It may have been with reference to the main cause of our attending so many meetings and taking advantage of all of them to put our case. To that the right honourable member did not allude, though it is most material. If anything was calculated to demonstrate the propriety of the course we took, it has been the little impression niade by this Blue Book when it was flung at the heads of the people of the Mother Country and of Australia. This volume contains the records of the Conference, so fas as they were not confidential, published weeks after it had closed, and when the public mind had turned to other questions.",54

330,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Has there even been a case in which there were not closed doors at such Conferences? - Mr DEAKIN - No , , except that in 1887 the proceedings on the opening day were attended by the press and by the leaders on both sides in politics. whole of the occurrences and speeches on that occasion were reported in the newspaper's. But although the general proceedings of previous Conferences had not laeen held with open doors, we were of opinion that the time had come for a change to be made. When the absolute necessity for the change appeared, and it was denied, we felt that we had a right to appeal to the people outside. Conference, it has to be remembered, was not a body possessing Executive or legislative authority. Its resolutions did not bind any one. . Yet they were all it had to show. Its members came pledged to expound certain lines of policy; and unless its meetings where this was to be done took place in the full sight of the people of Great Britain and of Australia, it was bound to fail in its aim - So far, it has largely failed in that aim. representations regarding it are still being propagated even in this House, and these occur because the meetings of the Conference were held behind closed doors. The particular speech alluded to by the honoraible member for Parramatta, and which it has been asserted provoked cries of shame, contained no more than the speeches made by me previously at the Conference itself. Only thus could we convey to the public the views we were sent to express, which put to the vote ? could not be grasped from the bald precis published",55

333,Sir WILLIAMLVNE,BOARD OF TRADE,"I will answer what occurred at Sheffield. Mr DEAKIN ' - An y one who will turn to those outside speeches made at different gatherings-in the presence of Ministers some occasions, of the leaders of both parties on others, at several of which the Secretary of State for the Colonies was present-wil l see that the same ideas were presented to the public as were being preI t was sented at the Conference. They were treated in a slightly different manner, but the questions dealt with, especially that of mutual preferences, were those Ave were discussing at the Conference. That Avas our plain duty.

To return to less personal matters, it appears to me that AA*e suffer, as all political, philosophical, and theological, discussions suffer, because of a loose on application of terms. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the arguments which have been addressed to this Chamber in reference to preference, because of the several senses in which the term may be applied; and until we get a very much more elaborate - terminology that looseness of usage is haps inevitable, though it is extremely embarrassing. Now, so far as we are conthe cerned, we did not fail at every turn intimate, both in the Conference, and outtries side-havin g the' Conference Official Retries ports before me, it is .to these alone I shall refer-that , when we spoke of preference, we aimed at something very much wider than that word might at first appear to convey. It is scarcely possible to use a single which shall cover all that is associated with sideration. the greatest of great movements within the Empire for the co-operation of all its parts. What we aim at is, as a British Minister put it,. "" the free union of free Commonwealths.'''' Towards that great ideal there are many ways of approach; and must not be forgotten that we were obliged to use the word ""preference' ' continually when, covering or referring to one or other of these, besides the very great means of preference that is presented to us by Tariffs. From the very first I pointed out. as, for instance, at page 259, thatThe policy is large, and the principle policy applies not only to trade and but is capable, as already suggested, of indefinite expansion. Then at page 387Preferential Tariffs are only part of the of preferential trade. We included any association fur mutual ends, by means of improvements in our shipping communication, of our cable comthe munication, or of our .postal facilities. went on to sketch the possibility of a committee of experts bei;rig appointed, who would periodically review the trade of the Empire as a whole in order to retain trade as far as possible within the Empire, ing out that the idea .was capable of indefinite expansion, and that there were many stand-points which we could not yet attempt to touch. We were in favour of the adoption of every means pf co-operation for common ends. I had already written a despatch, the first from any Dominion challenging the maintenance of the high rates of charge on the Suez Canal. asked for a reduction, either by the British Government itself-the possessor by means of a happy investment of an enormous interest in the Canal, from which it receives a superb return-or . if that were not directly possible, for some indirect assistance by which we could meet the needs of our shipping. Having.raised that question by despatch and received a refusal, I was not deterred from including that at each opportunity, as one means available for perImperial co-operation. In addition to the reduction of freight charges, we referred to direction of the great stream of emito gration from the mother country to coun-' under our own flag, instead of to coununder foreign flags. These and other methods of co-operation were pressed forward in the Conference and out of it where ever opportunity offered us opendoors or open minds in order to provoke and proword mote schemes worthy of practical con",55
336,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,There is no distinction in the charges on the Suez Canal between British ships and foreignships.,56
337,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The r e is not, but there it are suggestive means of meeting them. ""One country with an infinitesimal marine already pays out of the Government dues the charge on its ships. I took the opportunity of calling attention to' a pracour tical concession, which could be adopted, if the whole of the reduction asked could not be made. At present, passenger of that steamers passing through the canal pay commerce, a due on the whole of the passenger accommodation, although little of it may be occupied. There are certain seasons in the Australian trade when, as a matter of fact, the mail ships and other policy vessels carry very few passengers, and yet are charged ' on the whole of the accommodation. I made the very simple and reasonable request that, althouch I believe vessels are in regard to oaigo charged I on their gross tonnage, so far as passengers are concerned, there should be a concession to commence with by charging only for the accommodation occupied. Finally, pointat page 426, I explained thatEvery time. I have touched this question I have' from the first, included improved cable communication, mail communication, and ihe diffusion of commercial intelligence, the - multiplying of commercial agencies in the country all as parts of one S5'stem. I have never severed them. Preferential trade, with me, means all those things, as well as promoting our dealing with each other's commodities. But, of course, the centre and pivot of We the discussion at the commencement, and for the major portion of the Conference, was Tariff preferences. On that, I have now to show, in reply to the leader of the Opposition, .not only that there has been no variation in the attitude of the Government, but that, as I shall evidence b.y y very few quotations, the mind of the Government was laid open to the members of the Conference, ancl even the Tariff now under consideration was, in its broad principles, outlined in advance so far as such a measure could be, by my colleague and myself to the British Ministers. The memory of the leader of the Opposition in regard to the official report is, perhaps, not so fresh as my own.",56
338,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,- I remember the 40 per cent-.,57
339,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,I think I shall establish the principle involved in the 40 per cent.,57
340,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,-The principle is all right.,57
341,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is the principle of what the right honourable member is pleased to call "" high"" duties. Tariff preferences, of course, as it was necessary to remind the Conference, even excluding those other forms I have temporarily dismissed, are of many kinds. We specially warned the British Ministers that we should be putting forward only one particular set of proposals, with a. full understanding that these would be merely the seed which might hereafter grow to something much greater. We were about to adopt the forms now available, whereas other forms of preference .might become useful at a later date. Here is the exact proposal which I ventured to submit, as reported on page 235What we suggest is a trade in preferences, in trade advantages which should be conceded to each other, on the usual principle of trade, that it should be to the benefit of both parties concerned. I think that is explicit enough in itself.",57
342,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"It is magnificently explicit, and means anything.",57
343,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I saidSo' far as I am aware, no one has yet fathered, or is likely to father, any such proposition as that this matter of business is to be dealt with to the advantage of one of the parties only. That answers your J £ I for a shilling idea. There is not anv business of that character, or which is assumed to be of that character. must yield mutual advantage, ancl of the value of that advantage each party must be the judge.",57
344,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is all right, but. it is reciprocal. ' preferences. the carrying of it out that I am concerned with.",57
345,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,A moment ago my right honourable friend did not agree with the statement.,57
346,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I agreed with the statement, duty, but I said it might mean anything.",57
347,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"My proposal for trade - preferences is contained in the words I have read; when Mr Asquith interjected at onceI entirely assent lo that proposition, if I may say so. It admirably states the case.",57
348,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,What about the fulfilment?,57
349,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I need scarcely remind my North Country friend that we cannot get a fulfilment before we get the proposal. I am only at the proposal now. I saidThat is why the goodwill cannot be disturbed. It must always be admitted that each of the parties to the bargain must be the best judge of its own gain. We may have a strong and clear opinion as to how the other bargainer should proceed, in. his own interest, but after all, that is his affair. We may regret that we cannot clo the business,, but necessarily we must in every case bow to< his decision. So, in - the present instance, it appears to us to be possible for each to imposeduties on a certain scale-puttin g aside the advantage which may be gained from those duties-grantin g each other preferences under them without loss orrisk of loss. That is a proposal which it is impossibleto misunderstand; it is a proposal for mutual preferences.",57
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,A very cold-blooded' one.,57
351,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"On e quotation did not please the leader of the Opposition, because it was hot-blooded. That which I have, just made does not please the deputy leader of the Opposition, because it is coldblooded. Let us come a little nearer toour Present proposals. At page 256 it will be found that I pointed out in London, thatIt is not possible for the Commonwealth toabclish its Customs duties, or reduce them in ihe aggregate in anv considerable measure. Whatis possible is discrimination and readjustment in* both countries by reciprocal concessions. It is,, and will remain, necessary that at least the present amount of revenue should be obtained in. Australia, but this allows ample room within, which preference may be given to British imports. I there warned them that reductions in our duties were not likely to come; that weI t must at least raise as much revenue as webest had done, and that the one consideration of reductions would be in connection withEven, in thisassembly, comparatively familiar with fiscal duties, confusion frequently arises.as to what ""high"" and ""low"" duties mav be, and in order that there might be no mistake I went on to sav that15 per cent, wilh .is ranks as a very moderateindeed, in most cases. The Committee has been asked to accept the statement that when we spoke at the Conference we led Great Britain to believe that"" we had in mind the low percentages with which they are familiar. I took especial care, in that ease (as well as in others) to safeguard the members of the Conference against any misapprehension by pointing out that with us 15'per cent., as a rule, was a very moderate duty. Having so paved the way to an understanding of the scale of duties we had in mind, I went on to point out that there were two modes of preferenceThe Commonwealth may proceed either to lower existing duties in favour of Great Britain or to increase these duties to the foreigner. This latter course has been followed in Canada, New Zealand, ancl South Africa, and probably in no perceptible degree influences' the amount of duties collected. The immediate object of preference in our case would be to exclude foreign goods and to favour British goods. On a more general view, nnd subject to this, its object is to obtain fair terms abroad where fair terms are granted by 11s, It is iifitnr.il, then, that the extent of the preference should be such as to be calculated to accomplish the first of these objects-that is, the cessation of importation of foreign goods, and'an increase of present duties would seem to be the best means to achieve this end.",57
352,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,That is an increase as against the foreigner?,58
353,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Yes, and other increases where necessary.",58
354,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,How could we help England by increasing the duties as against imports from that country ?,58
355,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The right honourable member thinks that it might be supposed that this suggestion of an increase related only to the duties on goods from foreign parts. To that I shall recur in a few minutes. I went on to point out the field of preference afforded in the first instance by our free list, which covered nearlv 34 per cent, of our total imports. In that direction, I said, it was possible to clo a creat deal, and we have done much in regarcl to them under the Tariff proposals now before us. At the same time, I warned the Conference-anc l this shows that I was speaking not merely of an increase of the duties on foreign goods-that an increase of local production must be allowed for where our circumstances were favourable. At page 258, pursuing another line of exposition, I saidThis would be the effect of substantial ferences, ancl substantial preferences are contemplated by the third resolution of the Conference, of 1902. Having quoted - the fourth - resolution of 1:902, which, provided that we might give to the products and manufactures of other self-governing Colonies similar concessions to those extended to the United Kingdom, under what I termed a system of "" Imperial reciprocities,"" I proceededRepeating for the. last time lhat the Commonwealth postulates your absolute independence in the judgment you are to exercise, ancl adding that we are not pleading for something which is to involve sacrifices, but for a co-operation which is to be mutually beneficial-repeatin g that for the last time-surel y the endeavour to look at this question from what I have termed a corporate pojnt of view, ancl the endeavour to secure corporate action, can be productive of nothing but good. . . . The policy is large, and the principle of that policv applies not only to trade andcommerce, but is capable, as already suggested, of indefinite expansion. The latter statement appears at' page 259, and lower down in the same page honourable members will find the followingWe have not yet propounded a complete scheme for anv of tliese on either basis: that is to say, neither as a one-sided preference tendered by ourselves, nor still less of the possibilities of a preference balanced by concessions from you. > Later, on. I am reported at page 261It is hardly necessary to remind the Conference that preferences may be of all kinds, degrees, ancl extents. They vary, and will vary, from time to time, between the same parties, and even more greatly between them and other parties. The Customs Tariff which we. shall submit will be framed on the same principle I have been enunciating here. Now what is it? Could any one mistake thisOur first consideration will be that of the circumstances of Australia and its demands. The next will be the possibility of giving a preference, ancl tlierefore entering into closer commercial relations with the Mother Country and our sister dominions. The third will be how far, and in what degree, it shall apply to foreign countries who single us out for special disabilities. I clearly showed that our Tariff, whether ""one-sided"" or reciprocal, was to be framed - with due regard to three considerations, given in the order of their necessity : Australia and its demands, preference making for closer commercial union with the Mother Countrv, and, finally, retaliation on those outside who were discriminating against us.",58
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,I presume that the honourable gentleman would take any one of them ?,58
357,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I desired to take all preof them, going on to sayThe larger trade exchange with the Mother Country towards which we look, ample in its proportions, and immense in its possibilities, will be constantly before us, but the extent to which we can approach a complete mutual exchange will, of course, be governed by the'attitude which is adopted here towards our proposals. I'think I can fairly say that any encouragement we may receiveThis was not a cold-blooded statementwill be met, not in a spirit of barter, but with a desire to prove our appreciation of it and of our family relations.",58
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,That is much better.,59
359,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,It is the sort of talk that is always indulged in when one is endeavouring to make a bargain.,59
360,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I doubt if any member of the Committee, who ""is indebted to the brilliant speech of my right honourable friend for his knowledge-of the proposals that we actually submitted, had any suspicion that there were such pertinent and practical passages, in this report, dealing with the very problems with which the right honourable member was gallantly wrestling without making any reference to them. No one who reads can doubt for a moment what we proposed. ences were to be proportioned to theirs. So far from our standing alone, the same attitude was adopted not only by Natal, Cape ' Colony, and New Zealand, but by 'Canada, the greatest and most populous Dominion of all.",59
361,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Wit h thing added. The honourable gentleman did not quote that.,59
362,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I do not quite catch the honourable member's meaning, or he does not catch mine. Sir Will f r i d Laurier said-pag e 411-that a complaint had been madethat the Canadian preference has not done as much for British trade as had been hoped for. I repeat, there is a way of doing it. by adopting a mutual system of preference. But again, I suppose, the British Government represented here may say, "" No , we are not prepared to do that. We might improve our trade with our self-governing dependencies, but whilst we might do this, we would disturb the whole sys- tem of trade, and would lose, perhaps, more than we would gain otherwise, by disturbing the whole system of trade that we have in this country."" This is a question wh^ch is not for us.",59
363,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"He would give the preference if the British Government still maintained their, views.",59
364,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"He does still give the preference, but points out, as we do, that the preference given without, return is nothing like the preference which would be offered in return for a reciprocal preference from Great Britain. That is his point.",59
365,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,It would not be 33 per cent. It might be 66 per cent.,59
366,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"It might be anything that both Parliaments thought fit. Precisely the same attitude was taken up by the representatives. of the other self-governing Dominions. They all said, "" So far as we are concerned, what we seek* is reciprocity with the Mother Country- a preference extended to us and a preference granted by us-the question of the details of those preferences to be worked out, as they must necessarily be, according to the judgment of the several Parliaments concerned."" Until we were at one, of course the arrangement would not be mutual - As already said, whatever preference were given to us we should at least balance by equal preferences of our own. That mutual preference meant far more than that .which we now propose. This is a preference by way of g if t without return, made as an indication of good-feeling and attachment. The context must be examined with regard to the word ""preference"" in each case to Our prefer- discover when we were referring to reciprocity-preferenc e by return-o r only to preference by gift . In several of the passages cited to-night by the right honourable member, the Statements relate to the reciprocal preference and not to the preference which is before us at the present sometime.",59
367,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"I thought I made that clear. When I was speaking of the honourable gentleman's statement about thp 50 per cent, increase of trade, I alluded to a reciprocal arrangement, Mr DEAKIN ' - I 'may say, although I have not his permission to name him, that the gentleman who made that statement. It is was well acquainted with all the circumstances of Australian trade. He entered into most careful and elaborate calculations before we left this country, and, on my expressing doubt as to the estimate which he had formed, pointed out that he meant the estimate of 50 per cent, to applv to the circumstances which would arise if , in consequence of preference being granted for our agricultural products in the Mother said he Country, larger areas of land were placed under cultivation in this country, a larger population found employment on the soil, the consumption of British goods brought here under preference being by that means increased. He said it was fair to assume that, within a comparatively short period, those circumstances would lead to an increase of 50 per cent, in our importation of goods from Great Britain, only a part of that increase being gained at the expense of the foreign goods which at present enter into competition with them, the rest being derived from the great growth which he foresaw in our consumption of. British goods under the stimulus ence.",59
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,"In other we did 50 per cent, more business with them, they would do 50 per cent, more with us.",60
369,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Let us hope,-more. order to show that we approached this subviewer' ject from a perfectly equitable stand-point, I took pains to give ""the rather unnecesme, sary reminder-pag e 236-tha nised to the full the perfect right and freedom! of the Mother Country, consistent with am-not preferential. her adoption of this policy, to levy protective duties against us on any and product that she thought fit. I said we made our proposal subject always to the condition of .the - complete freedom of ference. the Mother Country to impose duties upon our products to any extent she thought necessary in regard to her own local sumption.",60
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,BOARD OF TRADE,"We should not like it, though. ;",60
371,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is another quessurance tion. But the case was put fairly by It was only right to show that' we asked nothing that we were not prepared to concede. The liberty that we desired for ourselves was necessarily extended to the Mother Country- the greater and senior partner. - Sir JOHN FORREST - If they taxed our goods, we should not be likely to tax theirs so much.",60
372,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,That is a question for their statesmen.,60
373,Mr HUGHES,BOARD OF TRADE,"What the gentleman hasstated is a repudiation of Mr Chamberlain's first'dictum at Glasgow that "" the colonies' were not to increase their scope of manufactures.""",60
374,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I remember that proposition. It really resolves itself into a Question of the class of manufactures. If the right honourable gentleman said, "" Y o u shall not increase your duties upon your iron manufactures,"" that would be an impossible condition. But if he said, as he reasonably might- "" Here are a great quantity of high-class iron goods, which can only be profitably made in huge quantities; you in Australia cannot at present consume' siich quantities; you 'cannot expect to start manufactures on a sound basis for that particular kind of goods; offer them no protection, but allow us a preference on them, and then,'instead of suffering, you [177] gain, and we gain also""-that would be of prefera different thing. , - Mr Reid - That is a bit of daylight. words, if I like to hear that. .",60
375,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"If the right honourable member is interested .in that bit of davlight, .1 would remind him that two orI n three years ago it broke upon an inter: representing the Westminster 'Gazette, then in Australia, who waited uponand; I think upon the right honourable t we recogmember' among others.'",60
376,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,They : never came to me. I. %,60
377,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The right honourable, every member - gave an interview with .rethat gard to the question 'of trade generally. I do not say that he advocated preI n dealing with the question then, I pointed out' this very method, by which it will be possible for us to conlend most valuable assistance to' many departments, pf English industry without in any .degree interfering with our . - - .own .manufactures. In order to make asdoubly sure- I fear I am rather us. tedious, but wish to satisfy the right honourable member' once and for all on this point- I shall-show that at the Conference when I had concluded, whether' in warm blood or cold blood, no less a critic than that singularly'able economic exponent; Mr. Asquith, commended our starting point. As he took the principal part in the campaign against Mr Chamberlain's proposals, he has been generally-recognised as the foremost speaker for the present Government on these subjects.. ' He commenced with ""a reference to that ^principle of liberty to honourable which my right honourable friend has made eloquent allusion. He is reported on page 305- I am leaving out unnecessary wordsSir Will f r i d Laurier has often said that in this matter each community of the Empire must primarily pay Teganl to the interests of its own members, and I was yery glad to hear that statement reiterated with great emphasis and explicitness by Mr Deakin more than once in the course of his speech. There we are all agreed. A little lower down he saysBut' particularly, in these fiscal ancl economic matters,. the primary and governing consideration of every one of us-the first considerationmust be how does it affect the community with which we are more particularly connected, ancl which we have'the honour'here to represent? He applauded our watch-word, ""Australia first,"" whilst Great Britain's-interest came first for him. . On the next page, 306 of the report, he went on to say- ' For the first time in the history of the world we have managed to reconcile, what hitherto has been found irreconcilable in every political combination, namely, the completest development of local liberty and independence without impairing, nay, rather with an enhancement of, a sense of corporate unity and attachment between the parts and the whole. If that is true, gentlemen, of our Empire as a whole, of its structure and its foundations, nowhere is it truer, I think, than in this department of fiscal policy. It is by giving, as the Mother Country has done, complete fiscal autonomy to her Colonies- I will not say only by that, but it is partly by that, and largely by .that-lha t we have succeeded in arriving at a working'Imperial arrangement. There was no hostility to our doctrine of ""Australia first."" He went on to say that he would not. even criticise our fiscal policy, though he did not agree with it, and then at page 307 of the report he showed his complete - understanding of our intentions. I call attention to it again, not as a inatter of Complaint, but simply as a matter of fact-in these very preferential Tariffs that have 'been the subject of discussion during the last few days there is not one of them which proposes to let British manufactures enter into the Colonial markets to compete on level terms with the Colonial manufacturer in regard to the class of commodities the production of which you think it your duly to encourage by protective duties. And quite rightly, from your point of view, if I mav say so",60
378,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,No protectionist could have put the matter more fairly.,61
379,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"No ; but the point is that people here are invited to believe that in the Tariff now before the Committee we have departedso absolutely from the principles laid down at this Imperial Conference debate, as to take the British Government by surprise. I wish to showhow frankly and freely Mr Asquith, and afterwards Mr Lloyd George, recognised our exact position, ancl realized the meaning of the words that we there used. On the same page it will be found that Mr Asquith further saidYou are not going lo admit anybody, British Or foreign, to compete on level terms in your markets in respect of the industries which you desire to protect. You could not do it. It is a negation of protection. Obviously the thing itself is self-contradictorv.",61
380,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is what we say, but the Government try to do it sometimes.",61
381,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"A little lower down I find this passage which the right honourable member for East Sydney also quotedUnder the system of preference, or the mitigated form of protection which it is proposed your protective Tariff should now take, it is.essential for your purpose', in the exercise 'ofyour fiscal independence, and in the maintenance, as vou conceive it to be,' of vour economic interests, lo exclude the British manufacturers to a very large extent from your markets. I make it a matter of complaint, but I note it as a fact taken for granted by every one round this table. Yet we are told that every one who sat round the Conference table in London is now amazed that we acted on the principle of ""Australia first,''""' in protecting our own manufactures before granting a gift preference.",61
382,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"It is the jump from a' moderate duty of 15 per cent, to an extreme duty of 40 per cent, that ""might take their breath away.",61
383,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"On e more quotation from Mr Asquith's colleague, the very able President of the Board of Trade, Mr Lloyd George.",61
384,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,There are some able free traders in the world.,61
385,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"There are indeed, and I think that Mr Asquith and Mr Lloyd George rank amongst the ablest in Great Britain. It was a great privilege to hear them, and a great honour to meet them It is said that there was no knowledge in Great Britain with regard to our Tariff proposals, but this is how Mr Lloyd George referred to the matter. At page 360 referring to our elections, he said I believe lhat at that election Mr Deakin also sought and secured a mandate for raising the protective duties now levied by the Commonwealth against ihe importation of goods in which Britain drives a very considerable trade with the Australian consumer at the present moment. My right honourable friend would have drawn tears from, stones to-night by his' picture of the grief and horror of the British Government when they discovered that we were raising the duties, not only; against the foreigner, but against some British goods as well.",61
386,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Doublin g them. - Mr DEAKIN - My right honourable friend insists that they never dreamt of. such a thing when we were in England. I have read what I said, he knows what my. honourable colleague said, and here is the President of the Board of Trade stating that after hearing us he was in no doubteither as to the verdict of our last elec-. tions, or as to the intention of this Government as to the Tariff now before us.",61
387,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"He would be. astonished to hear the honourable gentleman call that "" preference.""",61

I pointed, out that Mr Lloyd George had inverted, the order in which preference was-to come I saidThere are two issues. _ The first issue, as we 1 say I do not put it, was protection. Then Mr Lloyd'George, with sympathetic intuition and understanding, said, "" higher Tariff,"" and I went on to sayYes, because without the Tariff we do not get the opportunity of preference. Is this explicit enough? We mentioned preference second in order importance. In logical order, we say protecDaily tion and preferential trade.",61

Gazette, the ""Sea-green incorruptible"" English economic orthodoxy. Both these newspapers admit, in articles on the present Tariff, that, as framed and submitted here, it is exactly in consonance William Lyne and I stated in Great Britain.

409,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable memher must be wrong. I have no wish to delay at the Committee, but in the London Daily Telegraph of 30th August last there is a leading article which commencesOwing 'to the infinite ignorance with which the Australian Tariff has been discussed in most quarters, an1 the incorrigible partisanship, the criminal prejudice with which that measure has been attacked in other quarters, we are threatened with what would be no less than an Imperial disaster. It cannot be too clearly understood that this matter stands clean outside the fiscal;,controversy amongst ourselves. Canada gave preference .without entering into a- . bargain. Australia, in the same way, provided for special treatment elsewhere. . to the Mother Country without making, any lations or waiting for a return. In the"" second case, as' in the first, we were offered 'something and were asked for nothing. Whether the absowith lute, worth of the Commonwealth concession more or less-and it has been having than is generally thought-its . withdrawal would be a sheer, unmitigated loss to British trade. It would be impossible to harshly thefolly of those responsible for such a calamity. That very important organ of public opinion, The Standard, is equally emphatic. The National Review, among reviews,, with the Saturday Review, the Outlook', and other leading weeklies, take identically the same view. The Spectator seems the only exception.",62
410,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,The Saturday Review advocates protection.,63
411,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,Why not? suppose that my honourable and learned friend will go so far as to say that that puts it outside the pale of controversy. Even protectionist organs must be allowed to express opinions. .,63
412,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"No doubt; but I wish to qualify the reference to it as an authority, by showing that it has a bias for protection, out of which preference-springs ",63
413,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"We have been told that it is the protectionists of Great Britain, our friends there, who have been offended, and 'disappointed by the Tariff. In answer to that, I have shown that all - the leading newspapers, favoring Tariff reform, take the view which I have read, although the Times, in its customary judicial manner, balances both sides.",63
414,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,The honourable member has all the Conservative perverts in his favour.,63
415,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"On the other' side, men like Mr Asquith and Mr Lloyd George were perfectly logical in their attitude on the fiscal question. Mr - Asquith'.s Cobdenite principles are pure and absolute, with no admixture of protectionist admissions of the kind to which we are getting accustomed in this country. boldly, in effect, that,- whatever protectionist Tariff we may impose, it cannot injure the United Kingdom. Alluding to all protectionist Tariffs, foreign or colonial, he stated- , I assert these two propositions : that we stand .'better at this moment industrially in the Tariffprotected markets of Europe than any of the nations which have protected themselves inter se by retaliation. That, is one proposition. I say next, and I believe this to be equally true as a matter of ""fact, that our foreign trade has been - growing of late years in those very protected markets, even at a more rapid rate than it has : stipuThe kindest thing we can do, according to Mr Asquith and the gentlemen who agree him, is to raise our Tariff still higher. be The more, we raise it the faster will Brimuch better worth tish goods come in.",63
416,Mr THOMAS,BOARD OF TRADE,Ex-Seriato r Styles said stigmatize too that in another place.,63
417,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I have now shown that our friends, the Tariff reformers of Great Britain, are satisfied with our - proposals, and that their opponents, the Ministerial party,-are, according to their great spokes-men,:, either satisfied, or, at. ieast, . indifferentto the rates of duty which we .may choose to levy. What .then becomes of the plea of our Cobdenites - in Australia professing, to protest on behalf of the Cobdenites.in Great Britain, while these last I do not are saying openly . that there, can be no: thing .unsatisfactory to the Mother Country because of increasing Tariffs in .other parts of the world.",63
418,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,The more the people of other countries tie themselves up the better it is for those who remain free.,63
419,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Mr Asquith continued- . There is no Tariff wall that has yet been erected, even in America, which is the highest of .them all, which has succeeded in excluding, or ever will ' succeeV. in .excluding, British goods from a market, so long as British goods retain their pre-eminence in quality and adaptability to the needs of. mankind, and so long as. those needs remain a constant or"" growing quantity. You cannot do it, and no power ,on earth can do it. Then why are we asked to mingle, our tears with-those of the leader of the Opposition on account of our' Tariff increases?'",63
420,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,Grea t Britain has not to thank for her success those who have tried to shut her out of their markets. She does not thank them for trying to shut her out.,63
421,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,What I have read is Cobdenism pure and undefiled.,63
422,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,It ' is manliness. British He stated manufacturers do not crawl behind' barricades; they pierce them.,63
423,Mr HUGHES,BOARD OF TRADE,It seems to me very like Cobdenism in a trap and squealing ,63
424,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I admit the. manliness of .the position; but the exhaustion which the right honourable member's demand for sympathy may have caused will, I hope, be repaired, by the consolation extended to us by Mr Asquith. It may be said that the British Government is indifferent to preferences offered to it. ' - Mr Reid - No one would say that. . Mr DEAKIN - The right honourable 'member did not say it?",63
425,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"N a The more preference we give the better; but, in any case, - preference is a good thing.",64
426,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"M a n y influential newspapers have taken that ""view, and, on the point, I am happy to quote Mr Lloyd - George, who saidWe heartily concur in the view which has Jbeen presented by colonial Ministers that the Empire would be a gainer .if much of the products .now purchased from foreign countries - could be produced and purchased within the Empire. In Britain we have the greatest market - in the world. We are the greatest purchasers of produce raised or manufactured outside our own 'boundaries. A very large proportion, of this 'produce could very well be raised in the colonies, and any reasonable and workable plan that would tend to increase the proportion of the produce which is bought by . us from the colonies, and by the colonies from us and from each other, must necessarily enhance the resources of the Empire as a whole. That is what we have been Saying from the commencement. It is the position on which our preferential trade proposals are based. . Although Mr Lloyd George is a confirmed free-trader, making no departure from the faith, except, as I shall presently show, under certain possibilities, he ""grasps the fundamental principle underlying them, which is the employment of ' the forces of the Empire to develop its resources. He' said again that the preferential Tariffs already in force in other Dominions-and remember that they were made by raising their own Tariffs first, and then raising them more against the foreigner - were "" substantial concessions."" Canada has added to hers of late. Yet on page 386 he describes the preferences as ""enormous advantages."" On page'387 he says that Great Britain was grateful for the concessions,' and recognised the spirit of comradeship in which they were .made. 'Consequently, we have from the lips of - the President of the Board of Trade a sufficient statement of appreciation from .the British Government-b v free-traders, who - grant no preference, remember; by those who are usually supposed to attack.preference. We have .these frank admissions on the face of this report. Nevertheless in regard to ourselves there is a significant admission by' Mr Lloyd George on page 372, when he said I agree something seems to be wrong in the trade between our country and Australia, and I - should like to know something more about it. / It is no use concealing that fact. Thera is special justification, if one was sought for the policy which we' have adopted.",64
427,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,He has stated that we are adopting an exclusive policy. . Mr DEAKIN - This aiiotation extends back to a period beginning in 1901.,64
428,Mr SINCLAIR,BOARD OF TRADE,"Can the honourable gentleman tell us what Mr Lloyd George has said, about the preference in the Tariff now that it is submitted? ;",64
429,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I have seen no statement by Mr Lloyd George on that head. As his o.wn agent pointed out, between ' 1901 and 1.905 British imports to Australia fell by 13 per cent.; whilst foreign imports to Australia rose by 11 per cent.",64
430,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,It is a most extraordinary thing that from T902 to 1906 the .official - statement which Mr Knibbs has published shows an increase - in British imports. ' Mr DEAKIN - But .not in the percentages.,64
431,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"It shows an actual increase in value of ,£2,700,000.",64
432,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,My figures are taken from Board of Trade returns for the years I have named.,64
433,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"Percentage s prove wonderful things sometimes. ' Mr DEAKIN - At present we have no proposal for any kind of reciprocity from theMother Country, ancl consequently all the statements which - are to he found in these reports relating to reciprocal preference, no longer apply. We proffer a preference of :the 'same class and character as that already given by Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, but we have illustrations in the German and French 'Colonies of reciprocal, preferential trade in those countries. Algerine grain is admitted free to France, while foreign grain is' taxed at the rate of 12s. 3d. a quarter. In German ' Colonies German goods are exempted or placed on a lower scale. Mr Lloyd' George went so far as to say, .on page 393:The German railway is a bonus on exports; the British railway is a bonus to the foreign ex-' porter to this country. That is to Great Britain. He pointed but that this was a suicidal policy, and one into which it was necessary that his Government should inquire. . These are some of the illustrations presented to us of our neglected opportunities for reciprocity.",64
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,How can they correct that unless they first nationalize the railways ?,64
435,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"That is a large question. Another consequence of the neglect of reciprocity by the Mother Country is that Canada has now an intermediate Tariff, and, from a cablegram which has arrived during the last few days, we learn that negotiations are already on foot with Germany and Italy. This means that the British preference hitherto granted by Canada will be reduced by exactly the amount of that intermediate Tariff to those two countries-on e of them the most formidable competitor the Mother Country has. That is because Sir Will f r i d Laurier's proposal for reciprocal preference, - again repeated at the last Conference, has been declined.",65
436,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,"Oh , no.",65
437,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,"He has announced that policy on several occasions; for instance, in Paris two years ago.",65
438,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"E x a c t l y ; but it is consequence of the absence of reciprocal treatment. The Premier of Cape Colony has warned the British Government that the preferences granted there are being opposed reasons also. by a portion of the people whom he represents, until reciprocity is conceded.",65
439,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,Does the honourable gentlenot man intend to follow on his lines?,65
440,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Is that relevant? Are - we not proposing a preference this very moment? I am not, at this late hour, be led off the track.",65
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,BOARD OF TRADE,In view of a quotatablished tion from a statement by the honourable tive gentleman in London it is relevant.,65
442,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable member will have an opportunity of mentioning that statement, and, as we are in Committee, I can refer to it if necessary. have two out of the three Dominions which have already granted a preference, qualifysible ing it on account of the absence of reciprowhich city. But, for all that, we have the best of reasons for proposing a preference, and question with the trade question. a liberal one.",65
443,Mr CROUCH,BOARD OF TRADE,Without reciprocity.,65
444,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Yes . In the first place, we have the example which has been and again for many years. set by every self-governing DominionSouth Africa, Canada, and New Zealand And, in addition to that, we have this - that , whilst it is true that there is discrimination in our favour in the Mother whole. Country, there is a discrimination against us in some foreign countries. Mother Country gives us no greater adcommercial vantages than she gives to the foreigner; but in Germany today there is a distinct discrimination against certain Australian goods. Germany subsidizes steamers, which are not allowed to take meat and other of our raw products, to German markets. That discrimination is being adopted by Sweden and another European country, to some extent.",65
445,Mr FRAZER,BOARD OF TRADE,"Differentia l raihvay rates, too.",65
446,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Differentia l railway rates exist, too, particularly in Germany, There, and elsewhere, we are being subjected to so-called Customs - examina, tions, especially in regard to meat, which amount to absolute prohibition. ' That treatment is accorded to us by , foreign countries, from whom, at least, we have a right toexpect, not exceptional favour, but the same treatment as is accorded to other parts of the world; we have, therefore, another justification for extending to a the Mother Country, whose markets arealways open to us, better treatment than to those who employ their powers against us.",65
447,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Anc l for other,65
448,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"And for many other reasons. The greatest reason of all I do propose to enter upon because it really does not come within the scope of this debate. It seems to me that the relations between the Mother Country and the selfto governing Dominions are now in process of re-adjustment, and that this must go on"" until, on clearly thought-out arid well-eslines, we have adjusted our relaresponsibilities to each other. These are incidental to our approach towards national manhood and can no longer be put aside. But each requires to be dealt with as far as possible, 'on its own merits. To-night Now we the leader of the Opposition indulged in some persiflage with reference to the posdefence proposals of the Government, will be dealt with in clue course. But it is undesirable to confuse the defence It is true that we owe all he said, and more than, we can say, to the protection of the British flag ancl fleet. I have urged it"" again But this is to be met by the discharge.of our responsibility in connection with the defence of the fact Empire - That can partially be measured, no ancl ought to be related to defence as a In the same wav it appears to me that we require to consider trade in The respect to trade, and to adjust our mutual relations through the freedom of our markets, and share all - the advantages which' we can obtain from trade preferences. .. And so of the several other relations which we are now establishing, most of them imperfect and unformulated, and all of them open to definition and improvement. We can attempt to re-adjust them one by one. Among the greatest tasks whioh lie before us, so aoon as our hands are somewhat freed from the great and pressing questions of a local character that now confront us, must be the taking up in connection with local questions of the issues involved in our Imperial relations un- til these are fully and fairly balanced. The most encouraging feature is that, on the part of the British people and its Parliament as a whole, there is today an even more generous spirit than has obtained hitherto. In recent years there has been carping from some quarters at the Do minions for not having taken their share of the defence burden of the Empire. The last debate in the House of Commons, when that question was considered, was marked by a striking speech from the leader of the Opposition, Mr Balfour, with whicl '-""the Government immediately 'issociated U - ilf. This proceeded exactly on the same broad lines as the official statehere proposed. ment afterwards made to us by Lord Tweedmouth on behalf of the Government Although they felt that we had a responsiulity in connection with Imperial defence, hey left it to their self-governing Doninions to determine - for themselves how far, when, and to what extent, they ivould undertake to share that burden. Greater and more generous treatment there could not possibly be. .It is upon the senti.nent thus expressed and the practical developments that we may anticipate from it, that .we may confidently rely to bring us and keep us together in the future. £>o, though as to the Tariff we were met by Mr Asquith in an absolutely uncompromising manner-as my quotations will have shown - it was with the utmost courtesy and consideration, and an almost anxious desire to avoid trespassing, even for a moment, upon the privileges which had already been conceded to us. Having been met in that spirit, it seems to me ab' solutely. essential thjat the self-governing Dominions of their own accord should take into serious consideration their relations with' the Mother Country with a. view of discharging, according to their own consciences, and their consciousness of the fitness of things, their duty ' in regard to' the world-power under whose shelter we have grown up. Under its shelterour children must continue' wbile rising gradually to. the full measure of their responsibilities, within the Empire to the end of time. This digression is cognate, because it brings me back to the question of granting a preference to the United Kingdom at the present moment. That preference is due upon commercial and trade grounds alone. I .put it upon no higher grounds now, because it is to be dealt with as a matter of business. At the same time, 1 realise that considerations of business in this instance can be as much invested with spirit, sentiment, and aspiration as if there were no bargain. We bring forward our proposals with far greater ---ijarmfh, zeal, and hope for their future development than we would do if they merely represented a business transaction. They ought to represent ai contract of the character that a father would make with his son upon the latter entering into business on his own account. These arrangements are very different fromthose which they would make with outside competitors. Therefore, this Committee will do well for itself and well for the Commonwealth if it grants such a preference as is This particular schedule must be .of a temporary character, because, by carefully observing the effects of each of these concessions, we shall seek to discover, those which: are practicable, those which may be further extended, and those which should be withdrawn as having failed in their effect. Hereafter, in the light of experience, we shall be able to do what, at present, we can only attempt in a general and theoretical fashion, that is, to foster trade with the Mother. Country where it will best suit her development and that of the Commonwealth. I have put the matter in this way, although we are now viewing it from our own side of the shield. Despite the coldness with which our overtures for reciprocity, are being received in the Mother Country, I have by no means abandoned the opinion that it will not be long before we discover a change in the attitude lately adopted towards us. in this matter, and in the course Great Britain will be prepared to take. Her feeling for the Dominions oould not be warmer than it is at present, and, if I am not much mistaken, it will find adequate channels of expression before many, years. If asked why I venture this daring prophecy about a country with which I cam claim no immediate political acquaintance except that which has been derived during three short visits, I turn for one illustration to the impassioned language of Mr Lloyd George, than whom there is no more determined free-importer. Upon page 362 of the report of the Conference he saysA considerable !part of the surplus population of the United Kingdom, which now goes to foreign lands in search of a livelihood might then find it to its profit to pilch its tents somewhere under the nag, and the Empire would gain in riches of material and of men. We agree with our Colonial comrades, that all this is worth concerted effort,.even if that effort at the outset ccsts ua something. The federation of free Commonwealths is worth making some sacrifice for. One never knows when its strength may be essential to the great cause of human freedom, and that is priceless - I am nqt one of those who believe that the value of great ideals is to be assessed always by Board of Trade returns. In the main purpose, therefore, which has brought you and ourselves to this Conference, we agree. We differ only on ways and means. Every self-governing Dominion adopied a protective policy. Country alone stands aloof. If the words of Mr Lloyd George mean anything, this distinguished free-trader is prepared in the future, if he finds it necessary for the cohesion and development of the Empire, to make some sacrifices of his own opinions.",65
449,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Of principle ?,67
450,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,Not of principle; no sacrifice of principle is demanded.,67
451,Mr HUGHES,BOARD OF TRADE,Everybod y thinks that there are greater things than free-trade.,67
452,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Exactly ; there are greater things than any fiscal system, and the occasion to demonstrate it may arise. Certainly the cause of human freedom is priceless. If we are met in that spirit, many ways will be open to us in the future for many kinds of preference, not excluding Tariff preference.",67
453,Mr LIDDELL,BOARD OF TRADE,Would the Prime Minister mind reading the following sentence uttered by Mr Lloyd George?,67
454,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"Certainly We are prepared to make even greater sacrifices in the futufe, but we are convinced that' to tax the food of the people is to cast an undue share of the sacrifice on the poorest and most helpless part of our population, and that a tax on raw material would fetter us in the severe conflict we are waging with the most skilful trade competitors with whom any nation has ever yet been confronted. That would be a sacrifice which would diminish our power for further sacrifice, and we doubt the wisdom of making it. But I misread that statement altogether if the first is not the. major and permanent proposition, and the second the minor immediate qualification of Mr Lloyd George's present undoubted, firm, and clear conviction. Though he believes that sacrifices may be involved, he will be prepared to make them. He is against us at present; but not beyond hope.",67
455,Mr GLYNN,BOARD OF TRADE,He actually implores them not to attempt a change.,67
456,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"When we speak of the treatment which our goods have received in foreign ports, we have to remember that which was meted out to our ships, in , the Marshall Islands - a wrong wl?ich has remained unredressed ' even to this day, and for which a reasonable demand has been knocking in vain' at the door of the Chancellor at Berlin during the past eighteen months or two years-. How can foreign powers who take that course of action wonder if we extend prehas ferences elsewhere, and even impose disThe Mother abilities upon them? Before I conclude, may 1 remind the Committee-as my ho'nr orable colleague has done in detail-that the preference proposed at present covers £15,000,000 worth of British goods, upon some lines of which, at all events, decided inroads have been made? Within the last few days I have learned, from communications direct from several houses interested in importing leading lines, that deliberate attempts-quite proper and reasonable attempts in their way-ar e being made to undersell some of the staple 'products in which, today, Great Britain holds the pride of place, by a deliberate reduction in the ordinary prices of foreign goods brought here. I have had evidence placed in my hands relating to a particular line in which the foreigner has nofooting whatever, and in which hisprices have been reduced below the cost of production in order to - obtain our trade. Tbis is only one of several dangers. Whilst Great Britain now holds ,£15,000,000 worth of trade which will be affected by the proposed preferences; experience shows that she must not rely upon retaining it, and, therefore, any assistance we can render her must be counted. The preferences proposed also cover ,£9,000,000 worth of goods from foreign countries, over all of which the British importer will obtain an advantage. I propose only to mention the effect of our preference .upon seventy-six items which will be free to the United Kingdom, sixty-six of which .will be subject to a 5 per cent, duty' in the case of a foreigner, and ten of which will bear a 10 per cent duty. These affect nearly three and a half mil-' lion pounds worth of imports, of. which one and a half millions are foreign goods! Our preference protects the three ancl a half millions, ancl gives Great Britain the opportunity of competing for the one ancl a half millions a year. I am informed from a careful calculation that this will probably mean a trade of three millions to the Mother Country a.t once. I have taken out a list of some twenty odd lines in which foreign competition is or may become severe, and on.which this preference will afford considerable relief, but pass from this because, I have already exceeded the time for which I thought it would be possible for me to address the Committee, or for honourable members to consent to listen. I had intended to allude to another proposal which was received at the Conference-if I may use the expression-wit h scant courtesy. It was that, following the original suggestion of . Mr Hofmeyr, in 1.887, afterwards elaborated by Sir George Sydenham Clarke, there should be formed an Imperial fund, contributed to by all the Dominions, to be devoted to Imperial purposes. This fund was to be raised iby the imposition of a rate to be agreed upon, equivalent to a duty of 1 per cent, or less upon foreign imports-, together with a condition enabling a country which did not desire to impose such a duty to make its contribution in some other fashion. This proposal for the establishment of an Imperial to be devoted to the encouragement of quick and cheap communication between the mother land and her oversea Dominions, or cheaper freight for British manufacturers, and cheaper freight for our producers here, cheaper cable messages, the lowering of canal rates, or in any other manner in which we could increase trade and intercommunication between the parts of the Empire-this proposal was first scouted and then ridiculed. So strong . was the Little Englander spirit which, having banged the door on the policy of preference, bolted and barred it , then practically rejected a proposal for Imperial union for Imperial ends, only making at last a lame effort to frame a meaningless resolution which we declined to adopt.",67
457,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,I do.not think that the honourable gentleman should say that there was scant courtesy.,68
458,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The proposal received scant courtesy, though, indeed, it was not full y debated by those present. strong statements were uttered. [,78]",68
459,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Nothin g like what was said on the other side.,68
460,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"I know of nothing of this nature that was said on the other side, but that, is a detail.",68
461,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,They were very courteous.,68
462,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"This was a proposal that meant no fiscal sacrifice on the part of any country. It afforded an opportunity of proving, apart from fiscal relations, that if they were willing to meet us for mutual ends this was an opportunity of doing so.",68
463,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,BOARD OF TRADE,Was that matter proposed with the consent of the self governing Colonies?,68
464,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,It was supported by some only of the representatives.,68
465,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable gentleman will see the difference between a tax of 1 per cent, on the enormous imports of Great Britain and a similar tax on the imports of Australia.",68
466,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"But , as I pointed out at the time, the 1 per cent, was merely put as a figure for purposes of illustration. Anv other amount could have been substituted. Mine was a proposal for the establishment of some fund for Imperial fund purposes. The 1 per cent, was only suggested as a measure. Each Parliament would have controlled its own contribution. It was simply to be dedicated to Imperial purposes by each, so that there was no interference with its self government. There was also a debate on the proposal for an "" All Red Line""-a n old proposal known for ten or twenty vears in this country-whic h is now being discussed with warmth in Canada. I fear that the direct or indirect interest of Australia in such a line is at present small. Nevertheless we supported the proposal on Imperial grounds so far as it affected Canada. What helps one Dominion helps all"". A precedent of this kind would have been valuable to us. That is all the gain we should have had from it now. To send ships quicker to Canada than to New York would have been an Imperial gain. The British Government has already subsidized ships to New York, and', having done that, why not subsidize steamers to connect with their own Dominions, Tud make the route through Canada the quickest Some route to the East, and perhaps in the future to Australia?",68
467,Mr FISHER,BOARD OF TRADE,It was to prevent the Cunard Company from entering into the American syndicate that the British Governappeal. ment subsidized that line.,69
468,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"-That was one object, but if they could do that to. - f conditions why not then do the same in order to link up Canada with the Mother Country, and ultimately with New Zealand and Australia?",69
469,Mr HUGHES,BOARD OF TRADE,"Imperia l interests tuated them in the first instance, and might have actuated them in the second.",69
470,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"The honourable member has put it admirably. Canada has more claims on the Imperial Government than have, and has recently proved in conquiring, nexion with the Japanese and other treaties - matter s of great moment-that she is able to make her weight felt. She may succeed, having the immense assistance of the great Canadian Pacific Railway, with its enorbe mous resources in money and of influences behind it. That great company patriotiobject cally wields its influence to benefit Canada, being a very great land-holder in Canada. Hence the company's influence is used in helping Canada in matters of consequence. I am happy to read in the Canadian papers and reviews-in the Canadian Magazine, for instance-expression s of opinion deour cidedly encouraging from the Australian point of 'view. The Canadian Magazine rewith minds us that just the same cry as is being raised in some quarters against the Australian Tariff was raised against the Canadian Tariff when it was introduced. But it adds that Canada declined to be affected by outside interests which clashed with those of her own people, and Australia is urged to do the same. I find in the newspapers of Canada that, although they do not hope for much in the way of reciprocal arrangement with us, they neverthe two countries. the less point out that Australia is taking the course that Canada has already folthe lowed. When Australia makes her weight and influence felt, as Canada has done, within the Empire? it will be recognised in England that in building up our own resources in this counit try we are doing the best service we can the Empire. It is not for us to remain dependent, in these respects. It is for to blaze our own trail and follow it, taining a policy which will be beneficial to. the Mother Country, since it will enable us to go more efficiently to her aid in any hour of need. In regard to dealing with Australia, Australians are the best judges; if not, there are no others to whom we can . Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - No one has said the contrary.",69
471,Mr REID,BOARD OF TRADE,In what way is Australia meet one set interfered with ?,69
472,Mr DEAKIN,BOARD OF TRADE,"In no way directly, but we are at present being subjected to certain criticisms in the House, and by the foreign trade party outside, who object to Ausactralia judging for herself; urging that she should be governed by other considerations. To these, with apologies for having detained the Committee so long, I make this brief replv. The present proposals for preference, incomplete as .they we are, and immature as they must be, relike other political proposals, to be adapted from time to time to circumstances, were the best that could be made just now. They are an instalment of preferences which, if adopted, can and will made more effective as time goes on. I trust and believe it will be seen that the real we have in view is to adopt a distinctly different line of conduct towards the Mother Country, and to approach her commerce in a distinctly different spirit, with a warmth of blood begotten of kinship and community of interest such as no other power can claim. All. questions affecting trading and commercial relations with the Mother Country must be approached the sentiment of the family, otherwise now such schemes will have been launched in vain. I confess that this schedule is imperfect-it is temporary-as all fiscal proposals must be, but believe it will accomplish much more than is anticipated. The leader of the Opposition today, in one of his passages, pointed out that the increased trade daily between independent powers such as the United States and England had made for a peace, harmony, and strength between If that be so, how much more will increased trade between Mother Country and her Dominions make for increased harmony, strength, and peace I accept the right honourable' gentleman's argument, and apply here. In another glowing passage he refor ferred with disdain to the.impossible ideal of making Australia a self-contained counus trv. He said that it was folly to hope or mainbelieve that it would be well for Great Britain to be self-contained. There is another ideal which includes both. We are confident that the Empire, if not self-sufficing, can approach more nearly to that condition than any other power in the world. Every climate, every soil, every source of wealth, every means of strength and greatness are already within its bounds.",69
