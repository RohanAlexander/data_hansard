FUTURE FUND BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
7,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Future Fund Bill 2005 implements another important part of the government's long-term fiscal strategy. This is a bill which will put in place arrangements for future generations to allow them to deal with the massive changes that the ageing of the population will bring, from a much stronger financial position. When this government was elected in 1996, Australian government net debt stood at $96 billion. We are forecasting that by 30 June 2006, after 10 years of coalition government, we will have reduced that debt by around $90 billion and, by doing so, released more than $6 billion a year from ‘dead' interest payments to fund priority areas like health, education and national security. With net debt now under control, we are turning our attention to addressing the largest single liability on the government's balance sheet: unfunded public sector superannuation. As at 30 June 2005, unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities stood at around $90 billion, and are forecast to grow to around $140 billion by 2020. The Future Fund will strengthen the Australian government's long-term financial position and ensure we are better able to meet the challenges of an ageing population without raising taxes or driving the budget into deficit. The Future Fund will reduce calls on the budget in future years and free up resources at a time when the 2002 Intergenerational report tells us significant pressures are expected to emerge. The Future Fund will be invested with the aim of accumulating financial assets sufficient to offset the government's unfunded superannuation liabilities by 2020. The bill provides for seed capital of $18 billion to be transferred to the fund in 2005-06. The government will also contribute future realised surpluses and proceeds from asset sales to the fund. To ensure that the fund grows over time the earnings of the fund will be reinvested and the assets held by the Future Fund will be quarantined from the rest of the budget. Notably, New Zealand, Ireland, France and Canada all have similar strategies in place and in none of those other national funds are the returns on investment allowed to be siphoned off to fund pet projects of the government of the day. This will also be the case for the Future Fund. The fund will only be drawn upon at the earlier of 2020 or a time when an independent actuary determines that the fund's assets are sufficient to offset the unfunded part of the government's accrued superannuation liabilities. Queensland has already fully funded its superannuation schemes. Other states and territories have put in place arrangements to fund past service liabilities with the aim of achieving fully funded schemes over the next 30 to 40 years. The Commonwealth is now, for the first time, making proper financial provision for its liability. An appropriately qualified Board of Guardians, chaired by Mr David Murray, will manage the fund. Mr Murray is a well known figure in Australia and with 13 years experience as CEO of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is an outstanding choice to lead the Future Fund through its inception and early years of operation. The board will be responsible for deciding how to invest the Future Fund. By creating an independent Board of Guardians with powers protected by legislation, the government is putting in place robust measures to guard the fund from being raided by any future government. The assets and the earnings of the fund will be locked away, to grow over time, and will be directed to the purpose for which it has been created. When the fund is eventually drawn down to pay superannuation liabilities-some of which are accruing now-taxpayers will face a lighter burden than would have been the case if this fund had not been established. The fund represents a sensible financial policy now for the benefit of future generations. The fund will be needed in the future because we know that future generations will have the costs of the ageing of the population on their hands within 20 years time. The fact that the current generation is funding its liabilities, and also funding liabilities accrued in the past, will give future taxpayers a much better chance to cope with these challenges. The Board of Guardians will be assisted by a new statutory agency, the Future Fund Management Agency. The agency will implement the decisions of the board and undertake the associated operational activities but investment activities will primarily be outsourced to private sector funds managers. The primary functions of the agency will be to provide administrative and policy support to the board and manage the relationships between the board and investment managers such as funds managers, transition managers and custodians. The government's clear view is that detailed investment decisions should be left to the board. The bill provides a framework for these decisions by outlining an investment mandate to guide the board and setting the broad parameters within which the fund can operate. The government's initial investment mandate will set a benchmark for long-term returns on the fund and will include any restrictions on the investment of the fund. The general view of the government is that restrictions should only be applied where there are sound policy or national interest reasons to do so. The Future Fund is a financial asset fund. This means that the board will be able to invest in a wide range of financial assets including shares and bonds, but it cannot invest in non-financial assets such as direct holdings of property and infrastructure. However, the board will be able to gain exposure to these asset classes through pooled investment vehicles. Under the external reporting standards which the budget is prepared on, transactions involving financial assets do not have an impact on the budget bottom line. The provision of a broad investment mandate does not in any way compromise the independence of the board to deliver the government's desired risk and return objectives. The bill sets out a transparent process by which the board's view on the investment mandate is tabled in parliament. The bill allows the board to take a long-term view of the investment strategy and gives them the investment powers to maximise the returns on the fund over the long term. This is broadly consistent with the approach taken by national funds in New Zealand, Ireland, France and Canada. The framework ensures that the management of the fund will remain at arm's length from the government and that the board is accountable for the performance of the fund. Full details on the establishment of the fund, board and agency are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I present the memorandum and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (ANTI-AVOIDANCE) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
8,Mr RUDDOCK,BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment (Anti-avoidance) Bill 2005 is the latest in a series of amendments introduced by this government to address practices which undermine the integrity of the bankruptcy system. This bill contains amendments designed to strengthen existing anti-avoidance provisions in the Bankruptcy Act 1966. Those provisions allow the trustee to recover property disposed of prior to bankruptcy or owned by a third person but acquired by that person using the bankrupt's resources. It is possible for bankrupts to deliberately avoid these provisions by, for instance, transferring assets to family members or close associates when insolvency is looming and then purposely delaying the commencement of the bankruptcy. It is also possible for people approaching insolvency to build up wealth in the lead-up to bankruptcy in the name of a person who allows the bankrupt to enjoy assets acquired with that wealth. This bill will amend the claw-back provisions in the Bankruptcy Act by: (a) increasing the claw-back period in section 120 from two to four years for transfers of property by a bankrupt to a related entity for less than market value; (b) introducing a rebuttable presumption of insolvency for the purposes of sections 120 and 121 where a bankrupt has failed to keep proper books, accounts and records; and (c) providing that a transfer made to defeat creditors is void against the bankruptcy trustee under section 121 if it was reasonable for the transferee to infer that the bankrupt's main purpose in transferring the property was to defeat creditors. The bill also includes some minor amendments to remove possible doubts about the operation of the claw-back provisions. Significant amendments will also be made to division 4A of part VI of the act. These will remove current difficulties in applying these provisions to property held by a natural person. The amendments will allow the court to make orders in relation to property or money of a natural person where during the period of up to five years prior to bankruptcy: - the person acquired an estate in property as a direct or indirect result of financial contributions made by the bankrupt during that period; or the value of the person's interest in particular property increased as a direct or indirect result of financial contributions made by the bankrupt during the period; and - the bankrupt used or derived (whether directly or indirectly) a benefit from the property during the relevant period. The time periods in division 4A of part VI will be aligned with the amendments to section 120. That is, the trustee will be able to recover property acquired by the person or the increase in the value of property held by the person in the two-year period prior to bankruptcy or four years if the person is related to the bankrupt. In both cases, the period can be extended to up to five years if the bankrupt was insolvent at the relevant time. There will also be rebuttable presumption that the bankruptcy was insolvent if, at the time, they had not kept proper books and records. A further amendment contained in the bill will allow transcripts and notes from examinations under sections 77C and 81 of the act to be used in proceedings under the act, regardless of whether the person examined is a party to the proceedings. The proposed amendment is consistent with the modern trend to allow relevant and probative material to be considered in proceedings, rather than having artificial limits on the evidence that may be adduced. In many cases, use of the transcript will be an efficient way to get straight to the major issues and evidence in the proceedings. These amendments will assist trustees particularly in relation to proceedings to recover property for the benefit of creditors. The amendments to be made by this bill have been developed following extensive public consultation. They will provide an appropriate balance between the rights of individuals to organise their affairs as they see fit and the rights of creditors to be paid. The amendments will also ensure that our bankruptcy system is protected from abuse. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Andrews, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
9,Mr ANDREWS,OHS AND SRC LEGISLATION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.27 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This OHS and SRC Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 implements the government's response to a recommendation of the Productivity Commission in its report National Workers' Compensation and Occupational Health and Safety Frameworks of June 2004. In that report, the Productivity Commission recommended extending coverage under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 to eligible corporations which are licensed under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The SRC Act establishes a premium based workers compensation scheme for Commonwealth employees but also enables former Commonwealth authorities and eligible private sector corporations to obtain a licence to self-insure under the scheme. The OH&S(CE) Act provides the legal basis for the protection of the health and of Commonwealth employees. It does not, however, apply to former Commonwealth authorities and private sector corporations that become licensed self-insurers. At present, therefore, former Commonwealth authorities and licensed private sector corporations operate under the Commonwealth workers compensation regime but are covered by state and territory occupational health and safety legislation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. This makes unnecessary difficulties for many firms to develop a national approach to occupational health and safety and may result in the requirement that they comply with eight separate and quite distinct occupational health and safety jurisdictions. The amendments in this bill will provide all licensees under the SRC Act with the benefits of operating under one occupational and health and safety scheme together with integrated prevention, compensation and rehabilitation arrangements. This will produce better health and safety outcomes all round, including for the employees of the affected bodies. The amendments will enable greater coordination and feedback between the workers compensation and occupational health and safety arrangements. The time and resources currently expended in addressing jurisdictional and boundary disputes caused by multiple compliance regimes can be redirected to achieve overall efficiencies. Importantly, savings can be devoted to further improving health and safety at the workplace. The bill contains other amendments. The name of the act is being changed to the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 to reflect its extended application beyond Commonwealth workplaces. Consequential amendments are being made to other acts which contain references to the Occupational safety Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act to reflect the new name of the act. The remaining amendments are mainly technical in nature. Some amendments correct a drafting oversight in amendments to the SRC Act and the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act made in 2001, which rationalised scheme funding and placed the provisions for regulatory contributions for both acts in the SRC Act. Because of differences in the definitions of ‘Commonwealth authority' in both acts, a regulatory contribution towards the costs of administering the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act cannot currently be charged to some Commonwealth authorities covered by that act but not by the SRC Act. The amendments will correct this oversight and validate payments already made for the year 2002-03. The 2001 amendments also rationalised the licensing arrangements under the SRC Act and introduced one generic licence. Some licensees were charged, and paid, licence fees for the year 2002-03 under the wrong licence provisions. While the amounts were later recalculated under the correct provisions and reconciled, the amendments will also validate those licence fees as originally paid. I commend the bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. AUSTRALIAN SPORTS ANTI-DOPING AUTHORITY BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Andrews, for Mr MCGauran, and read a first time. Second Reading",22
10,Mr ANDREWS,OHS AND SRC LEGISLATION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.32 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill establishes the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority as the focal point for Australia's continuing campaign against doping in sport. Australia is acknowledged internationally as being at the forefront of the fight against doping in sport, balancing a ‘tough on drugs' approach with ensuring that all athletes are treated fairly and that athletes' tected. Through its Tough on Drugs in Sport strategy, launched in May 1999 in the leadup to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the government has ensured that Australia has a robust antidoping framework that is world's best practice. The government's unrelenting pursuit of this strategy has meant that all major Australian sporting organisations are now compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code. In the 2004 election policy Building Australian Communities Through Sport, the government committed to strengthening its Tough on Drugs in Sport strategy through enhancing the investigation of alleged doping violations and establishing clear and consistent arrangements for the hearing of doping in sport matters. As part of that commitment, on 23 June 2005, the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator the Hon. Rod Kemp, announced that the government will establish a new Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) to investigate allegations of antidoping rule violations and present doping cases at hearings. ASADA would assume the existing drug testing, education and advocacy functions of the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) and include the current Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee. The bill before the House delivers on that commitment. It sets out a new, more robust regime for responding to alleged antidoping rule violations in Australia through a new, dedicated agency. The ASADA Bill empowers ASADA to investigate all allegations of antidoping rule violations outlined in the World Anti-Doping Code and present cases against alleged offenders at the international Court of Arbitration for Sport and other sports tribunals. The bill provides ASADA with the followrights are proing functions: - Undertake antidoping testing, investigations and presentations at sport tribunal hearings functions; - Determine mandatory antidoping provisions to be included in Australian government funding agreements with sports; - Advise the Australian Sports Commission, as the government's principal sports funding body, of the performance of sports in observing these requirements; - Provide education for Australian athletes and support personnel in relation to antidoping matters; - Support and encourage research into antidoping matters; - Encourage antidoping initiatives by the states and territories and cooperate in carrying out these initiatives; - Provide antidoping and other services under contract; - Make resources available to the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee for the performance of its functions; and - Provide advice to the responsible minister on matters relating to these functions The establishment of ASADA will mean that sports, athletes and the public can have complete confidence that doping allegations will be investigated and pursued in an independent, robust and transparent way. ASADA's establishment represents the next step forward in strengthening Australia's already world-class antidoping regime. In the event of serious allegations of doping infractions by athletes, Australia will have in place an integrated system to respond vigorously from the outset-from collecting, preserving and analysis of evidence to making recommendations on its findings and carrying a case to a tribunal hearing if required. The creation of ASADA will enhance Australia's compliance with the World AntiDoping Code and will strategically implement the UNESCO International Convention Against Doping In Sport, once ratified by Australia. The creation of ASADA, more broadly, represents a tough response to doping in sport and a response that treats all athletes fairly. The ASADA Bill sets out the broad requirements under which ASADA will exercise its functions. Detailed protocols and procedures for the exercise of ASADA's functions will be contained in a National Anti-Doping Scheme, which will be a legislative instrument developed alongside the ASADA Bill, to be tabled in parliament. The National Anti-Doping Scheme will reflect the provisions of the two major international instruments on antidoping to which Australia is a party. It will be consistent with the mandatory provisions of the World AntiDoping Code and will implement the UNESCO convention, once ratified. The scheme will contain: - Antidoping rules applicable to athletes and support personnel, including details of antidoping rule violations and the consequences of infractions; - Protocols for ASADA drug testing procedures; - Protocols and procedures governing ASADA investigations; - Protocols for ASADA to establish a register of its findings, and to advise sporting organisations and athletes of its findings; and - Protocols for ASADA's presentation of doping cases at sports tribunal hearings. - The scheme will set out the obligations for Australian sporting organisations in the following areas: - Promoting athlete compliance with the scheme; - Referring violations of the scheme to ASADA; - Assisting ASADA in the course of its investigations; - Taking action in response to ASADA finding a violation has occurred; and - ASADA's role in hearings and appeals for doping cases. - The scheme will also authorise ASADA to: - Monitor the compliance of sports and sports administration bodies (including the ASC) with these obligations; - Notify the Australian Sports Commission in regard to such compliance; and - Publish reports about the extent of compliance. As a condition of any funding from the government, sports will be required to adopt the scheme as part of their antidoping policies, which will include submitting to the antidoping jurisdiction of ASADA. This carries with it requirements for sports to ensure that their athletes and support personnel cooperate with ASADA officials in carrying out its testing, investigations and presentations at hearings functions. Sports will also be required, as a condition of the scheme, to accept any findings by the new authority that an individual has committed a doping offence and apply the appropriate penalty. The bill also contains provisions facilitating the exchange of sensitive information between ASADA, the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police in regard to the use and importation of prohibited substances. The bill also provides protection from civil actions to ASADA members, staff and those giving information to ASADA for any act undertaken in good faith during an ASADA investigation. These provisions, along with the obligations imposed on sports through the contractual arrangements with the government, will put in place a system that will provide ASADA with the powers and ability to carry out its functions to the fullest extent. In framing the proposed ASADA legislation, the issue of safeguarding athletes' rights was a prime consideration. Accordingly, the ASADA Bill attaches strict conditions to the receipt and disclosure of sensitive information from Customs, the Australian Federal Police and other law enforcement bodies. For example, disclosure must not contravene the terms of Customs initial disclosure to ASADA, and sports in receipt of such information must give an undertaking that any use of the information on its part must be for antidoping purposes and will not occur in a way prejudicial to the subject of the information. It also stipulates the rights that athletes will have in relation to ASADA decisions. Athletes will have access to established external review mechanisms in relation to any ASADA investigation (including a test or the testing process) including the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Further, the bill contains appropriate privacy safeguards for athletes and sporting support personnel-the Privacy Act 1988 will apply to ASADA's advocacy, education, drug testing, investigative and reporting functions, and any other operations where ASADA is required to collect and deal with sensitive information. Taken together, these provisions will continue to ensure that athletes' rights are protected under the new antidoping regime. The World Anti-Doping Agency, the body responsible for coordinating the international effort against doping in sport, has welcomed the entry of ASADA as the new key body in Australia's antidoping framework. As host of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in March 2006, Australia now has an opportunity to showcase internationally its commitment to the fight against drugs in sport and to demonstrate to athletes who might be inclined to cheat that they face a strong and systematic response once detected. The establishment of ASADA represents a significant enhancement to a Tough on Drugs in Sport strategy that is already worldleading. ASADA will ensure that Australia remains a leader in the international fight against drugs in sport. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. AUSTRALIAN SPORTS ANTI-DOPING AUTHORITY (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Andrews, for Mr MCGauran, and read a first time. Second Reading",24
11,Mr ANDREWS,OHS AND SRC LEGISLATION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.42 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill contains transitional provisions and consequential amendments to a number of acts related to the establishment of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) by the Australian Sports AntiDoping Authority Bill 2005 that I have just introduced. The detailed provisions of the bill will ensure that the new ASADA is able to operate effectively. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 6) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Brough, and read a first time. Second Reading",27
12,Mr BROUGH,OHS AND SRC LEGISLATION,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.43 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia's taxation system. Amendments contained in this bill ensure that parents who work fewer than 15 hours a week continue to be eligible for the childcare tax rebate. To be eligible for the rebate, families must receive child-care benefit for approved care and meet the child-care benefit work-training or study test. The Welfare to Work package introduces a requirement that a taxpayer must work, train, or study for at least 15 hours a week-or 30 hours over two weeks-to meet the child-care benefit worktraining or study test. Taxpayers will not need to satisfy the new hourly requirements to receive the child-care tax rebate. Taxpayers will continue to be eligible for the rebate if they receive child-care benefit for approved care and work, train or study at some time in the week. This bill also gives effect to the government's announcement that it will amend the income tax law to ensure certain not-forprofit organisations are not subject to tax on mutual receipts as a result of the Coleambally Federal Court decision handed down on 7 September 2004. Under the mutuality principle, membership subscriptions and receipts from other mutual dealings with members are not liable for income tax. The court's decision, which held that the principle of mutuality cannot apply where an organisation is prevented from distributing to members, would potentially affect between 200,000 to 300,000 notfor-profit entities including clubs, professional organisations and some friendly societies. The government's amendment today restores the long standing benefits of the mutuality principle that applied prior to the Coleambally decision. Further refinement to the consolidation regime is also contained in this bill. The amendment ensures the method for calculating the rate at which the head company of a consolidated group can recoup a joining entity's losses, operates as intended. It allows consolidated groups to round the available fraction for a bundle of losses to the first non-zero digit, if rounding to three decimal places would result in an available fraction of nil. The amendment improves the consolidation regime by ensuring that the available fraction rounding rules do not prevent consolidated groups from being able to deduct losses held by a joining entity at the joining time. Also, this bill amends the lists of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Deductible gift recipient status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. Finally, amendments are made to the medical expenses offset to ensure that solely cosmetic procedures are no longer eligible expenses for the purposes of this offset. Specifically, solely cosmetic procedures are excluded from the medical expenses offset under two broad categories: general medical expenses and general dental expenses. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend this bill and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Gavan O'Connor) adjourned.

(3) Division 4 deals with notification requirements, the lodgement of notices with the Employment Advocate and the enforcement of the new transitional employer's obligations by pecuniary penalties. (4) Division 5 allows regulations to be made to deal with other transmission of business issues in relation to transitional awards. 72C Definitions In this Part: business being transferred has the meaning given by subclause 72D(2). Court means the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Magistrates Court. new transitional employer has the meaning given by subclause 72D(1). old transitional employer has the meaning given by subclause 72D(1). operational reasons has the meaning given by subsection 170CE(5D). time of transmission has the meaning given by subclause 72D(3). transferring transitional employee has OF the meaning given by clauses 72E and 72F. transmission period has the meaning given by subclause 72D(4). Division 2-Application of Part 72D Application of Part (1) This Part applies if a person (the new transitional employer) becomes the successor, transmittee or assignee of the whole, or a part, of a business of another person (the old transitional employer). (2) The business, or the part of the business, to which the new transitional employer is successor, transmittee or assignee is the business being transferred for the purposes of this Part. (3) The time at which the new transitional employer becomes the successor, transmittee or assignee of the business being transferred is the time of transmission for the purposes of this Part. (4) The period of 12 months after the time of transmission is the transmission period for the purposes of this Part. 72E Transferring transitional employees (1) A person is a transferring transitional employee for the purposes of this Part if: (a) the person is employed by the old transitional employer immediately before the time of transmission; and (b) the person: (i) ceases to be employed by the old transitional employer; and (ii) becomes employed by the new transitional employer in the business being transferred; within 2 months after the time of transmission. (2) A person is also a transferring transitional employee for the purposes of this Part if: (a) the person is employed by the old transitional employer at any time within the period of 1 month before the time of transmission; and (b) the person's employment with the old transitional employer is terminated by the old transitional employer before the time of transmission for genuine operational reasons or for reasons that include genuine operational reasons; and (c) the person becomes employed by the new transitional employer in the business being transferred within 2 months after the time of transmission. (3) In applying clause 72F and Division 3 in relation to a person who is a transferring transitional employee under subclause (2) of this clause, a reference in those provisions to a particular state of affairs existing immediately before the time of transmission is to be read as a reference to that state of affairs existing immediately before the person last ceased to be an employee of the old transitional employer. 72F Transferring transitional employees in relation to particular transitional award (1) A transferring transitional employee is a transferring transitional employee in relation to a particular transitional award if: (a) the transitional award applied to the transferring transitional employee's employment with the old transitional employer immediately before the time of transmission; and (b) when the transferring transitional employee becomes employed by the new transitional employer, the nature of the transferring transitional employee's employment with the new transitional employer is such that the transitional award is capable of applying to employment of that nature. (2) The transferring transitional employee ceases to be a transferring transitional employee in relation to the transitional award if: (a) the transferring transitional employee ceases to be employed by the new transitional employer after the time of transmission; or (b) the nature of the transferring transitional employee's employment with the new transitional employer changes so that the transitional award is no longer capable of applying to employment of that nature; or (c) the transmission period ends. Division 3-Transmission of transitional award 72G Transmission of transitional award New transitional employer bound by transitional award (1) If: (a) the old transitional employer was, immediately before the time of transmission, bound by a transitional award that regulated the employment of employees of the old transitional employer; and (b) there is at least one transferring transitional employee in relation to the transitional award; and (c) but for this clause, the new transitional employer would not be bound by the transitional award in relation to the transferring transitional employees in relation to the transitional award; and (d) the new transitional employer is a transitional employer at the time of transmission; the new transitional employer is bound by the transitional award by force of this clause. Note 1: Paragraph (c)-the transitional award might already bind the new transitional employer, for example, because the new transitional employer happens to be a respondent to the transitional award. Note 2: The new transitional employer must notify transferring transitional employees and lodge a copy of a notice with the Employment Advocate clauses 72J and 72K). Period for which new transitional employer remains bound (2) The new transitional employer remains bound by the transitional award, by force of this clause, until whichever of the following first occurs: (a) the transitional award is revoked; (b) there cease to be any transferring transitional employees in relation to the transitional award; (c) the new transitional employer ceases to be bound by the transitional award under Part 5; (d) the transmission period ends; (e) the transitional period ends. New transitional employer bound only in relation to employment of transferring transitional employees (3) The new transitional employer is bound by the transitional award, by force of this clause, only in relation to the employment of employees who are transferring transitional employees in relation to the transitional award. Commission order (4) Subclauses (1) and (2) have effect subject to any order of the Commission. (5) To avoid doubt, the Commission cannot make an order under subclause (4) that would have the effect of extending the transmission period. Old transitional employer's rights and obligations that arose before time of transmission not affected (6) This clause does not affect the rights and obligations of the old transitional employer that arose before the time of transmission. 72H Interaction rules Transmitted award (1) This clause applies if subclause 72G(1) applies to a transitional award (the transmitted award). (see Division 3 pre-reform certified agreement (2) If: (a) the new transitional employer is bound by a Division 3 pre-reform certified agreement (within the meaning of Schedule 14); and (b) a transferring transitional employee in relation to the transmitted award was not bound by that certified agreement immediately before the time of transmission; and (c) that certified agreement would, but for this subclause, apply to the transferring transitional employee's employment with the new transitional employer and would prevail over the transmitted award to the extent of any inconsistency with the transmitted award; the transmitted award, to the extent to which it relates to the transferring transitional employee's employment with the new transitional employer, prevails over that certified agreement to the extent of any inconsistency with that certified agreement.

13,Mr ANDREWS,SMALL BUSINESSES,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.47 am)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. On Friday, 2 December the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 passed the Senate with a number of amendments. These amendments must now be considered by the House. The government has always maintained that it is open to sensible amendments that do not undermine the integrity of the Work Choices bill. The amendments enhance the Work Choices bill, mostly through technical changes, with some minor changes to policy. A number of sensible changes were suggested as part of the Senate inquiry into the bill, which reported on 22 November 2005. The government took on board these sensible amendments and moved a series of government amendments in the Senate. These amendments are now before the House for consideration. The minor policy amendments will, firstly, ensure that people who are employed for a specific number of hours a week will be paid at least for those hours each week, irrespective of whether the actual number of hours worked each week fluctuates. Secondly, the amendments guarantee that employees who are engaged for a fixed number if: of hours accrue annual and personal or carers leave based on those fixed number of hours, regardless of the number of hours actually worked in a given week. Thirdly, the amendments protect award provisions relating to the timing of payment for awardcovered employees. Fourthly, they guarantee that employees will be paid at least fortnightly in arrears, unless they are covered by an Australian pay and classification scale or an arrangement or agreement that provides for frequency of payment. Fifthly, they proDivi- vide for the averaging of hours only by way of an award agreement or contract. Sixthly, the amendments change the medical certificate requirements for personal leave. Seventhly, there is a provision that allows employees to provide a statutory declaration as an alternative to a medical certificate where it is not practical to provide a medical certificate. Eighthly, the amendments provide employees with the right to refuse to work on a public holiday on reasonable grounds. Further amendments extend the notional expiry date for union greenfields agreements to five years, clarify that the only circumstance in which accepting an AWA as a condition of employment is not duress is when it applies to prospective employees, clarify that the 90-day notice of the unilateral termination of an agreement can be given only after nominal expiry date of the agreement, introduce a regulation-making power to widen scope for awards and agreements to override state and territory laws in relation to ticeships and traineeships-the provisions do not currently refer specifically to traineeships-treat traineeships on the same basis as apprenticeships, prevent companies restructuring to have fewer than 100 employees to avoid unfair dismissal laws based on section 50 of the Corporations Law, extend the time for election to proceed to bring court proceedings for an unlawful termination matter from seven days to 28 days to accommodate the new $4,000 financial assistance scheme and maintain existing protections for outworkers to prevent exploitation of this vulnerable group of workers. The Senate also accepted one nongovernment amendment to the Work Choices bill-the Australian Democrats amendment R17A-which aligned the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's obligations in relation to equal remuneration with those of the Australian Fair Pay Commission. The government will be accepting this amendment, which was in the same terms as an amendment the government had proposed. As a consequence, the government proposes to accept all amendments to the Work Choices bill made by the Senate. The bulk of the substantive amendments made by the bill will commence on proclamation. Schedule 3, which relates to school based apprentices and trainees, will commence on royal assent. So too will provisions dealing with redundancy pay for small business employers. The Australian Fair Pay Commission will also be able to begin consultations about wages issues from royal assent. Schedule 4, part 1, which permits the making of regulations for transitional and consequential amendments, will also commence on royal assent to allow for preparations to be made for the introduction of the new system. All other schedules will comapprenmence on a date fixed by proclamation, which will occur during the course of the first half of 2006. Ten years ago the union movement and the Labor Party predicted that the Workplace Relations Act would drive down wages, destroy working conditions, increase unemployment and slash working conditions. How wrong they were. They were wrong when they said this in 1996 and they are still wrong in 2005. The passage of this bill sets the scene for the implementation of significant reforms to the workplace relations system, such as moving towards a national workplace scheme. These reforms will give Australia a workplace relations system designed for the 21st century-a system which looks to the future, not to the past. (Extension of time granted) Contrary to what the critics suggest, the bill will not usher in a system that exposes employees to exploitation. Rather, the bill as amended will make the workplace relations system fairer. Fairness does not require complexity. In fact, fairness is impeded by complexity. Fairness is best ensured by a system which is easily understood by both employers and employees-when they know what they have in the system. Work Choices will put in place a clear set of minimum wages and conditions and a less confusing and bureaucratic process for agreement making in the workplace. The government will enshrine in law minimum conditions of employment, ensure that award wages and basic working conditions, including the right to be represented by a union, are protected by law, and that there are comprehensive transitional arrangements to assist employers and employees in the move to a new system. The government wants to give more Australians a chance at a job and to drive down our unemployment rate even further. We are determined to put economic reality back at the centre of workplace regulation, where it should have been all along, and give more Australians the choice to participate in Ausernment tralia's workplaces. It is important to note that even after these reforms are implemented, Australia's workplace relations system will still be more regulated than that New Zealand or the United States. Importantly, what this bill does is provide a framework to improve productivity, encourage participation, create more jobs and secure a prosperous future for Australia. Work Choices does this by accommodating the greater demand for choice and flexibility in our workplaces. It continues a process of evolution begun over a decade ago towards a system that trusts Australian men and women to make their own decisions in the workplace and to do so in a way which best suits them. This bill makes the necessary changes to move away from an outdated and inefficient system that no longer meets the needs of a modern Australian economy. For it is a strong economy which enables employers to pay their workers more, it is a strong economy that reduces unemployment and it is a strong economy that delivers, just as it has done over the last decade, more jobs and higher wages for all Australians. Work Choices is founded on the principle that the best arrangements are those developed by employees and employers at the workplace. The government recognises that the time to turn this idea into law and move to a better system is now. I commend the amendments to the House.",104
14,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SMALL BUSINESSES,"I move: That in place of Senate amendments 5 to 328, the following amendment be made: Schedule 1, omit the Schedule, and, as a consequence, schedules 1A, 2, 3, 3A, 4 and 5 be omitted. The House should adopt my amendment because the adoption of the amendment kills the bill. No tinkering amendments-even if there are 330 or 340 of them-by the govcan rescue this bill. The Prime Minister said to his party room yesterday that the government had lost some bark so far as public opinion was concerned as a result of of these measures. Well, you might think you are losing bark now, but we will take an axe to these proposals and we will take an axe to the Liberal Party. When we are elected to government we will kill this bill and replace it with a system that is underpinned by fairness, that treats people with civility and dignity and makes sure that there are sensible safety nets, minimum standards and a strong independent umpire. We will do things the Australian way, not the un-Australian way that the Prime Minister is proceeding with. We heard nothing about these proposals in the run-up to the last election, but we will hear plenty about them in the run-up to the next. When did we start to hear about these proposals? We started to hear about these proposals when John Howard, the Prime Minister, realised that he had total control of the parliament-that he had all power under the sun. Where did he revert to when he discovered that? He reverted to the John Howard Jobsback October 1992 policy. That Jobsback policy, released in October 1992, was resoundingly rejected by the Australian public because it was a massive attack on living standards and a massive attack on the Australian way of life. That Jobsback policy became the briefing instructions for the 1,500 pages of legislation and associated material that we now find. You will find a lot in the 1,500 pages and the 534,000 words in this legislation and its associated materials, but there are two things you will not find: you will not find a guarantee that individual Australian employees will not be worse off and you will not find fairness. As a consequence of that, this is a massive attack on the living standards and conditions of Australian working families and a massive attack on the Australian way of life. The 10 million Australian employees in the work force should do one thing today: they should write down very carefully the full extent of their conditions and entitlements in the workplace. They should make a checklist and come back in 2007 and see where they have ended up-see what has happened to their penalty rates, their overtime, their redundancy pay, their shift allowances, their leave loadings, roster times and holidays. They should see what has happened to their way of life-their capacity to spend and share time with their family and their capacity to balance work and family. The Prime Minister and the minister often say, ‘In 1996'-when you had Peter Reith and alsatians and balaclavas-‘Labor said the same thing.' There are a couple of qualitative differences. Firstly, in 1996 the Austraany lian Senate and about 230 amendments stood between you and what you wanted to do. Now that you have total control of the parliament and total control of the Senate, you are doing it for yourself. We will hold you to account. John Howard has said that as a result of the adoption of these measures unemployment will decrease, employment will increase, our productivity will improve and our international competitiveness will increase. We will hold John Howard and the Liberal Party to account on the promises and assertions they have made. These measures are a massive attack on the Australian way of life-on our values and virtues and character and on the Australian notion of a fair go. They are a massive attack on the living standards, the entitlements and the conditions of working Australian families. This House should do nothing except reject the bill resoundingly-and kill the bill.",106
15,Mr ROBB,SMALL BUSINESSES,"I stand to support the passing of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 and to oppose the amendments put by the opposition. The legislation will be fundamentally good for Australia for years to come-for decades to come. What has happened in the last few months in regard to workplace relations on the other side of the House has been nothing but a totally cynical political exercise. Opposition members have frightened people. Opposition members have talked down the economy. They have denigrated employers en masse with the sole intent of kick-starting their 2007 election campaign. That is all it is-an exercise in kickstarting their 2007 election campaign. It is not about the workers. If the opposition were about the workers, they would not have remained mute over the last few months on alternative set of policies. Not one alternative has been put to us. Today what did we hear? ‘Kill the bill'. There was no suggestion of any alternative. They base their campaign solely on ‘the vulnerable'. We have heard about nothing but their concern about the vulnerable. The current system has failed the vulnerable. Your system has failed the vulnerable. To be credible with the vulnerable, they must present an alternative solution. But we have heard no word of any alternative. The current system is excruciatingly complex, with hundreds of pages of unintelligible provisions in every award. Employers and employees alike have no understanding of all these rules, especially the hundreds of thousands of small and medium sized businesses. As a result, around two million workers today are in workplaces that effectively operate outside the system. Have we heard any mention of this on the other side of the House? Who does this expose-the two million operating outside the system? It exposes the vulnerable. Who has said nothing about this system's failure over recent months? It is the Labor Party and their union cronies. Under Work Choices, for the first time five strong minimum conditions must be paid by lawnot just for those on awards and not just for those in workplace agreements but by every employer and to every employee. What about the two million outside the system? The opposition ignore them because they are not good union fodder-they do not pay dues. Go for the big workplaces, where you can feather your nests-that is what it is all about. If employers do not pay these five minimum conditions the Workplace Services Inspectorate can be contacted, and these employers will be charged. Casuals get a 20 per cent loading, which more than compensates them for their lack of sick leave and public holidays. It is called protecting the vulnerable. That is what we have done. The campaign on the other side is all about politics. It is all about unionists getting themselves elected to parliament and about protecting the 80 per cent already there who have a union background. That is what it is about. In the process the unions have had a lovely time, floating around. Instead of doing the hard yakka and representing their members, they are running around the country amusing themselves. They have discovered campaigning. They are like a kid with a new toy, and aren't they pleased with themselves! What is it all costing? Walk past any fine restaurant in Canberra and who do you see there? You see Sharan Burrows, Greg Combet, Bill Shorten et al, sitting up having a lovely time, toasting their success with fine wines. You don't find a schooner-there is no-one with a schooner in their hands. They are there toasting their great success. The opposition do not like the truth; they hate it. They have played politics for months. Why don't they provide some alternative and look after the vulnerable, instead of looking after themselves? They are feeling vulnerable. That is why they are running a political campaign. They are trying to get their mates in here with them-80 or 90 per cent of them are unionists. They are protecting themselves, not the vulnerable. This is good legislation. It will stimulate the economy, protect jobs and will help Australia to prosper for years to come. (Time expired)",107
16,Mr BEAZLEY,SMALL BUSINESSES,"The government defends the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 with lies and corruption because they cannot defend it with the truth. They may have acknowledged 337 mistakes in this bill, but they have not had the humility or guts to recognise their greatest mistake-that they will not give a guarantee that this bill will not make Australian workers worse off-because it will. Now is the final chance for this parliament to kill this bill entirely, to rip it up and toss it in the bin. John Howard may think that this is his Austerlitz, but it is, in fact, his Waterloo. This is not the first bad idea the Prime Minister has had, and it is not the first bad law he has passed. It is not the first time he has abused public funds, misled the Australian people or diminished the living standards of Australian families. But it is the Prime Minister's most un-Australian act. It is the law that will define him and his prime ministership. It embodies the ideological poison and prejudice that has driven him for three decades. It is the defining act of an out-of-touch government, an elite that governs for itself and not for the country and protects its mates and persecutes its citizens. In this legislation, the government have simply gone too far. They are now riding roughshod over the will of the Australian people, destroying rights that generations of Australians have fought hard for over the last 100 years. Let us stop the pretence that this has anything to do with economic reform; it does not. The government have been unable to demonstrate any convincing evidence of that, and they have even muzzled their own Treasury research on the impacts of the bill. This is not about economic reform or the good of the country; it is about one man having the power to impose his extreme ideology on the nation. This bill should be ripped up but it will not be because power has gone to their heads. Now that the government have absolute control they are out of control. They think they can get away with anything they like, and that is why they have gagged debate and rammed through these laws. Unless you were a senator with a Liberal or National Party badge, you had just 40 minutes to read the amendments before they started bulldozing them through the Senate. Yet again they look after themselves and to hell with the rest of us. To hell with the 55 per cent of Australians who did not vote for this government in the Senate. This is an absolute disgrace, absolute arrogance. These changes are un-Australian, nothing less than a frontal attack tralian way of life. They will eat away at the foundations of job security, family life and wage fairness. In the years to come, this bill will slowly erode our way of life. We will see our nation become more like America, where millions of people work in full-time jobs but stay in poverty and where there has been no increase in the minimum wage since 1996. Six months ago the government snubbed seven million Australians by rewarding themselves with whopping big tax cuts and breaks while they threw a few scraps to the rest of us. Now they are passing a law that takes away basic work rights from every Australian worker. They are ripping into the welfare safety net that helps give our nation's kids protection from poverty. Only one thing can come out of this bill, and that is the beginning of the end for this government. If you do not trash this legislation this morning, we will hold every single Liberal Party and National Party member of this House personally responsible for their vote to take away the rights of Australian workers. For the sake of working families, we will fight you every day in your electorates until your government is brought down for this vicious, unnecessary and completely un-Australian law.",108
17,Mr BARRESI,SMALL BUSINESSES,"Out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition, there is confirmation of exactly what the member for Goldstein was talking about in his contribution. The opposition's position here has nothing to do with workers' rights or protecting workers' rights. This is a political campaign. We have heard members of the union movement saying that they are going to attack, with $8 million in marginal seats. Bring it on. At the end of the day, the fear campaign by the Labor Party has not worked in the past and it will not work in the future. Who do we on the Aus- turn to? Who said: The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; about the abolition of safety nets. Who said that? Stephen Smith said that in 1995. And what have we seen since 1995? We have seen unemployment driven down, and we have seen real wages go up by 14 per cent. Do not be a fortune teller, Member for Perth, because you have no idea how to predict the future. You were wrong then and you will be wrong again in the future. The Leader of the Opposition has admitted that this is all about politics. Where is the argument about some of the specific issues? Show me an employer out there at the moment who, when recruitment takes place, says to a prospective employee, ‘Here, read the 400 pages of the award to make sure your conditions are there.' Show me an employer who says that, or show me an employee who asks for the same thing, an employee who says: ‘I need to know my rights. Show me the award-the whole 400 pages-before I sign off on this employment contract.' That does not occur now, but what will occur through the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 is a guarantee that every employer by law has to meet at least five minimum conditions. A whole lot of other conditions can be negotiated and, if they are not negotiated, they default to the standard position. That will happen now under this legislation. An employer who breaches the fair pay conditions under our legislation is in breach of the law. You show me where an employer today who has not shown an employee the 400 pages of an award is then taken up and breached. It does not happen, and that is why we have over two million people out there in the community who are working outside awards and agreements. Ms King interjecting",109
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SMALL BUSINESSES,Order! The honourable member for it is Ballarat has had a good go without getting the call. The honourable member should sit there quietly.,110
19,Mr BARRESI,SMALL BUSINESSES,"Does the union movement protect those people? No. Does the Labor Party protect those people? No, it does not. It has ignored those two million people. This government is about making sure that five minimum conditions are included in legislation, making sure that the conditions are in law as a bare minimum. You know that, and so do your mates over in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. They all know that. That is why they have deregulated their industrial relations systems. They have done it and reaped the benefits of it. But what do we have here? We have an opposition that just wants to oppose at every opportunity. There is no discussion about how we can introduce far greater deregulation into the work force and still provide protection. This government has done it, and this government is very proud of the fact that this legislation has been introduced. You know as well as we do that there are safeguards in this legislation. There are safeguards for the vulnerable, and the amendments introduced in the Senate provide even further safeguards. It is about time the opposition looked at themselves and said: ‘Are we really genuine about opposing this? Is this about protecting our financial coffers in the union movement?' And, of course, that is what it is all about. It is about making sure that their union mates still have relevance in the new world order. The fact is that they do have relevance, but if they are smart they will take up the opportunity to reinvent themselves and become bargaining agents for those they believe are vulnerable, rather than simply opposing this legislation. The prophecy from the past has been seen to be simply hot air, and the prophecy of today will also be hot air. (Time expired)",110
20,Ms MACKLIN,SMALL BUSINESSES,"Jagajaga) (10.15 am)From this day, this campaign will go out of the parliament and into the streets and workplaces of Australia. We will be down at the Blackburn shops, taking this matter into the electorate of the previous speaker-the electorate of Deakin-telling the people exactly what the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 will do to their family lives, to their working conditions and to their capacity to pay their mortgages. We know that this legislation will make it harder and harder for the people of Blackburn, for the people of Templestowe, for the people of Goldstein and for the people of Corangamite. The people of Geelong know what they pay for their mortgages. They know that they depend on penalty rates and shift allowances to pay their mortgages. When we have been out in the workplaces of Australia, we have been told time after time, day after day, that without those shift allowances, without those penalty rates, people will not be able to pay their mortgages. People in Deakin, in Corangamite, in Menzies and in Goldstein all know that they will not be able to afford their mortgages because they are about to lose their penalty rates and Deakin. their shift allowances. Talk to the nurses in the hospitals. They will lose $260 a week as a result of this legislation. That is how much their shift and penalty rates are worth. They say to us-and I am sure they will be saying it to the member for Deakin, if ever he goes down to the Blackburn shops-that they will not work these family-unfriendly hours if they are not guaranteed their shift allowances. We are not going to have nurses in our aged care homes and in our hospitals if they are not guaranteed their shift allowances and their penalty rates to compensate them for working family-unfriendly hours. All those around Australia that we rely on-whether they are nurses in hospitals, police or firefighters-deserve to get shift allowances and penalty rates for protecting our community and for looking after the sick and the aged. But what does this legislation do? Go back to the real minister for industrial relations over there, the guy who is sitting in the back stalls waiting. He is just waiting until the member for Menzies is moved on for cutting the wages and working conditions of the entire Australian population. Down will come the member for Goldstein, who has made it absolutely plain in this place today that only five conditions are protected now. Here in this parliament, he has given it away and made it absolutely plain to the people of Australia that only five conditions are protected now. All the other things that workers rely on-their shift penalties, overtime rates and other extra payments, which ensure that they can pay their mortgages-have been given away by the member for Goldstein. Mortgages are pretty expensive in Goldstein. It is a pretty nice part of Melbourne and very expensive. Perhaps those in Goldstein will be able to continue to pay their mortgages, as they will be getting their benefits from somewhere else. But it will not be like that for the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers in",111

She stood up for the people of Hasluck, who know what it means to work for a living. She knew and understood the people of Hasluck because, before she came into the parliament, she also knew what it meant to work for a living. We know that the people of Hasluck know exactly what happened in Western Australia. They know that the working conditions of Western Australians were stripped. That is exactly what this legislation does. It brings into play for the whole of Australia what happened in Western Australia. (Time expired)",111
23,Mr MCARTHUR,SMALL BUSINESSES,"The workers and the small businesses of Corangamite will be delighted with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005. Unlike all the members opposite, including the member for Ballarat, the people of Corangamite-the workers and the small businesses-will welcome this legislation. They know that it is not extreme legislation. I totally reject the Leader of Opposition and other speakers saying that this is extreme legislation. That terminology is completely wrong on the basis that we have been arguing this case for some 20 years. We put up the argument in 1996 and this legislation is a continuation of that proposition. The Leader of the Opposition and those opposite continue to run the argument that this is extreme legislation, but they have no evidence to support their argument. Further, I put to the member for Corio, who is entering the chamber, that, unlike him, I have met with the workers of Geelong. I have had discussions with members of the Trades Hall Council and they have put no argument to me about this legislation being not in their best interests. They know that jobs will be created in Corangamite and in Corio, where the honourable member lives. They know that jobs will be created in the electorate of Reid, in the electorate of Cowan and in the electorate of Bendigo-as I would say to that honourable member, were he to come into the chamber. They know that this legislation will create a more flexible position. I note the untimely passing in recent days of former Senator Cook. I have read very carefully a number of the accolades and obituaries about Senator Cook. Senator Cook is on the public record as saying that he advocated an alternative system, a decentralised industrial relations system. Mr Edwards interjecting",112

28,Mr MCARTHUR,SMALL BUSINESSES,"We have heard a lot of rhetoric from those opposite. The member for Corio and others talk about ripping up the legislation. They talk about it being ‘extreme'. They talk about workers' rights. I put it to the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite: what is your policy? What are you actually advocating? Leader of the Opposition, you have no position as to what your alternative policy is, because you know fundamentally that this is correct. You know fundamentally that we need a more flexible system in Australia. You know that enterprise bargaining was something that your government started, Leader of the Opposition. When you were in government in 1993, you advocated a similar position. We have built on that. All this rhetoric from those members opposite does not stand up. When I spoke to those Trades Hall people from Geelong, they had absolutely no argument about what was wrong with this legislation. They had similar arguments to those put up by the members opposite about overtime, about the reduction in wages. Let us be quite clear: wages for Australian workers have gone up 14 per cent over the last nine years, and those opposite have no track record similar to that. So those members opposite who represent the trade unions, all my friends on the other side of the parliament, have come in here day after day, and they-the shadow spokesmen-come here again today and talk about extreme legislation. They talk about overtime rates. But they have no alternative. They know that, in the UK, Tony Blair adopted the flexible arrangements of the Thatcherite government. They know that that will be the case in Australia. They know that when they go to the next election the rollback of the industrial relations legislation will be a similar situation to that of the rolloff. back of the GST. The Leader of the Opposition, the spokesmen and all those opposite stand condemned on their lack of argument. They have no position. They have no alternative policy to make a change for the betterment of Australian workers, the betterment of Australian businesses and the long-term future of Australia. Every commentator knows, the OECD knows-everyone knows-that you need to make a change to this hundred-year-old system with the industrial relations club. I commend the legislation. I commend the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the minister at the table. I invite those opposite to put up a sensible proposition. To date they have made no contribution to this debate.",112

That has the effect of killing this extreme, unfair and divisive piece of legislation. No other amendments can rescue this piece of legislation. Do you know what the first amendment in the Senate was? The first amendment in the Senate, rejected by the government, was to ensure that the word ‘fair' was included in the objects of the act. So you are quite happy to rort, to politically corrupt, an advertising campaign using taxpayers' funds to put the word ‘fair' on the cover sheet of your material and propaganda, but you reject an amendment to insert the word ‘fair' into the objects of the act. Where does this massive attack on the living standards of Australian families come from? First, it comes from the attack on the minimum wage. If the Prime Minister had had his way in the course of his term of office, those on the minimum wage would currently be $50 a month or $2,600 a year worse The objects and public policy purpose of this legislation are to reduce the minimum wage in real terms, and that has a cascading effect upwards-which the Prime Minister well knows, as he comes into this place to preen himself in his arrogance, with proposals never put before the Australian people in the run-up to the last election. The last time you put these proposals to the Australian electorate was in 1992 with Jobsback-this is the briefing instruction for the 1,500 pages of material that we now find. You were soundly rejected on that occasion by the Australian people, and you have been soundly rejected by the Australian parliament. As you come in today to preen yourself in your arrogance, you are not worried about the nation's future, just concerned about your past and your place in history, so that you can go to the Liberal Party Christmas party this year and stand up and say, ‘It wasn't me who squandered the last Senate majority. It was Malcolm who squandered it; it wasn't me. Look what I've done, something I've been trying to do for 30 years, to rip away at the wages of Australian workers, to rip away at their conditions, their entitlements and their penalty rates.' You will be condemned, because in the end the Australian people know that what you are doing here is un-Australian. The social and economic effect of this legislationas you rip away at wages, penalty rates, overtime, leave loading and shift allowances; as you shift the total factor income sector of the economy further from wages to profitwill be to create an American-style working poor. People will not just struggle to make ends meet; they will be reliant upon the American tipping bowl to survive as you create in this country a divided society where people are dependent upon the tips they get in the tipping bowl to try and make ends meet. When did we hear about this monstrous attack on living standards and the Australian way of life in the run-up to the last election? The Prime Minister now stands up and says: ‘If we don't adopt these proposals now, our economy will crumble.' When was the last time. I read that? Jobsback. You can read the words now: ‘Unless these proposals are adopted immediately, our economy will crumble.' You have been saying it for 20 years, and you have always been wrong. You also assert that the mere adoption of these proposals will see four things happen to our economy, as you sit there and preen yourself with your arrogance. The last time you brought proposals, at least you had Peter Reith with dogs and balaclavas. On this occasion, you bring the minister-alsatians and balaclavas are not his style; opera glasses and poodles are more his style. You assert that the mere adoption of these proposals will see unemployment decrease, employment increase, our international competitiveness improve and productivity increase. We and the Australian people will hold you to account for the way you have dishonestly pursued these proposals. Some of us have been around long enough to remember that ‘Honest John' was always an ironic expression. As you rip away at the wages, conditions and entitlements of Australian families and at the Australian way of life, the House should adopt my amendment and tear up this bill, rip up these proposals and rip up your political future.",113
30,Mr HOWARD,SMALL BUSINESSES,"I hope the member for Perth now feels a bit better. In the short time available to me, let me remind this place that nine years ago, when the amendments to the workplace relations bill were returned to this place, the same doomsday predictions were made, the same emotional attack was made on the government and a number of questions were asked. I turn to the speech of the member for Fraser, the then opposition shadow minister and member for Canberra. He will remember the speech in which he asked the question: Will there be fewer industrial disputes over this three-year term under this regime than there were in the last three years under the old regime? The answer to that question was a resounding yes. He said: Perhaps more importantly, will there be more jobs created in this parliamentary term under this regime than there were in the last term of the parliament? As every Australian knows, there is no prouder boast of this government than that, in the time that we have been in office, 1.7 million more jobs have been created. There has been a lot of rhetoric and emotion in this debate. The heaviest burden carried by the Australian Labor Party throughout this whole debate is the fact that the government I have led over the last 9½ years has been a better friend of the workers of Australia than the Labor Party has ever been. No matter what events may cross my political path in the years ahead, all I can this: of all the things to which I may have in a small way made a contribution, there is none of which I am more proud than the fact that my government has lifted the living standards of the men and women of Australia. We have given the workers of Australia more jobs, higher wages, lower interest rates and lower levels of taxation. We have brought to the working men and women of Australia hope and opportunity. All the Labor Party has brought to the working men and women of Australia is a harking back to a bygone age that was never as golden as they painted itMs King interjecting",114
31,The SPEAKER,SMALL BUSINESSES,Order! The member for Ballarat will calm down.,115
32,Mr HOWARD,SMALL BUSINESSES,"The working men and women of Australia are now enjoying better wages and better conditions than they have ever enjoyed in the past. That has all occurred despite the doomsday predictions of the member of the Australian Labor Party. As this debate comes to its closing phases, let us remember that in the end the only guarantee of job security and higher wages in the Australian economy is a strong economy. You cannot legislate job security in the face of a failing economy. We saw that in the early 1990s when we had a much more regulated economy. We had an economy regulated according to the Labor model, yet more than one million people lost their jobs and real wages were in free fall. That is the reality. The test of any industrial relations system, whether it is proposed by us or by those who sit opposite, is the contribution it makes to the strength of the economy. The test of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 is whether it will result in a stronger economy, whether it will further unleash the productive efforts and resources say is of the men and women of Australia and whether it will further encourage the risk takers and entrepreneurs of Australia to invest in jobs and the future of this country. This is not a debate about the past in Australia; it is a debate about the future. It is a debate about which industrial relations system will better strengthen the Australian economy in the years ahead. This bill is an investment by the government of this country in the future hopes and aspirations of the working men and women of this country. It is not an investment in negativity and looking back. The Labor Party has again fallen into the trap of pledging itself to repeal the bill lock, stock and barrel, just as it pledged itself to oppose the GST. Once again the Labor Party is looking to the past and not to the future. Once again the Labor Party and its attitudes have failed the future aspirations of the working men and women of Australia.

33,Mr BEAZLEY,SMALL BUSINESSES,"Why doesn't the Prime Minister, if he is so proud of this legislation, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005, and so confident about it, have the courage to debate me in public? Why have you absolutely no ticker for a fight with me in public on this issue, to stand before the Australian people and make your claims about the economy and about what will happen to middle Australia? You do not have the courage. You do not have the ticker. You have been too long in the job and do not think you can do it anymore. You do not think you can get up and canter around the paddock on this issue, Prime Minister. You want to run away and hide behind the looting of the taxpayers' purse of some $55 million to promote this wretched legislation. Understand this, Prime Minister: the modern work force in the modern era is not about persecuting workers and sending them back to 19th century master-servant relationships, even though you have craved that since the 1970s. The modern work force which succeeds and will drive a regeneration of Australian exports is the highly skilled work force that has the opportunity to get decent training and a decent education, which are now being routinely denied them by this government. That is what generates productivity. That is what generates wealth. And that is what the government will not address. Instead of dealing with skills-making sure that our work force have the skills they need-as the OECD has told you you must do and as the Reserve Bank has told you you must do, you decide that the way you will go about this is to lift the profit share-at a very historically high level now-even further. What you Liberals have to understand is this. We are talking here not simply about vulnerable Australians. We are talking about middle Australians and their values. One of the problems that the Liberal Party has in this place is that its members of parliament do not represent its base vote. You do not see in this parliament the electricians, the fitters and turners and the plumbers who represent the bulk of the Liberal Party vote. As I go around this country and talk at large numbers of meetings of thousands of workers, I am conscious that at the last election a substantial minority of those workers voted Liberal. They make that point to me. There is nothing new in that. For the last 100 years, a good 40 per cent of Australian workers have voted conservative. For the ordinary Australian work force, we have always been in contest with you. In the days when I first joined the Labor Party and was fighting the Communist Party people who then existed in the community, the Socialist Workers Party and the rest of them outside the Labor Party, I always pointed this out to them: ‘We are not competing with you for the working class vote. You haven't got any votes at all. We are competing with the Liberal Party for workers' votes in this community. We are competing with them.' There has always been a substantial minority of workers who have voted for you. That substantial minority is a substantial majority of your vote, and you have spat on them. You have turned your backs on them and you have spat on them. You have told them that, if they want a Christmas holiday, they have to go and give a reasonable explanation.",115

You are going to be talking- (Time expired)",116
39,Mr ANDREWS,SMALL BUSINESSES,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (10.40 am)-At the end of this parliamentary year, the overblown rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates one simple fact, and that is that the Australian Labor Party has no ideas and no policy. The reality of its attack on this lation, its so-called policy to roll back this legislation, is no policy whatsoever. This is a party that has reached the sad state where it is not able to bring some policies forward to the Australian people in the contest of ideas in Australia. That is the reality of what we have seen from the Australian Labor Party today. It is well known and well understood that these reforms are needed for Australia. We have had the OECD, the IMF, the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Productivity Commission all saying that these further changes to workplace relations in Australia are needed to ensure that we set up this country as best we can for a prosperous future. The reality is that some of these changes have been supported in the past by Labor luminaries in Australia. We can go back to Gough Whitlam, talking about the need for a national system. We know that Neville Wran supported a national system. As long ago as 1991 we saw Mr Carr, the previous Premier of New South Wales, write that there was a need for a national system of industrial relations in Australia. But it is not only those. What we have is this hypocritical stance from the Australian Labor Party, having supported what Paul Keating belatedly recognised in the early 1990s as the need to make a change away from the rigidities and the inflexibilities of the old award system to a system based on agreement making at the workplace. The Leader of the Opposition was the passenger then, following Paul Keating; he is the passenger today, simply following the bosses of the union movement. Yesterday we had Sharan Burrow down here telling him what to do. But it was Paul Keating who said back in 1993 that this is the way in which we need to go. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition and the people of Australia what Paul legisKeating said about the changes that were needed in 1993. He said: ... let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level ... He continued: We need to accelerate workplace or enterprise bargaining … And he said: We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards, as they sometimes are today, to being full substitutes for awards. This man who is now the Leader of the Opposition is always a passenger. He was a passenger when Paul Keating was driving reform; he is simply a passenger today when the union bosses, for their own sakes, are saying, ‘We are opposed to these reforms in Australia.' For example, there are provisions in this bill that the Australian Labor Party voted against that provide further protection for outworkers-some of the most vulnerable workers in Australia. The Australian Labor Party voted against those in the Senate. In the Senate, they voted down protections for outworkers. That is an indication that the reality is that the Australian Labor Party, as far as this debate is concerned, are not about protecting ordinary Australian workers; they are simply about protecting their jobs and protecting their union mates, who pay millions of dollars to ensure that they stay in this place. That is the reality of the opposition. As a real Labour leader, Tony Blair, once said, ‘You should remember that fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job.' That is what he told the Trades Union Congress; that is what he had the courage to do. This Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage to stand up and put forward some policies for the good of the Australian work force. He simply does what he has been told. Tony Blair told the Trades Union Congress, ‘We have nothing to lose but our dogma,' and that can be applied equally to the Australian Labor Party. They have got nothing to lose but their dogma. This bill is for the good of Australia. It is for the good of Tuckey, C.W. Australian workers. It is about setting up this country for prosperity in the future. I move: That the question be now put.

NA AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY UP-FRONT STUDENT UNION FEES) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 December, on motion by Dr Nelson: That this bill be now read a second time.",122
46,Mrs HULL,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Riverina) (11.33 am)Yesterday I spoke on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 and today I would like to continue my speech on this issue. For five years I have been one of the very few people who have continually fought to get a sensible balance on this issue. Whilst I have never supported compulsory unionism, I have argued the case for the provision of a service fee or a funding pool to enable universities such as the university that I represent, Charles Sturt University, to offer valuable and viable services. Year after year I have argued against my Young Nationals at The Nationals' New South Wales state conference, because the Young Nationals have strongly supported this legislation. I would like to give thanks to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, for his patience and for always agreeing to meet with me to discuss my views. Nobody could say I have not had entry to meaningful discussions with this minister. Again, I sincerely thank him. Whilst I recognise the concerns of the many constituents who feel aggrieved at having to pay the compulsory fee, I do hope they realise that, to date, students who have attended Charles Sturt University and who have paid this fee have received value for money. I support the provision of funding to cover services such as bus services, child care, canteen, legal aid and other services. Without funding, these services and facilities will be forced to close. This will impact on students-many from rural and regional communities-and their future studies. One example I have already mentioned is the provision for students of bus services between the campus-which is on the outskirts of Wagga Wagga-and the central business district and suburbs throughout Wagga Wagga. It is my concern that these services, if lost, would not be replaced by commercial operators as it would prove too costly to do so. It would then be costly for students and this would, of course, also impact on their parents. I do not think parents understand that. Again, I have made a number of representations about this issue, but I would ask that the government at least consider providing a funding pool that enables universities such as Charles Sturt University to access funding to provide to students essential services such as those I have outlined. I understand that negotiations and discussions are continuously taking place on exactly this issue. For that I am eternally grateful. I feel confident that I can come into this House to speak on this bill and raise my concerns for the university I represent. People who are opposed to paying compulsory student union fees may not recognise that much of those fees goes toward the provision of services. I suggest that the government move towards providing a funding pool-(Time expired)",124
47,Mr GRIFFIN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. This bill will destroy the social and cultural fabric of Australian higher education institutions.,124
48,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Order! I interrupt the member for Bruce for a minute to draw attention to the state of the House. We are in an unusual circumstance where we do not have a minister present, and I hope someone will make an early arrangement to be here. To facilitate ongoing debate I am prepared to let it continue, but I hope someone will make a prompt arrangement to ensure that we do have a minister present as soon as possible.",124
49,Mr GRIFFIN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I guess it says something about the way the government is treating this House. Along with the way it has been treating the other house and the operation of the parliament, it really says something about the way they are treating the institution. As I said, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 will destroy the social and cultural fabric of Austrainclude lian higher education institutions if enacted without amendment. With no compulsory services and amenities fees in universities and TAFEs, the services and activities that student associations provide will be reduced to the bare minimum. The ability of student organisations to provide extensive welfare services, subsidised health and child care, academic appeals and advocacy will be significantly diminished. It is absolutely shameful that through this bill this government is prepared to see the collapse of student organisations across Australia-student organisations which provide vital services and advocacy roles for students. Labor will strongly oppose this fundamental attack on students. Surely students have already suffered enough under this government, with higher HECS fees, crowded classes and now $100,000 degrees. In 1999 Labor opposed a similar attempt by the federal government to introduce voluntary student unionism at a federal level. In the form of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, the Howard government attempted its initial assault on student organisations. The former bill, as with the current bill, attracted widespread community the opposition. It was opposed by a number of vice-chancellors, including the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. State parliaments passed motions against the former bill's introduction. It is interesting to note that in 1999 the then Liberal controlled House of Assembly in the South Australian parliament passed a motion against the bill which stated: That this house is committed to ensuring that South Australian university programs and students are not disadvantaged and is therefore opposed to voluntary student unionism. As I mentioned briefly before, student organisations provide a wealth of services that subsidised health and child care, academic appeals, student loans, welfare support and assistance in the transition to university life. These services could not exist without a compulsory services and amenities fee. Attending university for the first time can certainly be one of the biggest challenges for any person. University can be a lonely time. No longer is a student guided by a teacher in a school of 800; a student is now a very small fish in a very big ocean. A student has to find their own way in a large institution of sometimes more than 15,000 students. During orientation week, many students are able to develop their friendship circle and support network by participating in the activities offered by the student organisations. The development of a network of friends enables a student to settle into the university or TAFE more quickly and hence improve their educational outcomes. This bill will reduce orientation programs conducted by student associations. This in turn will impact on a student's ability to successfully participate in the higher education system. In particular, the removal of a broad transition program which is offered by student organisations will impact significantly upon international students. For many international students, the transition programs that student organisations provide during the orientation period are essential to their success in higher education in Australia. In a Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee report entitled ‘Hacking Australia's future', Mr Trevor White, a representative of the Australasian Campus Union Managers Association, believed that services provided by student organisations were ‘part of the total educational experience in coming to Australia'. In relation to the abolition of a compulsory service and amenities fee, Mr White stated: It is an outrageous comment by the government to say that these services are not important. International students use a wide range of services from student organisations as part of their transition to university life in Australia. Apart from the vital program that occurs for international students during orientation week, many student organisations have an international students department. The international students department provides an important support base and friendship network for overseas students on campus. At Monash University Clayton, a university situated close to my electorate, Monash University International Student Services offers a variety of activities and services for international students, including a lounge, affordable day trips, political advocacy, international newspapers and cheap faxing. In addition to the services provided by Monash University International Student Services, international students are able to access the standard services provided by student organisations, including clubs and societies, which can often include clubs of their countries of origin. It was concluded in the report by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee that there was a clear danger that foreign students would be deterred from enrolling in Australian universities if these services were not available. The abolition of the compulsory services and amenities fee will also impact severely upon the higher educational outcomes of minority groups, including mature age students, women and students who attend regional universities and satellite campuses. For mature age students, going back to university can be a challenging time. Mature age students find going back to study and upgrading their qualifications a tough experience, and they are often juggling home life with studying on a limited income. In student organisations across Australia, there are often mature age student departments. At Monash University Clayton, the Mature Age and Part-time Students Association, otherwise known as MAPS, provides a strong support base for students aged 23 and above. They provide a quiet and comfortable lounge with free computer access, coffeeand teamaking facilities, reading rooms and regular social events. They also play a strong advocacy role for mature age and part-time students within the university. This department would almost certainly not exist without a compulsory services and amenities fee. The participation of women in Australia's higher education institutions is greater than ever before, yet women still face discrimination and harassment on campus. The level of success that they experience from participating in higher education can be dependent on how safe they feel on campus. With many universities today having classes late at night, women can often feel unsafe walking to and from class at this time. Student organisations have played a vital role in lobbying university administrations to ensure that campuses are well lit. They have also helped to ensure that many campuses have security guards on campus. Security guards will walk students to and from class and to car parks to ensure their safety. In addition, many student organisations now provide shuttle buses for students to get to their car park at night. Apart from safety on campus at night, women can face discrimination in the classroom. Many women feel intimidated by tutorial environments and feel unable to engage in classroom discussions, with male students often dominating. In addition, women enrolled in non-traditional professions such as engineering will often feel totally excluded in these predominantly male courses. In cases like these, the women's department, which is part of the student organisation, plays an important role in providing support for women on campus. Women's departments are often one of the strongest departments of a student association. Women's departments can be advocacy bodies that raise campus awareness regarding issues such as discrimination in the room and sexual assault and discrimination on campus. Women's departments often also provide a whole range of activities, including self-defence classes and practical workshops. In addition, many campus student organisations have a women's room, a women-only space that can provide important time-out periods. It is fair to say that the women's department can play an important role in the retention of women at university. Without a compulsory services and amenities fee, the number of activities that the women's department would be able to operate would be severely diminished. In some associations, they would be forced to close down. Women will be the losers on campus. While student organisations are important for all universities, there is no doubt about the importance they play in the lives of students who attend regional universities. Student organisations at regional universities the lifeblood on campus, providing activities and support for students almost 24 hours a day. The wide variety of services that student organisations provide in regional towns, including in some cases free transport to and from the local towns, have enabled students to have an active student life and a fruitful university experience. Without such services, students would be less likely to select regional universities as their higher education provider of choice. This has significant implications not only for the university but also for the local economy of the town itself. For regional towns, student associations often own a variety of facilities used by the local people; at the University of New England, the student union owns the town's cinema. These facilities add to the vibrancy and life of regional centres. The functions that are provided by student organisations are vital parts of a student's experience in higher education. Even the Minister for Education, classScience and Training acknowledged that: ... student organisations enrich university life and provide a whole range of services, from the very commercial right through to support and counselling-services which are all ... valued by students. Despite these comments, the minister now is trying to destroy the very institutions he praised. What hypocrisy! The minister must know that this bill, without amendment, will mean the cessation of many of the services he regarded as ‘valued by students'. It will lead also to a massive loss of jobs. This was shown by the experience of Western Australia. In 1994, when the Court government introduced voluntary student unionism in Western Australia, student organisations were forced to the brink of collapse. University administrations recognised the irreplaceable value and role of student associations are and were regularly forced to financially prop up student organisations to ensure their continued existence. Under VSU, student organisations in Western Australia were forced to lay off services staff, as they did not have the funds to maintain their employment. If the legislation is passed without amendment, the Australasian Campus Unions Managers Association, the peak body for services providing organisations on campus, estimates that at least 4,200 jobs will be lost, including hundreds in regional areas. How can this government claim to support regional Australia when attempting to legislate hundreds of regional jobs out of existence? The minister has argued that many of the services operated by student organisations could be operated by commercial enterprises and that this would be a more efficient and cheaper way to go. However, this is not viable for all services, as students are on campus for only six months of the year. In order to make their business commercially viable, many commercial providers who decide to operate on campus need to boost their prices to compensate for the six months they are not there. Many student organisations currently subsidise food outlets; however, without a compulsory services and amenities fee, this would not be able to continue and, in reality, students would face higher costs. The government fails to recognise that student organisations provide for more than just food and drink outlets. As I mentioned earlier, services such as the provision of fare and student advocacy would not or could not be taken up by commercial providers. Even if services such as student counselling were to be offered by private providers, it is very unlikely that they would be offered free, as is often the case currently. In Western Australia, as a result of the voluntary student unionism legislation introduced by the Court government, students who worked unpaid for the guilds found themselves using all their energy in recruiting students as members to their guild rather than representing their members. The students had no choice but to do this, as without the financial resources provided through memberships the student associations would almost definitely cease to operate. As announced, Labor will be introducing a compromise amendment to outlaw compulsory student union membership and to allow universities to charge a compulsory services and amenities fee. Labor's amendment provides a practical and sensible way to protect vital campus services. Labor has moved beyond the Liberals' tired old debate about compulsory student unionism, where Liberal members are still fighting the campus battles they lost in the 1970s. In conclusion, if its amendment is not adopted, Labor will strongly oppose this bill. Without a compulsory services and amenities fee, vital student services such as welfare provision, subsidised health and child care, academic appeals and advocacy will be significantly diminished; in some cases, they will cease to exist. I note that in the next few minutes we will see, once again, a gag come into effectanother gag by this government so that it can ram through legislation without proper debate. Watching the gag being used for a range of legislation over the last few days, we have seen the real nature of the way this wel- government intends to deal with issues this term. I am absolutely fascinated by what my friend the member for Fisher might have to say on this legislation. I hope that it is not the usual ideological rant that has come from many on his side. However, as it has been so many years since he was at university, as it has been for me, the chances are that he does not have quite the painful memories of some of his colleagues with respect to what occurred on campus. I am not sure whether we will value his contribution in the time that is left, but we will certainly listen to it-if not here, in our offices. But I certainly note that, once again, this government is gagging debate on important legislation that will impact on the community. Part of what it is trying to do, I am is to put this legislation through and send it up to the Senate while it thinks it might be able to get it through. The question then will be: what will happen in the Senate; what will happen with Senator Joyce from Queensland-‘Backdown Barnaby'-who, once again, has been talking about being prepared to stand up and fight the good fight on this legislation? I guess we will have to wait and see whether he does. But, with the number of times we have had an argument from a National Party member about legislation put up being bad and then not having them vote against it, you have to wonder about what they say versus what they do. Again, I will be very interested to hear the member for Fisher on this particular issue. I know that he has an involvement historically in the National Party. He could probably explain to the House what is wrong with those National Party members much better than I could. I certainly look forward to hearing what he might say about that point, if he should address it.",125
50,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"As I think Billy Hughes said when he was accused, at a significant celebration, of having been a member of all political parties in the parliament bar one, ‘You've got to draw the line somewhere.' If one were referring to the Australian Labor Party, I must confess that in 2005 I would have to echo the words of the former distinguished Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes. One would have to draw the line at the possibility of joining the Australian Labor Party. I think it is particularly important to recognise that the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 is all about freedom of association and freedom of choice. The ALP has long been a supporter sure, of compulsory student unionism. While the member for Jagajaga is now seeking to vary that long standing support for compulsory student unionism into a form of compulsory services fee, one ought not to lose sight of the fact that it is the Australian Labor Party that wants to compel students at Australian tertiary institutions to be part of an organisation and to pay money which will be used for certain purposes. I have listened very carefully to the members opposite-to their remarks about many of the virtues of the services provided by student unions and student guilds. I have listened to their claim that many services would not be provided were it not for the presence of those student guilds, associations or unions. I really do not have a problem if someone wants to join those associations, if that person voluntarily elects to do so and, as part of doing so, naturally pays a fee. My difficulty with the proposition being proposed by the member for Jagajaga is the element of compulsion. As a person who takes a libertarian approach to some matters, I very strongly support the right of someone to join a union, whether it be a student union, a student association, a student guild or, for that matter, a trade union, but equally I believe that in a democratic nation we ought not compel anyone, we ought not conscript anyone, to be a member of a union, and we ought not to conscript the fees that that person would have to pay to be used for certain purposes, however desirable. We all know of the large numbers of external students who never visit the university campus. The honourable member for New England represents the University of New England. The University of New England has quite an admirable program of external degrees, giving many people right throughout the nation the opportunity of a tertiary education. But many of those external students would never visit the campus at Armidale or, if they did so, they would do so rarely. In my view, it would be entirely inequitable for those students to be forced to make a contribution to the costs of running facilities at the University of New England. I only mention that particular university because the member for New England is here, but a similar rule and a similar arrangement could apply to other tertiary institutions throughout the country. I find it amazing that in 2005 the Australian Labor Party could actually stand up and support compulsory membership or a compulsory contribution towards the provision of services for students at institutions. The government does remain committed to genuine freedom of association-the right to join a union or not to join a union-and the same rule applies not only to trade unions but also to educational unions or student unions, term them as you wish. I believe in true freedom of association, and it is important that those associations in the student arena should be able to provide services of a sufficient standard to make people want to join them, but I do not believe in the element of compulsion. If people want to vote with their feet, if they are dissatisfied with the services provided or, for that matter, if they are not going to use the services, then I believe it is entirely uitable that those students should be compelled to write cheques to benefit people who will use those facilities, when they themselves have chosen not to or are unable to do so. I have long been on the record as supporting the principle of voluntary student unionism. We all know about some of the appalling misuses of student funds by student associations and unions over the years. Those funds have been used for political purposes, quite foreign in many cases to the attitude of their student body. Many students are forced to pay a compulsory membership fee to a student union. They play no role in the activities of the union, and often a militant minority is able to hijack the agenda of the student union and use the funds compulsorily acquired from the student body for purposes diametrically opposed to the principles of the bulk of that student body. We have had a situation where people have had to pay up to $600 a year for membership of a student union and there are great penalties for those who do not pay, such as enrolments being cancelled or results being withheld. It does seem almost unbelievable that a student who has studied hard for a number of years and has endured the other hardships of tertiary study-such as, in many cases, separation from their family and financial strugglescan have their goal of a tertiary qualification blocked at the last hurdle by a dubious debt from an unrelated, unrequested and unwanted membership fee. The bill before the House, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005, seeks to put fairness back into the tertiary arena. Those who wish to join a union may do so and those who do not wish to join a union do not have to join. As I said earlier, I am impressed with many of the facilities provided by student unions, but there ineqought to be no element of compulsion on the part of students either to join the union or to pay a fee to provide for services at the tertiary institution if the student chooses not to make that contribution. From July 2006, student union membership will be voluntary, and students who enrol after that date will no longer be subjected to fees that must be paid. From 2007, all students in all universities, public and private, will benefit from these provisions. Gone will be the days of students struggling to find the extra money to fund the fees. Gone will be the days when a student's results will be held to ransom by the non-payment of the fees. From mid-2006, we will return to a true sense of freedom of association on Australia's university campuses. This is an important piece of legislation. have absolutely no concerns about it. It enacts what I believe to be an absolute principle-that is, the principle of freedom of association in a democratic society; the freedom to join or not to join a union or student guild. Equally, it is important that no student be forced to make a contribution to services or facilities if that student chooses not to so. While an argument could be made that on-campus students who use the facilities ought to be contributing towards them. I have no problem if they voluntarily choose to do so-I think it is entirely inequitable, inappropriate and antidemocratic that students who in many cases live thousands of kilometres away from the institution and never get to use the facilities ought to be compelled to do so.",129
51,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"It being 12 noon, in accordance with the resolution previously put, I call the minister in reply.",131
52,Dr NELSON,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (12.00 pm)-in reply-I thank all of those who spoke to the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. Whilst not agreeing with quite a few remarks made by those opposite, the issues have been well canvassed in relation to this matter. It is worth recording that in 1999, which was the first occasion upon which this issue was considered in the parliament, we had 17 speakers in five hours in the House of Representatives. We had a Senate inquiry. In 2003 through to 2004, the bill was re-presented. We had 10 speakers in two hours and 57 minutes of debate. In this attempt to introduce voluntary membership of student unions, guilds and associations, we have had 31 speakers comprising just over 9½ hours of debate. We have also had another Senate I inquiry. I thank all of those who have contributed to the debate. The government believe very strongly, particularly in this early part of the 21st century, that students should be free to choose what services they will purchase with their money and what organisations they will join. We recognise that there have been many do changes in higher education, which is rapidly evolving. One-quarter of Australian university students do not set foot on campus; they are fully distance or online students. Amongst the many inequities about which we have heard is that this is a flat tax. The students from the poorest families pay exactly the same as those from the wealthiest, and we think that this is one of the few anachronisms which remain to be addressed. The government are very committed to this. I thank all of those who contributed to the discussion. Question put: That the bill be now read a second time. The House divided.

53,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Let me draw to the attention of the House the resolution carried this morning that says that the bill will be taken as a whole during consideration in detail for a period not exceeding 60 minutes. That is the procedure under which we are operating.,132
54,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"I move the amendment circulated in my name: (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 9-34) and page 4 (lines 1-3) omit subsections 19-37 (1), (2), and (3), substitute (1) A higher education provider must not: (a) require a person enrolled with, or seeking to enrol with, the provider to pay to the provider or any other entity an amount in respect of an organisation of students, or of students and other persons; unless the higher education provider has: (b) established a fund to be applied by or on behalf of the university towards academic support, academic advocacy and international student services, student welfare, cultural, sporting, health, and artistic purposes; and (c) provided that amounts from the fund may be applied to organisations and groups which apply the amounts: (i) only for purposes related to academic support, academic advocacy and international student services, student welfare, culture, sport, health or art; and (ii) only for the provision of facilities, services and amenities. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 will be extremely damaging to regional universities. I think that even the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is at the table, recognises, and has recognised through some of his previous comments, that there will be enormous damage to regional universities. Within the electorate of New England I have the University of New England. I had the honour of serving on the council of that university for a few years. I am very much aware of the activities that the union and other bodies-student representative bodies-provide within the University of New England and I praise them for their efforts over the years. The amendment that I have moved essentially allows all activities that have been provided within the university by the student fee to exist-other than the political activities that the government, the minister and some of the zealots within the Liberal Party believe should not occur. Personally, I do not have any problem with some degree of political activity within a university. I would have thought that a university is a place where people come together and learn to think and argue. But it seems that the government and others have a problem in relation to the use of a student fee, a compulsory fee, to finance political activities that may advantage one side of the political equation or the other. At the University of New England, contrary to the prevailing wind that seems to be blowing around this chamber, the Liberal Party-the Young Liberals in particularhave used and abused the privileges of the university to their advantage. So wiping out the very people that the government is saying it would like to wipe out at that university will in some way be wiping out its own kind. At the University of New England something like 49 activities are funded through this fee. The amendments provide for all those activities to be maintained and for the removal of the ability to use the fee for political activities, which is a very small proportion of the total use of the fund. I do not believe-and I do not agree with the government-that we should throw the baby out with the bath water on this particular issue. I listened intently to some of the National Party members in this chamber when they delivered their speeches. I do not believe that they believe in this either. I am very pleased that Senator Joyce has taken a solid stance on this matter in the Senate, and I would encourage him to stand up for regional people and maintain his stance. I am confident that this legislation will be defeated in the Senate. It has been promoted by a number of people who, in their own minds, still have not left university. I think it is about time they grew up on this issue and started to look at the damaging impacts this measure will have on sporting and cultural facilities, on cafeterias, on help for students and on a whole range of activities. I am aware that the Labor Party has an amendment, which I will be supportive of. It is more far-reaching than my amendment. The sole purpose of my amendment is to preserve all of the so-called good activities and to remove-from the point of view of the half a dozen zealots in the Liberal Party-the so-called offensive activity of using students' fees to fund political activities when some students would prefer that money not be used for that purpose. In conclusion, I do not believe the minister has his heart in this issue and I think it a shame that he has to go to this extent to curry favour for a few votes for the deputy leadership of the party at some later time. I do not think we should be using our students as pawns in another political activity.",132
55,Mr KEENAN,NOES,"I have got some news for the member for New England: the Minister for Education, Science and Training does have his heart in the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005, and he has his heart in it because he believes in freedom of choice. He does not believe in allowing a small band of students to compulsorily acquire people's money and then misuse it in the way it has been misused for many years within university campuses across Australia. This bill is long overdue and when it is passed by this parliamentMs Macklin- Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that this legislation is at the consideration in detail stage. We are now considering an amendment moved by the member for New England. I would bring the member back to the point under debate.",134
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I think the member for Stirling is in order but he should confine himself to the amendment.,134
57,Mr KEENAN,NOES,"I am talking about the bill and the amendment before the House, and I am in order. Ms Macklin-That's not for you to decide!",134
58,Mr KEENAN,NOES,"I will leave that up to your judgment, of course, Mr Deputy Speaker. With your protection, I will continue. I have rarely heard such nonsense in this chamber as that which has been put about by the Labor Party on this bill. Outlandish claims have been made that we will close down student unions, adversely affect arts or sporting facilities on campus or close is down what I think is quite a proud tradition of political activism on university campuses. Just yesterday I sat in this chamber while the member for Oxley came in and said that the Liberal Party hates university students. This is apparently what passes for coherent and logical argument in the Labor Party. The reality is that the government do not have a vendetta against student unions. What we are asking is that they be called to account for the services they provide for their members and that they provide services that Australian students actually support. We want to give students the freedom to choose what services they use whilst they are enjoying their student life. It is a fundamental freedom that we grant to every other section of Australian society. The Liberal Party supports and recognises the contribution that university students make to this great nation. Quite a few of us have been students ourselves. The Labor Party opposition to this bill is not based on the needs of students. That is what is so offensive about their opposition: they are not concerned about the needs of students. What they are concerned about is protecting their political fellow travellers and the quarter of a million dollars that the student unions spent campaigning for the Labor Party in the last federal election. Their opposition to this bill is really based on protecting their mates who have given them money. I will go over what the National Union of Students spent in the last federal election campaign. They spent $75,000 on broadcasting electoral advertisements, over $40,000 publishing such electoral advertisements, nearly $50,000 producing campaign materials such as how-to-vote cards, posters or pamphlets and just under $90,000 on direct mailing. I have absolutely no problem with students or students unions supporting the Labor Party. But what I will say is that, if you want to play politics, if you want to get involved in the political process, then do not do it with other people's money. Be prepared to put in your own. I cannot emphasise this point enough. The Labor Party are opposing this particular bill because they are protecting their mates who gave them a quarter of a million dollars in the last election campaign. I will make this point: the return mailing address for the National Union of Students that was registered with the Australian Electoral Commission is care of Trades Hall in Victoria. So they are really paid-up members of the Labor movement and you are just protecting your mates in opposing what is a very sensible measureMr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are debating the amendment and the amendment does not say anything about that. The amendment splits the political side from the recreational side. The member is not saying anything about the bill whatsoever.",134
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Stirling is ranging pretty widely but is out of keeping with the consideration in detail stages such as we have had previous to this day.,135
60,Mr KEENAN,NOES,"I will address this issue of an amenities fee. The fact is that people pay amenities fees when they use services. I have absolutely no problem with somebody paying an amenities fee if they want to pay a particular fee to use a squash court or something, but the point is that the user pays for it. (Time expired) Mr Anthony Smith interjecting Mr Katter interjecting",135
61,Mr ANDREN,NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, could I ask for a little bit of silence in the chamber; it is a little bit tracting.",135
62,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Kennedy and the member for Casey: the member for Calare has the call.,135
63,Mr ANDREN,NOES,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the member for New England. I would like to put on the record a couple of the observations that I wished to add to the second reading debate, which has been denied. The Minister for Education, Science and Training told me in question time yesterday that Charles Sturt University collects something like $1.9 million in student union fees, with 3,000 on-campus students and 4,000 external students. He seems to suggest-and I would like him to correct this if it is not the case-that this amount is not accountable and the external students do not use the union services. On that first point, the fact is that the CSU Students Association is an incorporated body operating within ASIC guidelines. It is audited yearly by an external accountancy firm and it submits those annual results to the CSU council. Expenditure is accountable to the board, on not which there is university representation. On the other point, about the access of external students of CSU to the provisions of services by the association, the fact of the matter is that there is a range of services supplied to external students both when they attend campus and when they carry out their distance education. The association is there to represent them in the provision of services, and to the executive of the university in any disputes over marking and also the provision of services when they attend their block release, their study periods on campus. Apart from all that there is transport; counselling; insurance; accommodation support for when they come to campus, or when they are full-time students; advocacy; sport; recdis- reation; and, yes, some political activitybut that, as the member for New England pointed out, is a very small part of the services provided. As the member for Riverina alluded to in her contribution to the second reading debate, the National Party seem to be very ambivalent about this bill. They know the contribution of students associations, particularly those of the Charles Sturt University campuses in Dubbo, Albury, Wagga, Bathurst and Orange. I call on the members representing those particular campuses to put forward a fair representation of the work the student association provides and the services it provides for the students in those regional areas. One issue that the previous speaker, the member for Stirling, alluded to was that these so-called associations are nothing more than radical political organisations. I take him back to the years when there was really some quite radical activism on the campuses-which, indeed, led to a change in policy on, say, the Vietnam War. No-one would advocate violence or anything similar, but compare the sort of tame political activity on campuses today with what it might be. I would like to see the students out marching against the war in Iraq a bit more, and really raising those issues as they once did so bravely on the streets when the Vietnam demonstrations occurred. I point to the Curtin University paper, which clearly demonstrates the disastrous impact of voluntary student unionism when it was introduced to that campus under the voluntary membership system. Since the amended legislation from 2002, which abolished voluntary membership, the Curtin guild has been able to rebuild those services that were lost, with proper requirements on how that money is spent. That is the tenor of the member for New England's amendment and I support it strongly.",135
64,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,NOES,"This amendment moved by the member for New England is a lazy amendment. It shows that he has not done the work at all. It is an amendment that would maintain compulsory membership. It is an amendment where-as his good friend the member for Kennedy, who sits next to him, said-he seeks to split compulsory fees for what he thinks are political activities from sporting and catering activities. If you listened to the that member for New England, and indeed the member for Jagajaga and those opposite, you would be forgiven for thinking that catering, sport and all of those things were actually invented by universities, that they do not happen in the rest of society. This debate, and the amendment moved by the member for New England, characterises so many things about those opposite. It is a pity for the people of the electorate of New England that he has joined those in the Labor Party in denying students choice. That is what this debate is about. In Australia, students who are 18 years of age are entrusted to have a drivers licence, enrol to vote and purchase goods and services in an international economy, with one exceptionthat is, union membership on campus. Without it they cannot attend a lecture, they cannot attend a tutorial and they cannot get a degree, and now the member for New England thinks that, somehow, there is some cute way that he can split these things and that somehow students must be forced to join a student union. There are those who doomsay about voluntary student unionism, including the previous speaker, the member for Calare, and those opposite, but in their speaking to this amendment you do not hear a word of criticism about student unions today. You do not hear a word of criticism about the Melbourne University Student Union, which, with compulsory membership, went broke. What sorts of services did students get for their money at Melbourne University, whose union went broke? With Laborite activists running that union, what sorts of catering services and what sort of value for money did those students get? Those opposite and the member for New England have this implicit notion that if you take the truly dangerous step, in their frame of mind, of giving students on Australian campuses a choice, they will not join a student union. That is their assumption. They say, ‘Students of Australia cannot be entrusted to decide for themselves whether to join a union.' The National Union of Students has consistently said that this legislation that the member for New England is seeking to amend should be withdrawn on the basis that surveys they have done show that 84 per cent of students oppose it. If that is the case, 84 per cent of students would join a voluntary union. What is there to fear about giving students the choice to join any union that provides any facilities? What is so frightening for those opposite about letting students determine the sorts of services they want on campus? That is what this bill will do. For those opposite, it is truly radical to give an 18-, 19or 20-year-old the choice to join a union. What is so wrong about letting students decide on the sorts of services they want? Why should the member for New England decide those sorts of services? That is what this debate has been about. Mr Crean interjecting",136
65,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,NOES,"It is great that in this debate we have the dinosaur of the Victorian division of the Labor Party here, who of course was sustained for so many years by the people he now in his final days here tries to protect. The member for Hotham was sustained by Labor students who, of course, have now turned on him in his own seat. This is a long overdue bill. (Time expired)",137
66,Mr KATTER,NOES,"Kennedy) (12.33 pm)There are some very decent people in the Liberal Party and at the universities, but I interviewed a person for a job and I said, ‘What do you think about the Liberals on the campus?' She said, ‘They're a sort of pimply faced little brigade who run around looking for something to be earnest about.' My colleague the member for New England commented that a lot of these people have not really changed. That pimply faced brigade, as this woman described them, have come into this place and they really have not changed. We had the intellectual tour de force, the member for Casey, speaking a moment ago, yelling out that we do not do any work. Well, actually, I have audited 37½ hours of travel every week for a three-month period. Last weekend I had entire workdays on both the Saturday and the Sunday, and if the member for Casey thinks I am not working down here he can come up and sit in my office, and then he might be doing something useful with his time. Mens sana in corpore sanoMr Anthony Smith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw to your attention the fact that the member for Kennedy is not speaking on the amendment, in talking about his travel. Since he raised it, I was referring to his",137
67,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! Resume your seat, member for Casey. I hear your point of order. The member for Kennedy is ranging widely, but no more widely than the member for Stirling did.",137
68,Mr KATTER,NOES,"I was just answering the charges that were laid against me by this brilliant intellectual fellow over here. Mens sana in corpore sano were the words used in conjunction with educational institutions throughout the world. Translated, it means: a healthy mind in a healthy body. That was a concept put to people when the idea of a university was put forward. In my years at university, every afternoon each of the colleges at the University of Queensland would go down onto the oval and play touch football. It was one of the most enjoyable pastimes that I think all of us participated in in those days. Also, if you are sitting there all day long, there are health and obesity issues that set in as a result of the very nature of sity life. What these people are doing here today is taking away from the regional universities the right to do that, because there is no way legally that a regional university will be able to raise the money to provide for the upkeep of those ovals and those facilities. So these people have taken them away from the regional universities, and for most of them, who went through the sandstone universities, their facilities will stay in place. The people of regional Australia have really had a gutful of this sort of treatment continually coming from this side of the House, and possibly they are even worse than the last lot. Maybe a quarter of Australia's Olympians come from on campus. They use these facilities regularly. If we have had good performances internationally, it is because of the istence of those facilities. Again, the more well-looked-after people in society sit on the government side of the House, and they probably can have access to facilities elsewhere and can pay for those facilities. But the average person who does this and aspires to Olympic representation needs those facilities if they are going to compete and perform. We are watching today yet another facility provided to regional and rural Australia being taken away from us under the guise and the clothing of some sort of principle that those in this pimply faced little brigade, who used to run around the university looking all of the time for a cause, are still living out. They have an arrested development which is creating a problem for all of us.",137
69,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,"I have some brief comments to make in relation to comments made about the amendment. The member for Stirling spoke about choice. He based his argument totally on choice. It is a fallacious argument, to say the least. You would be fully aware that the univerWorkplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005, which we passed this morning, states I think at page 181, under the prohibited content provisions, that when an AWA is structured between a worker and a boss and they are in agreement-and they have had the choice of agreement-or with any other agreement, the minister of the day, not necessarily today's minister but the minister for industrial relations, can intervene in that agreement. And you say that you represent choice. That is not choice. Government members are absolutely hypocrites on this particular issue of choice. The issue here is the provision of services to country students in regional universities that will not have the capacity to pay for the services that some of those kids will need. Are you suggesting that someone at a univerex- sity who has been raped or gone through some great degree of mental trauma is suddenly going to have the capacity to go and pay for services in a community that may not even have those services to assist them? These are the sorts of services that are being provided by that fee. I would hope my son or daughter would never need those services. But if those services are not there for people who may require some assistance that could save their lives in relation to some of these issues, that is what you are talking about here. You are not talking about replacing those services. You are saying that, if you are going to go out there and be raped, make sure there is a service in your university or in your town that will be there to assist you. That is the choice you are presenting. Ms Panopoulos- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That language was very unparliamentary and reflected on members on this side of the House. It was extremely offensive to use a criminal offence of rape as an example, and I request that you consider asking the member for New England to withdraw that statement unreservedly.",138
70,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,I heard nothing unparliamentary. Has the member for New England concluded his remarks?,139
71,Mr WINDSOR,NOES,Yes.,139
72,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The question is that the amendment moved by the member for New England be agreed to. A division having been called and the bells having been rung,139
73,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! As there are fewer than five members on the side of the House for the ayes in this division, I declare the question negatived, in accordance with standing order 127. The names of the members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.",139
74,Ms MACKLIN,NOES,"Jagajaga) (12.45 pm)by leave-I move opposition amendments (1) to (7) as circulated in my name: (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 9-17), omit subsection 19-37(1), substitute: (1) A higher education provider must not: (a) require a person to be or to become a member of an organisation of students, or of students and other persons; or (b) require a person enrolled with, or seeking to enrol with, the provider to pay to the provider or any other entity an amount for membership of an organisation of students, or of students and other persons; unless the person has chosen to be or to become a member of the organisation. (2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 18-22), omit subsection 19-37(2), substitute: (2) A higher education provider must not require a person enrolled with, or seeking to enrol with, the provider to pay the provider or any other entity an amount for the provision of an amenity, facility, activity or service that is not of an academic nature, unless that amenity, facility, activity or service is of direct benefit to students enrolled with, or seeking to enrol with the provider. (2A) In this section a direct benefit in relation to amenities, facilities, activities or services for students who are enrolled or seeking to enrol with a provider, is the provision of: (a) food and beverages, meeting rooms, sports and physical recreation, child care, counselling, legal advice, health care, housing, employment, visual arts, performing arts and audio-visual media, debating, libraries and reading rooms, academic support, personal accident insurance for students, orientation information, support for overseas students, student representation and advocacy, student clubs and societies, social activities, cultural activities, welfare, commercial activities, capital funds and infrastructure, investments and reserves, student publications, or student financial assistance; and (b) administrative matters related to any of the items listed in paragraph 2A (a) , including the costs of collecting amounts paid under this section; and (c) other facilities, services consistent with, or reasonably incidental, to any of the items listed in paragraph 2A (a) .

(6) Schedule 1, item 4, page 5 (lines 23-28), omit the item. (7) Schedule 1, item 7, page 6 (lines 3-5), omit the item. While I recognise that the member for New England's amendment was an improvement on the government's bill, Labor's view is that it did not go far enough. The amendments I am now moving go further, to make sure that we protect university student services while giving students the choice of whether or not they wish to belong to their student organisation. I will quickly run through the amendments so that they can all be dealt with together. Amendment (1) enshrines student choice about whether or not they wish to become a member of their student union. It is important that members of the government recognise that the vast majority of Australia's universities recognise this as a reality already. There are only three universities where membership is not a requirement of enrolment. We have certainly moved on from the Liberals' tired old debate about compulsory membership. Unfortunately, it seems to be the case that the government are still fighting campus battles they lost back in the 1970s. Amendment (2) provides that universities can levy a compulsory fee for amenities and services. The critical thing about this part our amendment is that these amenities and services must be of direct benefit to students. Section (2A) lists a range of amenities, facilities, activities and services on which money can be spent. Section (2B) reflects the section of the government's bill that still lows universities to charge ancillary course fees related to a student's course. Section (3) of amendment (3) mandates for the first time-and I say to the government that it would be very important that they recognise this as part of our amendment-pro rata adjustments in fees for part-time external or distance education students. Section (4) establishes for the first time tough new accountability and reporting arrangements and requirements on the ways fees are collected and spent, including how universities and other organisations are to account for moneys collected from students. I ask the government to recognise that. Amendments (4), (5), (6) and (7) delete various aspects of the government's bill, including the punitive penalty regime, which seeks to impose outrageous penalties on universities that seek to levy amenities fees so that they can provide these very important services for their students. Overall, Labor's very sensible compromise amendments do not allow compulsory student union membership. They allow universities to charge a compulsory services and amenities fee and they specify a range of amenities, facilities, activities and services on which moneys can be spent. Those include child care, sports facilities, advocacyparticularly when, for example, students come into dispute with the universitycounselling, orientation information and cultural activities. I am sure members of the government have seen the full page ad that was in the Australian today. A huge number of great Australian artists and sports heroes of from around Australia, including people like Cate Blanchett, Kevan Gosper and Stuart MACGill have spent their money-not the government's money-to say to the government, ‘Think again and make sure that these amenities and cultural services can continue alon our university campuses.' We do know that there should be tough accountability and reporting arrangements. This is a sensible way to protect vital campus services. It is high time that we got over the very tired Liberal Party debate about compulsory student unionism. We know many of you lost your fights back in the 1970s and the 1980s. The fight from the university forecourt is over for you guys. It is time to recognise that you have to stop playing student politics in the Liberal Party and support the amendments that Labor have put forward so that these services can continue.",139
75,Ms PANOPOULOS,NOES,"Indi) (12.50 pm)What a facade; what a fraud! The amendment that has been put up in the name of the member for Jagajaga is modelled on the Victorian version of so-called VSU, but it is worse than that. We have been told that students will not be forced to join a union-but they will be forced to pay money to support the services of their union. Essentially it is taxation without representation, and that is a fraud. To say that no-one will be forced to join a union but that they still have to hand their money over is even worse. In the Victorian so-called compromise legislation, which is not as extreme as the member for Jagajaga's, we have seen some extraordinary use of student money. If we have seen disgraceful examples of the wasting of student money on nutty causes and partisan political campaigns under that legislation, what can we expect under the amendments from the member for Jagajaga? In Victoria under the so-called amenities fee we have seen $6,600 spent on migration agent fees to fight the deportation of an gal immigrant. Perhaps that would fall under the category of health-the mental health of that particular illegal immigrant. We have seen $3,000 spent on criminal fines for students charged with violent protest and we have seen entertainment costs of $5,000 at national protests. Perhaps these fell under the category of cultural or artistic endeavours. These are essentially political activities. You can mask them in whatever way you like. You can call them essential services. Perhaps when the member for Jagajaga and other members of the Labor Party were at university, they did not have the initiative to engage, as other adult students do, in their own cultural and entertainment activities but needed other students to subsidise them. Life on campus is not determined by compulsorily acquired union funds. The member for Jagajaga, being a Victorian, neglects to mention all the other political activities that have been funded under this fraud of a so-called VSU. The Monash University Students Association after the tragic S/11 event produced stickers that read ‘Bomb the White House'. Gee, that was really an essential service of direct benefit students! It was quite a disgrace. The member for Jagajaga did not like the member for New England's amendment because it did not go far enough. We can always rely on members of the Victorian Labor Party to go further than any other state branch of the Labor Party, so far removed are they from the mainstream. We have social activities deemed to be of direct benefit to students. How patronising and how pathetic. The member for Jagajaga's amendment is actually one of the most patronising and deceitful amendments we have seen with regard to this legislation. They say they care for students services and they say they want to maintain a particular culture on ille- campus. But why do they assume that such services will collapse under voluntary student unionism? Are they saying that adult students who have been given the responsibility of voting at a federal election cannot make up their minds about what sorts of services they think would be of direct benefit to them? Do they need the patronising paternalism of the Labor Party's amendment to tell them what social activities are of direct benefit to them? It would be an absolute disgrace. We have seen the University of New England Students Association actually say: What some people don't realise is that the VSU legislation will not outlaw student unions. Rather, the legislation will ensure that students are afforded the right to choose whether or not they join and contribute financially to a union. In addition to enshrining a basic freedom, the VSU legislation will ensure that unions are more responsive to needs of students, only offering relevant and in-demand services and representation. That is the key to the government's legislation. It is not only to give adult students a choice but also to make student organisations accountable. We have seen that the so-called compromise halfway measure does not work. It has not worked in Victoria and it will not to work nationally. The member for Jagajaga does not fool anyone on this side of the House, even though she may point to expensive newspaper as and even though people like Kevan Gosper may be supportive.

76,Ms KATE ELLIS,NOES,"I rise to support Labor's sensible compromise amendments, which would protect student services while giving students the choice of whether or not they wish to belong to a student organisation. Ms Panopoulos-It's a fraud and you know it.",143

78,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Adelaide will refer her remarks through the chair. The member for Indi will cease interjecting.,143
79,Ms KATE ELLIS,NOES,"I think it is absolutely shameful that, along with a lot of other members who represent many students and have a right to represent those constituents in this place, this is the only opportunity that I have had to contribute to this debate. My electorate includes two universities and several campuses. I have thousands of students within my electorate who feel very strongly about this issue. I would also like to contribute to this debate, because, unlike many of the members opposite, who probably received their degrees when there was free education and they were living in a completely different set of circumstances to those that students face today, I was a student recently. I was probably the last member of this House to actually be a full-time student and I would like to comment on some of the experiences I had. I support the member for Calare, who said that students today face a vastly different set of circumstances. Students are paying increasingly greater sums of money for their degrees. People are working longer and longer hours on the side to support themselves and more than ever people need the support of their student organisations. We all know that the government's attack is aimed at silencing opposition. We have seen it silencing the opposition in the House and we have seen it in the Senate. I have some advice for the government: if you want students to stop opposing you, if you want students to stop protesting against you, then rather than going to this extreme legislation, why don't you stop ripping out their funding, why don't you stop ripping away their support mechanisms and why don't you stop attacking their student organisations? That is a much easier way. The government's attack is particularly aimed at the representative arm of student organisations, though the consequences will be felt far more widely. I absolutely defend the role of student organisations to represent their students to the government, but we need to understand that those representative arms of student organisations also play a very important role in representing students to the university. I did have personal experience within my student organisation and I stand here, proud that I actually stood up and fought for students. I wish more members opposite would do that now. Mr Keenan-You don't need to take other peoples' money!",143
80,Ms KATE ELLIS,NOES,"No, you do not compulsorily take other members' money. The other thing we should keep in mind is that every South Australian university has an optout provision from their student unions. Do you know what? It is not very well taken up. Also, when we talk about choice, we should keep in mind that every single university in this country has democratic elections, where students decide who represents them and who spends those fees. Many members opposite would know this, because most universities actually have Liberal students who run on a pro-VSU line. Unfortunately for the members opposite, they just do not get elected, because that is not what students want. Getting back to my point, student organisations play an important role in representing students to their universities. When at university I represented students on student appeals committees when they were being charged with offences against the university and needed representation. I also represented students on equal opportunity boards, on the university council and on both chancellor and vice-chancellor selection committees. Who is going to play this role if the government gets its way? Where is the students' voice? The effects will be felt far wider than the representative arms of student organisations. Labor's sensible amendments aim to protect many of the services which student organisations deliver on our campuses. In my state of South Australia these services include: 24hour computer access, the Flinders University parent centre-which the member for Boothby proudly stood alongside in photos that he sent out in his electorate-an employment service, an academic rights officer, women's rooms, music, sport, safe spaces, taxation assistance, welfare services and a whole range of other services which we must protect. I believe that universities must remain a place of ideas and a place for fostering debate and inspiration. They must remain a place of vibrant campus culture, a place for sport, a place for art, a place for music and a Bartlett, K.J. place where students have a voice. In consideration of this, the Labor Party's amendments must be supported by all of us here. Question put: That the amendments (Ms Macklin's) be agreed to. The House divided.

84,Mr ANDREWS,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (1.24 pm)-I move: That the requested amendments be made. The Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 clearly demonstrates the government's commitment to giving people of working age every opportunity to move from welfare dependency into work. At the cornerstone of these reforms is the fact that the best form of welfare is a job. The reforms to the Social Security Act are significant because for the first time they will provide for the assessment of people based on their capacity and availability to work. This is a significant shift from the old paradigm in which people were assessed first and foremost on their incapacity or lack of availability to work. This approach has led to a situation where many Australians of working age have been condemned to a life on welfare in which their aspirations for a better have in many respects been cruelled. We as a society should never presume that people on welfare do not have the same desire that other Australians of working age have to succeed in life and participate in our nation's prosperity. The opportunity and ability to earn private income from a job should never be denigrated and nor should it ever be portrayed as a less desirable alternative to welfare. At a time of record economic growth and employment growth, there has never been a better time to provide the necessary assistance and support to people of working age to enter the labour force and secure a job. There are also a number of important reasons for seeking to increase labour force participation. These include the need to address the issue of a rapidly ageing population in which the supply of labour will decline over next 15 to 20 years and the current skilled and unskilled labour shortages in which business is struggling to fill vacancies and satisfy demand for goods and services. We therefore need to act to address such important economic and social policy issues in order to lock in sustained economic growth and lower unemployment for generations to come. The government has consulted widely with stakeholders on these reforms. The government listened closely to their concerns about the application of the compliance regime. The government also recognised the need for appropriate exemptions for principal carers who are foster carers, long-distance educators or home-schoolers, and who have a large family. In addition the government agreed to the provision of an income supplement for principal carers with exemptions, in order that they can receive the equivalent of the parenting payment single. Prior to the introduction of the bill the government also acknowledged that it is appropriate for single parents to retain access to life the parenting payment single until their youngest child turns eight, while requiring that they actively seek work once that youngest child reaches school age. The government will closely monitor the impact of the welfare to work reforms. To this end the government has accepted the recommendation of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in its inquiry into the Welfare to Work bill. The committee recommended that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations table in parliament on an annual basis key data on the implementation of the welfare to work package. The government's response is that it will provide separate reports on key data on the welfare to work measures. These will be included in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations annual report and those of the departments of the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Human Services. The government will also work closely with the Welfare to Work Consultative Forum on the implementation and monitoring of reforms. The forum's membership consists of the major stakeholders, including Mission Australia, ACOSS, the Smith Family, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Salvation Army, Catholic Welfare Australia and NATSEM. The government will continue to focus on employment demand-side strategies. The government also recognises the importance of providing employers with the information and assistance to make it easier for them to hire unemployed people. To this end, $50 million will be provided for more direct assistance and incentives to increase employment opportunities for parents, mature age people, the very long term unemployed and people with disabilities. The government is helping employers to create more flexible jobs to match the needs of people who maybe cannot work all day every day of the working week or people who need special equipment or modifications in the workplace. The challenge of implementing welfare reform is to get the right balance between obligations and support. This must be accompanied by appropriate incentives and support mechanisms to ensure that job seekers continue to be provided with services. The government believes that its reforms strike this balance. The majority of Australians would agree that it is not unreasonable to expect those people who are available and capable to work to participate in the work force. The economic and social arguments for such reform are both compelling and necessary. It is time to act. I commend the amendments to the House.",147
85,Mr BEAZLEY,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"The government has rammed the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005, the so-called Welfare to Work legislation, through the parliament-legislation that pushes people who are struggling right over the edge. There is no evidence that shows that dumping people onto a lower welfare payment will help them get a job. But good policy and true reform that is based on evidence does not mean anything to a government that is out of control, intent on lowering the living standards of Australians, starting with the most vulnerable. John Howard has shown his contempt for democracy and proper parliamentary process by pursuing his ideology with such fervour. These laws are the final stage of the Prime Minister's tired old dreams becoming the new Australian nightmare. Make no mistake about it: with a fixation on ideological obsessions, the Prime Minister and his government have recast Australia with the American dye-an Australia where many single-parent families and people with disabilities will rely on soup kitchens and charity to get by. These are some of the most disadvantaged Australians, but they are also our neighbours, our sisters and brothers, our parents and our friends. These laws say that if you are unemployed you can be paid dirt or get nothing at all. No matter how bad the job offer, a welfare recipient has to take it or lose income support payments. This is about lower wages. It is about worse conditions and no real protection from exploitation. Such disadvantage is the inevitable consequence when you tear at a nation's social fabric, when you assign moral failure to the vulnerable, when you dismiss people who are struggling as lazy or morally defective. John Howard's and Kevin Andrews's idea of reform does not encompass giving disadvantaged Australians the help and support they need to live with selfrespect and dignity, the chance to realise their potential through education and training, universal health care and fairness in the workplace. At the cold heart of this so-called reform package is a cut to payments-this government's attempt to address complex issues with a financial sledgehammer. In my 25 years in parliament I have never seen anything so fundamentally out of touch with basic Australian values as the industrial legislation we have just discussed and this. It is so deliberately targeted to undermine the security of Australian families; it is so ful. With the passing of this bill, vulnerable Australians begin a race to the bottom. This legislation creates an army of working poor that competes in a no-win race for low-paid work. John Howard is determined to tear this country apart, set worker against worker and family against family and breed two Australias: lucky and unlucky. After 9½ long years of the Howard government and its sustained attack on the most vulnerable, we will continue to stand up and fight to push fairness back on the national agenda. We support welfare reform that goes far beyond moving people from one welfare queue to the dole queue. We believe people who can work should work, and those who cannot we should care for. Everyone benefits when more people participate in the social and economic mainstream. That is why we want real reform that tackles the reasons someone is not working and delivers practical solutions. Real welfare reform gives people the chance of getting the skills an employer needs. Real welfare reform encourages employers to give people with disabilities the opportunity to demonstrate their ability. Real welfare reform understands that being a parent is an important job in itself and that work makes families more secure. Real welfare reform helps parents find the balance between supporting their family and raising their kids. Real welfare reform involves strong support from government in breaking down barriers to participation such as skills, work-family balance and employer attitudes, alongside fair and reasonable requirements for job seekers. And real welfare reform makes sure people get a fair reward for effort. The policies we take to the next election will be based on these Labor principles, and we will argue for real welfare reform until we are in government to deliver it. We will bring the right incentives, practical measures and a comdeceitmitment to making Australia the truly advanced and civilised society it can be. That is why, even at this late stage, the government should back off. When it eventually comes back here the House should reject the bill.",149

87,Dr NELSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (1.34 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill before us, which had been introduced into the Senate, contains measures which will enhance the legislative framework under which Australia's higher education system now operates. In particular the bill will strengthen the accountability arrangements already in place under the Higher Education Support Act 2003, so that the Australian government and Australian students can be assured that all higher education providers have structures and procedures in place which are fair, transparent and accountable. The bill will clarify the fairness requirements in the act to ensure that higher education providers' selection procedures are based on merit in the providers' ‘reasonable view'. This amendment reflects the Australian government's policy that all higher education providers, public and private, must have open, fair and transparent selection procedures in relation to students. The bill will provide for ministerial discretion to require an audit to be conducted on the operation of non-table A providers to determine their adherence to the financial viability, fairness, compliance and contribution and fee requirements of the act. It is envisaged that such compliance audits would be conducted on an ‘as required' basis, rather than on a regular or cyclical basis. The bill will also clarify the requirements that need to be satisfied before a person is taken to be a Commonwealth supported student. These measures are designed to make certain that students are properly informed and protected about decisions made by higher education providers which affect them. The bill will also make some minor technical revisions to the Higher Education Support Act 2003, including amending it to reflect the new business name of Open Learning Australia: Open Universities Australia, clarifying that the guidelines for ‘incidental fees' and fees in respect of overseas students are to be specified in the Higher Education Provider Guidelines rather than the Commonwealth Grant Scheme Guidelines, and clarifying the definition of ‘student load' relates to a bridging course for overseastrained professionals. The bill also amends the Australian National University Act 1991 to repeal an obsolete heading. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",150

We all remember that the Higher Education Support Act was supposed to be the grand recasting of Australia's university system in the Howard government's image-an extraordinarily disturbing image. After the second year of the operation of this act we have higher fees, fewer students and less research. What an extraordinary report card for this government and this minister! Higher fees, fewer students and less research-that is what the Minister for Education, Science and Training has managed to achieve in his time as minister. This government, instead of trying to rebuild our university system so that our country can have world-class universities and excellent teaching and research, is preoccupied with its extreme ideological vendettas. We have just seen a debate gagged and legislation rammed through the parliament by a government that is determined to ferociously attack anything that is called a union, whether it be an industrial union or a student union. We have seen two pieces of legislation rammed through the parliament this morning because of this government's ideological vendettas. Unfortunately, many areas of higher education that need this government's attention are not adas it dressed in this bill. Therefore, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) breaking its promise not to increase the 35 per cent cap on full fee paying domestic undergraduate places; (2) failing to provide adequate indexation of university funding; (3) failing to provide enough university places to meet the high levels of unmet demand from eligible Australian applicants; (4) pushing Australian universities further down an American style user pays university system, and (5) pursuing an extreme ideological agenda, including measures such as punitive workplace relations requirements and so-called voluntary student unionism, instead of adequately addressing the real issues facing Australian universities”. The minister has just set out what this bill seeks to do. The bill makes many small changes that clarify the definition of student load, ensure that the guidelines for incidental fees in relation to overseas students are specified in the Higher Education Provider Guidelines rather than the Commonwealth Grant Scheme Guidelines and establish the requirements that must be satisfied in order that a person will be regarded as a Commonwealth supported student. The bill also removes an obsolete provision of the Australian National University Act 1991 and corrects a minor drafting error contained in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. An additional component of this bill is the change in name of the organisation formerly known as Open Learning Australia to its new incarnation as Open Universities Australia. The opposition supports this particular amendment because, as I am sure you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, Open Learning Australia, now Open Universities Australia, was a very important policy initiative of the previous Labor government. Indeed, the creation of Open Learning Australia is an example of what distinguishes federal Labor's approach to education and training from the policy agenda of the present government. As I am sure everyone would know, Open Learning Australia was established as part of an integrated and forward-looking public policy framework designed to make sure that non-traditional modes for the delivery of higher education-flexible delivery-were available, particularly for those who are not able to get to university during the day. It was also part of a significant commitment by Labor to lifelong learning. The establishment of Open Learning Australia also responded to the shifting patterns of life and work that many Australians face, whether individuals or families. Open Learning Australia provided an opportunity for the flexible delivery of courses so that individuals could study online or at night in a way that suits their lifestyles and time constraints. By contrast, we have not had from this government and this minister any imaginative initiatives such as Open Learning Australia. All we have had from the federal government is a preoccupation with massive fee hikes for both HECS places and full-fee places. This can really be summed up as the Americanisation of our university system. Universities have been starved of resources following the savage cuts to operating grant funding imposed in the Howard government's very first budget. The reduction of funding by this government now amounts to about $5 billion and it has been exacerbated by the government's refusal over the last nine years to introduce a fair and reasonable system of grant indexation. This is despite the fact-and no member of the public will be surprised at this-that the Howard government went to the 1996 election promising not to reduce Commonwealth funding of universities by one dollar! This was yet another broken promise from this government. There have been no serious policy initiatives from the Howard government on a par with the creation of Open Learning Australia. Contrast the establishment of Open Learning Australia with this government's ideologically fuelled attacks on vulnerable students: with the legislation that was pushed through the parliament just half an hour ago, there will be a withdrawal of support for essential university facilities. All the services and amenities that university students depend on will go. This government has also pushed through legislation that will force staff in universities onto Australian workplace agreements through the higher education workplace relations requirements. All we have seen in the nine long years of the Howard government is incompetence and underfunding and this is now taking its toll on our universities. I think an extraordinary achievement is that just last year, for only the second time 50 years, the number of Australians going to university declined. What an outrageous thing to happen. If you were education minister, how shameful to have a reduction in the number of Australian students going to university. But that is what has happened under this education minister's watch. By contrast, we have seen education priorities distorted to make sure that universities can attract increasing numbers of fee-paying students from overseas. Growth in undergraduate places for local students has stagnated. This year about 20,000 qualified Australians were denied a place at university, all because this government just will not provide the places that are needed. We have seen massive fee hikes for Australian students; a drop in the number of Australians attending our universities; chronic underfunding of our universities, causing the vast majority of our universities to increase their fees; threats to standards and threats to the quality of university. All these things sum up the achievements of the Howard government. What we need in Australia is a government that is committed to higher education-a government that ensures that higher education is encouraged and that we have high-quality tertiary education for Australians, no matter where they live. By contrast, the Howard government has spent nine very long years starving our universities into submission. Now they are being forced to contemplate very radical restructures just to survive. The government our has introduced an extraordinary number of full-fee degrees, 60 of which now cost more than $100,000. Now some of our most prestigious universities are looking for opportunities to significantly expand the number of degrees that cost more than $100,000. That might benefit the prestigious universities. If that expansion of those full-fee degrees goes ahead, as the minister seems to be considerin ing, the prestigious universities will do okay, but it is quite plain that the minister has in mind that that will be at the expense of newer universities. The minister for education's plans for research are just as extreme. Minister Nelson has already warned some universities that they may end up with no research funding at all. The increased income from fees-the extra research resources for the relatively rich universities-will increase their ability to pay a premium to attract the best staff from other institutions. At the same time the Howard government, with its unwarranted industrial relations agenda, will encourage universities that are struggling to balance the books to drive down relative wages and become low-cost, high-volume institutions. So the pattern is very clear indeed. We will have a system of haves and have-nots for our universities, where the haves will continue to struggle to keep up with international standards, but the have-nots will, frankly, struggle to survive. This government likes to talk about diversity, but the reality is just the opposite. We need look no further than the uniformity of university responses to HECS increases. When the minister introduced partial deregulation of HECS a couple of years ago, he said he wanted diversity of fees around the country. One year into so-called ‘variable HECS', the variation is nowhere to be found. Only three universities in the whole country have resisted HECS increases; the rest of them have all put up their HECS fees. There is no diversity at all. We know that, without proper funding of our universities, it is only a matter of time before these last three also join the rush for desperately needed income, further burdening our students and their families with higher fees. It is the case that students are feeling it hardest. Compare what students paid when the Howard government was first elected with what they are paying now. Back in 1996, a law student paid $12,000 for their degree. The government has had its way over the last nine years, and they now pay about $40,000. So it has gone from $12,000, when this government was elected, to $40,000 now. In 1996, when the Howard government was elected, science students paid about $7,300 for their degree. Now they pay about $20,000 for a science degree. An arts student back in 1996 paid about $7,300 for their degree, whereas next year an arts student will pay about $15,000 for an arts degree. Students are paying more, but the reality is that the quality of their education is under threat. Student-staff ratios have increased by more than one-third since 1996, when there were 15.6 students per member of academic staff, to 20.7 students per staff member in 2004. The increased financial burden borne by our university students has been forced onto them to compensate for the drastic funding cuts this government has made. The most extraordinary thing is that Australia is one of the few developed countries where private contributions are now greater than public investment in tertiary education. That is a very recent phenomenon, once again the product of the Howard government.",151
89,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,What is wrong with that?,154
90,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"But the Howard government's thirst for fees is having a broader impact. HECS has become a giant burden on our students. The member asked what is wrong with that. I will tell him what is wrong with it. Young Australians are graduating from universities with massive debts, making it much harder for them to buy a home and start a family. They are having to delay buying a home and starting a family because their HECS debts are so high, all because the Howard government keeps hikthe ing them up. If you look at the tax office's latest figures-the member, of course, would not have any clue about the size of the debt that is owed by Australian students and graduates-they now owe over $13 billion in outstanding HECS debts in 2005-06, all because of the massive HECS rises that have been put in place by this government. What we know from the minister for education is that, unfortunately, it is only going to get worse. Just last month he opened the door to massive increases in full fee degrees for Australian students. In the context of a reform proposal released by the University of Melbourne, the minister was interviewed on ABC radio's PM program on 16 November this year, where he flagged further deregulation of Australian full fee degrees. When asked whether the current 35 per cent cap on domestic full fee paying undergraduate students would be lifted, the minister said, ‘It's something that I would be prepared to look at.' This is yet another broken promise from this minister for education. I contrast that latest effort from the minister for education with his remarks in the parliament on 15 June 2005. The minister for education said: The full fee cap is currently that no more than per cent of the students enrolled in a particular course should be full fee paying Australian students. We will not be increasing that cap. He has just thrown that promise out of the window-an extraordinarily quick backflip, even for the minister for education. You might say he is even giving some other members of his cabinet a run for their money when it comes to cabinet room acrobatics. This backflip will mean more Australian students will face American style fees of up to $200,000 or more. As I said before, we already have more than 60 degrees that cost $100,000 or more. A medical-law degree at Monash University costs a staggering $256,000; dental science at Melbourne university, $150,000; physiotherapy at the University of Queensland, $112,000; and medicine at Adelaide University, $151,000. So the list goes on: 60 different degrees that now cost more than $100,000, all as a result of the Howard government's changes. No ordinary Australian can pay anything like these amounts of money for a degree. This government is so out of touch with ordinary Australians that it thinks these sorts of fees are acceptable. Labor does not. We do not agree that anyone should have to pay $100,000 for a university degree, let alone $200,000. So we have waved there before us from the minister for education's latest backflip-laid bare-this government's real intention of Americanising our university system and forcing the full cost of university education onto our students. Labor is totally opposed to students being forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a university education. Back in 2003 the minister for education was cajoling the then Independent senators into agreeing to the 25 per cent HECS hike. At the time the minister for education made a commitment to review university funding 35 indexation arrangements, and he said, ‘I will have a review of indexation if you agree to the 25 per cent HECS hike.' He also made that agreement with the university sector. Of course, it has been the case, unfortunately, that both the senators and the universities have been completely done over. At this point I remind those people in the Senate who are about to debate the voluntary student unionism legislation not to believe the education minister when he comes bearing gifts. He came bearing gifts back in 2003 when he promised indexation reviews for university funding. He did not deliver any indexation for universities. Universities are still struggling to get the money that they need. Of course, we are going to have the same promise offered to senators in the next day or so. The minister is going to offer a bit of money-just a little bit of money-to National Party senators to try to get them to support this outrageous attack on university student services. It will be a little bit of money, but I say to all of those National Party senators not to believe for a minute that it will go anywhere near guaranteeing that those services on our university campuses continue and, of course, it will not be nearly enough to make sure that the services that students need in all of our outer suburban universities and all our inner city universities continue as well. Do not believe this minister when he comes bearing gifts because he has form. ",154
91,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"He promised indexation back in 2003. He did not deliver it; he had just a little internal review. He did not even allow the universities to make a contribution to the review. All we saw from this minister was a 25 per cent HECS hike. We have the member for Aston interjecting. The parents in Aston whose children currently want to get into Monash University are now facing HECS rises of 25 per cent. I hope the parents in Aston are listening to this. The member for Aston supports the 25 per cent HECS hike. The member for Aston supports students at Monash University paying $256,000 for a university degree. That is what the member for Aston has agreed to. That is what students at Monash University now face-a university degree that costs $256,000. The parents in the seat of Aston are worried about what is going to happen. They are already worrying about whether their children will get into university. The students have just been working very, very hard, finishing year 12. First of all, they will be ried about whether they will get a placethat is hard enough; secondly, they will be worried about whether their children will be able to repay their HECS debt, whether they will be able to afford a home, whether they will be able to start a family; and, thirdly, they cannot get a HECS place, this government has said to you that if you cannot get a HECS place you can pay up to $256,000 at Monash University. And the member for Aston not only voted for it but supports it.",155

93,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be absent from question time today and tomorrow.

NA Liberal Party: Leadership,156
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer stand by his view that the Prime Minister should stand aside before the next election?,156
95,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is based on a false premise. Economy,156
96,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer advise the House of the results of the September quarter national accounts released today by the Australian Bureau of wor- Statistics? What do they indicate about the Australian economic outlook?,156
97,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan. I can inform him that national accounts were released today which indicate the state of the economy in if the September quarter of 2005. Those national accounts showed that the economy grew by a modest 0.2 per cent for the quarter, and 2.6 per cent through the year. This comes after the strong growth we saw in the June quarter. Consumption has moderated, undoubtedly due to higher petrol prices. It appears that, with the house market turning down in value, consumers or home buyers have taken the opportunity to consolidate their balance sheets. The dwelling sector continues to experience a relatively mild downturn. Australia is in the midst of a very strong investment boom. Total new business investment rose another 2.5 per cent in the September quarter and is now 17.6 per cent higher through the year. This is supported by terms of trade which are as high as we have seen since 1974. It is also supported by the fact that business profits are higher as a percentage of total factor income than ever previously recorded in Australian history. Notwithstanding the rise in the terms of trade, inflation remains moderate. What that means is that the economy is now shifting from consumption to investment, we are lifting our capacity and we are now getting good strong infrastructure investment, which gives the opportunity to lift the capacity of the Australian economy and meet the boom in mineral commodities which is coming, led principally by China and to some degree India. That means we are building for the longer term. These infrastructure developments take time to be brought in but, as that capacity comes on line, I would expect Australia's exports to increase. For the member for MCMillan and others who are interested in economic prospects in this country, this means that the Australian economy continues to grow in a sustainable way, with unemployment as low as it has been for 30 years and inflation which is moderate and under control. It is important that we keep economic reform going in this country to lift productivity. Nothing could be more important than the industrial relations changes that have just been passed because they will give Australia the opportunities of the future. Liberal Party: Leadership",156
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confirm that on the Alan Jones program this morning he said: I'll be a candidate for the leadership if there vacancy, but there is no vacancy, and I have said so on many occasions and, frankly, I'm just sick of talking about it. When was the first occasion that the Treasurer stated his new white flag formula?",157
99,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Another false premise. And, of course, this has been stated as being my position over and over again so often that I am about as sick of saying this as I am of hearing questions from the Leader of the Opposition. NA",157
100,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen. On behalf of the House, I extend to her a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Workplace Relations",157
101,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of any recent surveys on the confidence of Australian employers and employees? Are there any alternative views?,157
102,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and for his continued interest in business and the opportunities for Australians in employment. I can inform him about a couple of recent surveys. Firstly, the Sensis business index for small and medium enterprises recently found that 15 per cent of small and medium businesses in Australia expect to increase the size of their work force in the next 12 months. If those businesses were to employ just one more person each, that would amount to over 150,000 new jobs in Australia. The outlook for employees is also good. Today the latest version of a regular Morgan is a poll on employee attitudes was released. This is an important longitudinal survey which has been conducted now for 30 years, since 1975, so it gives us a sense of the way in which employee attitudes have changed over that 30-year period. What today's release shows is that 83 per cent of Australian employees feel secure in their jobs, and that figure has risen by four per cent since December 2004-a very interesting figure. This is at a time when we have had the opposition running a scare campaign around Australia saying that, as a result of changes to workplace relations, the divorce rate will go up, the incidence of disease in Australia will go up and men, women and children will be killed on picket lines in Australia. Despite this hysterical campaign from the union movement and the Labor Party, this 30-year longitudinal study shows that the attitude towards job security of Australian workers is the highest that has ever been recorded. What is also interesting about this is that, when I looked into the 30 years of this longitudinal survey, I found that the highest level of job insecurity occurred in November 1992. And who was on the watch so far as employment policy in Australia was concerned in November 1992? None other than the member for Brand, the current Leader of the Opposition. No wonder there were high levels of job insecurity in 1992, because of course this was a time when the unemployment rate in Australia was 10.9 per cent. There were one million Australians who were unemployed as a result of the policies of the Australian Labor Party and the cabinet of which the Leader of the Opposition was then a member. What we see today is interesting because what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do for Australia is to roll us back to those policies which pertained in Australia in 1992, a time when the highest level of job insecurity was felt by Australian employees and a time when one million people were unemployed. That is the reality of what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do. That is what his roll-back is all about. On this side of polinomic tics, we will meet the challenges of the future in Australia. We will not go looking to the past like the Leader of the Opposition is doing. Mr Robert Gerard",157
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, why didn't your department perform the same detailed checks on Mr Gerard as are performed on other appointees to the Reserve Bank board?",158
104,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Gerard was treated in exactly the same way as other appointees. If this is a question about a story that I read in the paper today, which said that somebody had previously had an ASIO or security check, I have inquired of the department about that. The department have no record of any such check being made in rela me that they have never done it. Again, on a new day, there is another allegation, another falsity. The only thing that puzzles me about all of this is whether the Labor Party can get through another seven questions without mentioning interest rates, the economy, jobs, the national accounts or the trade position. I recall the Labor Party saying that it was going to try to build economic credibility after it lost its third election.",158
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. He has his claquers' questions on a routine basis. This was a very specific question about why he manifestly did not do the normal, routine checks on Mr Gerard.",158
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,158
107,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It remains to be seen whether the Labor Party can build any ecocredibility. It has not asked a question on the economy over the last two weeks, and it stands for nothing. NA",158

109,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House on the latest improvements to the management of cancer care in Australia?,159
110,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for his question. I can inform him and the House that cancer remains one of Australia's biggest killers, accounting for some 25 per cent of all deaths. One in three men and one in four women will have personal experience of cancer before the age of 75. But there is some good news: cancer death rates have been falling by about two per cent a year over the last decade. But the Howard government is certainly not going to rest on its laurels. This year's budget provided an additional $189 million for cancer initiatives, including $43 million to phase in a national bowel cancer screening program, $23 million for local palliative care grants, $22 million for clinical trial infrastructure and $17 million for dedicated cancer research. I can inform the House that the government has just announced the establishment of Cancer Australia, a new leadership body to coordinate and advise on cancer treatment, cancer research and cancer education. The chairman of the Cancer Australia advisory council will be Dr Bill Glasson, the former president of the AMA. I can also inform the House that the establishment of Cancer Australia has been widely welcomed, which is another sign that most Australians think our health system is in good hands under the Howard government. Taxation",159
111,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, are you aware",159
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,159
113,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You wish. Treasurer, are you aware that Commonwealth guidelines for prosecuting tax offences say: Offences involving taxation matters should be prosecuted by the DPP under the Crimes Act ... where ... serious fraud on the revenue was involved. Treasurer, do tax evasion allegations involving up to one-quarter of a billion dollars amount to serious fraud on the revenue? Is the Treasurer concerned that the ATO is not applying tax prosecution guidelines consistently? Will the Treasurer direct the Board of Taxation to investigate whether the ATO is consistently applying its guidelines?",159
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the Treasurer that he is not obliged to give a legal opinion, but there are other parts of the question that he can respond to.",159
115,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The enforcement of the guidelines of the Australian Taxation Office is a matter for the Australian Taxation Office. It is responsible for enforcing and following its own guidelines and it is the Commissioner of Taxation's obligation to enforce them. If allegations are being made against the Commissioner of Taxation, I suggest that the honourable member direct his questions to him. Automotive Industry",159
116,Mr RICHARDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister advise the House of government action to encourage investment and innovation in Australia's automotive sector?",159
117,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for his question and for his very strong support of the car industry, particularly in his electorate of Kingston, and for the investment that, with this government, he has worked to ensure continues to go into that area. When it comes to building a sustainable future for the car industry, this government's commitment is as strong as ever. We already back the sector to the tune of over $7 billion, which ensures that we create stimulation in the innovation and investment area of the car industry. Boosted by a strong economy and a government that is prepared to have the courage to put in place reforms that keep industry viable and give it confidence in the future, the car industry is rising to the challenges that it currently faces. In 2002-03, the car sector invested more than $630 million in automotive R&D-an increase of some $140 million on the previous year. This year in March, we saw Toyota announce a new R&D centre in Victoria and, only yesterday, we saw Holden announce that it would expand its Port Melbourne facilities to become the global hub of automotive design and engineering. GMH's design director, Tony Stolfo, said: It's just amazing to think about what that says about this country'sAustralia'screativity. From today, it says we can create cars for just about anyone, anywhere. I could not have said that better myself. Through innovation and investment, the Australian car industry is giving itself every chance for a strong and competitive future. By contrast, the Labor Party is working on a different agenda. At the last election, the Labor Party confirmed its commitment to abolishing Invest Australia-the very body that attracts investment to Australia in a whole range of areas, including the car industry. It has also committed to cutting $100 million from the automotive R&D schemethe same scheme that has seen this government contribute some $42 million to cuttingedge Australian car industry research. The Labor Party's anti-investment and antibusiness record speaks for itself. The Labor Party cannot be trusted with the future of Australian industry. Mr Robert Gerard",159
118,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that, according to the ATO's 2004-05 annual report, the total value of reparations for all tax evasion and fraud cases prosecuted in that year was less than that totalled for Mr Gerard? Is he also aware that, in the same year, the court sent some 102 people to jail for tax evasion and fraud for lesser amounts than that in the Gerard matter? Treasurer, why were these other matters prosecuted when the Gerard matter was not? Treasurer, we give you one more opportunity: will you now use your power to direct the Board of Taxation to investigate whether the ATO is applying its tax prosecution guidelines consistently?",160
119,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is a ridiculous question. The idea that the Treasurer of the day decides who gets prosecuted under the Income Tax Act, the idea that the Treasurer of the day is responsible for who gets prosecuted or the idea that the Treasurer of the day is responsible for enforcing guidelines is a complete nonsense. The Commissioner of Taxation is an independent statutory officer. He is an independent statutory officer for a very good reason: so that no politician would have the opportunity to influence the Commissioner of Taxation in prosecutions or in relation to the guidelines. This has always been the case and it always will be the case. If the honourable member wants to ask the commissioner, he should direct his question to the commissioner. Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Clearly, my question was whether the Treasurer was prepared to direct the Board of Taxation and not the Commissioner of Taxation.",160
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer has completed his answer. Voluntary Student Unionism,161
121,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister advise the House how the government plans to stop student union fees being used for political purposes? Are there any alternative views?",161
122,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I can inform the member for Stirling and indeed the House that the government is intending to do this with a very simple proposition-that is, every one of the 700,000 Australians who go to university will be free to choose whether or not they will join a student union, guild association. I am asked about alternative policies. On Monday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave a doorstop interview. It is a very interesting transcript. She was asked a question about who, under Labor's plan, would actually collect the compulsory Labor fees that would continue under Labor's plan. She said: ‘The universities-well, I'll double check. It's such a long time since we drafted it, actually.' In other words, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not even know what is in her own amendment. But she went on to say: ‘It's exactly what happens in Victoria now.' So the Labor Party plan, as it is, is how student unionism currently operates in the state of Victoria. So what happens in the state of Victoria? To give you some insight, the Australian newspaper on 25 October this year reported this: Monash University Students' Association president Nick Richardson said yesterday there was no barrier under the Victorian VSU model to spending student fees on political campaigns. “For us, it's totally meaningless,” he said. “The formula that was brought in depended on universities to implement it. In our situation, funding sources, other than the amenities fees, can be used for political activities. At the moment it's only a budgetary thing to get around VSU. The average Australian probably thinks, ‘Well, these are students who are having to part with their hard-earned money, many of them mature aged students getting an education.' In terms of what that money is currently used for in the state of Victoria under the Labor Party's plan, for example, it is reported in the Herald Sun of 23 November this year: Money from Victorian students has been used by the Monash University student union to pay an Iraqi oil worker with links to anti-coalition forces. or Minutes from a Monash Student Association meeting in May show the union gave $1000 to Foraok Isma'al as part of an Australian speaking tour for the union activist. Let us make it absolutely clear. Under Labor's plans, under the existing model in the state of Victoria, for those who support so called amenities fees, we have student union fees, forcibly appropriated from students who have no interest in this at all, funding a speaking tour by a southern Iraqi oil worker. If you want to know what this organisation is about, go to the Guardian newspaper on 18 February this year. In an article from Hassan Juma'a Awad, who is the general secretary of this oil company union, he said this: The resistance to the occupation forces is a Godgiven right of Iraqis, and we, as a union, see ourselves as a necessary part of this resistance ... It is enough that there are some Australians who think that they should seek to undermine the integrity and sovereignty of our country, but that the Labor Party should seek to",161

Treasurer, is it the case that making false or misleading statements to the tax office is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for up to 12 months?

140,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. Would the minister advise the House what the government is doing to provide older Indigenous Australians with better access to aged care and hearing services?,163
141,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and note his very deep interest in the well-being of Indigenous people in his electorate. The Howard government is committed to ensuring that older Indigenous Australians have access to appropriate aged care services. There are currently around 60 specifically funded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aged care homes. In addition to recurrent subsidies, the Australian government is now investing a further $10.3 million over four years by way of a viability supplement, recognising the particular difficulties of providthe ing aged care in rural and remote areas. I have visited a number of these homes. Recently, I visited some in Derby in the electorate of Kalgoorlie. I have also visited some in the electorates of Solomon and Leichhardt. I have been very impressed with the quality of care and the standards that are being achieved in these Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aged care homes. At the recent Ministerial Awards for Excellence in Aged Care, of the 10 national awards, two Indigenous workers were recognised for their contributions to culturally appropriate aged care. Last week, the Minister for Human Services and I announced a new program to assist older Indigenous Australians. Specifically, it is a free hearing assessment service and, if necessary, free hearing aids for older Indigenous Australians. We understand that about 20 per cent of older Indigenous Australians have reported hearing loss. We expect that the figure is in fact higher than that. This $10 million program will provide free hearvices ing assessment services and remedial action, if necessary, throughout Australia in rural and remote communities, including through mobile service units. This is another example of the Australian government developing policies and providing funding for practical assistance to older Indigenous Australians. Mr Robert Gerard",163
142,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statements in this place in relation to the Gerard appointment.

Treasurer, did your chief of staff contact the ATO in relation to any other appointments to Reserve Bank board? Did your chief of staff contact any other regulatory agencies in relation to the Gerard appointment?",163
143,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have checked with my chief of staff, and he has contacted the tax commissioner on other occasions-not in relation to the RBA board but on other occasions. In relation to this matter, as I said earlier, when he contacted the ATO he was told that confidentiality provisions prevented any information being given to him. I repeat again that he was not told about any of the matters which were in the Australian Financial Review-nor was I told about those matters, nor do I believe that any member of the opposition knew about them until they were published in the AFR, nor do I believe that any other media outlet knew about them, nor any television or radio outlet.

On behalf of the House I extend to her a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Taxation and Superannuation",164
153,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister please advise the House what financial benefits are provided to families by the government through the taxation and superannuation systems?,164
154,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for his interest in Australian families and their welfare as we lead into Christmas 2005. It was great news today that the RBA has ensured that variable home loan interest rates will not be going up. We are not going to see Australian families struggling away trying to find a few extra dollars for the interbank, which could have gone for kiddies' presents or perhaps a bit of Christmas fare. I remind the House that in 1995, as we headed into Christmas under a Labor government, those same families were slugged with a 10½ per cent interest rate on their mortgage-money which was going straight to the banks, not to the families. Moreover, these same families now have the benefit of ‘fool's gold'. ‘Fool's gold' is what it is known as by the member for Lilley; it is otherwise known as family tax benefit part A supplement. Take the average family in the electorate of Hasluck, with a couple of kids. If they put their tax in on time on 30 October, they could have received a supplement of $1,255.60. That is real money for real Australian working families to put towards the Christmas that they deserve-to have a holiday, to put a bit of Christmas fare on the table, to buy a gift for the kids. Mr Swan-It's not real.",164
155,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What does the member for Lilley think? The member for Lilley says, ‘It's not real.' The only thing that is not real is the attitude of the member for Lilley. I would like him to go to the families in Nundah or Margate in his electorate and say to them, ‘Oh, listen, that money you got the other day from tax-it's not real. Don't go and buy the kids a bike with that because it's not real; it will evaporate.' It will not evaporate under a coalition government, I can tell the member for Lilley. The member for Hasluck can tell his families that it will continue to expand every year under a Howard government. Because of the tax policies and the superannuation policies of the Howard government, the good news as we head into Christmas is that families in Hasluck and around Australia can feel more secure. As those families headed into 1995, they did have something to look forward to. We will come to that in a moment. What they had to look forward to was 7.3 per cent unemployment in the electorate of Hasluck. Today that is at 4.3 per cent. There are more Australians with jobs, doing something positive for themselves. What if that hard working family in the electorate of Hasluck, say in Forrestfield, wants to do a little bit of extra work? What if the husband or the wife says, ‘We're going to put a bit of extra time in here. We're going to add a few extra quid to put something special on for the kids.' In every hundred dollars extra they earned in overtime, that average family would have been paying $12 to $18money lost straight to the tax system. Today that money is in their pocket. They can decide what to do with it. They may even decide to put that money into the future. They may decide to put a bit of that money into superannuation. And do you know what, Mr Speaker? They will not only pay less tax; the Howard government will give them $1.50 for every dollar they put into their own superannuation so that they can build a benefit for today and into the future. That is what good policy is about. Those families can look forward to a child-care rebate into the future as well, as a result of the policies of the Howard government delivering real assistance for Australian families through positive taxation and positive superannuation, not the failed, lazy, dinosaur based policies presented by those opposite. Water Management",164
156,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It relates to the issue of compensation payable to water entitlement holders who will lose entitlement as part of the National Water Initiative process to achieve sustainable water use. Does the Prime Minister recall saying, on 9 June 2005, at the joint $150 million Commonwealthstate-irrigator announcement with the then Premier, Bob Carr, to protect ground water in New South Wales: You can't ask the farmers to take the financial hit of the investment in the changed practices without some help from the Government. Prime Minister, it has been determined that the receipt of adjustment funds to farmers announced on that day will now be taxed as income even though the compensation is for loss of a capital asset for environmental good. Prime Minister, the government has the power to reverse this decision. Will you reconsider the government's position on this issue?",165
157,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for New England for the question. I think, with respect, through you, Mr Speaker, I would say this to the member for New England: he has really raised two separate issues. The principles that I talked about when I made the announcement with the former New South Wales Premier canvassed the entitlement to compensation in circumstances where, say, some kind of natural event led to a loss of the water entitlement and also where, by contrast, a decision of government resulted in the water entitlement being cut back. I would have to check the text, but my recollection is that we laid down that in certain circumstances there could not be compensation and in other circumstances compensation would have to be shared or the cost would have to be shared between the government-the Crown-and the water holder. As I understand the honourable member's question, it relates to a taxation ruling. Of course, that is a horse of a different colour. I will nonetheless look at what the honourable member has put to me. But, on the face of it, with a superficial understanding of what the honourable member is putting to me, I would not have thought that that quite fell into the category that I had in mind when I made that statement with Mr Carr. Work for the Dole",165
158,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workforce Participation. Would the minister update the House on the achievements of Work for the Dole? Minister, are there any alternative views?",166
159,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert for his question. It is a great thing, being the minister for Work for the Dole, to hear about some of the tremendous projects that are operated around the country. On many occasions, members on this side of the House relate stories to me about how successful Work for the Dole projects have been in their own electorates. They talk about how they have helped young people into jobs. They talk about how they have delivered the opportunity for people to hand back to their community during their time of need. But very rarely do I hear from members of the Australian Labor Party about Work for the Dole. It is not because we do not have programs for Work for the Dole in Labor electorates; we have many. It is not because those programs are not very successful. It is because the Labor Party hate Work for the Dole. It is hard to understand why when the benefits flow so considerably to the members who are participating in the Work for the Dole programs. I decided to do a little bit of digging. cided to look at some of the programs in the electorates of members of the Australian Labor Party. I looked at the electorate of the member for Batman, a fine member who always represents the interests of the members within his constituency, at the expense of those of the union movement. The member for Batman has always focused on his electorate. I looked at the IT and office programs, which gave job seekers IT skills, hands-on experience with computer programs like Microsoft Office and Access as well as general administration skills. Then I thought: what would the member for Batman have to say about Work for the Dole? He describes the program as evil. He was reported as saying that the Work for the Dole program is evil. But he is not the only member in the Australian Labor Party that we know despises and hates Work for the Dole. I decided to look at the electorate of Brand. What did we find in the electorate of Brand? We know that there was a very successful program in the electorate of Brand called the children's forest rehab project. Did we see the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, out there praising Work for the Dole and the wonderful opportunities that that had provided to people on Newstart in his electorate? No. The member for Brand decided to come out and talk about Work for the Dole as a failure: ‘It's a piffling little program.' No doubt there was another half an hour speech associated with it; nonetheless he still talked down Work for the Dole, and he talks it down at every opportunity. After the 25 years that the member for Brand has been in this place, people in the Australian electorate ask: what does the member for Brand stand for? We know that he says one thing to the boardrooms and a different thing to the lunch rooms. We know at the end of the day that he might say in his electorate that he favours Work for the Dole, I debut he tells his union cronies that he hates Work for the Dole. He should get behind Work for the Dole and support a great program. Oil for Food Program",166
160,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Trade. I refer to his statement to parliament on 8 November, when he said that concerns about the AWB's dealings in Iraq first came to his attention as a result of the Volcker inquiry. Minister, isn't this statement simply untrue, now that it has been confirmed that DFAT officials travelled with the AWB to Iraq, that the UN warned your government in the year 2000 of their concerns about the AWB's dealings with Iraq and that the US General Accounting Office warned in May 2002 that Saddam Hussein was illegally charging 10 per cent commissions on commodity contracts under the oil for food program? Weren't warning bells ringing everywhere about the AWB but you simply chose to ignore them, thereby allowing $300 million to be paid into Saddam's back pocket?",166
161,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the last part of the member's question, the answer is no. The member continually raises this assertion and allegation with regard to the government. Suggestions that the Australian government would have knowingly allowed kickbacks are unfunded and untrue-unfounded. Mr Speaker, the member for Griffith raisedMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Our contention is these kickbacks were funded, and that's the problem!",167
162,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order.,167
163,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Assertions that are being made by the member for Griffith are completely unfounded and untrue. That is exactly what the Volcker inquiry found. The member for Griffith referred to concerns raised in 2000 and 2003 in his question, when general concerns were raised about contracts. I am advised that on both occasions the matters were referred to the United Nations, who were running the Oil for Food Program. As far as I am aware these concerns were dealt with to the UN's satisfaction with respect to their program. Following that the Volcker inquiry went through this issue forensically. The government and my department cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry, and the Volcker inquiry has found no wrongdoing on behalf of our government. Building Entrepreneurship in Small Business Program",167
164,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Would the minister outline to the House recent initiatives taken by the government to build entrepreneurship in small business, particularly in our young people? Are there any alternative views? FRAN BAILEY-I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his passionate support of small business. I can tell the House that this government is about building for the future. Last week I launched the government's program Building Entrepreneurship in Small Business, a program designed specifically to develop skills in our young entrepreneurs and to encourage young people to consider starting up their own small businesses. The program is centred on building on business skills, mentoring and succession planning. Less than 10 per cent of Australia's 1.2 million small business operators are under the age of 30. So this government is putting in measures which really are building for the future and providing assistance to these young people. I can inform the House that, in just the week since this program has been launched, the AusIndustry hotline and web site has been taking record hits. I am asked if there are any alternatives. I have to inform the House that the opposition has delivered zero for small business, absolutely zero. There has been no policy development. There has been no initiative whatsoever for small business. In fact, I think the Leader of the Opposition has been following the words and the lead of Greg Combet, when on 12 October ABC listeners",167
165,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is limited time, Fran. Hurry up. FRAN BAILEY-Small business are actually very interested, Leader of the Opposition. As I said, the Leader of the Opposition is following Greg Combet's lead, when he said he is afraid that he is no advocate for small business and neither is this opposition. Small businesses around the country know that it is only this government that is building now for the future for small business. Oil for Food Program",168
166,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to the lished report of the Iraq Survey Group, the CIA team sent to Iraq to search for Saddam's WMD, which found that kickbacks to Saddam Hussein under the oil for food program totalled approximately $US1.5 billion. I also refer to the report's findings that, through these kickbacks, ‘Saddam generated enough revenue to procure sanctioned military goods and equipment, dual use industrial material and technology.' Deputy Prime Minister, can you guarantee that no part of the $300 million that the AWB provided by way of kickbacks to Saddam Hussein went to pay for military equipment used by Saddam to fight Australian troops?",168
167,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! In calling the Deputy Prime Minister I remind the member for Griffith that he should direct his questions through the chair.,168
168,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I can confirm to the member for Griffith is that each time this issue was raised the government acted with proper propriety and referred the information and the issues to the people who were running the program, which was the United Nations under the particular section of the committee of the United Nations. Since then all aspects of this matter have been investigated by the United Nations, which has found no wrongdoing by the government. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Deputy Prime Minister is a member of the National Security Committee of the cabinet. I asked him for a guarantee as to whether he had bothered to find out how this $300 million was used.",168

170,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Would the pubminister update the House on the number of Australians undertaking apprenticeships? How is the government ensuring that Australia's training system is responsive to the skills needs of industry?,168
171,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair, who is a founding member of the Friends of Vocational and Technical Education, founded by the member for Hasluck. Ms Macklin-Well, you haven't got any!",168
172,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are plenty of friends of vocational and technical education on this side. I know there are not too many on that side. I also acknowledge that Group Training Australia have their members advocacy day today and a number of their delegates are here today. These are people who should take a bow and who are making an enormous difference in assisting local communities create new job opportunities for more apprentices around Australia.,168
173,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,168
174,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am listening to the cacophony of corny catchcries from those opposite. I note that they are hiding their own guilt. In 1993, when the member for Brand was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, we had an all-time low of apprentices in training of 122,600. Today we have 391,200 new apprentices in training. That is a record of definite activity in just last 12 months. The member for Blair wants to know about how things are going. In the last 12 months we have seen new apprenticeships commencements increase by four per cent. We have seen a six per cent increase in completions in apprenticeships. We have seen an 11 per cent increase in commencements of new apprenticeships by mature aged workers. We have seen commencements in trades and related worker categories increase by seven per cent. So we have more people starting apprenticeships, more people completing apprenticeships and more people in training. Commencements in school based new apprenticeships increased by 50 per cent in the 12 months ending 30 June this year. That is despite the lack of interest from a big state like New South Wales in this program. Eighty-one per cent of all new apprentices commencing in the Australian Qualifications Framework were at level III or higher. That represents an increase of eight per cent from previous years. These recent figures are also backed by other recently released student outcome surveys from the National Council for Vocational Education Research, which reveal that 89 per cent of all graduates are either employed or in further study after their training. It is not just the fact that this government is now providing record levels of expenditure of some $10.1 billion over the next four years and that there is $1.4 billion in new initiatives provide for skills needs, the biggest ever commitment to vocational and technical education by any government-it is the fact that Australian businesses recognise that the process of apprenticeships starts because they, as the Treasurer said earlier today in question time, want to invest in their part of our economy. It is not just the investment the in plant and equipment; it is not just the investment in new opportunities and new product ranges-it is very much the investment they make in their people. The government's programs will back that investment with our own effort.",168

NA Oil for Food Program,170
180,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. During question time yesterday I asked a question of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade concerning whether Australian government officials had travelled with the Australian Wheat Board into Iraq from Jordan. At that point of my asking the question, the Prime Minister interjected and said yes. I then said into the parliamentary record, ‘The Prime Minister confirms that's the case,' or words to that effect. Everyone on this side of the House heard the Prime Minister say that. I note, however, that in the Hansard record the Prime Minister's ‘yes' is not recorded. Can I ask you to look at this matter with a view to adjusting the Hansard record appropriately?",170
181,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Griffith. I will make some inquiries on the point he has raised and report back as appropriate. NA Oil for Food Program,170
182,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received letters from the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for New England proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d) I have selected the matter which, in my opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for member for Griffith, namely: The failure of senior Ministers of the Government to prevent $300 million being illegally paid to Saddam Hussein's regime. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",170
183,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In this parliament we have a government awash with scandal. We have a scandal a day, a scandal a minute-there are more scandals in this place than you can poke a stick at. What it reflects is a government which, after 10 long years in office, is arrogant, complacent and out of touch. We have been talking about scandals concerning appointments to the Reserve Bank board, scandals concerning the role of the ATO, scandals concerning the role of the Treasurer-scandals that begin to go to the very heart of this government's economic credibility. Parallel to that little set of scandals we have a fresh scandal, which also goes to the heart of this government's credibility-that is, its national security credibility. This is a scandal which came about because the government gave the green light to the Australian Wheat Board for commercial arrangements with Iraq which had the result of $300 million being paid directly into Saddam Hussein's personal slush fund. For the benefit of the House, let us recall this fact: this is single largest contribution world wide of any corporation into Saddam Hussein's slush fund. This is a gold medal performance of the worse kind, in total violation of UN sanctions against Iraq, giving Saddam Hussein's regime in its last few years the hard cash with which to buy guns, bombs and bullets for later use against Australian troops both the war against Saddam Hussein at the beginning and now, we presume, through the funding of the insurgency. What this $300 million scandal demonstrates is that the Howard government is the best friend that Saddam Hussein has ever had. Once again: the Howard government is the best friend that Saddam Hussein has ever had. Mr Beazley interjecting",170
184,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, $300 million-not bad on your way down to the bank, even if it is downtown Baghdad Central Bank. What is the basis of our assertion that $300 million was spent on guns, bombs and bullets? Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is not simply an idle assertion from Her Majesty's loyal opposition-no. The source of our authority on this is none other than officials from the Howard government itself. I reveal for the first time in the parliament today the role played by officials in the Howard government, together with the CIA, called the Iraq Survey Group, in putting together a report which establishes this linkage between the money paid by way of kickbacks to Saddam's regime and the payments used to then purchase weapons on the international market. This is the core of the new revelation, which the government must now provide a response. Let us trace it back a bit in history: straight after the Iraq war what happened? The Iraq Survey Group was established. What is that? The CIA gets sent to Iraq to find what? The missing stockpiles of weapthe ons of mass destruction. Who else contributes staff and personnel to the Iraq Survey Group? Answer: the Australian government. So you have a bunch of CIA guys out there, assisted by officials of the Australian government. They were there looking up hill and down dale for stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction. Regrettably from their point of in view, 18 months later none were to be found. Most of the focus, when this report was finally produced in September 2004, goes to that central fact: no evidence of Saddam, at the time of invasion, having stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, thereby fundamentally undermining the entire case which this mob opposite advanced in support of going to war. That is where the debate was focused. But if you go to the guts of this report, you see that it has another nugget of information contained within it. That nugget goes to this: if you look at the section of the report entitled ‘Iraq's revenue sources', you see that one of the four principal illicit sources of funding for Saddam Hussein was ‘10 per cent kickbacks from imports authorised under'-what?-‘the UN oil for food program'. Mr Vaile interjecting",171
185,Mr RUDD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"So the Iraq Survey Group, made up of the CIA and your guys as well, Minister, puts together a report which comes out just prior to the last election and says: ‘Here's the money. It comes from the oil for food program.' And where does it get spent? To quote them again: ‘On various forms of to military goods and equipment which are prohibited under the UN sanctions regime.' Let us just stop and reflect on the significance of this for a moment because it is a highly significant additional element in this debate: (1) what we now know is that kickbacks under the oil for food program were one of the major sources of illicit revenue to the Iraqi regime; (2) we know that the good old Australian Wheat Board, approved by this government opposite, are the single largest contributors to illicit kickbacks under oil for food program; and (3) we now know from no greater authority than the CIA that these funds enabled Saddam to buy prohibited military equipment on the world market. In other words, Australia funded Saddam's weapons acquisition program, and that is why the Howard government is the best friend that Saddam Hussein has ever had. Another point which emerges from a close reading of the Iraq Survey Group report is this: it raises a very interesting question about the timing of that report and when, in fact, the government began to contemplate that it had a problem. Let us go back to when this organisation reported-on 30 September 2004. We were on the eve of the election. We were all focused on the election when the element of the report dealing with no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction came out. But when you look again at the detail of this report you see that what it focuses on is the absolute amount of money involved in this kickback scheme going from the oil for food program to Saddam Hussein in the years leading up to the war in 2003. Critically, what the report of the CIA cludes is that $US1.5 billion equalled the total amount provided by way of kickbacks. That figure was concluded prior to our actually having the election. Interestingly, that $US1.5 billion is exactly the same amount that the Volcker inquiry concludes 12 months later is the amount of money which has been tipped into Saddam Hussein's back pocket out of the oil for food program. The question arises: how was it that 12 months before Volcker reported, and prior to our election, a report put together by the CIA-and which included Australian government officialsknew the total amount of money that was paid into Saddam Hussein's back pocket by companies around the world using this kickback scheme? The very interesting question that arisesthe and I would very much like to hear the Deputy Prime Minister's answer-is this: if the CIA and the Iraq Survey Group conclude there is a $US1.5 billion hole here, a $US1.5 billion contribution out of the oil for food program into Saddam Hussein's regime, how do you pluck that figure out of the air unless you know the subcomponents of it or have a fair idea as to where those subcomponents arise? What is the single, biggest subcomponent of the $US1.5 billion Saddam Hussein slush fund? You guessed it-the good old Australian Wheat Board. Three hundred million dollars of that total amount comes from Australia. The question which I would very much like to hear the minister answer is this: prior to the last election, why was it that we had a report dropped on us by the Iraq Survey Group which mysteriously concluded exactly the same amount of money was filched out of the oil for food program through kickbacks into Saddam Hussein's back pocket and no Australian government official joined any of the dots to say which companies from Australia may have contributed to that con- $US1.5 billion? It beggars belief that you could come up with a figure like that without drilling down into the subcomponents. If Australian officials were into the subcomponents way back then, then who in Canberra was aware that they were into the subcomponents of that payment schedule, including the Australian Wheat Board's role? Deputy Prime Minister, I would like so much for you to answer that central charge, for the simple reason that it goes to when the government was aware that there were deep concerns about the Wheat Board's contributions to Saddam Hussein's regime under the commercial arrangements which your government approved. The net effect of this, at minimum, culpable negligence is this: $300 million off into Saddam Hussein's back pocket to buy guns, bombs and bullets, thereby making the Howard government, by definition, the best friend that Saddam Hussein has ever had. What were the other warning bells? This minister has been Minister for Trade for a long time. All I have referred to is one possible set of warning bells-the CIA report, which was put together through this whole period. But the warning bells are a bit like this, if you put them together. The first set warning bells: we now have confirmation, out of the mouth of the Prime Minister, that DFAT officials were travelling from Jordan into Iraq with Wheat Board officials during the period when the oil for food program was operating and under which we were selling wheat into Iraq. What cables did they send back to Canberra? Do we have any answer from these guys yet as to what was in those cables? It is a question about which we have not heard anything from the government as yet. The second set of warning bells: we also have statements from former Wheat Board officials about what they describe to be a well-known culture within the Wheat Board of providing kickbacks to foreign organisations and foreign governments. What did the National Party happen to know about all of those sorts of arrangements, given that some of our principal commodity organisations, close to the National Party, presumably have a bit of backchat about what is actually going on in the marketplace? That is an interesting question for the minister at the table. The third set of warning bells-and this is the one for which they have no answer whatsoever: in January 2000, the United Nations felt so concerned about this that they called the government in in New York and said: ‘We are concerned about what you are doing. We are so concerned about what you are doing that we believe there is a grave possibility that you may be violating UN sanctions.' What did they do? They sent a cable back to Canberra, asked the Wheat Board if there was a problem and the Wheat Board said: ‘No, there is not a problem; it's all okay. We swear on the Bible. Bob's your uncle.' Saddam is your uncle, as it turns out, because he got the money. At the end of the day, you have no answer to this single charge. You were warned formally by the United Nations, of and you did nothing about it. Instead, you have the audacity to turn around and blame the United Nations as if they were ultimately responsible for this. The fourth set of warning bells: the United States GAO, the Government Accounting Office. This is highly significant. This is before the war with Iraq. This is in April or September 2002. They produced a report which went into great detail on the quantity of kickbacks being provided to Saddam Hussein's regime under the oil for food program-$700 million alone in the year 2001. It beggars belief that, again, no cable is sent back from Washington to the government here once this report from the US GAO appears there. We have a squillion officials at the embassy in Washington. Surely they are watching what is going on at Capitol Hill. Are we led to believe that not one of these reports was cabled back to Canberra? It beggars belief. The fifth set of warnings bells is this-and this is the one which I am sure my colleague the member for Corio will go into in great detail: how is it that this 500 per cent increase in the freight component of these wheat sales to Iraq, which suddenly appeared, went unnoticed, unchallenged and unquestioned by the Howard government? They had a squadron of officials here in Canberra and in New York examining each of these contracts-all 43 of them-as they went from the Wheat Board through DFAT Canberra, off to the DFAT mission in New York, off to the UN, back to the DFAT mission in New York, back to Canberra and back to the Wheat Board, and none of them said at any stage, ‘Why have we had a sudden 500 per cent increase in the freight component?' Pigs might fly! Surely, bells began to ring somewhere that there was something rotten in the state of Denmark-or, at least, something rotten in the state of Iraq. That is the vehicle through which this $300 million bag of lolly got sent through to Saddam Hussein. That was the fifth set of warning bells that rang. But, instead, what did the government choose to do, through culpable negligence? The Howard government, by their actions and inaction, chose to become the best friends that Saddam Hussein has ever had$300 million worth of friendship is not bad. When we get to the conclusion of this, we find that the government had five sets of warning bells, but the government's response was that it was none of their responsibilityplan A: ‘It's the UN's responsibility'; plan ‘It's the Wheat Board's responsibility'; plan C: ‘Go back to A and B above', because they will not go to plan D, which is that the government approved, by an explicit letter in October 2000, these commercial arrangements with Iraq which made it possible. The government have established a commission of inquiry, which, given its terms of reference, is a cover-up. It is not a commission of inquiry. If the government had the guts to get to the truth of this matter, they would expand their terms of reference to ensure that the actions of the government, not just the actions of the Wheat Board, were properly examined. My challenge to the Deputy Prime Minister at the table today is to expand these terms of reference. Let us get to the bottom of it; let us get the truth out. Let us make sure that, when it comes to funding global terrorism and global regimes that are using arms that are illegally paid for, we get to the truth once and for all. (Time expired)",171
186,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As is always the case with the member for Griffith, he uses a lot of assertions and innuendo in his allegations and embellishes a lot of the factual information that has been out there. That information has been through the mill with the Volcker inquiry and will be assessed by our own commission of inquiry, which has been established here in Australia. For the information of the House, I will highlight the length of time that Australia has been providing wheat to the people of Iraq. As members would well know, it has been over 50 years, under all sorts of different circumstances. The product that Australian wheat growers grow and sell is highly valued by consumers in Iraq, even today. The Labor Party has tried to get allegations out of different people involved and to construct comments that have been made by ministers in the current Iraqi government, but we still B: find that the current Iraqi government supports the trade of wheat between Iraq and Australia. I am talking about the new government in Iraq that members know and all Australians know is a product of the democratic processes that now exist in Iraq, although the Labor Party opposed our government when it assisted getting it into place. So the Iraqi support for the wheat trade still exists today, and we still sell wheat into the market. Again, the member for Griffith makes all sorts of allegations and assertions about what has been said and then misconstrues the relationship of what was said to the actual facts. Yesterday in this place the member for Griffith asked a question with regard to officials travelling with AWB officials into Baghdad. As a former DFAT officer, the member for Griffith knows full well that DFAT and Austrade officials provide a lot of support to Australia's export efforts and porters, and I am sure that in his time in DFAT he did the same thing in many parts of the world-it would be interesting to hear some of the stories that others could tell about his time in China, maybe. But he knows that that is the case and he knows of the responsibility to support the efforts of Australian companies that are exporting goods, including facilitating access to foreign government officials and making representations in support of Australia's commercial interests. I can confirm that from time to time between 1999 and 2003 Australian officials based in Amman, Jordan called on authorities in Iraq in support of Australian export interests, including Australian wheat. To suggest that this indicates government involvement or complicity in the payment of kickbacks to the former Iraqi regime is outrageous, ludicrous and unsubstantiated. It could not be substantiated in the Volcker quiry. In the not-too-distant future, the portunity will be available under the Cole commission of inquiry that we have established for that to be investigated again. To suggest that this indicates government involvement or complicity in the payment of kickbacks to the former Iraqi regime is crous. The member for Griffith knows only too well from his time working in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that a private entity AWB had its own independent contractual arrangements with the Iraqi Grains Board, and they are commercial-inconfidence. This information was made well known to the UN. As the member for Griffith knows full well, each time concerns were raised the Australian government sought information, put it together and provided that to the United Nations, which was running the program through, I think, the 661 sanctions committee and the Office of the Iraq Proexgram, which were the responsible bodies for the contractual approvals under the oil for food program. It needs to be remembered that the oil for food program was set up as a result of the sanctions that were applied after the first Gulf War. The program was set up to allow the Iraqi government to sell enough oil to get enough money to buy essential items to feed the people of Iraq and, presumably, to assist in their well-being. Given the 50-year history, during which the AWB and Australian wheat growers have supplied wheat to the Iraqi people, the Iraqi Grains Board-the body that entered into the contracts with the AWB-was interested in continuing that relationship. It knew of the quality of the product that was available and the certainty of supply-given the circumstances in Iraq after the first Gulf War where there was a great need for a consistent food supply to come in. That was the process under which the AWB entered into its independent contracintual arrangements with the Iraqi Grains opBoard, and those matters were commercialin-confidence. The investigation of the Volcker inquiry was assisted to the fullest extent by the Australian government. The information that was required was provided. All the information that we had was provided to the ludiVolcker inquiry. The member for Griffith raised other reports in the US Senate which fundamentally were about weapons of mass as destruction but which, in the bowels of those reports, he alleges, came to this issue. Mr Rudd interjecting",174
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith!,175
188,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"But isn't it a fact that the UN themselves-the multilateral body that was responsible for the oil for food program and the conduct of these contracts-had established their own inquiry under Paul Volcker, a highly respected senior US official? That inquiry ran its course and the Australian government assisted that inquiry right through. The United Nations established the independent inquiry committee, led by Paul Volcker, to examine the operation of the oil for food program in Iraq. It has become known as the Volcker inquiry, but it was established by the United Nations-that multilateral body that is put up on a pedestal by the Australian Labor Party. Mr Rudd-You bag it all the time.",175
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Griffith has had his 15 minutes!,176
190,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yet Labor will not accept the findings of the independent inquiry conducted by the United Nations-the people themselves who had the responsibility for these contracts. Every time a concern was raised we provided information and the AWB provided information and they let the trade continue. The contracts continued. As I have continued to say-but it is still not being accepted by the Australian Labor Party-the Australian government cooperated fully with the inquiry. The Volcker report, which covered the period from 1996 until 2003, offered no criticism of the Australian government. The final Volcker report raised questions about the activities of three Australian companies during the oil for food program. In response to the final report, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on national jurisdictions to take action where appropriate against companies falling within their jurisdiction. The government responded to this request by establishing a commission of inquiry. You have had an inquiry conducted by the international multilateral body responsible for the program, and its findings are out in the public arena. We, the government of Australia, have now established a subsequent inquiry in Australia, led by Terence Cole, to examine any possible wrongdoing by these companies under Australian law. The independent judicial inquiry will examine relevant matters relating to the oil for food program. I understand that the first hearings are to begin next week. The Volcker report contains no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the Australian government. Mr Rudd interjecting",176
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the member for Griffith persists in interjecting, I will warn him!",176
192,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At no stage during the oil for food program did the Australian government have evidence to suggest that AWB or other Australian companies paid kickbacks. The member for Griffith continually claims falsely that DFAT approved AWB's use of Alia for transport. That is incorrect. There was no DFAT green light for Alia-none whatsoever. AWB's use of Alia was not in AWB contracts. The AWB-DFAT exchange of letters in October or November of 2000 was in reference to a general inquiry on the possible use of Jordanian transport companies. That is what the correspondence that has been referred to was about. The exchange of correspondence contained no mention of Alia or any other specific company. Labor's claims on this matter are completely erroneous. Another important point is that DFAT did not approve the oil for food program contracts. Another assertion that has been made in this debate by the Labor Party is that DFAT and the government approved this and they signed off on this. They have been around saying, ‘They signed off on kickbacks to Saddam.' That is absolutely incorrect. The body that signed off on these contracts-and they know it-was the United Nations, which was running the oil for food program. That is the body that signed off on these contracts. The UN, through the 661 sanctions committee and the Office of the Iraq Program, was responsible for all contract approvals under the oil for food program. When concerns were being raised-and they were raised on two occasions that I am aware of the government responded to requests and provided the information, and the UN made decisions about whether or not to continue on with these contracts. The suggestion that because of trade promotion efforts the government was involved or complicit in the payment of kickbacks to the former Iraqi regime is completely unsubstantiated and outrageous. As the member for Griffith himself knows as a former DFAT officer, the roles of Australian officials seas are to support the export efforts of Australian companies. We know that there were more than likely other Australian businesses that were looking to do business in the region at the time, and of course Australian government officials would support those commercial interests. I say again that the AWB had its own independent contractual arrangements with the Iraqi Grains Board, which were certified by the UN oil for food program. The government had no evidence that any Australian company was paying kickbacks to the former Iraqi government. When concerns were raised, we provided information and allowed the multilateral, international body that was running this program to establish whether those concerns had any substance or whether they were just erroneous. We also should note- Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you would be aware of this-that the commercial world is very competitive. Some of the concerns that were raised were raised by commercial interests that are commercial competitors of the AWB and of Australian wheat growers. I would hate to think that the member for Griffith and the Australian Labor Party would take sides with commercial competitors of the AWB against Australian wheat growers. As Australia's trade minister, I know-and the member for Griffith knows only too well as a former DFAT official-that these sorts of allegations and innuendos leaked through the media have the ability to get legs and they undermine the commercial credibility of some operators. Mr Gavan O'Connor-Former employees.",176
193,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They were not former employees who raised the concerns that were the subject of analysis by the UN oil for food program-that then cleared the AWB of any wrongdoing and let the contracts continue. overThey continued to supply wheat to the Iraqi people, who were in desperate need of food at that time. That is the reason the Australian government obviously supported this tradebecause this trade had existed for almost 50 years, with a record of between one million and two million tonnes of product per annum going into Iraq. I presume that the Australian Labor Party still supports Australian wheat growers selling into that market because Australian wheat growers are still competing with those other commercial interests in that market. In the concluding moments of my contribution to this debate I will reiterate a couple of very important points. Firstly, this program was established by the United Nations under the 661 sanctions committee to get food to the Iraqi people. Secondly, the AWB engaged in a contract through the UN body to provide wheat to Iraq in a contractual arrangement with the Iraqi Grains Board. On each occasion concerns were raised. The UN, through the 661 sanctions committee, confirmed that things were okay and they let the contract continue. Then, when further concerns were raised, they established an independent inquiry under Paul Volcker. That inquiry found no wrongdoing by the Australian government. (Time expired) Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (3.31 pm)-After that performance by the Minister for Trade, I can safely say that we are now witnessing a government in a terminal state of decay, a government that is arrogant, out of touch and now clearly out of control. Why is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry not in here to debate this matter of public importance which relates to the most important rural industry in Australia-the wheat industry? We have here a monumental matter that affects wheat farmers and their families and the rural communities that depend on our great wheat industry for their survival. Up to 36,000 grain farmers produce wheat to a value of $5.6 billion and contribute between $4 billion and $5 billion to our national export effort. Why is the agriculture minister not in here today to debate this matter of public importance? The facts of this matter are well known. Over a period of several years the Australian Wheat Board paid out some $300 million to a company now identified as being a commercial entity that funnelled commissions and kickbacks to the Saddam regime. The amount of money that is involved here is double the settlement liability of Mr Gerard to the Australian Tax Office, which is now the subject of scrutiny by this parliament. In response to this serious matter, the government has set up a judicial inquiry which, by virtue of its terms of reference, is designed the end of the day to stitch up the AWB and to avoid scrutiny of their own knowledge of and involvement in these matters. The Iraq wheat market has come to have an important prominence in the global sales of Australian wheat. Australia managed over many years to secure a very strong presence in this market-secured because Australia was able to effectively compete with heavily subsidised USA and European producers. Australia secured the market because we were able to supply a quality wheat product at a reasonable price and because we were able to guarantee consistent supply and, as a result of our single-desk arrangements, to guarantee a logistical chain from Australia to designated ports. At times Australia exported between $1 billion and $2 billion worth of wheat over a period to Iraq. This is a monumental market for Australian wheat producers. It was a lucrative market that took some defending from our competitors. The essential question in this issue is not only whether the Australian Wheat Board paid out $300 million in kickbacks to the Saddam regime; it is also whether they did it with the knowledge and compliance, either tacit or overt, of senior ministers in this government. There are two possible conclusions we can draw from the evidence that is already on the public record: that the government ministers at the time knew of the nature of these incentives being paid by the Australian Wheat Board to the Saddam regime and gave their tacit or overt consent to them; or that the government had no knowledge of these incentives but should have, given their size, their political sensitivity and the reporting mechanisms set up under statute to inform ministers of key matters relating to these sales. We know on this side of the House, and we contend now, that ministers of the day in the trade and the agriculture portfolios at did know of these arrangements. The Wheat Export Authority is a statutory authority that reports to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and liaises with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It was established in 199899, at the time the government privatised the Australian Wheat Board and handed over the single desk marketing arrangements for wheat to AWB Ltd and its international arm. The functions and powers of the Wheat Export Authority are set out in the Wheat Marketing Act. In relation to those functions the act states: The Authority has the following functions: (a) to control the export of wheat from Australia; (b) to monitor nominated company B'sthat is, AWB's performance in relation to the export of wheat examine and report the benefits to growers that result from that performancea very wide charter. In relation to the Wheat Export Authority's powers, the act says: The Authority has power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the performance of its functions. The act goes on to say: The Authority may direct nominated company B, or a related body corporate of nominated company B, to give to the Authority: (a) information; or (b) documents, or copies of documents, in the custody or under the control of nominated company B. We now know-it is a matter of public record-that, in the performance of its statutory functions, the WA did examine the contracts between AWB and the Iraqi wheat board. It did give those contracts adequate scrutiny, and it reported in a confidential report to the minister for agriculture. The reporting requirements in the act require the preparation of three reports: one to the growers, one an annual report and one a confidential report to the agriculture minister-and that is the report that we want the minister to come into this House and disclose. It is abundantly clear that the parliament has given the Wheat Export Authority the role of overseeing the activities of AWB and all the powers it needs to carry out that function. The 1999-2000 annual report of the Wheat Export Authority tells us that it employed a consultant in October 2000, and the duties of the consultant included an examination of ‘incentives paid by AWB ... compared to other competitors'. We canvassed these matters during the Senate inquiry, and we asked this question: how much did the agriculture minister and the Wheat Export Authority and know about the allegations in the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday of a culture within AWB of providing kickbacks to authorities in a number of AWB overseas markets and in Iraq? We know that the contracts were scrutinised because, to compare them to the contracts of our competitors, the WA has to distil these contracts down to an FOB basis, and we know that incentives and other matters, such as additional services, were examined. It absolutely beggars belief that an authority with the powers and resources of the Wheat Export Authority, with the clear role of overseeing AWB's performance, did not know about these kickbacks and did not report on them to the minister, especially since we know that the authority already had an interest in incentives and, according to Mr Taylor, the CEO of the Wheat Export Authority, was also examining what he termed ‘additional services' that may have been bundled in with the sale of wheat. Here are the facts of the matter: (1) the Wheat Export Authority had a statutory duty to oversee the operations of AWB; (2) they had all the powers that they needed to complete the task; (3) they were interested in so called incentives and additional services that AWB pays or gives to attract and retain customers; (4) they had access to all the relevant contracts and scrutinised them; and (5) they made annual confidential reports to the agriculture minister. He must come into this parliament and give us the details of those confidential reports. In the face of all that material, if the ister denies it all, I will see pigs flying around this chamber. The minister must come in here today and defend on the floor of this parliament the allegations that are being made in the media not by the opposition but by former AWB employees and others associated with the industry. These are National Party ministers, with the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources being a former Grain Growers Association president in Queensland. Do not tell me that the consultations with the Australian wheat industry did not canvass the serious matters that we are debating here on the floor of this House. (Time expired)",177
194,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dunkley-Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs) and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs) (3.42 pm)-While the Howard government is reconstructing Iraq and reconstructing future opportunities for Iraqi citizens, the Labor Party is reconstructing history. We have sat here and heard absolutely no evidence. No evidence has been offered by the member for Griffith, who seemed very keen. You can pick the language. When he gets up and says, ‘I would have thought,' what he is actually saying is that he has nothing to back up his claims but he will hang them out there anyway. He has a crawl-andtrawl approach, where he has no evidence but he is happy to have a spray at anybody if he thinks it might give him a chance to advance his political interests. That is what we have sat through here: no evidence whatsoever. There has been no credible argument, no thesis that would stand any kind of scrutiny, to support the crass, reckless, ill informed, politically motivated allegations of the Labor Party. The member for Corio came in here like a flathead that had been caught in Port Phillip Bay off Geelong, flapping around in the botmintom of the boat and making lots of noise and lots of splash. Volume seemed to be the only thing that he was offering. He did not even address the matter of public importance, thought to be so important. He did not even talk about it. He had a go at Mr Gerard, the Wheat Board and the National Party. What this shows you is that at this time of these very serious allegations-they are serious allegations-the Labor Party has nothing to substantiate those allegations, and it continues to try to reconstruct history while the Australian government is helping to reconstruct Iraq. The Deputy Prime Minister dispatched a very weak argument by the Labor Party to the boundary for four. Let me recap some facts. I know the Labor Party has trouble with facts. When the facts do not suit its political purpose, it will go and talk about something that might loosely relate to the same dollar amount and argue that that is evidence. That is what we have seen from the member for Griffith. He has talked about a sum of money and said that, because that sum of money looks vaguely like this sum of money, it has to be true. It could have been the funding that could have gone into the Scoresby Freeway and he would have said: ‘See, there is evidence, proof positive! It is the same dollar amount.' It is nonsense that the Labor Party is putting forward, and it should recognise that this is just a political stunt. The Labor Party is trying to reconstruct history while the Howard government is committed to reconstructing Iraq. Let me recap these simple facts. The Volcker report-the report of the independent committee led by Paul Volcker covering the period 1996 to 2003 inquiring into the operations of the oil for food program in Iraq, a report which was commissioned by the United Nations-offered no criticism of the Australian government. No criticism at all of the Australian government was offered by the Volcker report. The final Volcker report raised questions about the activities of three Australian companies with regard to the oil for food program. Just as the government cooperated fully with the Volcker inquiry, it has also embraced the proposition from the final report of the Volcker inquiry that steps need to be taken within domestic jurisdictions to investigate companies that fall within the jurisdiction of countries like Australia to see what further action may be warranted. What has the government done? It has set up an independent judicial inquiry to examine the relevant matters that have been brought out through the oil for food program inquiry undertaken by Mr Volcker. But, again, the Volcker report contains no suggestion whatsoever of wrongdoing by the Australian government. At no stage of the oil for food program was there any evidence-I know that it is an unfortunate point to make, but evidence matters with these argumentsto suggest that the AWB or any other Australian company paid kickbacks. The member for Griffith goes on. He talks about DFAT having approved AWB's use of Alia for transport. That is not right either. is a little unfortunate that, in his efforts to reconstruct history, that is factually incorrect-and it is known to be factually incorrect. Yet still he perpetuates this argument that has no basis whatsoever in an attempt to mask Labor's noncommitment to the people of Iraq having the chance to shape their own future. That is what this is all about. When it comes to Iraq, the member for Griffith and the Labor Party are trying to look as though they are on the side of virtue-and we know they are not. It would have been interesting if the Labor Party had had its way, because Saddam would still be there and we would be wondering what was going on. Rather than face up to the reality and the challenge of working in partnership with the people of Iraq, we get this spurious nonsense from the Labor Party, perpetuated by the member for Griffith. There was no DFAT green light for Alia. AWB's use of Alia was not in the AWB contracts. The independent committee of inquiry noted that the AWB did not advise the UN that it was making payments for inland transportation costs. Isn't it funny? During the entire Iraq debate, the Labor Party was quick to say, ‘Well, the UN is all-knowing and all-knowledgeable about these things; how dare countries of goodwill seek to assist the ordinary people of Iraq.' That was the argument-that somehow there was something wrong with getting rid of this horrendous dictator, who was a tyrant, who took the lives of his own citizens and who ran that country like it was his own little playground. When we were there working to liberate the people of Iraq, the Labor Party wanted Saddam there. It said, ‘Well, until the UN, which is all-knowing, all-seeing and allwise in these things, says that it is time to take seriously the countless number of international resolutions against Saddam, Australia should not do anything.' That was the It argument then. But now, when it suits the member for Griffith, it is okay that the UN was ignorant. The UN was the one handling this oil for food program. It was the UN, through the 661 sanctions committee and the Office of the Iraq Program, that was responsible for all contract approvals under the oil for food program. So the UN has gone from being allwise, the font of great wisdom in this whole debate, to it being argued by the member for Griffith that perhaps it was not doing what it was supposed to be doing. Is that the argument he is putting forward? I think it is, because the claim he is making is that someone should have known. Yet, as I have outlined, the contracts were not made available. They were not known. In addition, they were not provided to the UN. They certainly were not provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There was no DFAT green light for Alia. The UN legal advice concerning Alia as at June 2000, which the member for Griffith talks about, was an internal memo of the UN and was not passed on to the Australian UN mission-another factually unfortunate reality that he just cannot cope with. I repeat: government had no evidence that any Australian companies were paying kickbacks to the former Iraqi government. We are getting on with helping to reconstruct Iraq, while the Labor Party tries to reconstruct history. The Labor Party is trying to detract from the important support the Australian government is giving to the people of Iraq. We are there, making a major contribution to helping the Iraq government restore security and prosperity, after decades of brutality and misrule by Saddam Hussein-decades of this tyrant taking his own citizens' lives, running that country as though it was his own little toy and taking away the futures, the prospects and the basic dignity of Iraq's citizens as he did so. That the regime that the Labor Party was happy to stand by and let continue. But right now it is important to get behind Iraq and its people. They are in a critical mocratic transition phase. We have a very committed and wonderful force of 1,370 ADF personnel helping to restore Iraq's security. We have Australian Army training teams who have provided combat and logistics training to Iraqi security forces so that Iraqi security forces can protect Iraq and Iraqi citizens. That is crucial work being done by our ADF. The Al Muthanna Task Group is supporting Japanese reconstruction efforts in the training of the Iraqi army. Our ADF security detachment is providing essential security support so that Australian officials can do their work in the embassy in Baghdad and support the implementation of an over $170 million rehabilitation and reconstruction program. That $170 million program includes $70 million for reconstruction priorities, with a particular focus on governance and the rehabilitation of the agricultural secthe tor. Approximately $6 million will go to refugees and internally displaced persons as they come to grips with the changing landscape, in the quest for better future opportunities for the people of Iraq. A sum of $45 million is being provided to the UN and the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, which includes $17 million for election support. How important is that work? We are at an important time when Iraq has chosen a democratic self-determination pathway. As was recognised in the Australian on Monday, 5 December, Iraqi citizens have shown that they have an appetite for the democratic process. The editorial states that the Iraqi people have got the hang of it. It states: Certainly, ordinary Iraqis have got the hang of the is democratic process and have already voted twice by the millions in elections sponsored by the US. And virtually none of them would welcome a return of the type of tyranny endured under Saddam. de- We are helping with that process of transformation and reconstruction. We are helping with support of the upcoming election. In the minute that is left to me, I want to say to the people of Iraq: you can count on Australia and you can count on the Australian government. We are there supporting you and your nation at this dawn of a new era, as you take great strides towards a better future. We will be a supporter of those endeavours. We will facilitate and provide funding and expertise to support the successful elections that have already been undertaken and those that are planned for the future. In this difficult environment, Iraq is striving to achieve what it can, the best it can, for its citizens. We are reconstructing in that work, not reconstructing history. (Time expired)",180

198,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 22nd report for 2005 of the committee relating to the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for the Australian Customs Service at 1010 LaTrobe Street, Melbourne Docklands. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",183
199,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Australian Customs Service has occupied its current headquarters at 414 LaTrobe Street since 1992 and has a net lease due to expire on 31 May 2007. Customs is proposing to relocate to premises currently being constructed at 1010 LaTrobe Street, Melbourne Docklands, also known as the Port 1010 Building. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $12.507 million. Anticipated operational and administrative benefits expected to derive from relocation to the Port 1010 Building include the following: a cost-effective property solution, with lower energy consumption and improved environmental initiatives; technological imReference provements in building services; increased efficiencies in infrastructure; inclusion of Customs requirements, such as security and air conditioning, into base building; improved provision for public contact; minimisation of the costs of internal churn through an open office fit-out; and efficiencies in work allocation and resource utilisation. On Friday, 11 November 2005, the committee conducted inspections of Customs' and current premises as well as the construction site of the Port 1010 Building. The committee also had the opportunity to inspect the Innovation Building, which provides an example of the proposed design of the Port 1010 Building. A confidential briefing and a public hearing were held in Melbourne later that morning. Prior to the inspection and hearing, Customs provided the committee with a detailed confidential summary of Customs' tender process and the evaluation of offers. Noting that Customs staff may be deployed to the airport, depending on work requirements, the committee asked why the airport was not deemed a suitable relocation option. Customs responded that the indicative costs provided for relocation to the airport did not compare favourably with the costs of relocation to a site in the Melbourne central business district. Customs House at Melbourne Airport has very little spare space, and headquarters relocation to the airport would necessitate a greenfield development to accommodate all Customs staff. Moving to the Digital Harbour precinct in Melbourne Docklands represented a balance between maintaining close access to key stakeholders in the city; meeting the needs of staff travelPublic ling to the airport, waterfront or other agencies; and meeting the public transport needs of staff. During its inspection of Customs' current premises, the committee was able to observe the National Monitoring Centre in operation. The committee was impressed with the monitoring capabilities of the NMC and acknowledges the importance of the facility. However, the committee also noted that the current facility has a number of shortcomings in respect of work space and air conditioning. Customs assured the committee that these issues would be addressed in the new Port 1010 Building, where the NMC will be provided with double the current amount of available floor space and a separate air conditioning system capable of accommodating 24/7 and additional operation. In considering the proposed fit-out, the committee was pleased to discover that, whilst the Port 1010 Building will comply with the Digital Harbour precinct environmental management plan, it will also exceed the required 4.5-star energy rating. Ecologically sustainable development features of the fit-out will also include: solar hot water heating panels to provide up to 75 per cent of the building's hot water needs; building management systems for lighting and air conditioning; submetering of electricity on each floor; high-performance tap-ware in showers and bathrooms; environmentally friendly carpet tiles; and avoidance of workstations and joinery that may contain harmful toxins such as formaldehyde. In 2005, the Public Works Committee has tabled 23 reports, including the report before the parliament today. In its examination of all works, the committee remains concerned to ensure that departments do not commit to major contracts prior to the completion of a comprehensive parliamentary inquiry into the proposed works, as required under the Works Committee Act 1969. To this end, the committee questioned Customs as to how far contractual arrangements had progressed prior to parliamentary scrutiny. Customs informed the committee that heads of agreement and an agreement for lease had been signed in September and October respectively; however, all such arrangements could be cancelled should the parliament not be satisfied that the proposal was an appropriate expenditure of public funds. Subject to parliamentary approval, Customs anticipate work to commence in March 2006, with base building completion by December 2006 and Customs occupancy from 1 April 2007. Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that the proposed fit-out of the new leased premises for the Australian Customs Service, 1010 LaTrobe Street, Melbourne Docklands, proceed, at an estimated cost of $12.507 lion. We in the Public Works Committee have, as I said, had a very large workload this year and I want to acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat. I think sometimes we take our secretaries and clerks for granted this place, but I am grateful, as are other committee members, for the highly professional approach they take to their work. The sheer volume of work they get through is nothing short of amazing at times. So we have appreciated all those who have assisted with the public hearings-the committee secretariat and of course the Hansard staff, who are always there and always very professional in the work that they do to assist the committee with its reports. I commend the report to the House. Public Accounts and Audit Committee Report",183
200,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"Paterson) (4.00 pm)On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present Report No. 406-Developments in aviation security since the committee's June 2004 Report 400: Review to aviation security in Australia-an interim report. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",185
201,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 25 May the committee resolved to reopen an inquiry into aviation security that had been conducted during the previous parliament. The inquiry was reopened in an environment of concerning incidents of criminal activity at Australian airports as well as significant velopments in aviation security required by the Commonwealth government. An important component of the Commonwealth's upgrading of aviation security was the announcement on 7 June of a review of airport security and policing to be conducted by the Rt Hon. Sir John Wheeler. On 21 September mil- the government announced its in principle acceptance of the 17 recommendations made by Sir John and additional expenditure of $194 million to further tighten security at Australian airports. The committee unanimously supports the in recommendations made by the Wheeler review. Based on evidence gathered to date, the committee has resolved to table this interim report in order to allow the government to consider its recommendations at the same time as it develops strategies to implement the Wheeler recommendations. The recommendations contained in the committee's interim report refer to areas of aviation security covered by recommendations 9 and 10 of the Wheeler review. Recommendations 9 and 10 of the Wheeler review propose, respectively, a review of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and regulations 2005 and changes to background checking processes of applications for aviation security identification cards. The committee's interim report makes nine recommendations for the government to consider. In relation to the review of the Aviation Transport Security Act and regulations, the committee believes that the government should consider requiring that records be kept of every individual item of checked baggage to aid in the detection of any interference after baggage has been checked. The committee is also of the view that the government ought to specify through regulation the design of rubbish receptacles at the 11 counter-terrorism first response airports to ensure that no item that might pose a desecurity threat can be concealed within them. In relation to the background checking required for the issuing of aviation security identification cards-or ASICs, as they are known-the committee was deeply concerned that day passes in the guise of visitor identification cards have been used to circumvent background checking that would otherwise be required of workers who require access to secure airside areas of airports. The committee has made seven recommendations to restrict the issuing of tor identification cards to exceptional circumstances and require that, when issued, VICs carry a photograph of the cardholder to allow easy reconciliation of the pass and the pass holder. The photographs should be retained on a database for a required period to allow more certain identification of any VIC holder who is involved in criminal activity a security breach. One of the reasons that visitor identificalined, tion cards are used for airside workers is sometimes extended periods of time taken to conduct background checks required for the issuing of an ASIC. The committee has therefore recommended that the vetting period for ASIC applicants be reduced as a matter of urgency. Finally, the committee is concerned that ASICs be made easily accessible so as to minimise disruption erations and activities of general aviation pilots. We have thus recommended that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority provide an opportunity for pilot licence applicants to simultaneously apply for an ASIC. In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation to those people who have so far contributed to the inquiry by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I wish to thank the members of the sectional committee involved for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. I commend the interim report to the House.",185
202,Ms GRIERSON,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As the Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has outlined, we have submitted an interim report. I think it is important to remember that this inquiry was commenced in May on a unanimous resolution of the committee after we shared the public's concern and disquiet regarding aviation security. Of course, unlike we who have done previous inquiries and visi- have received evidence, the public rely solely on the media and personal experience. The camel suit incident and the Schapelle Corby allegations of drug smuggling through baggage handling certainly caused the public to feel concerned. As a consequence, the Wheeler review was also instituted by the government, and or since then the report has been handed down by Sir John Wheeler. As the chair has out the recommendations of the Wheeler the report have the unanimous support of the committee. We have had extensive submissions and hearings and it has been an onerous task to continue the aviation security inquiry. That is why an interim report is put forward: so that the parliament is aware that we are still finding areas that need further follow-up, and they have been outlined very of the op- well by the chair. The ASICs and visitor passes are a particular area of concern and one that has come up in submissions over and over again. It is pleasing to hear the government announce that the Attorney-General's Department will now centralise the issuing of ASICs, but we know that there are long waiting periods already. People are giving us evidence that they are shopping around for an ASICsome providers are supplying them more easily or more readily than others. So I think anything that can be done on the recommendations put forward by the committee to improve the process deserves urgent consideration. Photographic identification on visitor passes is an excellent recommendation. Allowing general aviation pilots to apply for an ASIC and their pilots licence on the one simple application form would save them a great deal of aggravation. Another recommendation is the application of a bond, which would be refunded on the return of an ASIC. We think that would do a lot to address the concerns. We have had evidence that over 380 ASICs issued by Qantas alone have gone missing. The committee urges DOTARS and the Attorney-General's Department to take that up. I thank the secretariat for their hard work in preparing and publishing this report so quickly at a time of year when, as we know, there is so much to do. I hope they enjoy their well-deserved break. I congratulate the chair and my fellow committee members on their hard work on this inquiry. Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Membership",186

205,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The amendments passed by the Senate and presented to us for endorsement are based upon the government's commitment to work constructively to ensure that our counterterrorism legislation is improved, where it can be, but to do so in a way that does not detract from the objectives of the legislation. In this case, the amendments respond to recommendations by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, to suggestions raised by other government members and, in some respects, to suggestions by the public more broadly, particularly those representing media interests. The key features of the government's amendments provide that a person in preventive detention must be informed that they have a right to put material to the AFP in relation to a preventive detention order and that any such material will be put before the issuing authority in the context of an application for a continued preventive detention order; clarify that an issuing officer will summary information; provide that young people between the ages of 16 years and 18 years must not be detained with adults; require that any questioning that takes place during a period of preventive detention is videotaped or audiotaped wherever practicable; clarify that the AFP must assist the detainee to choose and contact a lawyer and to have access to an interpreter if one is needed; require that the senior AFP officer notify the Ombudsman when a preventive detention order and a prohibited contact order are made and provide the Ombudsman with a copy and summary; specify that the Attorney-General's annual report to parliament on preventive detention orders must include the number of orders voided or set aside by the AAT; clarify that the day of the hearing to confirm or vary or revoke a control order must be set as soon as reasonably practicable after the making of the order; clarify that reliance on hearsay evidence in proceedings for the grant of a continued control order is not permitted; specify that the issuing court will clear summary information provided about reasons for the control order; amend the definitions of ‘advocates' and ‘praising of the doing of a terrorist act' to require that the praise must be made with the intention of doing a terrorist act or in circumstances where it is likely to have the effect of creating a substantial risk of a terrorist act occurring; insert the phrase ‘by means of force or violence' after the word ‘effect' in the definition of ‘seditious intention'-this is a matter the opposition raised which I am pleased to respond to, and I should have mentioned it earlier-insert an additional ‘good faith' defence in relation to publishers of material who act in good faith and in the public interest; and clarify that a warrant, once obtained, does not give ASIO the right to control confiscated material indefinitely. A number of Senate recommendations adclear dress the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. It is the government's expectation that the Ombudsman's role in oversighting the activities of the Australian Federal Police will extend to the exercise of powers by the AFP under this legislation. A range of powers are conferred on the Ombudsman to oversight the conduct of the Australian Federal Police by the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, including powers to conduct own-motion investigations, obtain information documents, examine witnesses and enter premises, and will apply to the conduct of the AFP under the provisions of this bill. I mention these matters because the oversight of the Australian Federal Police is an important matter, but we are not specifically conferring powers in this bill because the powers already exist. The Prime Minister has written to his state and territory counterparts asking that, where state facilities are used to detain a person under Commonwealth legislation, they consider providing entry to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Similarly, the legislation strengthens ASIO's existing powers. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will provide independent assurance. The Attorney-General's guidelines in relation to the performance by ASIO of its function of obtaining intelligence in relation to security, issued by the director under section 8A(1) of the ASIO Act, include guidelines for the treatment of personal information. The guidelines are currently under review but we will consult with the inspectorgeneral in relation to those matters. We took the view that there would be a review of this matter after five years. The Prime Minister agreed and has written to the premiers suggesting that the COAG review should be informed by a wide range of expert views, that this should include the opportunity for public submissions and hearings, and that the existing review mechanisms for other security legislation, such as the Sheller committee, which is reviewing the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, could inform that process. I will speak again to deal briefly with the sedition issues, but I commend the amendments to the House.",196
206,Mr ANDREN,COMMITTEES,"Calare) (4.15 pm)Despite the changes proposed by the Senate, the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 is still condemned by the Law Council of Australia, the International Commission of Jurists and legal experts from across the land-yet here we are about to approve legislation the need for which the government has given no clear outline. I invite all members of this House who oppose all or part of this legislation to join me when I call a division at the end of this debate. I especially appeal to those who in the past 24 hours have made much of the sedition provisions. The Leader of the Opposition says the government is protecting itself, not the Australian people, with these sedition provisions. The member for Kingsford Smith has also railed against these provisions. Not only are our beds burning but so too are our most basic legal rights, such as freedom to protest and freedom of expression. These provisions are unnecessary and they serve a political, not a security, purpose. We already have criminal and security laws that provide sufficient protection. The war on terror is not a war and we do not need warlike responses; it is an international policing campaign to root out those planning mass murder. To ramp up sedition laws and hold people in detention without charge for rolling two-week periods is to surrender freedoms we fought legitimate wars to defend. Such laws exploit fear and try to justify an illegitimate invasion to disinfect an illegal act, which is now about to be protected in sedition laws through the prosecution of those who would dare speak against it. We have already seen Scott Parkin deported for apparently inciting non-violent protest-just imagine a public campaign against the Iraq war as intense as that against the Vietnam War. These provisions are designed to ensure that that justifiable action of the sixties and seventies never happens again. The Prime Minister's contention that these sedition provisions have been in the Crimes Act for the last 50 years is disingenuous. As the Music Council of Australia made clear in an email sent to me: ‘There are provisions that never existed in our law and introduce an alternative element of recklessness.' The MCA points out that there are six offences of sedition that have no link to force or violence and that the limited good faith provisions are not available to all associations. As well, the good faith provisions reverse the onus of proof. As I said, we already have laws that are ripe for abuse without extending the powers of ASIO or state and federal police. The International Commission of Jurists has detailed recent raids on Sri Lankan Tamils in Melbourne, where innocent charitable donors have been caught up in attempts to find links between genuine tsunami aid and assistance to the Tamil Tigers. As with Fretilin in East Timor 30 years ago, someone's freedom fighters are another's terrorists. Let me read to the House the words of one of my constituents, whose concerns are representative of the scores of messages I have received against this legislation from the electorate, with very few in support: 14 day detention without charge, house arrest 12 months or more and the lack of meaningful review by a court of these restrictions represent serious inroads into rights I and other Australians have come to enjoy. Children between the ages of 16 and 18 can also be detained under the proposed laws. This flies in the face of the international standard children should only be detained as a last resort. Rights to be presumed innocent, to a proper defence, and to be free from arbitrary detention as well as freedom of speech are all under threat. Importantly, we do not have a Bill of Rights to protect these rights and freedoms as other countries enjoy ... Considering the government's insistence on including these sedition provisions, as well as the continuation of detention without charge, the unjust control order regime, the absence of independent oversight, the refusal to sunset these laws at five years instead of 10 years, an inadequate five-year reviewand that was the view of the Law Council as recently as half an hour ago-the flawed disclosure provisions, the unfair proceedings and the limited access to legal representation, and in the absence of an overarching bill of rights, I reject this bill and call on those of like mind to join me in the division.",198
207,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"The amendments before the House that were adopted by the Senate are a positive change to the legislation proposed by the government. Labor supports them; they do not, however, go far enough. They are based in large part on the bipartisan recommendations of the Senate committee, which had a very short time to review the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005. Unfortunately, a number of key recommendations of that committee were not agreed to by the government in the Senate and are not before us at this time. They were, however, moved by Labor in the Senate. Regrettably, the government members in the Senate did not support their own recommendations, in some cases, or the proposals we put. There is deep concern on the part of Labor about the provisions of schedule 7 dealing with sedition. In this House and in the Senate we sought to defeat the sedition provisions that altogether. Labor has done all within its powers to remove the provisions on sedition from the bill before us. The government, for reasons best known to them, have insisted on maintaining flawed sedition provisions in this bill. The government know this bill is flawed in respect of sedition. They have already announced their intention to conduct an inquiry into these provisions after they pass into law, in a classic case of putting the cart before the horse. The proper process is clearly that a review of sedition laws should be undertaken and, following that review, consideration should be given by this parliament to any recommendations. But, no, this government have decided that they will pass legislation they know to be flawed and then a conduct a review so that sometime next year we will again revisit this legislation.  review.",199
208,Mr BEVIS,COMMITTEES,"That is an absurd position and, as the Chief Opposition Whip reminds me, it should be a full parliamentary review with the opportunity for public involvement and transparency. That has not been afforded to the parliament; indeed, it has not been afforded to the government for such a review to occur. Perhaps the Attorney may like to explain why it is that he and so few others in his own government are committed to that course of action. I remind the parliament of the bipartisan conclusions reached by the Senate committee in respect of sedition. Their report says: The committee agrees with many of the concerns raised in relation to the sedition provisions. committee agrees with the evidence received that the removal of Schedule 7 from this Bill, pending the review foreshadowed by the Attorney General, would not weaken Australia's antiterrorist capacity ... That is important. We need to understand that the bill before us contains two quite different areas of government policy-one dealing with our response to the terrorist threat and the other dealing with sedition. The sedition laws are not in any way needed to deal with the threat of terrorism. That is not just an assertion I make; it is a conclusion that a bipartisan committee of the Senate made. To this day, the government have failed to provide a shred of evidence, much less a substantive case, to demonstrate why the sedition laws are necessary-certainly why they are necessary in the immediate future-for us to be able to respond effectively as a nation to the threat which terrorism presents. So we embark upon this folly at the insistence of the government. Having done all within our power, both in this chamber and in the Senate, to remove sedition from this bill, Labor have said from the outset that we accept that the agreement reached between the premiers and the Prime Minister is important and that there need to be revisions of our security laws in order to effectively deal with the terrorist threat. We are not willing to jeopardise the safety of Australians on the back of government belligerence and arrogance. We have therefore supported this bill in spite of our serious concerns in relation to sedition. In conclusion, I want to thank those people who have been involved in making the improvements on what was terribly flawed legislation, known as the ‘Stanhope version', as originally proposed by this government. My thanks go to the premiers; the Senate committee, who did a very good job in a short space of time; Senator Joseph Ludwig, ... the who debated this legislation in the Senate with a great degree of skill; and the shadow Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, whose involvement in this legislation has been pivotal and most helpful. I think it has all added to a better outcome for Australia.",200
209,Mr QUICK,COMMITTEES,"On 5 October 2000, in a speech that I made in this House, I stated: On the evening of Tuesday, 12 September 2000, my daughter and several of her friends, along with hundreds of others, gathered outside Crown Casino in Melbourne to peacefully demonstrate against the World Economic Forum meeting. The atmosphere among protesters was positive and non-violent. Into this peaceful scene at around 8 p.m. came riot police, armed with extra-long batons and wearing helmets and visors. ... The riot police charged the protesters, without warning or provocation. ... The officers-the overwhelming majority without identification-launched themselves at the crowd and began to relentlessly beat and punch the protesters with fists and batons, aiming for their heads and faces. Mounted officers then attacked from behind, forcing protesters forward into the line of police who were armed with batons. Protesters who were forced to the ground were trampled by horses, police and other protesters. ... Many protesters were trapped in the crush caused by the police, and attempts to escape were met with further violence. ... One friend of my daughter was hit repeatedly across his back and legs as he tried to escape the violence. I went on to say: [Premier] Bracks praised police for an ‘absolutely outstanding' job on 12 September. What part did he find outstanding? The unannounced baton charge? The failure of police to wear identification? The inability of protestors to identify police and hold them accountable for their actions? The response to alleged individual acts of violence by protestors with violence against the demonstration as a whole? The Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 states, in section 105.41: … A person (the parent/guardian) commits an offence if: … … … (a) the parent/guardian is a parent or a guardian of a person who is being detained under preventative detention order (the detainee); and … … … (c) While the detainee is being detained under the order, the parent/guardian discloses information of the kind referred to in paragraph (3)(b) to another parent or guardian of the detainee. And it goes on to say that the penalty is imprisonment for five years. I can just imagine my daughter being arrested in a similar situation to the one that I mentioned, ringing my wife, Alma, at the Department of Health and Ageing and saying, ‘Alma, I have been arrested.' I can imagine getting home from parliament and my wife is unable to tell me that my 20-year-old daughter, who has the courage of her convictions, is locked away in detention and she cannot tell me because the punishment for that is five years. I would urge all members in this place to read a letter from an amazing person whom we all admire-Martin Luther King. In a Birmingham jail on 16 April 1963, he wrote: One may ask: “How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. ... One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all” Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. … … … Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest. … … … I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law. This letter was written in response to the church. He went on to say: In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique Godconsciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? I, along with the honourable member who spoke previously, are the two people who have voted against this bill. This is an unjust bill and I totally oppose it. (Time expired)",200
210,Ms ROXON,COMMITTEES,"Gellibrand) (4.29 pm)The member for Brisbane, Labor's homeland security spokesperson, has already outlined our position on the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 and the sense of regret that we feel that it could be better than it is. He has taken us through some of the significant improvements that have been made through a Senate process that Labor argued long and hard for. The fact that there was a joint report at the end of the Senate committee process shows just how valuable following some proper process can be. How much more valuable it might have been if a proper amount of time had been allowed and if more of the recommendations had been taken up by the government we can only speculate on. I am not going to go back over the ground that has already been gone over in the speeches on the second reading debate and in the contribution of the member for Brisbane today, but I think it is very important to put on the record that, whilst Labor are supporting the bill now in its amended form, there are a number of significant improvements that we think are needed. There is a significant issue that we will continue to fight for whenever the government stands up and says that our police, security services or law enforcement agencies need more power-that is that the granting of more power must always come with careful controls and oversight so that that power cannot be misused or abused. That is one of the issues that the member for Franklin and others have been trying to raise and we regard it as very significant. If you are going to grant, as this bill does, extraordinary powers that are not normal for the sort of democracy that we live in, you must be careful to ensure that safeguards are put in place. We are pleased that, despite their original intentions, the government have put in place a number of controls, particularly for judicial oversight, which give us much more comfort that the process will not be able to be lightly and easily used-or misused, for that matter, which is the greatest concern that there is. We made very clear in our second reading amendment that we believe that the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security needs to have more resources to be able to do the job properly. We believe that the Federal Police needs to have some oversight or integrity body. It is extraordinary that as a Commonwealth agency it stands without any independent oversight body. I know that the government agree with that, because before the last election it was part of the government's policy to establish such an oversight body. Although we have seen this legislation that we are debating today produced with great haste, it has been 18 months since the commitment was made by the government to introduce some sort of oversight body for the AFP, and we are yet to see even an exposure draft or legislation that would fulfil that commitment. These issues are important to the balancing of the powers that are being granted today. We would like to have seen them as part of the package, but as they are not part of the package they are issues that we will continue to pursue. Whether it is today, tomorrow, in three months time, at the next election or the next time the government puts forward some other proposals, these are consistent measures that the Labor Party think need to be in place if you are going to give law enforcement agencies more power. Another measure that we believe is central is the public interest monitor. The model that Queensland has in place seems to work well. We believe that you could use that as the starting point for introducing a similar system at the federal level. I am not meaning to labour the point, but I think this is very important: if you are going to give the Federal Police, ASIO and other agencies extensive new powers that are going to be used in a way which is quite different to the way their other powers have been used in our criminal system to date, then it is appropriate to make sure that there are some checks and balances in place and some sort of independent oversight-a place where people can complain if they believe that the powers have been misused or if they think that there are systematic problems. I believe we have been very lucky to date in having had a pretty high standard of integrity within our law enforcement agencies, but we would not like to see people and agencies granted a lot of new power with there being no mechanism for the public to feel confident that there was some check on that power except one that relied on just politicians or the heads of the agencies themselves. One of the critical matters that also goes to that is that we are very disappointed that the government have not picked up a threemonthly reporting time frame for the use of these new powers. We do not think it is too onerous for the Attorney-General to report to the parliament and tell us how often the control orders or the preventative detention orders are being used. It is done in the UK, and it should be picked up here. (Time expired)",202
211,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"I will not deal with all of the points made on the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005, but I will deal with some of them. I think the member for Calare has fallen for the argument that is advanced by members of my profession that, essentially, there is only one way in which you can deal with the present risks that we face, and that is to deal with them in the traditional way in which you deal with breaches of our lawthat is, you wait until somebody has committed an offence, you investigate that offence, you consider whether the evidence is sufficient to be able to charge and convict a person with the burden of proof being beyond reasonable doubt and you proceed to deal with the issues in that way. The government came to a view some time ago that in the present situation that traditional way of dealing with issues is no longer appropriate and that control orders and preventive detention were mechanisms that we needed and which had been seen as appropriate in the experience of the United Kingdom, which has already had terrorist bombings. You either accept that or you do not. If you are of the view, as Mr North from the Law Council of Australia is, that nothing like that could happen here, you would stand aside and wait. We came to a view that that was not appropriate. I was glad the member for Gellibrand qualified her comments in relation to the Australian Federal Police, because I think that it is an organisation that is extraordinarily competent. You can see that in some of the investigations that it has undertaken offshore. I think it is an organisation of integrity. The reason we have not proceeded with any particular urgency is that there are no substantial complaints made about our police that warrant those sorts of investigations. The only other matter I want to deal with is the sedition matters. There has been a good deal of misinformation circulated about the sedition provisions. I have noticed that many commentators have suggested a trend in some other countries away from so-called sedition offences. It is certainly the case that in some countries they have moved away from calling offences dealing with the issues that we are dealing with ‘sedition'. That may well be an approach that we will take in the context of the review that we are undertaking. But it is important to understand that the substance of the offences that would be removed from our statute books were schedule 7 and existing provisions to be removed would fly against the trend of what has happened elsewhere. For instance, in the United Kingdom the proposed encouragement, inducement and dissemination of terrorist publications offences address sedition. On 6 October 2005, a report of the independent reviewer of changes to the law against terrorism in the United Kingdom, Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, concluded: In my view this proposal in its revised form is a proportionate response to the real and present danger of young radically minded people being persuaded towards terrorism by apparently authoritative tracts wrapped in a religious or quasireligious context. The balance between the greater public good and the limitation on the freedom to publish is no more offended by this proposal than it would be by, say, an instruction manual for credit card fraud were such to be published. I believe that it is Human Rights Act compatible. The Canadian Criminal Code for sedition offences, like Australian provisions, includes a good faith defence, but, unlike Australia, it provides a maximum penalty of 14 years. Section 3 of article III of the Constitution of the United States defines treason as including: ... adhering to their Enemiesof the United Statesgiving them Aid and Comfort. The US criminal code includes an offence of seditious conspiracy as well as an offence of advocating the overthrow of the government, an offence with similar elements to aspects of the sedition offence in Australia. Therefore the claim that sedition is no longer an offence in other Western democracies appears to be incorrect. But I make the point that we are intent on ensuring that the way in which this has been misrepresented will not be able to continue. The offences will deal with people who, in the words of the act proposed, urge ‘another person to overthrow by force or violence' the Constitution of Australia and a series of other things that follow. If the Labor Party are seriously saying that those measures should not be in the law, let them state it clearly, because that seems to be the position they are taking. We will be issuing a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission. (Time expired)",203
212,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The question is that the amendments be agreed to. A division having been called and the bells having been rung,204
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"As there are fewer than five members on the side for the noes in this division, I declare the question resolved in the affirmative. In accordance with standing order 127, the names of those members who are in the minority will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LOSS NA MEASURES) BILL 2005 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be considered immediately. Senate's amendment(1) Schedule 5, item 20, page 105 (lines 29 and 30), omit “the day on which this Schedule commences”, substitute “1 July 2004”.",204
214,Mr BROUGH,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (4.46 pm)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. Schedule 5 allows employee share scheme participants in certain circumstances to treat the new shares or rights that they are issued in the event of a corporate restructure as a continuation of their old share rights. Following the introduction of the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005 into the House of Representatives the government was made aware of taxpayers who would be unable to benefit from these changes if the date of effect remained on or after royal assent. Accordingly the government has changed the date of effect to 1 July 2004 so as not to disadvantage and to provide the benefit from this measure to these particular taxpayers. It also aligns with the start date of other recent changes to the employee share scheme provisions relating to corporate restructures. Schedule 5 of the bill ensures that a taxing point does not arise for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. It also ensures continuity of treatment for capital gains tax purposes. Whilst speaking to this amendment and noting that this bill passed the other place earlier today, I take this opportunity to say that I announced by press release today that, having had consultation with many industry players and following the deliberations of the Senate committee that the issue of the same business test is not fulfilling its purpose in the way that some industry groups would prefer, I have undertaken to revisit that in new year. Rather than pull the bill in its entirety and resubmit it in the new year, the clear advice from industry was that they would like to see passed the many very positive measures contained in the bill to give certainty to industry. Always wishing to do the best thing that we can to increase the productivity of the nation through effective consultation and implementation of effective taxation legislation, I have agreed to that. Hence we will be meeting with industry in the new year to facilitate, if at all possible, clarifications and improvements to the same business test which will give the clarity that business groups are seeking.",204
215,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Hunter) (4.49 pm)This is the mother of all Brough-ups. While the opposition supported the thrust of the Tax Laws Amendment (Loss Recoupment Rules and Other Measures) Bill 2005 the last time it was in this place, we are tempted on this occasion to oppose it. What the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has just told the House is that, just as was the case with the sedition laws, the government is going to pass this important piece of legislation and then fix the Brough-ups after the event. So the business community is going to get new law as it relates to tax losses, the goalposts are going to move when this bill receives royal assent and then, some months down the track, the government is proposing to change the goalposts once again following a review that the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, who is at the table, announced some 10 minutes ago. So let us review what happened here. The government put forward a bill and the opposition was very quick to point out the bill was flawed. So we moved an amendment in the Senate to try to improve the bill. The amendment related to the threshold and the same business test. The government chose to vote that amendment down. In the interim, it the appears that the minister, unsurprisingly, has had some very heavy lobbying from the sectors that are going to be adversely affected by this bill. But rather than pull the billwhich is probably what he should do-and go back and fix it, he is proposing to let it pass the parliament and have a review for a few months. We do not know any of the details of the review. We do not know who is going to head the review, who is going to be involved in the review or what opportunity industry is going to have to make input into the review. He is going to pass the bill, have the review and move the goalposts on industry somewhere down the track. We have been saying for weeks now that this bill is flawed. The Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue has had every opportunity to fix the billMr Brough-How is it flawed?",205
216,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"but rather than fix it he is going to let it pass, have a review and fix it somewhere down the track. I take the interjection from the minister at the table. He said, ‘How is it flawed?' Well, it is flawed in a number of ways. The key issue here is for industry-industry that relies on certainty in these provisions to make its investment decisions. This is creating huge uncertainty for them. The changes you are making, Minister, to the same business test are going to lock many out of the opportunity to claim these losses. Mr Brough interjecting",206
217,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,You are making changes. Mr Brough-We're not making any changes to the same business test.,206
218,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"The minister says he is not making any changes to the same business test. That is not true. In fact, the industry came to him for changes to the continuity of ownership test and, as a quid pro quo, he decided he would fiddle with the same business test. That is what happened, Minister. The industry has been telling you ever since that that will make it impossible for some sectors to access the recoupment of those losses, and that is going to have enormous adverse consequences for investment in particular industries, like the mining industry, where we have a crisis in mineral exploration and, of course, in a number of areas of venture capital. My challenge to the minister at the table today, Minister Brough, is to forget about the review and to get the legislation right in the first place. We would have liked him to get the legislation right prior to the introduction of the bill-we would not have found it necessary to move amendments in the Senate and we would not be back here today still debating the bill. The right way to do these things, Minister, is to design the bill right in the first place. If the Senate demonstrates clearly to you, and the industry groups in the interim demonstrate clearly to you, that the bill is basically flawed, then pull the bill and go back and have another go at it. Let us not have this folly of letting a bill pass the parliament, having a review and then having another bill to fix the original flaws in the bill. Already these changes are causing uncertainty for industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you imagine a business that has been planning its future on the basis that it would have access to these losses? Now it is going to have to contend with the fact that, after the passage of this flawed bill, those losses are not going to be available to them. They will also be asking themselves: what will be the situation in six or 12 months time, when the minister has had his review and decided that there is a better way of doing this? Minister, my challenge to you is to pull the bill. I know that industry is pretty keen to get the continuity of ownership test changed pretty quickly, but it is just not worth it. Just admit that you have it wrong, pull the bill, go back and have another go and we will be happy to support it if you get it right next time.",206
219,Mr BROUGH,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (4.54 pm)-Unfortunately, the member for Hunter clearly does not understand some of the complexities of these issues. This is not anything new; we deal with this with most of the bills that we put forward. The reality here is that there were no changes proposed to the same business test; there was a threshold to be introduced. Let me explain for the member for Hunter's benefit. A business with a cap ex of over $100 million is quite clearly going to find it very difficult to meet the same ownership test. We have made that more liberal, which has been recognised and welcomed by the industry, so that we are preventing the tax minimisation of trading in losses but at the same time freeing up the provision of this particular schedule to ensure that businesses can continue to operate and gain the benefit from the measure. The same business test is in place; it has not changed. As a result of the Senate committee's work, business came back to me and said, ‘It's not the issue of the $100 million because, whilst we'd like that removed'and that is readily understood-‘the real issue for us is that the same business test has not worked as well as we believe it could.' Under those circumstances, because this is a government that does listen to business, that does try to create laws that work in the best interests of the economy and businesses in general, we have undertaken to do two things-firstly, to give them the certainty that they have requested. I thank both the department and the industry for the work they did in the lead-up to this bill, in getting the continuity of ownership test right, which has been very welcomed by industry. But in the area of the same business test, rather than it being an issue of a threshold, is an issue of the way it has always applied. They would like to see whether or not-I make this very clear to the House-it is possible in law to ensure that it meets the objectives that we in government have and that business also adheres to. It may not be possible-but, being responsive, we have said that we will listen, we will negotiate and consult with business in the hope that we can provide an even better piece of legislation. But we will not deny them the certainty that this bill provides in relation to losses, in particuposition lar in relation to the continuity of ownership test. The other measure that we were referring to here is an amendment that does not relate to the discussion we are currently having. I take it that the member for Hunter has no objection to that particular amendment.",206
220,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Hunter) (4.58 pm)I indicate that the opposition does support the amendment and the effect it gives to the protection of employee benefit schemes. But I am absolutely amazed. It is not a week for giving any credit to the Treasurer in this place, because we have seen the extent of his laziness, sloppiness and incompetence this week, but I did call upon him on Monday or Tuesday to intervene on his junior minister, to pull him into line to do something about the flaws contained within this bill. It seems that the Treasurer has intervened in the issue-but he has not intervened successfully, because a review after the passage of the legislation is simply not good enough. The minister came to the dispatch box after my contribution and said that there is no change to the same business test. I was flabbergasted. I was not sure what to say. I thought I must have been wrong. I could not believe that a minister of the Crown could make such an incorrect statement. I thought I must have been wrong. So I ran back to the EM to double-check. On page 98 of the EM it there is a big heading: ‘Modifications to the same business test'. There is a threshold introduced to the same business test. This is the major concern to the industry. This is the provision that the sector is concerned will deny them access to the recoupment of losses. This is the change, Minister. The opposition is not alone on this question. We sent this, sensibly-we have certainly been vindicated on this basis now-to a Senate committee. Guess what? The Senate committee unanimously agreed with the opthat the bill is basically flawed, particularly as it relates to the same business test. I am sure that Senator Watson and Senator Brandis would have been aghast when, this morning, the government members and others voted down their Senate committee proposition. I bet they will be even more aghast this afternoon to learn that the minister proposes to let the bill pass through both houses of parliament and to have a review, with submissions closing in January, which will possibly have some impact-the minister was not very succinct about that-on budget deliberations. The sector is in no-man's-land. They will have a bill go through that they know is absolutely flawed. It will impose great uncertainty on a number of sectors-indeed, on the business community generally. Worse than that, they will be waiting for the review and wondering whether in May 2006 there will be further changes. How do you plan a business in that sort of environment? How do you plan your investment decisions when you do not know what the recoupment of losses rules will be in six months time? In my view, there is no urgency to this bill, even though I know the sector is keen to get the continuity of ownership test through sooner rather than later. Can I say that it would be much better, Minister, to get this bill right so that, at the very least, the ness community is not dealing with the uncertainty involved in dealing with a tax change in a very complex area-there will be retrospective effects here in the sense of business planning. Businesses were planning two or three years ago and had an expectation that, in 2005-06, losses might be available to them. So they are not sure about that anymore, and they certainly will not be sure about it when this legislation passes. They will be wondering what will happen post the review or, indeed, whether anything will happen at all. I give this advice to the business community: I would not be taking it for granted that, because the government will have a review, there will be some changes around budget time next year. Already the government has been highly embarrassed on this. Already government senators on that committee have agreed that this bill is basically flawed. But they should not think that the political backdown today as a result of the Treasurer's intervention gives them any assurance whatsoever that around budget time next year they will have the flaws in this bill redressed. Minister, I appeal to you again-you have the capacity to do it: take your bill away, with our support. Take the bill back and draft it correctly this time, and consult the industry properly this time, before the event not after it. Take it away and we will support you to do so. But if you will not, Minister, (Extension of time granted) then, in the short time available to us, we will have to seriously consider how we deal with this bill in the Senate. So go away and talk to the industry. Pull the bill and talk to your colleagues. Talk to the Treasurer, because he is obviously the one who has been expressing concern. They have obviously been on the phone to him, over your head, urging him to intervene. We appreciate his intervention but it has not been enough. The industry will not be fooled by a busicommittee after the event. They will not pin too much hope on any relief as a result of your committee, which you think will get you through this political crisis at this point in time. Minister, you are hoping that the budget issues more widely next year will overcloud this. You want to wash this under the carpet now by promising a review. You know that, by budget time next year, there will be much more happening and so many other announcements around that this will be lost in the cloud of other political events. My proposition is that that is the government's plan. The industry and those representing these industries should be aware that that is the plan. I simply appeal to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer once again: pull the bill. Go back and do it properly this time, and consult the industry properly this time. Bring the bill back in a proper form and the opposition will be happy to support you.",207
221,Mr BROUGH,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (5.03 pm)-The member for Hunter has a very fertile imagination. I suggest to him that he use the time between now and when the bill gets to the Senate to ring industry. I am sure that will ensure that this bill will pass in way that it currently stands in the Senate. It would be a loss to Australian industry and a loss to the Australian economy through the bloody-minded attitude of the member for Hunter if that were not to occur. I feel that, being a reasonable man, other than the blown-up rhetoric we hear in here he will see that good common sense will prevail and he will ensure that common sense prevails in the other place and the bill will in fact pass. I have confidence.",209
222,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Hunter) (5.04 pm)I am happy to consult with industry; indeed, I have been. In fact they have been ringing me ad nauseam. I am not going to name them, because I know how this government operates. They will be punished for the rest of the term of this government for being so recalcitrant and for speaking out against the government. We are almost living in a police state these days. No-one speaks out against the Howard government so I am not going to name them, Minister, but they have been on the phone to me. They know there is a proposed change to the small business test. They know it will disadvantage them and they know it will create great uncertainty in the business community. They know something else, Minister: they cannot take the word of this government on this idea of, ‘Don't worry about the flawed bill. We'll have a review and fix it around budget time.' That is not the way to run a government. If you have a flawed bill, you pull it and you go and fix it. You do not pass legislation through this place which you have conceded is flawed and say that you will fix it after the event. I know the government has form on this issue, because that is exactly what it did with the sedition offences in the antiterrorism legislation, as you know only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker. So let us summarise: the minister brings in a flawed bill. He is determined to get it through in its current form-so determined the that he leaks it to the Australian Financial Review to try to lock his team into place. Then, at my request-and I am happy to claim the credit-the Treasurer intervenes and says: ‘Look, Mal, you've got all of our members on the Senate committee voting against this bill. This bill is flawed. You have the front page of the Financial Review-I don't know where that came from, but we just can't proceed with this in a political sense. What we could do is tell them that we'll have a review after and tell them we'll fix it in the budget next year.' And the minister expects, of course, that the industry should take them at face value. They are not taking you at face value, Minister, because I have spoken to some industry representatives since your one-minute-to-midnight media release this afternoon, and they are far from satisfied with what you are promising them. I can tell you that they are absolutely amazed that any government of any political persuasion would, twice in the space of a couple of weeks, admit that their own bill is flawed and push it through the parliament anyway on a promise to fix it after the event. The Governor General of this country does not deny a bill when it comes before him-that has been a tradition in this country for a long time-but he must be starting to think about it. When he is continually reading in the papers that the legislature is passing bills which, by its own admission, are basically flawed, he must be getting out the Constitution to check on his powers and thinking about whether it is appropriate for him to give royal assent to these pieces of legislation. Minister, you have admitted you are wrong, but concede that it is just not bright to pass legislation and promise to fix it later. Pull the bill. The opposition will be happy to cooperate and do everything in its power to expedite the passage of the new legislation when you bring it forward-that is, of course, on the assumption that next time you get it right.",209
223,Mr BROUGH,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (5.07 pm)-This is not a flawed bill. No matter how many times the member for Hunter wants to get up here and use that sort of terminology, this is a solid piece of legislation. What I have undertaken to do is to take that forward as it is and have it passed into law so as to give assurance to industry that that is place and for them to act upon. In the event that industry is able to work with Treasury to come up with an improvement to the same business test then that will be considered. I make it very clear: that will be considered. There is no suggestion that the government is putting forward a bill that is flawed or that is leaving open revenue holes-that there is leakage or anything of the sort. While we are on leaks, unless the member for Hunter has missed something, a Senate committee gave a public report and, glory be, the Financial Review actually gave notice to that on the front page of the paper. Far from it being a leak, it was just the reporting of a public hearing. The member for Hunter may be unaware of those facts, but here are the facts: there is no flawed bill, and I am undertaking to work with industry to see whether we can make improvements to the same business test. It is no fait accompli that that is possible, but in the interestMr Fitzgibbon-Ah, the caveat.",210
224,Mr BROUGH,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"I have stated from the moment I stood up here that I always stand ready to listen to business. But I can give them no assurance, because the business representatives have been unable to this point to come up with a workable solution that will improve the same business test and also protect the integrity of the revenue base in relation to this issue. I will always listen to business. I have a track record of listening to business, and I will continue to do that, regardless of the comments being made by the member for Hunter.",210
225,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Hunter) (5.09 pm)The minister has just conceded that this is a political stunt. He has just sent a clear message to the industry not to expect any change. He says: ‘This is not a fait accompli. Don't expect change. This is my little manoeuvre to push this aside as a political issue in until such time as we can bury it under the excitement surrounding the size of the Commonwealth budget.' That is what he is proposing. When he returned to the table, he said this",210
226,Mr SLIPPER,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My understanding of the standing orders is that it is a breach of the standing orders to be guilty of tedious repetition. The member for Hunter is clearly guilty of that parliamentary offence.",210
227,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,The honourable member will resume his seat.,210
228,Mr FITZGIBBON,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"I am very pleased the member for Fisher has turned up to undertake his speaking obligations today, unlike on the last occasion when he failed to take the opportunity to defend the small business community. What the minister told the House was this: ‘This is all about ensuring that businesses have access to the small business test until we can make it better.' They have access to the small business test now. The minister is trying to make their access to the small business test more difficult. What the minister is saying is: ‘Rather than give them access to the current scheme, we will change it when this gets royal assent in a couple of weeks time.' But then his half promise is: ‘We'll change it again in six months time.' I simply say to the minister: ‘Leave the small business test as it is.' It has been operating happily for a long time now. I am not saying it is perfect-and we are happy to talk about improvements-but do not change it and then change it again, Minister. Change the continuity of ownership test, leave the same business test alone and promise them the review. Then, instead of having two changes, they will have only one change. At the moment they are living under the current same business test, for six months they are going to live under the new same business test, with the hope, on a wing and a prayer, that after next year's budget they are going to have another same business test. I ask the minister: ‘What is the point in changing the small business test now if it is his genuine intention to change it again at budget time next year?' Minister, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Next time you get to your feet, you should give us the real explanation. Is it because you simply are not prepared to swallow your pride and back right down, or is there another event in operation here that we do not know about? You really need to explain the point of changing something now and changing it again in six months time-which, as I have said, will create enormous uncertainty, paperwork, compliance et cetera for the business community. Pull the bill. We will be happy to help you this time around. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed.",210
229,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. During the member for Jagajaga's contribution, she moved an amendment. Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ripoll-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",211
230,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has moved an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,211
231,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005. I was interested to hear the member for Hunter, when speaking on the prior bill, somehow suggest that the Governor General ought to have an unfettered right to either grant or withhold royal assent to legislation passed by this parliament. I believe the member for Hunter is probably a republican, and I find it quite an interesting proposition that he would want the Governor General to have that unfettered right.",211
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The chair should probably have reminded the member for Hunter about standing order 88. I now remind the member for Fisher about standing order 88, but I cannot be too savage to him, given that I was lenient to the member for Hunter.",211
233,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,I did not want to reflect on anyone. I wanted to comment on the rather bizarre turnaround by your colleague the honourable member for Hunter.,212
234,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,The chair is neutral when in the chair.,212
235,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I accept that, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. You are certainly one of the better Labor occupants I have seen occupy that high office.",212
236,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,I think I have told the honourable member for Fisher before that flattery might not get him too far.,212
237,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I am always happy to compliment the member for Scullin; I know that he makes a very worthwhile contribution. However, my contribution today is in relation to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005. I think most people would be relieved to know that Australian universities at last are starting to gear up more and more to become more competitive in the international tertiary education marketplace. Like other honourable members, I was concerned to see the ratings lists of international universities and to find that, until recently, no Australian university appeared in the top 20 and only one or two appeared in the top 50. I understand that this is changing somewhat and the University of Melbourne has received international recognition and other Australian universities are also now being seen as world-class tertiary institutions. The fact that our institutions are becoming more competitive is a significant development in our tertiary sector. Large numbers of overseas students make the pilgrimage to our Australian institutions to get their tertiary qualifications and to do that in a society that is relaxed and comfortable and relatively safe compared with other global hot spots. I think most people in the community accept that international students bring significant overseas income into our country, and that is a good thing. In addition, they build linkages between their countries of origin and this country. When one sees the large number of alumni of Australian universities back in their home countries occupying positions of influence, authority and power, one realises that this has assisted our nation to become more accepted in our part of the world, and I think that is a very good thing. In 2000, there were 182,000 students from overseas who were studying at Australian universities. Of those, 150,000 were onshore students and 56 per cent-that is, 102,000were studying tertiary degrees. Around 31,000, or 17 per cent, were enrolled at technical institutions and colleges. They were the figures in 2000 and no doubt those figures have substantially increased between 2000 and 2005. The provisions of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill strive to encourage further the ongoing development of this lucrative industry, an industry that is not only lucrative for our education sector but also lucrative as far as Australia's international place in the world is concerned and the understanding we have with people in other parts of the globe. While the traditional markets for international tertiary students are Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia, students are now coming in greater numbers from North and South America, Africa, Europe, Bangladesh and the Philippines. All these students from all these nations are contributing very substantially to the national health of the nation of Australia. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill builds on the achievements of Australian universities in developing tertiary education as an important export earner. This bill will help to improve the legislative systems in place to guide the operation of Australia's higher education sector. One of the most important modifications suggested by this bill will be the strengthening of accountability arrangements set out in the Higher Education Support Act 2003. These arrangements, as they are, are designed to give tertiary students the confidence that their institution administrative structures in position that are fair and transparent. Reforms of the higher education sector in recent years have encouraged institutions to set themselves apart from other universities, to market themselves as unique and to focus on achieving positive improvements in the areas of learning outcomes, teaching, workplace productivity, collaboration with other institutions and, most importantly, equity. The bill will also ensure that these institutions are accountable for their outcomes in these areas. The provisions in the bill embrace the ideas of fairness and transparency when it comes to the selection of students, and this reflects Australian government policy. The bill also ensures that the selection criteria used by the institutions for students are fair and reasonable in the providers' view and, most importantly, they must be based on merit. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill also embodies the power for the minister to be able to request an audit of certain tertiary institutions to determine if they are complying with requirements under the act for financial viability, fairness, compliance and contribution, and fee requirements. I think that is really important, because in 2005 we expect our tertiary institutions to dot the and cross the t's and to fully observe the law. The ability being given by this bill to the minister to request an audit is a very important safeguard. The fact that the minister has the ability to request an audit will probably ensure that these audits will not be regularly necessary, because the institutions will know that they are being watched very closely. This bill will not only give potential students the perception of attending an upstanding institution. It will also put in place a stricter requirement and ministerial powers has to ensure that our universities continue to improve in the areas of both student and administrative outcomes. This will help us to boost further the real international attractiveness of our institutions, thereby increasing the number of international students who consider making the institution of their choice an Australian institution. This is an important bill. The government is not minded to accept the amendment moved by the opposition, but that is probably no surprise to the opposition. We certainly would not want to give the shadow minister a Christmas present at this point, particularly when her request for such a Christmas gift is so fatally flawed. I commend the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 to the House.",212
238,Ms LIVERMORE,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 provides for mostly technical changes to the government's principal Higher Education Support Act. Notwithstanding the technical nature of this bill, it cannot be seen in isolation from the government's broader higher education policy and all that is wrong with this government's education policy. This bill is one more product of this government's reactionary and incoherent education policy framework. Those problems are listed i's in the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister. They include things like the failure to adequately fund higher education, the massive increases in HECS debts facing most students and the introduction of $100,000-plus degrees in this country. Paragraph 4 of the motion sums it up when it condemns the government for ‘pushing Australian universities further down an American style user pays university system'. That is certainly the case. Of course, the other product of the government's irrational and incoherent approach to higher education is the bill that passed through the House earlier today-the voluntary student unionism bill. You could not get a better example of the minister's misplaced priorities than the effort he has put into that particular ideological obsession over the past 12 months or so. Instead of addressing the real challenges facing universities in Australia, the minister has been stuck fighting the old battles of the seventies. In his determination to pay back student unions for their activities some 30 years ago-and of course to bolster his credentials for the Liberal Party's leadership race-the minister's VSU law will close down the essential services that students rely on at campuses right around Australia, particularly at regional universities like Central Queensland University in my electorate. Back to the bill. As I said at the start, we have to consider this bill in light of the government's overall record in higher education. Before I address some of the specific measures of this bill, I would like to briefly line what this government has done-or perhaps, more accurately, has not done-for Australia's higher education sector over the past nine years. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of this government's incoherent education policy is its absolute refusal to properly fund higher education, despite the role of education in creating a skilled, innovative and productive nation. The minister for education throws around figures about the funding he has poured into the higher education sector. For example, he claims that over the past nine years the sector has received an increase of $4.4 billion and that funding per student has never dropped. The only problem is that the minister's own department cannot even back him up on those figures. The unfortunate situation and the reality is that, since coming to office nine years ago, this government has slashed a massive $5 billion from our universities and funding per student has dropped by six per cent. The shameful truth is that Australia is the only OECD country to have significantly reduced public funding to our universities, while increasingly relying on private funding to prop our university system up. It is interesting that the member speaking earlier was referring to the international rankings of universities, which are becoming more and more important for our universities' viability, particularly in attracting international students, who now constitute a $6 billion a year export industry in Australia. I am not sure how the government expects that record and those rankings of our universities to hold up without appropriate support from the government through proper funding of universities. This government has not invested in Australia's higher education sector. In fact it has failed to invest in Australia's future. How can the minister for education keep a straight face when he talks about inout- vesting in Australia's future when he has personally seen funding slashed so significantly from our universities? Another very concerning aspect of this government's education policy is its continual refusal to address the problem of inadequate indexation for our universities? Inadequate indexation has been a persistent and very legitimate concern of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee. The indexation formula that this government persists in using to calculate government university grants is grossly inadequate. It fails to compensate for the very real increases in the cost of providing quality education. Unfortunately, this inadequate indexation of grants has led to significant problems in Australia's higher education sector. One obvious consequence is that an extraordinary amount of financial pressure has been put on Australian universities. For example, the New South Wales Auditor-General released a report in May this year that revealed a deterioration in the financial status of universities in that state. The report revealed that around half of the universities in New South Wales were in deficit and some in serious deficit. How did the minister for education respond to these alarming findings? The minister has still refused to revise the indexation formula, even after the mounting evidence of the pressure that this is putting on our universities and the real threat that it poses to quality in our university system. Australian universities have had little choice but to pass on the increasing costs of getting a tertiary education to students and their families. Under Labor, the introduction of the HECS scheme provided a fair and affordable way for Australia's students to access a university education while making a partial contribution towards the cost of their education through the taxation system once they had graduated. However, HECS under the Howard government is unrecognisable. After squeezing universities for years, the Howard government gave them the option of charging a premium on HECS fees, and guess what? Most of them took that optionor, you would have to say, were forced into that option. So most Australian university students have been faced with a 25 per cent increase in their HECS debts. We have witnessed almost every one of the 38 universities being forced to increase their fees through the HECS scheme just to stay financially viable. As Professor Peter Sheehan, the National Vice-Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, said in a media statement at the time of its decision on HECS: With the absence of full indexation of the government grant we have been faced with no other choice but to increase HECS in line with the majority of Australian universities. In these circumstances, the minister has also allowed universities to charge up-front fees for courses and, not surprisingly, after nine long years of inadequate funding many of them have opted for that. So we now have Australian university courses costing students over $100,000. I will give the House just a couple of examples. Veterinary science at the University of Sydney will now set you back $147,600, while a degree in physiotherapy at the University of Queensland now costs a staggering $112,000. So much for the government's promise to the Australian public that no university degree in Australia would ever cost over $100,000. What we have seen over the past nine long years is not an investment in Australia's future; what we have seen is a climb in the cost of getting an education in this country, which has put it beyond the reach of ordinary Australians. The government is sending the message loud and clear to Australians that a tertiary education equates with high fees and large debts. The message is that higher education is a privilege to be enjoyed by the wealthy, rather than an opportunity that is available to all on the basis of merit. It is a message sent by a government that is out of touch with the educational needs and aspirations of Australians and out of touch with the financial burdens that are being placed on Australian families. It was only a few months ago that the minister for education made it very clear where this government stood on matters of equal opportunity in relation to higher education. When asked by ABC's Four Corners program if he thought a university education was a privilege, the minister for education responded: I think that it's a privilege. This is a very worrying attitude to be displayed by the minister for education. On this side of the House, we believe that everyone should be able to access a quality and affordable education at all levels. Every Australian should be able to access a tertiary level education, not just the privileged few, as the minister for education would argue. It is obvious that the message from this government that higher education is not for everyone but only for the wealthy is getting through. Just a few weeks ago we saw another drop in the number of Australians applying for a university place. Domestic enrolments dropped for only the second time in the past 50 years. The most dramatic falls were in regional areas like my electorate of Capricornia, where the Central Queensland University has 15 per cent fewer students applying for its courses in 2006. I wonder where my region of Central Queensland is going to get its nurses, its engineers, its teachers, its scientists and its researchers from if that trend continues. We need to be training and qualifying people right in our region to do the jobs that are required. At a time when our neighbours and competitors in Asia are investing heavily in education and encouraging people to increase their skills and qualifications, our government is doing just the opposite. By making tertiary degrees unaffordable for so many in the community, the government's policies are discouraging people from furthering their education. While the opposition will not stand in the way of the various minor and technical elements of this bill, there are two particular clauses that are cause for concern, and I assure the House that the opposition will be watching the effects of these clauses very closely. The first area of concern is the ness requirements outlined in schedule 2 of the act. The bill intends to insert the word ‘reasonable' into the act so that the act will read that the provider: ... must have open, fair and transparent procedures that, in the provider's reasonable view, are based on merit for making decisions about the selection of students who are to benefit from the grant, allocation, or payment. Our concern is that the insertion of ‘reasonable' has the potential to make this process less transparent. I recognise that the proposed changes to schedule 2 are mostly technical. However, given the government's track record in failing to recognise that every Australian should be able to access a tertiary education on the basis of merit, I am concerned by any moves to make the selection criteria of students into university study any less transparent. Legitimate concerns have been raised on this side of the House about the amendment to schedule 2. It is possible that these proposed changes may lead to a softening of the fairness and transparency requirement of the selection criteria in our universities. The amendments to schedule 2 add a subjective element to the equation. Rather than selection being based purely on objective merit requirements, the amendments give more leeway to providers to consider their own ‘reasonable' view of merit. Obviously, any softening of the fairness and transparency of the selection criteria is entirely undesirable in terms of fairness and equal access to education. The opposition will be monitoring the impact of this change, to ensure that transparency and fairness remain a fundamental principle of the selection of students into courses of study. I would also like to raise my concerns in the House today about the proposed amendments to schedule 4. The amendments introfairduce additional auditing requirements for non-table A higher education providers. The amendments will allow the minister to require a non-table A provider to be audited with regard to financial viability, fairness, compliance, contribution and fee requirements. The amendments also provide that the audit must be conducted by a body determined by the minister and that the provider must fully comply with the auditing body and pay charges for the auditing. The opposition believe that robust accountability for education institutions is absolutely necessary. Of course education providers should be held financially accountable. I also recognise that the proposed amendments are not overly onerous, especially as they only apply to non-table A providers. However, there are concerns about where these types of amendments will stop. While these amendments are not overly burdensome, the minister has shown a great deal of enthusiasm for meddling in the management of education providers, whether it is relations with their staff, the courses they will offer or, after today, how they will vide vital student services on their campuses. So we have to ask: what will stop this government legislating for more extensive, more intrusive and more administratively burdensome auditing requirements? What will stop this government making these requirements more onerous? And, perhaps more concerning, what will stop this government making these requirements apply to table A providers as well? I think the House needs to be wary of amendments such as those proposed to schedule 4. While the opposition have always called for robust financial accountability, we are also aware of the undesirability excessive central regulation. In summary, while this bill will do no harm to the higher education sector, it certainly does nothing to offer the kind of support that our universities and our students deserve from government. As a nation, we need individuals to be given the opportunity to make the most of their abilities if we are all to succeed and prosper. Right now the government is slamming the door on those opportunities for too many people. While the opposition will support this bill's technical amendments, we will certainly be watching very closely to ensure that the quality and standards in Australian higher education and opportunities for students are not further undermined by this government.",213
239,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005, which amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003. Among a number of things, it will clarify the definition of ‘student load' and clarify the quality and accountability requirements to ensure higher education providers' selection procedures are based on merit in the provider's reasonable view. I note the concerns which were expressed by the previous speaker, my colpro- league the member for Capricornia, on that particular issue. She outlined the opposition's concerns about that amendment to schedule 2. The bill will clarify that guidelines for incidental fees and fees in respect of overseas students are to be specified in the Higher Education Provider Guidelines rather than in the Commonwealth Grant Scheme Guidelines. It will provide an audit to conduct an operation of non-table A higher education providers. This was to determine their compliance with one or more of the requirements of the act, subheaded ‘financial viability reof quirements', ‘fairness requirements', ‘compliance requirements' and ‘contribution and fee requirements'. Again I go back to the comments which were made by the member for Capricornia in her contribution. She outlined the opposition's concerns about schedule 4. The bill will clarify the requirements that need to be satisfied before a person will be taken to be a Commonwealth supported student. And it will reflect the new business name of Open Learning Australia: Open Universities Australia. Whilst, as the member for Capricornia said, the opposition will not oppose the proposals that have been put forward, we do want to express our concern about the impacts that particularly schedules 2 and 4 may have, and we will be monitoring them into the future. The opposition amendment provides a bit of clarity as to where we might be heading in the higher education debate. The member for Jagajaga moved the following amendment: whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) breaking its promise not to increase the 35 per cent cap on full fee paying domestic undergraduate places; (2) failing to provide adequate indexation of university funding; (3) failing to provide enough university places to meet the high levels of unmet demand from eligible Australian applicants; (4) pushing Australian universities further down an American style user pays university system, and (5) pursuing an extreme ideological agenda, including measures such as punitive workplace relations requirements and so-called voluntary student unionism, instead of adequately addressing the real issues facing Australian universities. Throughout the year I have spoken a number of times in this place about the attacks on higher education being carried out by the Howard government almost on a continuing basis. As I reflect on what I have said during these contributions to debate on various pieces of legislation which have passed through this place during the year, it is clear to me that the situation is simply getting worse, especially for regional universities like the Charles Darwin University, which serves my electorate and which indeed has a campus in Alice Springs. Charles Darwin University has its base in Darwin. Mr Nairn-Established by the CLP.",217
240,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Established by the CLP, as my colleague over here says, but funded by the Labor Party. Mr Nairn-Not originally funded by the Labor Party.",218
241,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The interjections come from a former resident of the Northern Territory and former voluble member of the CLP in the Northern Territory, currently the member for Eden-Monaro. He does have some history with the Northern Territory and some experience of it. Mr Nairn-I'm very proud of it, too.",218
242,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"He is very proud of it, and I applaud him for that. We have not always agreed, and we will not always agree in the future. We certainly will not agree about his interpretation, I am sure, of some of the things that the CLP have done to education in the Northern Territory. But it is true that they did initiate the development of the Charles Darwin University. For your information, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay-you may like to know this-it was formerly the Darwin Community College, and I taught in it. Then when it changed its name to another guise I taught at that as well. Mr Nairn-The Darwin Institute of Technology.",218
243,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Darwin Institute of Technology. Then it became Charles Darwin University, and I taught in that as well. Mr Nairn-No, the Northern Territory University.",218
244,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I beg your pardon, the Northern Territory University.",218
245,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,What happened to Batchelor College?,219
246,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is still there. I will come to that in a moment. I have had the opportunity to work in that fine institution in its various guises. I thank my colleague for helping me in the construction of this speech! What we do know is that over the last number of years, since 1996, Charles Darwin University has suffered massively under the Howard government. It has a very difficult task because it seeks to deliver higher education services to a sparse population, a relatively low population and a population which is not centred on a large population centre-as in your instance, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the regional centre of Townsville. We have one large population base in Darwin of only 100,000-plus people, a smaller population base in Alice Springs of about 28,000 to 30,000 people and the opportunity to try and provide outreach services to other places around the Northern Territory. It is an extremely difficult task it requires resourcing. I think it is a real sue. It is certainly a real issue for me. When look at the services which are being provided to people who live in the bush, as I would describe it, access to higher education is a matter of major concern. The government may have the desire and obsession to drive Australia down the American path of higher education but, in my view, it is tearing opportunities out of the reach of people in my electorate. To me, that is a major concern and I have expressed that sentiment previously in this place. One example of the impact on Charles Darwin University of the Americanisation of higher education is that the university has raised its HECS fees by a full 25 per cent. It was allowed to do that by the Howard government's changes to higher education. The government's farcically named Backing Australia's Future package has led the way for full up-front fee degrees, for which students will have to buy their way through higher education rather than be rewarded for merit and academic achievement. In October, in a contribution I made to a debate in this place on the question of voluntary student unionism, I told the House that, of the 1,100 units previously offered by the Charles Darwin University, 340 units had been cut in 2005. That is a remarkable number of units-a third of Charles Darwin University's offerings-that were cut in 2005. That has occurred because of the cuts in government expenditure on and investment in higher education in the Northern Territory, largely by the Howard government. It seems to me that we have a responsibility to all Australians. Whilst the government has an ideological view-a view that I do not accept-it has the responsibility for providing access to educational services for all Australians and at a reasonable cost. In the context of Northern Australia, certainly and Charles Darwin University has been sacriisficed at the altar of the government's ideoI logical expediency-and, frankly, I do not think that is good enough. I have spoken previously also about the Charles Darwin University's business school in Alice Springs. This year, nine courses were advertised. In the past, those nine subjects have had lecturers in front of students in classrooms in Alice Springs. However, this year, only two courses have lecturers in classrooms, and other courses are expected to be conducted online. Frankly, that is just not good enough. It means that, in Alice Springs, we are getting-with great respect to the professionalism of those who are responsible for those courses-second-rate university teaching. Those students need to interact with staff on a regular basis. I have some experience of being an external lecturer at what is now a university. Previously, the Curtin University of Technology in Western Australia was the Western Australian Institute of Technology. As a part-time external tutor at that university, I was involved in teaching and looking after external students in the history department. As anyone who is involved in correspondence education will tell you, it is extremely difficult to monitor, advise and participate and engage with students in that sort of situation. We need to try and minimise what we are doing in impacting on remote area education by ensuring that, as far as is possible, we get lecturers in front of classes so that there is proper interaction and value is added to the education that students expect to receive. I have also noted previously in a contribution in this place a piece written by Kent Rowe, who is President of the Charles Darwin University Students Union. He noted that, since the 1996 election, the Howard government has removed $6 million a year in recurrent funding from Charles Darwin University alone, or around $40 million to date. It is clear that the ideological obsessions of the Howard government have badly affected the services that Charles Darwin University can provide to people in my electorate-and the Howard government should be condemned for it. This has happened on two fronts: with its introduction of legislation to prevent universities from charging compulsory fees for student services and representation and with its moves to make university funding reliant on adopting its radical workplace relations changes. In October, I spoke about the ideological obsession of the Howard government in introducing voluntary student unionism. It is willing to blow students' access to essential services in a blatant case of payback politics. At CDU, many services are under threat from voluntary student unionism-an ideological obsession of the coalition. Today, in this chamber, we saw people applauding and clapping the minister on the back because the government had passed this piece of legislation through the House.",219
247,Dr EMERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,Big kids from student union days.,220
248,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"That is right. What a shame job, to have the minister parading around this place, poking his chest out like some hairy peacock because he has had passed through this place successfully the voluntary student unionism legislation-this ideological obsession, for which the Howard government ought to be condemned. That legislation will do no good for education services in this country and, in large part, having been criticised by all sectors of higher education, it will have a dramatic, negative impact upon student life and upon the services that can be provided by the universities. I hope that there is enough gumption and guts in the Senate for some who sit on the government benches to walk across to the other side of the chamber and prevent the passage of this legislation. We have seen time and time again this year that the government wants to silence its critics. It is worth saying this again: in just one month, I have been denied the chance to speak on vital legislation because debate is being gagged. Very recently, we saw sedition laws pass through this chamber that will threaten free speech in this country. This government cannot stand criticism of its political agenda, so it wants to silence all those who criticise it. To win the political battles that these pathetic individuals on the other side of the chamber could not win when they were involved in student politics whilst they were at university-and, I might say, while they were enjoying a system that was supportive of their academic aspirations and that was, for most of them, free-they now want to impose full fee paying obligations on Australian students. We have seen what that means. It was outlined in some detail this afternoon by the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, when she pointed out the increasing cost of courses and degrees. In 1996 an arts degree was $7,300 and this year it averaged $15,000; a science degree was $7,300 and this year it averaged $20,000; a law degree was $12,000 and this year it averaged $40,000. In 1996, the staff-student ratio was 15.6 students per member of staff and now it is 20.7 students per member of staff. There were 60 full fee paying places in Australia's universities that cost more than $100,000 year, and 20,000 qualified people missed out on a place in a university in 2005. Just last year, for the second time only in 50 years, the number of Australians going to university declined. Where does the responsibility for that lie? I suspect the government will blame the children, the students, or maybe they will",220
249,Dr EMERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,Probably the student unions.,221
250,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Yes, the responsibility of the student unions. Or perhaps the government will blame the parents. Is it any wonder? As I have said previously, the government is attempting to Americanise the Australian university sector. As the member for Jagajaga pointed out in her contribution this morning, more than 60 degrees have cost over $100,000, as I have just said. A medical law degree at Monash University costs a staggering $256,000; dental science at the University of Melbourne, $150,000; physiotherapy at the University of Queensland, $112,000; medicine at the University of Adelaide, $151,000; and the list goes on. Are we really to expect that Australian students, Australian parents and Australian families should be required to accept that obligation to get access to a tertiary education? It seems to me that the government has a responsibility to explain to the Australian community why this situation is occurring and why the number of students at Australian universities has declined this year. There is no explanation which is good enough, as far as I am concerned. I am most concerned because it devalues higher education in the minds of the community, because they say it is no longer accessible. For people who live in regional Australia, it becomes even less accessible. The reason is that you have to send students away from home. I will take my own family as an example. I have a this number of children-some would say too many-and one of those children is about to go off to university.",221

253,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Very well done. We live in Alice Springs. We have no option, like other parents who live in Alice Springs. If their children want to go and become a vet, a doctor, a drama teacher or whatever, they have no choice but to leave Alice Springs. What does that mean for the cost to the family? Already they wear the burden of having to send their children away. But then, if I lived here in Canberra and my child were attending the ANU or the University of Canberra, we could absorb their living costs into the household budget. That is not the case if they have to go away to university, and of course this has not been properly considered by this government. When they now promote the idea of the Americanisation of the Australian university sector, they are adding disincentive upon disincentive for those people who live in the bush to go away to university. It seems to me that they will pay the price for that in the longer term. This should not be about dumbing down the society; this should be about providing the greatest possible access to all Australians who have the qualifications to attend a higher education institution. is not what the government are doing. We have seen by the additional costs what is happening in that regard. We already know about the impact of the workplace changes to higher education. Some of the proposals in the bill that we contion, fronted here earlier in the year included quiring education providers to offer AWAs to all new employees by November 2005 and to all other employees by 31 August 2006 and requiring certified agreements to include a clause that expressly allowed AWAs to operate to the exclusion of the certified agreement or to prevail where there is an inconsisvise tency. Of course, universities like Charles Darwin University, which serves my electorate, will be required to implement these radical changes to the way they employ academic and administrative staff, in order to access the funding they need to continue providing educational services. They are being told that, unless they adopt this absurd proposition-another set of ideological obsessions of this government which it has enshrined in legislation-and unless they jump through this ideological hurdle, they will not get funding. How bizarre is that? Because they may have a view different from that of the government about workplace relations, they are threatened with cuts in funding. The proposals would have meant that, if the CDU certified agreement was not compliant with changes by September 2006, CDU would lose out on receiving a five per cent increase on its basic grant for 2006 and a further 7.5 per cent in 2007. That is morally indefensible. A university-in this case CDU, which is having difficulty with the cuts in funding that it has had to wear since 1996-is now in that position. Whilst the bill that we are discussing this evening bears largely on technical issues, there are a number of matters-two matters This in particular-which the member for Capricornia advised the House that we would be particularly monitoring. But I note the amendment that has been put by the opposition spokesperson, and I ask the House to endorse it, because it reflects the poor situathe outstandingly bad situation, that we re- are now confronting in the higher education sector because of the malpractice and poor service of this government.",221
254,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,I thank the member for Lingiari. The question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. I just adthe member for Rankin: something may happen in your speech.,222

256,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,I think you understand what I am referring to.,222

258,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,Yes.,222
259,Dr EMERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Rankin) (5.57 pm)Sometimes it is said that the differences between Labor and the coalition are not very great and that it can be a case of Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Never could that be further from the truth. In the last days of this year of 2005, in this parliament, a chasm exists between the views and philosophy of the coalition government and those of the Australian Labor Party. That chasm has opened up so clearly and so widely with the tragic passage of the industrial relations legislation. It exists profoundly in relation to the so-called Welfare to Work measures, which in fact are welfare to welfare measures that put some of the most vulnerable people in our country onto lesser benefits in a very punitive and vicious way; and now, today, it exists in relation to the treatment and funding of university education in Australia. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 is minor and of a technical nature. On that basis, Labor supports it. Nevertheless, it gives us the opportunity through the second reading amendment to make some observations about this government's approach to university funding, the philosophy behind that approach and the fundamentally different approach that Labor embraces. I had occasion to make some remarks in the media not long ago. In response to those remarks, the Minister for Education, Science and Training revealed the true intentions of this government. He said to the Australian newspaper on 15 September: Based on the demographics we know we are facing and the increasing tightening of the labour market, I will be surprised if there is a significant increase in demand for higher education above what it is today. There will be an increase in demand until 2014, and then it will decline. The minister for education is indicating that, as far as the coalition is concerned, the number of university places for Australian students will decline over the next 10 years. He describes this as a decline in demand. When the price is as high as it is under this government, then of course demand will fall away. That is just as this government wants it. It wants universities to be the domain of the privileged in this country, and it wants the sons and daughters of working Australians to aim lower-that is, to not aim for a university education. When the shadow minister for education, I and other members of the Labor opposition say that it is right and proper that young people from working class backgrounds should be able to aim for a higher education, a university education, we are described as ‘job snobs'-the words of the minister for education. I understand that the message in the bottle has now arrived. In view of its importance, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

260,Mr ANDREWS,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (6.03 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I do not propose to take much time of the House, because these matters were canvassed in earlier debate today. The amendments largely relate to the government's acceptance of the recommendations of the majority of the Senate committee which infailure quired into the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I therefore commend these amendments to the House.",227
261,Ms MACKLIN,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: (1) Senate amendment 3, after subsection (4B) insert the following subsection: (4C) The matters determined in subsection (4A) must include that particular paid work is unsuitable for a person if the cost of child care would result in a low or negative gain from that work. (2) Senate amendment 8, after subsection (IAD) insert the following subsection: (IAE) The matters determined in subsection (1AC) must include that particular paid work is unsuitable for a person if the cost of child care would result in low or negative gain from that work. (3) Senate amendment 17, after subsection (2AD) insert the following subsection: (2AE) The matters determined in subsection (2AC) must include that particular paid work is unsuitable for a person if the cost of child care would result in a low or negative gain from that work. (4) Senate amendment 24, after subsection (1D) insert the following subsection: (1E) The matters determined in subsection (1C) must include that particular paid work is unsuitable for a person if the cost of child care would result in low or negative gain from that work. The amendments that the government are seeking to move tonight unfortunately do not stop these welfare changes being a fraud on vulnerable Australians. It is a very sad fact that as a result of the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 we are now going to see the creation of a large number of American-style working poor, because this legislation moves people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment. It will take money out of the pockets of some of the poorest Australians. The extraordinary thing about this legislation is that it will not only move people from one welfare payment to a lower welfare payment but also reduce the financial return from work. It will make it less financially attractive to go to work than to stay on welfare. To make that very plain: when people with a disability or single parents move into work under these changes, they will still give very as much as 75c of every dollar that they earn back to the government. Anyone who thinks that these amendments make this legislation any less of a fraud unfortunately has been a victim of that fraud. The amendments that I have moved exa very pose just one small part of that fraud-that is, the Prime Minister's child-care guarantee. On 2 June, the Prime Minister was shamed by the member for Sydney into promising the following: If ... the cost of [child] care would result in a very low or negative financial gain from working, the very parent will not be required to accept the job. The problem is that the Prime Minister gave this promise here in the House of Representatives, but there is no reference to it in the legislation. Here in the parliament tonightat the eleventh hour-we are seeking to do what the Prime Minister and the Minister for a very Employment and Workplace Relations, who is at the table, should have done, which is make sure that this promise was included in the legislation. My amendments bring the Prime Minister's guarantee into the relevant sections of the amendments that the House is receiving from the Senate right now. In practice, the amendments will mean that single parents who have a requirement to look for work, whether they are on parenting payment, youth allowance, Newstart allowance or special benefit, will not have to accept a job when their earnings are eaten up by the cost of child care. When we call a division on this tonight, we will expect all members of the government to vote for these amendments, because they are about a promise that was given by the Prime Minister of this country here in this parliament in June this year. I hope that we will have every member of the government supporting the amendments. All that we are asking them to do is vote for the prime ministerial promise. Labor's amendments say: ... particular paid work is unsuitable for a person if the cost of child care would result in a very low or negative gain from that work.. We do not pretend for a minute that these amendments make the legislation acceptable. For that, you would need a blowtorch. But they do hold the government accountable for the promise it made, and they particularly hold the Prime Minister accountable. He made this promise right here in the House of Representatives. He made it to the parents who want to work but cannot find affordable child care. I commend the amendments to the House.",227
262,Ms PLIBERSEK,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"I second the amendments to the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 moved by the member for Jagajaga. The words in the amendments give effect to the Prime Minister's promise of 2 June. The question really is: is the Prime Minister a man of his word or is he not? The Prime Minister said on 2 June: If ... the cost of [child] care would result low or negative financial gain from working, the parent would not be required to accept the job. We have kept our amendment to these very simple terms. It is our intention to put into this legislation the guarantee that the Prime Minister says that he has already given to Australian parents. Has he given a guarantee or not? In this bill, there is no reference at all to the cost of child care. That concerns me greatly. We were only able to extract a promise from the Prime Minister on 2 June after he was shamed into acknowledging that there would be circumstances in which parents returning to the work force or going into the work force after having their children would be worse off not just because of effective marginal tax rates or the very clear disincentives that are written into this legislation but because of actually, literally losing money because their child care would cost more than they would be gaining from their work. The Prime Minister had dragged from him this promise that, if the benefit from working was outweighed by the cost of child care or there was a very low gain from working, parents would not be forced to accept that job offer. Where is it in the legislation? Nowhere. The bureaucrats were dragged out to defend it during the Senate inquiry into the welfare bill. Their defence, which I think you would have to say was fairly flimsy, was that proposed new section 501A(7)(g) protects sole parents from child-care bills that wipe out their wage. Let us have a look at what that section actually says. It says that, in considering whether to approve a parenting payment activity agreement, the secretary of the department is to take into account ‘the financial costs of compliance with the agreement'. There is nothing specific there about child care. There is nothing specific in a very there about a very low or negative gain. There is no mention of child care there. The relevant section of the explanatory memorandum says that it reflects matters that are ‘are taken into account in respect of activity agreement under other income support payments'. Child-care costs are not currently taken into account under other payments at all. Child-care costs are not taken into account under other payments. There is no mention of the cost of child care. It just shows the poverty of the agreement that the Prime Minister had dragged out of him on 2 June. Is there any other section of the explanatory memorandum that should give parents comfort? No, there is not. Page 41 of the explanatory memorandum says: The Secretary will bear in mind the cost of child care and accessibility of the child care when ing a determination as to the appropriateness of the child care. The problem with this is that the devil is in the detail. The devil is in the discretion given to Centrelink officers and others to interpret the will of the secretary. You could have, conceivably-very easily-two Centrelink officers in two different towns, one of whom says that spending 20 per cent of your gross income on child care is too much and does not make forcing you to take this job worthwhile and another who says that 80 per cent of your gross income is not too much because you are gaining all the associated benefits of working and one of these days you will be earning more and be able to afford your child care a bit more easily. There is nothing in this legislation that enacts the Prime Minister's guarantee that, if the cost of child care would result in a very low or negative gain from work, parents will not be forced into the work force, leaving their kids at home, leaving their kids in substandard conditions. (Time expired)",229
263,Mr ANDREWS,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (6.14 pm)-The government is ensuring that child-care costs will not absorb all the money that mothers on income support earn through paid work. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply mischievous. Parents on income support are only required to accept a part-time job once their youngest child is at school. So what we are largely talking about here is outside-school hours care rather than long day care. After-school hours care for parents on income support is heavily and generously subsidised by the government once child-care benefit and JET are taken into account. Low-income families receive the greatest support with the cost of child care through the child-care benefit. For makexample, a low-income family using afterschool care pays about $1 per hour. Families using vacation care are only paying 35c per hour. A number of families will be eligible for JET child-care assistance. The maximum fee a family using JET will pay is $2 per session, regardless of the number of children in care. So the opposition chooses to confuse the issues by not pointing out that the Welfare to Work package aims to maximise the opportunity of parents of school age children, for example, through the additional 84,300 child-care places for school age children, which is a cost of some $260 million over four years. The commitment to sensible child-care costs is reflected in the protective provisions of the Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005 and is specifically cited in the explanatory memorandum. My department will be developing guidelines on how the costs of child care will be taken into account in accessing suitability for a job. Indeed, in the development of these guidelines, we are consulting widely. We are consulting with the various welfare groups and we will be consulting through the Welfare Consultative Forum, which includes amongst its membership representatives of or persons who are involved with organisations such as Mission Australia, the Smith Family, Catholic Welfare, ACOSS and others. So we are developing these guidelines and it will be done in consultation with the relevant and interested parties. We also have guidelines on other types of costs. For example, we do not expect a person to take a job if they would need to spend more than 10 per cent of their gross wage on travel costs. Guidelines such as this ensure people can afford to take up part-time work and increase their income from work. For these reasons, because these matters are being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way through consultation with the various parties that I have mentioned, the government rejects the amendments which have been put before the House this afternoon and the matter will be addressed in the way in which I have indicated.",230
264,Ms PLIBERSEK,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"I would like the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to explain why he is not prepared to meet the Prime Minister's own commitment given in this place on 2 June. These are his own words. What is there to object to in the Prime Minister's own words? Why will you not support the commitment that the Prime Minister made in this place? I would also like to ask the minister: how can you justify, intellectually or morally, this double standard? There is a 60-minute travel rule-unfortunately, it is nowhere in the legislation and nowhere in the explanatory memorandum but is committed to by your own press release and Minister Dutton's press release-and a rule that says that, if you were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of your income on travel, then you do not need to take up the offer. Why can you be so specific about the cost of transport and yet, when it comes to child care, you will not say 10 per cent, you will not say 20 per cent, you will not say 50 per cent, you will not say 80 per cent? Why the double standard?",231
265,Mr ANDREWS,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (6.18 pm)-If I can briefly reply to the member for Sydney, the commitment which the Prime Minister made will be met by the government, but the government proposes to do this by way of the mechanism of guidelines and regulation rather than through the legislation. That is the way in whichMs Plibersek interjecting",231
266,Mr ANDREWS,RELATIONS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member says, ‘Why do you do it in relation to travel?' We do it in relation to travel. We have it in regulations and guidelines so that flexibility can be applied to particular cases. We are going to do the same thing in relation to this. That is the most sensible way, we believe, to move forward in this direction. But, as I said, what the Prime Minister said will be borne out in the final version of this legislation and guidelines and regulations as supplied to individuals. We are not walking away or running away in any sense of it from what the Prime Minister has said. We will put it in the regulations, as we have indicated we will.

NA AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed.",231
268,Dr EMERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"In my remarks on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005, I have already observed that this government considers access to a higher education should be available only to those who have the financial means to pay for it. That is an absolutely shocking indictment on this government. If ever there were a black mark against the government it is through the industrial relations legislation that passed through this chamber today and the Welfare to Work measures, which in fact are welfare to welfare measures-vicious, punitive measures that have just been passed now. Here we are on higher education and the government is occupying the position that those who can afford to pay for a university education should be able to obtain that education; for those who cannot, that is too bad-they should be aspiring to a technical education. I want to say quite clearly that those young people who aspire to a technical or a vocational education have every right to do so. It is a legitimate and very worthy pursuit. But those young Australians who are the sons and daughters of the working people of this country from less privileged backgrounds, who aspire to a higher education, should not be shut out of a higher education by prohibitive fees. Yet that is exactly what is happening in this country. In 1999 the Prime Minister solemnly said in this parliament and outside that there would be no $100,000 university fees. That was an ironclad promise. Ms George-Another one.",232
269,Dr EMERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Another ironclad promise in the Tony Abbott mould. There was no qualification to this promise and yet, in there are 60 full fee paying places in courses in Australia's universities which cost more than $100,000. That is 60 violations of that promise. By way of example: a medical-law degree at Monash University costs a staggering $256,000; dental science at Melbourne University costs $150,000; physiotherapy at the University of Queensland, $112,000; and medicine at Adelaide University, $151,000. So there it is: the sons and daughters of working Australians are being shut out of a university education by this government's prohibitive fee policy. I am glad to see the Minister for Education, Science and Training in the chamber. I was referring to his comments before this debate was interrupted. He basically said that anyone in the Labor Party who aspires to the sons and daughters of working Australians being able to have a higher education is a job snob, and he condemned us for it. He also condemned me personally for having an aspiration to double the proportion of young people in Australia going on to university. At present, around 30 per cent of young people go on to university, which is a very big increase on the eight per cent or so who used to go on to university in the pre-Whitlam era. So there has been progress, from eight per cent to 30 per cent. But the fact of the matter is that, in the modern global economy, access to a higher education and the proportion of people who are able to complete a higher education is a fundamental determinant of productivity growth and the future prosperity of nations. It is a fundamental influence on the wealth of nations. The Deutsche Bank has done an analysis which concludes that access to higher education is so important in productivity growth and future prosperity. Alarmingly, the analysis forecasts that Australia will rank last among 33 countries in growth in years of 2005, education between now and 2020. By 2020, our neighbours China and India will be the largest and third-largest economies in the world, and already they are producing more than 2½ million university graduates a year. Australian universities are producing just 160,000 young graduates a year. I believe that it is a legitimate aspiration to double the proportion of young people going on to university, say by 2020, from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. The education minister has described that aspiration of mine as madness. He said it is mad to imagine that there should be a doubling of the proportion of young Australians going on to university. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has set a target of 50 per cent of young Britons participating in higher education by 2010, so what is mad about the idea of 60 per cent of young Australians going on to university by 2020, a full 10 years after that? The minister has asserted that he would have to trawl through the nursing homes of Australia to find the people to go on to university to meet that aspiration of a doubling of the proportion of young people going on to university. Where is the maths, Minister? If 30 per cent of young people go on to university now and we double that to 60 per cent of young people, you do not need to go near a nursing home, although the minister can go near a nursing if he so wishes. It might be a good place for him to go if he truly believes that it is wrong and that it madness that we should be talking about the target of 60 per cent of young Australians completing a university degree by the year 2020. The minister has said that he would have to trawl through the nursing homes to find those people. Why not start with the more than 20,000 Australian school students who qualify for a university place but who are locked out of the university system by the government's limit on places? And why not encourage more of the 70 per cent of young Australians who do not go on to university to consider a university education? The OECD finds that, since 1996, almost all of its member countries have supplemented increases in private funding of tertiary education with extra public funding. But it identifies a major exception, and that ception, shamefully, is Australia. What has happened in Australia is that increases in private funding of universities have substituted for increases in public funding of universities, such is this government's mad ideological obsession. We stand almost alone amongst the countries of the OECD in that shameful record. The fact is that cash starved universities are responding in the expected way to the fact that they are not receiving anywhere near full indexation of their costs. That means that they have to find the money somewhere. How are they finding the money? They are finding it through the application of full fees to foreign students. A very simple analysis by Professor Bob Birrell and associates has found that, since government came to office, virtually all of the growth in the student load of Australian universities has been from full fee paying foreign students. How the Minister for Education, Science and Training can consider that he and this is government are doing a good job when there has been virtually no growth in the number of Australian graduates in our universities is beyond me. Instead of devising innovative policies and putting a bit of extra public funding into the universities, the minister and the other ‘big kids' on the coalition side have occupied themselves for the last year with the issue of voluntary student unionism. They are reliving their student days and squaring up for battles that they engaged in and lost. They have occupied so much of the time of this parliament and of the cabinet on the issue of voluntary student unionism instead of developing creative policies that would allow all young Australians, irrespective of their backgrounds and their financial circumstances, to be able to go on to univerex- sity and obtain a university degree. The government made profound changes to university funding arrangements, effective from the beginning of 2005. It increased to 35 per cent the proportion of Australian students who could be full fee paying students. It also lifted the cap on HECS funding, allowing universities to charge a 25 per cent increase in HECS fees. All but three universities have responded in the expected way because they are being starved of cash by this government. We have moved from a situation where, under previous Labor governments, all young people who aspired to go on to university, who had the intellectual capacity and who worked hard to do so, could go on to a university education. Professor Bruce Chapman, the architect of this HECS, has confirmed through studies that HECS, as it is structured, has not been a deterrent to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds going on to university. But when you change the arrangements to increase HECS fees by 25 per cent and increase the proportion of young Australians who are full fee paying students then you will get a genuine deterrence, and that is what is happening. Last year, for only the second time in the last half a century, the number of Australian students going to university has fallen. That is on this minister's watch. It is not only a matter of negligence but a matter of deliberate government policy. This government is obsessed with technical education, which is fine, but to the exclusion of a university education. I find it disgraceful that the ministers other frontbenchers responsible for this policy have almost all benefited from a university education provided by previous Labor governments-the Whitlam government and, following it seven years later, the Hawke government and then the Keating government. So they were there, they got the benefit of a higher education, and then they turn around and say to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds: ‘You are not cut out for a university education. We are going to shut the gate on you and shut you out of a university education.' If there was ever a more profound policy difference and philosophical difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition, it lies in the area of industrial relations, but it is second only to this government's policy and philosophy in relation to universities. I have proposed that banks and superannuation funds might be able to contribute private funding for the public good. I am not hung up on the idea that all extra funding going into universities must be public funding. I think there is a very strong case for extra private funding of universities and a very strong case for extra public funding of universities. But when I did propose that perhaps superannuation funds and banks, through what I called Australian student equities, could help out by investing in the talents of young people, again the minister for education described it as ideological madness. He said that we were ideologues for suggesting that such a policy should apply. The minister is supposed to be from the market side of the debate. He should be someone who welcomes extra private funding of universities, but he describes it as madness. We have the perverse situation where the minister, Commissar Nelson, is presiding over a central planning agency here in Canberra which eminent economist Max Cordon has described as ‘Moscow on the Molonglo'. and So we have Commissar Nelson, in his central planning agency, telling every university which places they can have and which places they cannot have and running a Soviet style command and control economy. He is supposed to be a Liberal. We know that he came from the Labor Party, but we have disowned him since. He obviously came from a very backward part of the Labor Party, a part of the Labor Party that was dismantled with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall. But obviously this minister harks back to the days when the Berlin Wall was up and central planning was all the rage. So Commissar Nelson is sitting there in the command and control centre in Moscow on the Molonglo and telling the universities what to do, when to do it, how much they can charge and how many places they can have. I am on the Labor side, and I think there is an argument for less restrictive regulations on our universities. You do not have to control everything, Minister. The fact is that many of our universities now obtain only 30 per cent of their funding from government funding. The reason for that is that this government has starved them of public funding so they are heading that way, yet the minister wants to control their every move-every breath they take, every move they make, he is watching them. The minister cannot seem to get over his old Soviet style predilections from when he was member of the Labor Party. We need more private resources in the universities, the public good, and we need to combine those private resources, for the public good, with extra public resources so that we can genuinely give every young Australian who aspires to a higher education an opportunity to have a university education, to improve themselves in life and to express and develop their talents in a creative society. Higher education is not only the source of productivity growth; it is the key that unlocks the door both to productive growth and to opportunity for all young Australians. (Time expired)",233
270,Dr NELSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (6.47 pm)-I thank all those who have contributed to the debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005, although I did not agree with quite a bit of what was said by those on the opposite side. However, it is worth pointing out that the government-in fact, two years ago this week-passed groundbreaking legislation for reforms of higher education. The end result of that has been an increased $11 billion in investment over a decade in universities, 40,000 additional government funded HECS places over the next five years and $400 million to support scholarships for living and accommodation costs for 43,000 Australian students. We have moved the universities to fund them on the basis of what they actually deliver and to provide performance based funding pools. I announced only last week the first allocation of the $251 lion learning and teaching performance fund, from which Wollongong and Swinburne universities, for example, were ranked in the top five. I turn now to some of the comments made by the member for Rankin. Firstly, the lifetime chance of higher education in Australia at the moment is approaching 50 per cent, with 30 per cent of students going directly from school to university. If you were to for have a 60 per cent participation in higher education by 2020, you would need students with an IQ of 90 going into the university system. The member for Rankin should know that the forward demographics for university demand show that we expect demand to increase by about 12 per cent by 2020 in Queensland and by seven per cent in Western Australia. We are anticipating a five per cent reduction in Victoria, a 12 per cent reduction in South Australia and an 18 per cent reduction in Tasmania. This year, university demand is down by 8½ per cent for non-school leavers and up 1.5 per cent for school leavers. Overall, demand is down 2½ per cent. The simple reason that demand is down is that the labour market is very tight. There is plenty of work, plenty of overtime and plenty of jobs, so non-school leavers, in particular, given the opportunity cost of going back to university, will understandably take a job. When the Labor Party was in government and we had 1.1 million Australians who were unemployed-11 per cent, in fact, in 1993-140,000 people could not get into university in January 1993. The reason they were queued up was that they could not get a job. One of the other things the member for Rankin might appreciate is that if there is a 60 per cent participation rate in a country with collapsing age dependency ratios and falling demand in terms of the demographic for higher education, you also have to take milinto account a 40 per cent attrition rate and reasonable failure rates. At the moment in Australia the lowest published entry score was a tertiary entrance rank of 32 for information and communication technology at RMIT. How low does the Labor Party really want entry standards to go in Australian universities? The other great inconsistency, which has been covered in one of the opposition's amendments, is the so-called cap on Australian fee payers. The ridiculous part about this is that Labor Party policy is that there should not be a single Australian paying his or her own way in an Australian university. The Labor Party supports no cap because it believes that there should not be any Australian students paying their own way in Australian universities. The Labor Party is hypocritical in complaining about a move on the cap. Equally, the Labor Party often says that the government should listen to the vicechancellors, but the call for the removal of the cap has actually come from the vicechancellors. I have said that I would be prepared to entertain it in the context of other changes that might also be put forward by the leaders of Australian higher education. The argument has been put, for example, by Professor Ian Chubb, the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, who says, ‘Why should there be no cap on foreign students but there be a cap on Australian students?' The absurdity of Labor's position is that there would be not a single Australian under a Labor government able to pay his or her own way in an Australian university, but an Australian can go to Malaysia and do a medical degree with Monash University. They can pay their own way and then come back into Australia with a Monash medical degree. That is amongst many of the inconsistencies in the Labor Party's position and the amendments being moved. The particular bill that is before us contains measures that will enhance the legislative framework under which the higher education system operates. It will strengthen the accountability arrangements already in place under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 so that the Australian government and Australian students can be assured that all higher education providers have structures and procedures in place which are fair, transparent and accountable. This bill will provide for ministerial discretion to require a compliance audit to be conducted on the operation of non-table A providers to determine their adherence to the financial viability, fairness, compliance and contribution and fee requirements of the act. It is envisaged that such compliance audits would be conducted on an as required basis in circumstances where the Commonwealth requires further assurance of the provider's compliance with these matters. The bill will also clarify the requirements that need to be satisfied before a person is taken to be a Commonwealth-supported student. It also makes some minor technical revisions to the Higher Education Support Act 2003, including amending it to reflect the new business name of Open Learning Australia-Open Universities Australiaand clarifying that the guidelines for incidental fees and fees in respect of overseas students are to be specified in the Higher Education Provider Guidelines rather than the Commonwealth Grant Scheme guidelines. It further clarifies the definition of ‘student load' as it relates to a bridging course for overseas-trained professionals. This bill also amends the Australian National University Act 1991 to repeal an obsolete heading. I urge members to support the bill. The government most certainly will not in be accepting the amendments that have been proposed by the opposition, and I will make sure that the Hansard records that the Labor Party has called for further deregulation of Australian higher education in this debate. The member for Rankin and others have called for further deregulation. We heard comments about ‘the commissar' and ‘the politburo' and all those sorts of things. I say to the Labor Party: if the fact that, as minister, I require universities to train nurses in regional communities and I require universities to train podiatrists and I require a say over training people in scepticism and the paranormal means that I am guilty of excessive regulation, I stand accused and condemned.",236

276,Mr RIPOLL,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Can I say at the outset that Labor opposes the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Promoting Safer Workplaces) Bill 2005. The bill was originally introduced into the House of Representatives on 1 April 2004. It lapsed with the prorogation of the last parliament and was reintroduced to the House of Representatives on 9 March 2005. This bill seeks to exclude Commonwealth employers and employees, including those in government business enterprises, from the operation of the ACT's industrial manslaughter laws and any subsequently enacted state or territory industrial manslaughter laws. The bill was considered by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, which reported on 10 May 2005. Regrettably, at no point has the Howard government consulted its ACT counterpart on this legislation. The bill was developed as a response to the introduction in the ACT of industrial manslaughter legislation. The ACT's Crimes (Industrial Manslaughter) Amendment Act 2003 came into effect on 1 March 2004. This act introduced the specific crime of industrial manslaughter into the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT). This provision is applicable to all employers, employees, independent contractors, outworkers, apprentices and trainees or Comvolunteers working within the ACT. The act also specifies a senior officer's offence, making senior officers liable for prosecution where it is proven that their negligence or recklessness led to the death of an employee under their supervision. The ACT government's evaluation of occupational health and safety laws identified problems in regard to private employers responsible for OH&S administration, who could evade responsibility for breaches of OH&S legislation by hiding behind a corporate veil. The ACT government believe that that same possibility exists for similar evasion by managers and senior executives in the public sector who are responsible for ensuring the enforcement of OH&S rules. The ACT authorities also believed that the charges and penalties were deficient in cases where accidents resulted in deaths in the workplace. Prosecution of corporate employers is difficult. The ACT government believes that its industrial manslaughter legisladeaths, tion provides a mechanism to facilitate the prosecution of companies and individuals found to be guilty of breaching OH&S requirements and causing death. In defining a corporation as a legal person, able to be prosecuted for a criminal offence, the ACT government has said it intends that the law will be a forceful deterrent to those companies who evade their responsibilities in providing a safe workplace. Under current OH&S legislation it is easy to prosecute companies for breach of the OH&S laws. Fines, rather than jail terms, are imposed on these companies, because the legislation does not differentiate between breaches which result in minor injuries and breaches which result in death. Breaches which have resulted in workplace deaths have proved difficult to prosecute. The Occupational Health and Safety Act 1989 (ACT) provides a fine for failure by an employer to: ... take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health, safety and welfare at work of the employer's employees. This attracts a maximum penalty of $25,000 for an individual employer or $125,000 for a corporate employer. Those who argue for the industrial manslaughter laws say that the more substantial penalties would be effective, as the charges would be seen as genuinely criminal rather than quasi-criminal, as under the current OH&S regulatory regime. The ACT government expressed in its submission to the Senate inquiry that existing pieces of OH&S legislation are: ... remedial rather than punitive in nature, ie they are there to improve the conditions of work, not to make the employer or employee suffer penalties for breaches of the law. It is the view of the ACT government that the change to the law with regard to workplace so as to put these within the criminal jurisdiction, emphasises the value which society places on human life and on the dignity of employment. Current attitudes to safety in some workplaces carry with them the notion of employees as assets which are attached to a business. This is not much further advanced than a past practice of seeing employees simply as units of labour and, by extension, the property of their employers. Consequently, the ACT government also places importance on the symbolism of industrial manslaughter legislation when considering its practical impact. With prosecution administered by the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, rather than by an OH&S inspector, industrial manslaughter and workplace death is understood to be an intolerable risk, treated with greater severity than other OH&S infringements. The bill specifically seeks to exclude the operation of the ACT's industrial manslaughter laws. The ACT's industrial manslaughter laws do not apply to direct employees of Commonwealth departments, as these laws do not expressly bind the Commonwealth in the right of the Crown. However, the ACT industrial manslaughter laws do currently apply to Commonwealth government business enterprises, such as Telstra, Australia Post and the Health Insurance Commission. This bill would have the effect of making Telstra exempt from the ACT industrial manslaughter legislation but leaving Optus covered by the legislation. The ACT government estimates that this bill, in exempting GBEs from the ACT's industrial manslaughter laws, will affect fewer than 1,000 employees. Therefore, the practical effect of the proposed bill is minimal. However, the ACT government remains strongly opposed to this bill because it is an intrusion into the right of the ACT to determine the laws that apply in this territory. Also, large, well-resourced corporations such as Telstra should not be exempt from the ACT's industrial manslaughter laws just because they are majority owned by the Commonwealth. The bill is also expressed to take effect retrospectively from 1 March 2004. As a matter of public policy, Labor opposes retrospective legislation. Since this bill was first introduced, other states have moved to amend their legislation to address workplace deaths. This bill seeks to exclude Commonwealth employers and employees from the application of a law of a state or of a territory which, to quote section 11A(1) of the bill: (a) imposes a criminal liability in respect of a person's death that occurs during, or in tion to, the person's employment or provision of services to another person; and (b) is prescribed by the regulations. It is unclear, particularly in the absence of the regulation referred to in the bill, whether the bill will apply to the various pieces of state workplace death legislation. This is something that the minister could address in his reply. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee considered the bill and reported on 10 May 2005. The government majority report supported the bill, stating that in the government's view emphasis on education and compliance to prevent industrial accidents was the preferred approach and imprisonment was excessive. Labor and the Democrats produced minority reports on this bill. The Labor senators opposed the bill, arguing: Changes to the law in regard to workplace deaths, so as to put these within the criminal jurisdiction, will emphasise the value which society places on human life and on the dignity of employment. Current attitude to safety in some workplaces carries with it the notion of employees as assets which are attached to a business. The Labor senators also opposed the overriding of state and territory jurisdiction by the Commonwealth. The Democrats supported the view that: ...the application of the criminal law of a State or Territory should not depend upon whether the employer is a Commonwealth authority or not. But the Democrats determined to formalise their position when the bill is considered in the Senate. In conclusion, Labor believes that this bill will only create more confusion about which ACT employers are and are not covered by industrial manslaughter laws and will not remove uncertainty, as has been claimed by the government. Instead, the bill will effecrelatively create a two-tiered system of occupational heath and safety within the ACT. Further, it is unclear whether this will also be the case in other states that have introduced various versions of workplace death legislation. Labor opposes this bill.",238
277,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"O'Connor) (7.06 pm)The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Promoting Safer Workplaces) Bill 2005 introduced by the Howard government today is a response to a piece of arrant stupidity presented to Australia by a governing body that, by any measure, should be a local government. It is headed by a chief minister called Stanhope who constantly makes the job he holds down look very foolish. I had considerable contact with him when I was Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, and I found him to be pedantic and silly on issues which I tried to address for the people of Canberra. On one occasion I saw him do a 180-degree turn from his highly principled position, after one of his aides obviously read him some of the public popularity figures on the issue. To think that the many thousands of people in middle management or other parts of the Commonwealth employment structure in this town-which of course lives or dies on the activities of this parliament-could be charged with manslaughter! Of course they are subject to a high degree of probity in very laws that have been produced by this Commonwealth government to manage industrial health and occupational health and safety throughout our workplaces. In order to refute any suggestion in any part of Australia-and this is a message, at least, to other state governments-that participating in this foolishness will be allowed to affect the ployees of the Commonwealth, it is very timely that the minister has brought this legislation to the parliament. The bill will exclude all Commonwealth employers, employing authorities and employees from the application of ACT industrial manslaughter laws and any other similar industrial manslaughter laws enacted by a state or territory in the future. This is all based on a premise associated with OH&S, an old adage that says prevention is better than cure. We attempt as best we might throughout Australia, typically, to protect people from themselves. It is an amazing thing that people with the appropriate expertise can walk across Niagara Falls on a tightrope. You could put that tightrope over there and the average citizen, having good sense, would not walk on it. But there is a belief amongst legislators today that you should have enough signs out surrounding the rope to say, ‘Don't walk on this rope.' They think there should be signs saying, ‘Don't dive into this bit of water in the ocean'-you would need such a sign every 20 or 30 metres around the coast of Australia. That is a totally impossible impractability that keeps confronting the ratepayers of various local authorities. They are silly premises. I think our law has overemphasised the prevention concept, and the concept of self preservation is being ignored, leading to a farcical situation. To say that someone over in a property in Barton could be charged with manslaughter because something happened out in some the part of Canberra to an employee of that department is outrageous. It is equally outrageous in terms of large corporationscompanies that employ 30,000 or 40,000 people. Why should a senior official of that particular company be subject to a threat of manslaughter when in fact they have done their best and they have passed all the necesem- sary resolutions through their board? What more can they do? This circumstance of the potential for abuse of duty of care has just been highlighted in Western Australia. The deputy leader of the Liberal Party over there-prior to that appointment, I might add, but as a senior member of the oppositionaccidentally shot his son in the thumb while they were out rabbit shooting. He was devastated by the injury he did his son, but the powers that be prosecuted him for failure of duty of care. The magistrate in the end realised it was a witch-hunt and fined him $1,500-which was probably the least he could do under the legislation-but refused to record a conviction. In the meantime, the man felt obliged to retire from his position deputy leader and from the front bench, with obviously some considerable financial loss. While all that was going on because he was a Liberal, most unfortunately a wellrespected and recognised rugby player backed over his baby daughter. It was a tragedy. Fortunately the child has survived, apparently without permanent injury. Is the Premier of Western Australia ringing up the Premier of, I think, Queensland and saying, ‘You've got to have this bloke for his failure to have a duty of care'? Any suggestion that either parent wished to inflict that injury on their child, one being mature and one being a baby, is ridiculous. But that is where we are at. It is quite possible, no doubt, under the state laws of Queensland, for this man to be charged with running over his own baby-if he were the Deputy Leader of the Opposition up there. That is abuse, and this legislation is ject to abuse. Are we prepared to say that the footballer in Queensland should have been charged with industrial manslaughter if that baby had died? That is what we are talking about. We are talking about legislation gone berserk. I congratulate the minister and the government for having the proper responsibility to say, ‘Not in our backyard.' If the Chief Minister of the ACT's twopennyhalfpenny parliament believes that is a burden to put on the employers of the ACT, I guess we can only be grateful it is a very small area and people will be able to take the opportunity of going to Queanbeyan or somewhere to invest their money. This whole issue is a matter of grave concern to me and my electorate. One of the great killers and maimers of people is the motor car. Manufacturers over time have done much to make vehicles safer and, quite properly, we have legislated that people should wear a seatbelt so that they have the as opportunity of protecting themselves in that regard. Ms Hall-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order relates to standing order No. 70. The member is straying from the subject of the debate. He talks about motor vehicle accidents, which are in no way related to the workplace but rather to motor traffic",241
278,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,I have listened attentively to the member for O'Connor and he is addressing the subject of the bill. There is no point of order.,242
279,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Has the member for Shortland never heard of a taxi? Is a taxi a workplace? Some of the people she has serviced in her life get workers compensation from the moment they get in their private vehicle to drive to work. She is here because they became sick of having her where she sub- used to be and she comes in and demonstrates her lack of knowledge of the matter before us, when I am talking about a motor car. Let me talk about motor vehicles and how many people are killed and maimed by them and about the protective mechanisms that are put within them. Ms Hall interjecting",242
280,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,The member for Shortland will desist. She will have her turn shortly.,242
281,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Yes, won't she. For goodness sake, I should stand around. It will be the biggest vacuum in my life if a motor car is not part of occupational health and safety. Ms Hall interjecting",242
282,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,The member for Shortland will desist.,243
283,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The point I want to make is that, under the ACT law we are overriding here today, if an employee of any personincluding the Commonwealth, up until this moment-went out in an older type vehicle without airbags and consequently, through the total fault of the driver, got killed while travelling within the ACT, the legislation could quite easily be read as saying that, because that vehicle was not equipped with airbags, a manslaughter charge could be levied against the individual who owned that vehicle and sent the person out to work in it. That is what we are talking about. But millions of cars in Australia do not have airbags. Clearly, that is the standard that is set today. I want to talk further about that regarding other pieces of equipment that are operated within my electorate. My mother often said, ‘If you put a beggar on horseback, they will ride to the devil.' That is a good thing to say about people who get empowered by legislation passed in places like this and go out full to the brim with their newly acquired power and try to apply a law in a machinery environment that encompasses many years. A car without an airbag-or without side-impact airbags or top-level airbags: what is the standard that might make you subject to a charge of manslaughter? Regarding my electorate, all of a sudden the authorities of Western Australia have decided to attack machinery dealers. When a farmer has an old piece of equipment-in my electorate, the pressure is on getting bigger and better machinery all the time just to stay financially viable-they expect to be able to trade it in at the appropriate time and a machinery dealer allows them to do so. The dealer then puts that machinery-which they have paid for out of their capital costs, by borrowing the money on a floor plan or whatever-in their yard, on its arrival from the farming property. It is possible that in the time it took to get the vehicle from the farm to the dealer's premises, for whatever reason, a guard has been removed or a decal, which sits somewhere out of sight and displays the appropriate standard requirements-it does not tell you to do anything; it just shows that the header, tractor or whatever vehicle it is is registered under standard XYZ or whatever-has fallen off. It is interesting that when that vehicle comes in, compared with the new beaut one that the farmer has just purchased, it no longer complies with modern law. But, if the vehicle dealer were to attempt to upgrade it to a modern standard, he would accept all the liability for that work. So what has happened? Inspectors have come in and gone around to all these dealers and said, ‘You fix that machinery; you bring it up to the modern standard.' The dealers say, ‘But we're not allowed to do that,' and are told, ‘Tough. You have an unsaleable piece of machinery. We'll lock you up if you don't fix it.' The dealers cannot fix it. Of course, these beggars have a very interesting status. There is a lady-I think she is called Mrs Lynne-who runs this department and she says that all the machinery dealers love her. Just for your information, Madam Deputy Speaker, there are two pages in the farm weekly of just what the dealers are saying about these arrangements. Inspectors went into one place and started to put notices on an unfinished piece of equipment under manufacture. What was it going to look like when it was finished? By coincidence, some months ago I was making a purchase in a warehouse type facility and was sitting, waiting for the goods to come out from the warehouse at the back. Two young women with green clipboards walked in and I thought, ‘Uh oh, the inspectors have arrived; I wonder what they're here for.' They walked straight up to the girl at reception and asked for the boss. They said, ‘Is Mr So-and-so here?' The receptionist said, ‘No, he's out trying to sell things to make a living.' The girls then said, ‘Well, he should be here because we've arrived and we want to inspect your premises.' Anyhow, while I was sitting there, they found someone else to accompany them and out they went. The place is a barn; in it are a few shelves on which they store the goods that they sell. One of the girls came back to the receptionist and said, ‘We couldn't find anything to grab you for out there, but I noticed a distinct smell of cigarette smoke.' According to her, somebody in this huge building had stood in a corner out of sight and had a puff on a fag. She wanted to find out who that was so that she could prosecute the boss, who was out on the road trying to sell things in order to make a living. What OH&S benefit is achieved by that? Absolutely nothing. And what is achieved by going into a saleyard, looking at equipment that might be 10 years old, that was produced to the required standard at the time, and overnight, with no warnings, telling people that they cannot sell that-possibly sending them broke, because they are between a rock and a hard place-and saying, ‘It's your problem, mate.' This is an outrageous situation. It is just bad as telling a person who puts someone in a car that does not have 10 airbags in it that they might be responsible and charged for manslaughter. It is about time, in all these processes, that there was an equalisation in the responsibility of the employee to ensure that they do everything possible to be safeand that might include driving a bit more slowly in the car that the boss provided or observing traffic signs. But, no, unless you put a sign on the dash that says, ‘Please stop at stop signs,' you can be held responsible. It is an interesting thing, because I have argued for a long time about outworking and giving people-single parents, for instancethe opportunity to work from home. Immediately people say, ‘But what about the OH&S problems? Will their home be up to standard?' I think about the lady who has her inspectors running around my electorate making life impossible for machinery dealers, and I wonder if every time she carves the family roast she puts on a steel mesh glovebecause, if she does not, she is not sticking to her own rules. It would not be a bad idea. Mr Windsor-Who's this?",243
284,Mr TUCKEY,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The head of the OH&S regulatory regime in WA. You want to watch out, Member, when they start in your electorate. You will find that they can close down machinery dealers and leave them with a yard full of second-hand plant. They are not allowed to fix it, they are not allowed to amend it and they are not allowed to sell it. But when the inspectors go into a factory and start putting yellow stickers on something that is only half finished, how can they do that? Who are the mugs they are employing to behave in that fashion? I could spend a large amount of my time reading from the report that is in this particular paper, highlighting these errors. Of course we want to protect people. Of course we expect fair and reasonable efforts as from the employer to make things as safe as possible. But, on the other hand, having done that and having put up the signs, if an employee injures themselves or is involved in a fatality, why would you think of charging someone with industrial manslaughter who probably was not in the workplace? I know that OH&S is the last bastion of the trade union movement. There is no need for them to be involved. We can have inspectors. I hope they are a little more sensible than those who went roaring around my electorate the other day, targeting shearers and shearing sheds. The wool industry is in disarray. It is very hard to make money, and we have inspectors going into old, established shearing sheds that have been there forever and have a high record of no injuries and telling them to spend $10,000 or $20,000 before they shear their 500 sheep or whatever. It is outrageous and it is wrong. (Time expired)",244
285,Mr HAYES,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Once again we have a bill being debated in this place that seeks to override a decision of a legally constituted body. But on this occasion it is not the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, as we have seen in other legislation introduced in this place. This time the federal government is seeking to overturn the decision of another government. But, much like the rest of the legislative program of this government, it is not a case of stopping at just one government. The provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Promoting Safer Workplaces) Bill 2005 act to curtail the operation of the industrial manslaughter laws of any state or territory into the future. I oppose this bill, both for what it does and for the premise on which it is based. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in his second reading speech, started out by stating that these amendments: ... will reinforce and underscore the Commonwealth's regulatory approach to workplace health and safety, which is to ensure that the main should be on preventing workplace injuries, rather than punishment after the event. They are noble sentiments indeed, and I think that you would be hard pressed to find anybody who did not support the notion that it would be better to have an approach that supports occupational health and safety and does not rely solely on prevention through punishment. But companies have been introducing workplace changes for some years, and I think there is now a reasonably healthy regime out there which has been developing. Whilst the government's philosophy on this occasion, where it seeks to focus on injury prevention, may be noble to that extent, I do not know if it would translate into setting aside law enforcement so that we focused on crime prevention rather than punishment after the event. I do not know that the minister would find too many people who would agree with that approach. However, fundamentally there is probably little difference between the two in terms of general philosophy. People always agree that law enforcement should have its focus on crime prevention, and it is certainly a guiding philosophy that most neighbourhood and community groups who are tasked with administering crime prevention programs would no doubt agree with. However, I do not know that anyone would go so far as to agree that, if a criminal act has taken place, the perpetrator should go unpunished just because the main focus should be on crime prevention. No-one is willing to let criminals go unpunished, so why should we adopt an approach to workers' safety in which negligent employers can go unpunished? To my way of thinking, that just does not make sense. The impetus for this bill is the passing by the ACT government of the Crimes (Industrial Manslaughter) Amendment Act. The act, among other things, moved industrial manfocus slaughter from occupational health and safety legislation into the Crimes Act because the standard for conviction is higher. Debate interrupted. NA",245
286,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Taxation",245
287,Mr WINDSOR,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to speak about the taxation regime that is imposed in some cases on compensation for structural adjustment payments. I raised the issue in question time today. The Prime Minister took it on board and said that he will consider the issue as raised, but I would like to flesh it out a bit more. I referred particularly to the structural adjustment process that has been put in place under the auspices of the National Water Initiative, which was announced by the Prime Minister and the then Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, back on 9 June 2005. Part of that process was a three-way split of the funding arrangements to bring water entitlements back to a sustainable fashion so that long-term environmental good within groundwater catchments could be adhered to. Fifty million dollars was promised by the Commonwealth government through the NWI process, $50 million by the state government and $50 million by the irrigatorsthe water entitlement holders. That was recognised as a major breakthrough-a part of the National Water Initiative where various groups could come together in a positive sense. We have since found that the adjustment payments that would be made to the various groundwater irrigators across five valleys in New South Wales will be subject to income tax, even though it is recognised that they capital in nature. That brings the focus very much on the processes that are at work within the government and the tax office in relation to these issues. I am formally calling tonight for a government inquiry into these processes, whether it be done through the parliamentary committee system, the Auditor-General or the ACCC-it will probably be left to greater minds than mine. I think it is time that we look at why some payments are treated differently to others. I would like to highlight a few of those payments because it might assist the Prime Minister in answering the question. The dairy industry adjustment scheme was put in place in 2001. It was recognised that the $1.2 billion that was committed by the levy imposed on milk consumers-no governments were involved in this-was going to be insufficient to pay the income tax that would come from the adjustment process with the individual dairy farmers. You will remember that that was put in place to assist the dairy industry to adjust to the deregulation process. The other day on radio, the former Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, admitted that the government decided to impose another 4c per litre levy on milk consumers to generate half a billion dollars in tax receipts. Whilst people were thinking they were paying that little bit more for milk to help the downtrodden dairy farmers, half a billion dollars was going into government coffers. That case was treated in a similar fashion to how the groundwater entitlement holders are being told by the tax office that they will be treated. But not all adjustment packages are treated in that fashion. In fact, the sugar exit package is not taxed. In the Namoi structural adjustment scheme, which the member for Gwydir had custody of, the Carroll chanare nel-I know this is parochial-was being funded to alleviate the same stressed groundwater systems to assist individual growers to bring river water into a groundwater system so that their livelihoods would not be impacted. Those payments were not taxed. In fact, the Commonwealth, through the Regional Partnerships program, paid the GST. There is different handling of these situations. Another example, for the South Australians, is the Mount Lofty Sustainable Water Management project, which was put in place to formalise water arrangements so that there would be a sustainable and environmentally good future for the water resource in that area. I do not think it is taxed. Maybe the Prime Minister would be able to clarify that. I am calling for an inquiry into the mechanisms at work in relation to the taxation of compensation. (Time expired)",246
288,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring light to the issue of the fication of graffiti on the internet. Dimity Barber of Leader Community Newspapers has dedicated much time and many resources to investigating this important issue. Graffiti, or graff as it is otherwise known, has traditionally been limited to appearing on our local streets, trains, fences and buildings. This issue has transformed to a new level, as we now see web sites advertising works of graffiti, with most web sites even breaking down the search by suburb. Access to these sites gives these so-called artists an opportunity to post pictures advertising their own creations to the network of graffiti enthusiasts. The internet has vastly broadened the network of current and potential graffiti artists. The impact of graffiti is immeasurable, whether it be the cost of removal or the violation felt by elderly residents when their property, such as a fence, is covered in graffiti. In 2001-02, La Trobe's largest council, the City of Casey, committed to a graffiti management program to address the growing issue of graffiti. This includes the free 24hour 1800 VANDAL program, which encourages residents to report graffiti vandalism and the council endeavours to remove the reported graffiti within 24 hours of notification. Last year the council spent $115,000 removing graffiti throughout the municipality, and roughly the same has been spent this year. The city spends $60,000 each year on its education program, targeting primary and secondary schools to promote the message that ‘Graffiti is not cool'. The council has gone further than just eradicating graffiti and educating the local community. The city has developed local legislation making it a criminal offence to sell aerosol cans of spray Graffiti paint to people under the age of 18 years. The City of Casey is doing a great job on glorithe ground addressing the graffiti problem. However, as the graffiti is now being photographed and published on the easily accessible internet, its good work is being undermined. Web site operators are developing networks publishing and advertising their works that deliberately break the law. These web sites encourage others to get out into the community with a spray can and deface property. At the state level, the Victorian government is attempting to address the issue by developing a state graffiti strategy called ‘Safer streets and homes'. According to the Victorian government's documentation, it provides: ... an integrated action framework to support the future management of graffiti in Victoria by both government and the community. However, this strategy completely fails when dealing with graffiti internet operators. In Victoria, a graffitist can be charged under state legislation for various offences, such as wilful damage and criminal damage. I am of the opinion that graffiti web site operators could be charged for incitement to commit a criminal offence under 321G(1) of the Crimes Act. For that, a person would need to be charged under the criminal damage section. It is therefore my belief that this issue should fall within the state's responsibility. Local police who know their areas should have the provision to restrict the incitement of graffiti, not the Federal Police. The Victorian Attorney-General, Rob Hulls, believes that the regulation of the internet falls under Commonwealth jurisdiction. A spokesperson for Mr Hulls, Sally Finlay, was quoted in the Berwick Leader on Wednesday, 9 November 2005 as saying: At state level, we are limited as to what we can do. We just don't have any powers at local level. I find this rather surprising. Recently in South Australia, a web site was closed down by the South Australian police for advertising and glorifying graffiti. I believe that this is the correct level at which to monitor and enforce graffiti incitement. The good work being done by local councils such as that of the City of Casey is being undermined if the practice is being advertised and encouraged on the internet. The Victorian government's strategy has a huge gap when it comes to graffiti on the internet. I believe that this matter must be addressed. Accordingly, I will write to the Commonwealth Attorney-General in an effort to encourage the Victorian state government to either prosecute offenders under current incitement provisions or, if there is some legal reason why this cannot occur, determine an outcome so that this can be achieved through a bipartisan approach. (Time expired) Victory in the Pacific Day Medallions",247
289,Mr RUDD,ADJOURNMENT,"My purpose in addressing the parliament today is to honour the contribution of many of Brisbane's war veterans in our recent commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the conclusion of the Second World War. As part of our local commemorations, I hosted a ceremony on 25 October to present medallions to local veterans and their families. I would like to use this opportunity in the parliament today to honour their contribution to our country and to our community. The Victory in the Pacific medallion presentation ceremony was held at the Easts Leagues Club in Coorparoo in Brisbane. Over 350 south-side residents attended the ceremony to celebrate the efforts of our local veterans. I was joined in honouring our veterans by Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Anetts, commanding officer of the Bulimba Barracks, and state members of parliament Gary Fenlon and Pat Purcell. I want to give particular thanks to our guest speaker for the day, Marie Dwyer from the War Widows Guild. The War Widows Guild performs a first-class function in our community in supporting widows who have had to fend for themselves in what has often been a difficult life. I also want to pay thanks to Betty Sinden, who attended as a special guest, representing the Friends of Balmoral Cemetery. Sixty veterans received specially made commemorative medallions and were entertained by the Coorparoo Secondary College Saxophone Ensemble. I seek leave to table the names of those individuals who were honoured in our local ceremony. Leave granted.",248
290,Mr RUDD,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the member for Sturt. It is important to note the contribution that Brisbane's war veterans have made to our community and our country. The city of Brisbane played a vital role in Australia's defence during the Second World War, serving as the headquarters for General Douglas MACArthur. None of us in this parliamentin particular, none of us from the state of Queensland-will ever forget the Brisbane Line. After the war, many of Queensland's returned soldiers and their families built their homes on Brisbane's south side. Many of those homes were in suburbs that grew up in my own electorate of Griffith-areas such as Coorparoo, Bulimba, Morningside, Greenslopes, Cannon Hill, Fairfield and Annerley-leaving a permanent mark on the development and character of many of our local suburbs. Over the last 60 years these veterans and their families have continued to serve our community through their volunteer work and participation in local community groups. One of the remarkable things I find with veterans in my community-and I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of parliament-is that many decades after having completed their service for their country they are still actively engaged in service to their local community. It is no small coincidence that those who have given so much to their country feel compelled even into their later years to give all that they can to others in their community work. The south side is home to a number of RSLs and service groups, who have ensured that the legacy and sacrifice of Australia's veterans are remembered. These include the Cannon Hill District and Vietnam Services RSL, the Coorparoo and Districts RSL, the Hellenic RSL, the Holland Park-Mount Gravatt RSL, the Ithaca South Brisbane RSL, the National Servicemen's RSL, the Norman Park RSL, the Stephens RSL and the Yeronga-Dutton Park RSL. It is my privilege to attend many of their ANZAC Day services each 25 April. I would also like to pay particular tribute to the Friends of Balmoral Cemetery. This is one of Brisbane's oldest cemeteries, and it lies in the middle of my electorate. Some years ago a group of volunteers decided to form the association with the object of taining this important historical monument within our local community and within that to particularly take on the responsibility of maintaining the graves of veterans. Some hundreds of veterans from the Boer War to the present are buried in the Balmoral Cemetery and the Friends of Balmoral Cemetery have played a first-class role in ensuring that their legacy is properly honoured. They have also put together many local histories and biographies concerning those who are interred in the cemetery. I pay tribute to their community work. I conclude by simply saying on behalf of the Australian parliament how much we honour the contribution of war veterans and their families in ensuring this country's freedom. (Time expired) Victorian High Court Building",248
291,Ms PANOPOULOS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am compelled to rise this evening to plead for the preservation of an important part of Australian history and heritage and to mention a serious conflict of interest for the Victorian Attorney-General. In October this year the Victorian government lodged an application to demolish the old High Court building in Little Bourke Street in order to make way for a 10-storey Supreme Court building. I am advised that the application will be determined early next year. The brave new world of the Bracks Labor government has form. It does not appreciate or attempt to preserve our history and heritage. Their arrogance extends to erasing history and in its place erecting monstrosities. We have seen a planning application to demolish three heritage listed buildings-part of Kew Cottages-in order to make way for high-density housing development. They have killed a national icon-the man from Snowy River-with their blanket ban on cattle grazing in the high country, even rejecting main- a $15 million Commonwealth government package for the environment and cultural heritage. Mr Hulls proposed an eyesore of a glass dome over the historic courtyard of the Supreme Court, and his tacky taste will only be outdone by his proposal to demolish the historic High Court building. As both Victorian Minister for Planning and Attorney General, Mr Hulls has a conflict of interest as his departments are both the applicant and the consenting authority for such an application. Designed in 1928 the old High Court building is a fine example of the architecture of the era and of the work by JS Murdoch, the Chief Commonwealth Architect, who also designed Old Parliament House and the Canberra Hotel, among other important buildings around the nation. It was the first building designed and built specifically for the High Court of Australia. It was opened as the principal home of the court in 1928 and was continuously occupied for this purpose until the opening of the High Court building in Canberra in 1980. The old High Court building is to the cial branch of government what Old Parliament House is to the executive and legislative branches. Can anyone imagine the outcry if there were an application to demolish Old Parliament House? The judicial arm of our democracy, its history and its development are just as important as the development of our unique parliamentary system. It deserves equal protection. The building is listed on the Register of the National Estate, the Victorian Heritage Register and on the site-specific heritage overlay control under provisions in the City of Melbourne Planning Scheme. During its occupation by the High Court of Australia, many important nation-shaping debates were conducted in the courtrooms in the building, particularly in court No. 1. These included the uniform tax case, the bank nationalisation case, the Communist Party case and the boilermakers case, as well as a number of challenges to the Whitlam government's legislation such as the AAP case and the first territory senators case. The historical significance of the building is enhanced by its close association with Australia's greatest judge- Sir Owen Dixon, who was associated with the building for more than half of the period during which the building was used by the court. When the building was transferred to Victoria in 1999, the then Chief Justice of Victoria, John Phillips, said the: ... decision to purchase this building, if I may say so, is a far-sighted decision, a timely decision, it is a decision which will have great benefit for our court and the advancement of justice ... In seeking to demolish the old High Court building, the Victorian government may be in breach of one of the terms of agreement under which the building was transferred to Victoria in 1999. Victoria's heritage acjudiknowledgement included listing on the Victorian Heritage Register, compliance with the Heritage Act 1995 and complying with conservation management works. No-one would have contemplated the destruction of this iconic building. Melbourne was the seat of the court for most of the last century. It beggars belief that a Victorian Attorney-General could seek to erase the physical reminder of the important part that Melbourne and Victoria played in the history of Federation. The preservation of this building is critical to an understanding of our nation's history. The importance of the great constitutional battles fought there cannot be overstated. No other democratic nation would treat such an important building with the contempt required to lodge an application to seek its destruction. On behalf of all Victorians, I beg Mr Hulls to reconsider this very rash decision. Child Care",249
292,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier today in the Main Committee I began raising the issue of child care in my electorate, particularly the shortage of places as a result of rapid growth in the number of young families going back to the inner suburbs, where the cost of land and housing is very high and both parents are working. There is a great demand for child care in the city of Port Phillip, which forms part of my electorate. We hear the government talking about its investment in child care, but people in Port Phillip are wondering where the money has gone, because we are not seeing the benefit. In Port Phillip today the Port Phillip Council provides 221 child-care places through its own facilities and subsidises a number of others-335 exactly. Only 415 places are available in the private child-care sector and indeed there is a waiting list of 1,935. That is nearly 2,000 children who cannot find places in child care in one city alone, whose parents are therefore unable to participate in the work force as they want to and as they need to-with all the economic dislocations occurring with highly trained people, particularly women-for their families and for the wider community. The economic cost of this, if one looked at it rationstate ally, would be quite large and would outweigh the benefit the federal government has gained by not properly contributing to child care. We only know of those statistics because of the excellent work of child-care activists in my electorate, such as Rebecca Bartel and people like Sonia Hood, who have had the good faith to try to see Senator Patterson about the federal government's lack of activity in this area but have come up against a brick wall. In child care, as in other areas, this gov- of parents. ernment has a blind faith in market forces and the private sector, but in my electorate the private sector has not met the demand for child care. This is partly because of the very high cost of buying land in the area and the cost of decontaminating land in areas that were formerly used for industrial purposes. The cost of vacant land in Port Phillip is so high because private developers are buying it up for apartment blocks. More apartments mean more families and more children-but no new child-care centres. The Port Phillip council estimate that the area needs four new child-care centres. The building costs alone for those would be $8.5 million-let alone the costs of land and decontamination. The Port Phillip council currently spend $1.25 million a year on child care, and this is not sustainable for a city of 82,000 people. Now the council have announced that they are being forced to scale back their child-care activities and they are moving to a user-pays system. This is very unfortunate. I am pleased that they have put some of these plans off for a year to give the parents more time to interact with them, but it is mainly because of federal government inactivity, which I will return to. The blame does not lie with the council, as I said, which does its best with the available resources to meet the needs of its community. It does not lie with the Victorian government, which has announced support for an additional child-care facility in Elwood, the Hub, which will be associated with the Elwood secondary school. It has donated land and also the old Albert Park Primary School for a child-care centre worth $3 million. Recently the state minister, Sheryl Garbutt, announced that the state government would fund a pilot waiting-list program for the whole inner-metropolitan area so that the current haphazard system of waiting becomes more attuned to the needs The blame for this situation lies squarely, in my view, with this federal government. The minister, Senator Patterson, continues to tell us that there is no crisis in child care, that more money than ever is being put into it and that, if there is no child care in inner-urban areas, it is all someone else's fault. When she came to a public forum in St Kilda in November she had nothing to offer and she told local residents that they should find creative solutions to the problem. It is evident that minister has little interest in the child-care crisis in my area or in helping the mothers and families who want child care for their infants and to get back into the work force. It is a fact that the minister does not understand that there is a problem in the area, if you look at her statements. Why is it that, if so much money is being spent on child care, as the minister says, none of it is reaching the areas of acute need such as those in my electorate? It is partly because funds are being directed to regional and outer-suburban areas, where this government is worried about their marginal seats and wants to prop up its sitting members, and it is partly because this government has no clear picture of the real demand for child care. There is no central database of waiting lists or awareness of the demographic change. This government needs to sit down and consult with parents, with the City of Port Phillip and with the state government and fix the child-care crisis in my electorate. Had Labor been elected, there would have been small amounts of money available for capital expenditure in community child care. This is the kind of thing that this federal government needs to consider, without wearing ideological blinkers and saying child care should only be done by ABC Learning and other fundraising donors.

293,Mr FAWCETT,ADJOURNMENT,"Wakefield) (7.55 pm)One of the constant bits of feedback I get from people in the electorate of Wakefield is that they believe governments should be taking a lead and not passing blame between levels of government. It is interesting, then, when you take the opportunity to get feedback from people-which I do at every chance through publications I send out, including survey forms-that it comes back on a host of issues that are largely state issues. I the draw the parliament's attention to a survey I issued recently and the hundreds of responses that came back, with more than 90 per cent of them mentioning things such as crime, safety, hoon driving, drugs and, essentially, policing as issues of significant concern for the residents of Wakefield. Because of the large numbers of people who are reporting this to me, I am compelled to draw it to the attention of the parliament. Many people are saying that this is a problem. The state government in South Australia says that it is not a problem and that, in fact, crime figures are reducing. The question has to be asked: is this just a perception on behalf of these people or is it a fact? If it is a fact: why? What should be done? Mr Rann, the Premier of the current Labor state government, makes much of his ‘tough on crime' approach. He is famous for the announcements that he makes. But a quick look at the facts reveals that in South Australia spending on policing under the Rann government is now the lowest in Australia: it is $230 per head versus the Australian average of $259 per head. The Productivity Commission's Report on Government Services 2005 has also discovered that South Australia is the only state or territory to have reduced police expenditure in 2003-04, against a national trend of increasing spending. Not surprisingly, with fewer police equipped with fewer resources, community satisfaction has fallen. Put into figures, it has fallen from 78.2 per cent in 2001-02 to 75.7 in 2003-04. So, despite the rhetoric, we are seeing a reduction in public satisfaction because of a reduction in spending. So how can the government say that crime is falling? It is interesting that policy documents given to the opposition recently indicated that police have been told to record only one offence per criminal incident, regardless of the number of offences that may have been committed-hence, the reporting statistics appear to go down. But, again, national statistics show the lie in that. Contrary to the impression created by the state government, the national Bureau of Statistics figures for 2004 show that in South Australia murder was 38 per cent higher than the national average; total homicide and related offences, which include things like death by dangerous driving, were 51 per cent higher; armed robbery was 10.4 per cent higher; unlawful entry with intent was 13.6 per cent higher; motor vehicle theft was 33.8 per cent higher; and other theft was 25.6 per cent higher. Overall, the number of crimes in all categories across Australia has dropped since 2001. The decline over the period has been in the order of 26.8 per cent; whereas, in South Australia, it has been around 7.3 per cent. Largely, the drop in the crime rate nationally has to do with a buoyant economy and low unemployment flowing from this government's good economic management. There are also things like the fact that the crime prevention program, a very successful initiative of the previous state government, has been scrapped by the current Labor government. Extra police that were committed to have not materialised and the delivery date has been put off again until after the next state election. Is it a case that these things are not able? Mr Speaker, I bring your attention and the attention of the parliament to the fact that this year alone South Australia has received some $187 million in GST over and above that which was promised under the guaranteed minimum amount. The state government shows its priorities in that it is planning to spend some $21 million on extending a tramline rather than providing police and security for its citizens. Importantly, it is potentially wasting $150 million on opening bridges over the Port River-as opposed to fixed bridges. I call on the state government to get its priorities right and support the people of Wakefield with appropriate police resources.",252
