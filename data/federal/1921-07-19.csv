4,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Yes . It is Bought to create the impression that no work is being done at the Dockyard, bnt I wish the public and the House to know that last week 750 men were employed there. What Mr Mahony wants, and what he is soreeohing about, is another matter.",19
5,Mr RYAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Is that the right way to refer to him!,19
6,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I know of no better word to apply to bia utteranoes. This morning he is soreeching again, tacking me. I am in no'way responsible for any delay, in commencing work at the Dockyard. It has been due to troubles inherent in the situation itself, with which he, I venture to say, has had as much to do with creating as.any one else.

8,Mr RODGERS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I was handling this matter until the end of the last financial year, but since then my honourable colleague, Senator Millen, has had it in hand. I think that the better, suggestion is that New South Wales Ministers might confer with our Minister and the Treasurer.

If the meat works were in full swing large numbers of those now ont of work would be afforded employment. Will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to have the contents of that telegram cabled to the Prime Minister in London V",19
10,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I have no objection to . communicating the substance of it to him, but I remind my honors able friend that the Prime Minister is already hard at work on this problem, and, I understand is, among, other .things, at- proposing a big Empire soheme for dealing with meat and other products. venture to say that he is doing infinitely more for Australia in London than he debtedness? could do by complying with the demand of the honourable member's leader that should be here.",19
11,Mr RYAN,WAR SERVICE HOMES,The honourable member's leader did not mean that; he did not know it was loaded. That has been plained in the press since.,20

17,Mr MATHEWS,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The ' following cablegram appears in today's ArgusThe first conclusive evidence of the proposal for the general cancellation of the Allies wax we have. debts was obtained when a letter from Mr. Lloyd George to President Wilson, dated 5th August, 1920, was read before the Senate finance committee today. The letter stated England's willingness to consider the cancellation of all debts owed to her if America consider the wiping out of British indebtedpared ness. [4H] I Has the Treasurer made any effort to secure the. cancellation of Australia's in Will the righ t honourable gentleman inform the world that we are he ready to forgive other . countries their debts to us if they will forgive ours to them?",20
18,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"There is not exmuch hope of such an offer being accepted. I know nothing of the proposal to which has been made by Mr Lloyd he George to the President of the TJnited I States of America, it being purely a matter for domestic concern' affecting Great Britain . I am afraid that in the end we shall have to make up our minds to Ministershoulder our own debts. OVERSEAS COAL TRADE . DELAYS AT NEWCASTLE.",20
19,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that recently an American ship was detained for seventyeight days at Newcastle awaiting a cargo 2,400 tons of coal ? Is the righ t honourable gentleman further aware that last a contract for coal for Bombay, which has been supplied from Newcastle for some years, passed to J apan ? Will the right honourable gentleman get in with the ofliceri n Newcastle, in I ask order to have some arrangement made whereby colliery-owners can charter boats with some degree of certainty as to their Loading, so as to, as far as possible, readiguard ouroverseas trade? Is the right honourable gentleman aware that every year our output of coal is increasing, and that there is about 1,500,000 tons of coal more than is required for our local consumption? If we are to safeguard our interests, these, matters must be attended",20
20,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I agree that it is all important that we should look after our overseas trade as-far as possible. However, I doubt the honourable member's figures when he says that we have 1,500,000. tons of coal to spare for overNew York, 14tli July. seas trade.",20
21,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,Y o u will find that,20
22,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I tell the honourable member that ^ in my judgment, if all the people in Australia got all the coal would they required, and which they are preto buy, there would be very little to spare for our overseas trade ",20
23,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"""We are stacking up a lot of coal just now, you know.",21
24,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"If the honourable member is so anxious to preserve and develop the overseas trade, may I make a suggestion to him?",21
25,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I know what your suggestion is, and I do not agree with it .",21
26,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"I suggest that there should be a greater production of coal in Newcastle, and employment given to the miners who today are unemployed throughout Australia.",21
27,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"They . are ing the coal production every month. Sir JOSEPH COOK: - Really , all the troubles in adjusting the loading of boats arise from the fact",21
28,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The r i g h t able gentleman will agree that the miners, in regard to output, have made a wonderful recovery since the war?",21
29,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Yes , but the point is that, as the output of the mines increases, so do the requirements of Australia increase, ",21
30,Mr CHARLTON,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"That is a good thing, but still we have a margin.",21
31,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"The output of the mines, in my judgment, is not in creasing as fast as is the demand up and down Australia. There is a margin for overseas trade, and one of the reasons for the shipping control the other day was to enable Commander Fearnley, who controls matters at Newcastle, to so arrange the loading of ships, so as to obviate the difficulties to which the honourable member calls attention. All the manipulations and re-adjustments will not get over the major fact, which is that we must have more production if we are to keep our overseas trade going. SOLDIER SETTLEMENT. REMARKS BY GENERAL HOWSE .",21
32,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR SERVICE HOMES,"Some time ago I called attention to remarks made by General Howse, on the question of soldier settlement in New South Wales, and asked that particulars might be obtained.

49,Sir JOSEPH OOOK,D EPU TY COMMISSIONER FOR WESTER N,"Th c answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The .agreement does not provide that the State Commissioner of Taxation shall remain OF MR . a State official. 2. I am not aware of the extent of Mr. Black's knowledge or experience of Federal taxation, but he has qualifications for the work of the amalgamated Taxation Office which are not possessed by any other ComFederal and monwealtli officer. 3. Particulars arc . not available of the volume of work in Western Australia since the amalgamation of the Federal and State offices, but, prior to the amalgamation, the relative positions were- (1) New South Wales, (2) Victoria, (3) Queensland, (4) South Australia, (5) Western Australia, (0) Central Office, (7) Tasmania. 4. Central Office, £1,000 and £850; New South Wales, £850; Victoria, £800; Queensland,' £750; Soutli Australia., £650; Western Australia, £750 and £650; Tasmania, £600. 5. (a) Mr Black was not eligible for appointment under section 34; (6) all the other appointments were not made to the Clerical Division, but some were made to the Professional Division; (c) all the other Deputies are not classified as Clerical officers. 6. No. 7. Mr Block has a general experience of taxation work and a special knowledge of important .phases of the work to be carried out by the amalgamated officer; and, in compliance with the conditions of the agreement, is entitled to retain the status he held under the State upon appointment to the Commonwealth. 8.

Has the position of Investigating Officer in the Taxation Department been placed in the "" Professional"" Division of the Commonwealth Public Service, and 'have several appointments heen made thereto? 2.

What was the reason for sueh a position in the State of Western Australia, to which an "" outsider"" was appointed, being recently reclassified to the "" Clerical"" Division, and the ""outsider"" appointed thereto? 6. As the result of this action, has a Third Class position become lost to existing Clerical officers, who, by reason of long and faithful viee, were deserving of' more consideration, and does the officer so appointed become eligible for transfer throughout the Service at large, although he has passed no such qualifying examination as is required of Clerical officers?' 7. In view of the fact that the appointments were made under section 31 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, which requires a certificate from the Public Service Commissioner that there is no person in the Service capable of filling the position, will the Government constitute a Board of Inquiry before which officers affected can appear to prove their right to appointment in preference to ""outsiders""?",23
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,D EPU TY COMMISSIONER FOR WESTER N,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes, in cases where no officers of the Clerical Division were regarded as capable of filling them with satisfaction to the Department. 2. Practical experience in commercial or other business undertakings. 3 and 4. It is hoped that, witli the training and experience now arranged for Clerical officers in the position of Junior Investigating Officer, it will not be necessary to go outside the Service to fill further vacancies. 5. It is intended to reclassify all such positions in the Clcrieal Division. 6. No officer with the requisite qualifications. was overlooked in filling this position. The appointee will be eligible for transfer or promotion to other positions in the Clerical Division, in common with other Clerical officers. 7. The Government do not propose to take action in the direction suggested by the honourable member. PUBLIC SERVICE. DISTRICT ALLOWANCES.",23
52,Mr BLAKELEY,D EPU TY COMMISSIONER FOR WESTER N,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has the Public Service regulation providing for a 5 per cent, climatic and isolation allowance been repealed; if so, for what reason? 2. Was such regulation repealed when the plaint of the Public Service Commissioner was before the 'Court?",23
53,Sir JOSEPH COOK,D EPU TY COMMISSIONER FOR WESTER N,"On account of the higher cost of living in Western Australia as compared with other States, a Public Service regulation was passed, in 1907, to provide for payment of a special allowance of 5 per cent, on the salaries of members of the Commonwealth Public Service in Western Australia who were not entitled to the prescribed "" district"" (remote localities, &c.) allowances. The Royal Commission on Federal Economies invited attention to the anomaly of the ser- payment of a bonus to officers in Perth, where, according to the .figures of the statistician, the cost of living was lower than in any other capital city. The regulation providing for payment of the special allowance was repealed as from the 26th May, 1921. Ko alteration was made in respect of the payment to Western Australian officers of the prescribed "" district"" allowances. As a result of subsequent representations, however, the Government have now decided that the question of the continuance or otherwise of the special 5 per cent, allowance shall be left to the Public Service Arbitrator for determination.

CUSTOMS TARIFF (INDUSTRIE S PRESERVATION) BILL . In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 6th July of motion by Mr MASSYGREENE (vide page 9726).",26
60,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Hunter ) [3.27] The motion before the Committee is designed to give effect to a promise made Sby the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) when we were dealing with the Tariff. During the discussion, of the Tariff schedule, many arguments were advanced to * the effect that the duties that were being imposed would not adequately protect pur industries in - view of the exchange position and the dumping that was going on. The M in ister was impressed with the seriousness - of the situation so created, and said he would bring down measures to deal with it . We now have before Us a motion dealing with both subjects, which will be ^embodied in the Bill itself. The motion is divided into two parts, the one, from paragraph A to paragraph D dealing with dumping, and the other from paragraph E to paragraph H , dealing with the exchange position. As far back as 1906, this Parliament passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act , which was intended to deal with dumping; but it has been inoperative owing to the fact that under it the Comptroller-General of v Customs, in the first place, has to be satisfied that goods in respect of which complaint is made are being dumped with intent to in j u r e an Australian in dustry, and, having satisfied himself on in such that point, has then to establish his case before the High .Court.",27
61,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,That would be quite impossible. .,27
62,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I was about to say that such a procedure is quite impossible, and that no one could have expected it to be successful. Since then practically no legislation dealing with that class of dumping has been passed, but since the war it has become more and more apparent that dumping is not only taking place, but likely to go on until it is stopped by legislative enactment. This motion is designed with that PAPER. object. It would appear, that we are following largely the Canadian legislation in respect of dumping. Canada has led the way in this direction. That Dominion passed legislation in 1904, which was amended three years later. In the United States, legislation exists which was somewhat similar to that' which we propose; but it was recently found advisable to amend the United States law, so that it is now practically in conformity with the Canadian Statute. The same remark applies to South Africa, while Great Britain also has to a very large extent legislated on the basis of the Canadian Act. Lastly, Australia is falling into line. For a long time Australia held a leading position with respect to advanced legislation; but, here, we are following the precedent of another Dominion. W it h respect to the resolutions themselves, provision is made that not more than 15 per cent, can be levied over and above the value fixed for duty under the Customs Act. That is similar to the Canadian law. Whether the specified proportion will be sufficient remains to be seen; but, throughout these resolutions, honourable members wil l notice one feature which, in my mind, is objecforeign tionable. I do not know how the obfor jection can be overcome, but there tinually appears the phrase, "" if the Mingoods ister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board."" That is to say, this anti-dumping legislation will not, by origin. the mere fact of its having received assent, the apply to any specific condition. Its plication must remain a matter of doubt, all depending on what the Board may commend. And, even then, it will be matter of whether the Minister approves a recommendation or not.",27
63,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,But the Minister may act without the approval of the Tariff one. Board. The Board will not control him.,28
64,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"No , the Minister stand will control the Board. But if the B6ard makes a recommendation, it does not folthe low that the Minister will adopt it .",28
65,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"While , if the Board ports adversely, the Minister may still",28
66,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"That is so. Time will prove whether the Tariff Board will prove efficient, or will be worked along similar lines to certain of its predecessors. The Inter-State Commission, for example, dealt with certain matters affecting Tariff, and occupied a good deal of time in coming to a decision. Then the ComThe mission would make its recommendations, which, however, were not - acted upon. Suppose that there is evidence that ing is taking place; what is to prevent serious delay, and grave injury occurring to Australian industry owing to advanter tage being taken of that delay ? Must specific matter be referred to the Tariff Board ? Aud must all idea of action hung up while the Board investigates, secures evidence, comes to a decision, reports to the Minister? How long will that procedure take? If it means a ter of two or three months, goods can dumped all the while, so that certain our own industries may be seriously affected. There should be means, if , when it can be shown, that dumping is being practised, of enforcing immediate activity with an idea of putting an end to the dumping, and so effectively proMinister tecting whichever of Australia's indusbe tries may be adversely concerned. Morespecific. over, unless immediate action follows levied only upon specified goods. upon the revelation of dumping, the porter is likely to be unfairly affected. I differs from, the Canadian. may be an importer who has taken adDominion vantage of an ordinary business opporterests tunity to purchase goods cheaply in country, and who. has arranged: their importation to Australia. T conmay have some goods on the way. other awaiting the chartering of freight, and still other goods purchased, but not in hand for export from the country of It may be that, just after arrival of the first shipapment, a decision is arrived at thab the importation of - these lines is reinimical to the test interests of an a Australian industry, whereupon it is decided to impose an embargo in the shape of a dumping duty. Where will the importer stand? The point is an important It is well for the Committee to underthat, if it is desired to amend these resolutions, they must be dealt with at present stage, for the reason that it will be too late to alter them after they re have been embodied in a Bill. I admit act. that the provisions dealing with exchange are very complex; and that fact reminds me of my earnest desire to congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) upon the able way in which he has handled the whole of the Tariff matthe ters which have came before Parliament. Minister has admitted that, with respect to the (exchange resolutions, the whole business has been speculative. He dumphas had to rely on what knowledge he could gain from overseas, and to do his best in all the circumstances. This matof exchange affects very many couna tries today, and particularly those which were engaged in the great war. be The currency of quite a number of the leading countries has greatly depreciated. and If we permit goods to come into Australia from certain parts at the rates of matexchange now prevailing, our own manube facturers are bound to suffer great injusof tice. The difficulty, however, is how to arrive at a fair compromise. Everyand thing again, just as in the case of tfie other resolutions to which I have devoted some attention, must be referred by thei to the Board; while the duty to imposed in this instance must be That is to say, duty is to' bo It is imat this point thatour proposed legislation The latter, found it advisable, in the in of its own industries, to levy aai some exchange duty upon all goods. Thu% Canadian business men know what is to be paid upon everything ported. The method appears sight to be complicated;.but that, upon practical working, it has found to be the best. The Canadian provides that, whatever may be the condiI tion of 'the currency of a country, 50 cent, of the standard is taken as maximum allowance of depreciated rency for the purposes ment of duty on imported And having ascertained that, the ties multiply the value of the by the number of times such value will divide into the 50 per cent. The Customs duty is imposed the value of the goods thus arrived at. do not say that the Canadian system is good one to follow, because there are many things which Australia cannot duce, and for. which we are dependent countries abroad. Therefore, it would be a mistake to devise a schedule all our imports, because that would make dearer to the people commodities cannot be produced in Australia. this Bill, if any goods are being which, the Minister considers are being sold cheaply in consequence of the deprewhether ciation, of. tie exchange in the country of origin, he can refer the matter to the Tariff Board. The Board will - the matter and report to the who may declare that such goods shall be governed by the schedule to this A better system, if it were would be for the Customs authorities compile a schedule comprising the goods which Australia produces quantities to supply local aud apply to such goods the dumping duties. If that could be the importer would know at once exactly what he would have to pay on his impormanufactured tations. The proposal now before .leaves the whole procedure in doubt. The extra duties mentioned in the may or may not be imposed. porter may arrange to import certain goods from, abroad, and land some of those goods before action is taken by the partment, and the landing of those modities may do injury to some an this country. It may be argued such injury would be only temporary, competition of that kind extending ""two or three months would be sufficient to do a great deal of injury to an indusvides try, and especially to the employees in Mr Charlton. exactly Whilst I do not advocate the scheduling imof all goods, as is done in Canada, I do at first say that we should schedule all those I understand goods in respect of which local requirebeen ments can be met by local industries, and law apply the table of extra duties to them. f the application of these provisions is per to be deferred pending a reference to the the Board, we shall not know how long the curBoard's investigation will take, whether, of the paywhen a report is made, the Minister will goods. declare that the goods concerned shall be authorigoverned by these anti-dumping proinvoice visions, or if he does so declare, at what by which date the new conditions will commence to operate. If , on the other hand, these proupon visions were applied immediately, they I might result in injustice to an importer. a If a man is putting £100,000 into the i m portation of a particular article, and has proonly landed £50,000 worth when action is on taken, he might be ruined.",28
67,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Surely the first thing an embracing importer will do before invoicing goods is to inquire into the question of exchange which and the effect of the law upon hi© imporUnder tations. imported,29
68,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"He does not know the goods will be affected by the law at all, because the whole question is left open.",29
69,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"But the law will be there investigate to warn him.. Minister,",29
70,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The warning will motion. be of very little value. The law should practicable, be in black and white, so that nobody to could make a mistake.' Is it fair to say that after a man has imported half of a in sufficient £100,000 order he shall be required to requirements, pay these added duties on the other anti- £50,000 worth of goods? It should not done, be difficult for the Customs authorities to prepare a schedule of goods that are in Australia in sufficient us quantities to meet local requirements, so - that the importer will know at once whafc schedule imposts he will have to bear in addition An imto the ordinary Tariff. Under this proposal there will be nothing but uncertainty. W it h the exception of that one Depoint, I do not see that there is much comi n this motion to discuss. I do not think industry that the proposed Bill wo\ild do any that injustice to other countries. All it does but is to put each country in relatively the over same position as it occupied when its currency was at par. The schedule prothat if the bank rate of exchange it. between London and the country of export or origin at the date of export is greater than 25.22 (par) francs or lira to the £ 1 , but is less than 30, no special duty shall be charged. If the rate of exchange of a country is somewhere between those ;two figures, that countiy may have a slight advantage, but otherwise this schedule will not do an injury to any country. I think the Minister means well by this legislation, and that he is honestly trying to prevent dumping by either under-selling or taking advantage of the exchange position, but the proposal to refer everything to a Board before a decision is arrived at may be found to work very unsatisfactorily. I hope the Minister will take note of this objection and consider if anything can be done to meet"" it. If he can show that the procedure will work fairly and expeditiously, without doing an injury to anybody, I shall have nothing more to say.",29
71,Mr GBEGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,What about the countries which have an appreciated exchange ?,30
72,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I do not think this proposal will make much difference to them. America, for instance, has an appreciated exchange, and might be under a slight disadvantage if it had to compete with Belgium, France, or Germany, which have a depreciated exchange. But, after all, it is very difficult to meet all cases, and it is quite possible that the appreciation of American exchange will not last for a very lengthy period. This legislation must operate slightly against a country that has an appreciated exchange, and if the honororable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) desires anything more done in regard to such countries, he should bring the matter up for consideration in Committee.",30
73,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,We have been very good to the United States and Japan and pretty hard on Italy and France.,30
74,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I am not sure thist, this legislation will not put Italy and France in relatively the same position as they occupied when the exchange position was normal. It may beargued by some honourable members that no provision should be made fer trade with Germany. Whatever we think in regard to trade with Germany, it is very evident that such trade is being done. If it is not being done directly, it is being done indirectly, and the sooner we realise that, ,war conditions having passed, the nations must again deal with each other, the better it will be for Australia. If we trade with Germany indirectly through other countries we shall pay more for German goods. than we ought to pay,"" and the intermediate country will be getting the advantage. This measure proposes to balance .trade conditions -.generally. No matter howmuch the mark may be depreciated, the balance can be restored by applying this legislation. The only objection I have to the Bill is that it leaves so much in doubt. The Board has to make inquiries, and it must recommend to the Minister, and the Minister in turn has to proclaim the application of this law. I again suggest that it would be an improvement to specify all those goods which are produced in Australia in sufficient quantity, and allow all questions affecting other goods to be referred to the Board. I hope the Minister will give consideration to that suggestion before the Committeestage of this Bill is reached.",30
75,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Dampier) [3.50] - I have no objection to the passing of a short Bill for the protection of the manufacturers of this country against dumping, and, no doubt, members generally are ready to give fair and legitimate consideration to the interests of Australian, manufacturers; but, in my vijew, the Minister might be satisfied with a measure embodying the powers asked for in paragraphs A and D of the motion, allowing legislation for the regulation of exchange, and for dealing with other matters which are the subject pf the motion, to stand over until October, when we could give it full consideration. The Minister showed that he had hacLextreme difficulty in coming, not to a. definite, conclusion, because he found thatimpossible, but to anything like a reasonable conclusion. After cabling to various countries for all the information available, he still found himself in the dark. At the present moment, there are only about a dozen members in the chamber. We have come to the fag end of a session in which there has been an arduous Tariff discussion, and we are not now prepared to deal with an intricate measure of this sort, which may seriously affect the trade and prosperity of the country.",30
76,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,It will be necessary for the Bill you suggest to embody paragraph E as well as paragraph D.,30
77,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Tha b is so. I overlooked paragraph E . If my suggestion were adopted, there would be a longer time for the collection of information. Until I began to study this question, I had no knowledge of it , and probably many other honourable members were in the soune position. It is extremely dimc u l t to make up one's mind as to the likely effects of the legislation proposed. Will the Minister accept my suggestion? Wlhat he proposes is something extremely drastic, and possibly dangerous..",31
78,Mr GHOOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,I do not see how the paragraphs you have named could be separated from the motion.,31
79,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,We shall try very liberate misrepresentation? hard to separate them.,31
80,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,The adoption of suggestion should simplify matters.,31
81,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,It would omit many exports. necessary powers.,31
82,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I ean hardly underister stand the Minister's action in asking f the powers provided for in paragraph It is one of the most monstrous promous posals that I have read. Ministers say city. that they want an anti-dumping measure; but they are not content legislation like that in force in other scountries, where, if goods are imported below their true value, or below the valuation that the Customs Department thinks fair , excess duties may be imposed on them. The Minister evidently in tends to fix for himself what is a reasonvessels able selling price. To the cost of the goods is to be added the .freight , in surance, landing, and other charges, Customs duty-whic h might be an' ad valorem duty of 45 per cent., plus the customary 10 per cent - and on top of all these there is to be an impost of 20 per cent. I have indented from the Old. Country, and know, as do many other honourable members, that it was possible to do it for about 5 per cent. Probably many indentors would only charge 6 per oent. today. Y e t the Government's prohis posal is to add 20 per cent.",31
83,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,This provision would not session. apply to all consignments. It would apB ply only under the conditions set forth.,31

It is all very well fco say that it* wil l apply only to this article or to that, and only when the Board reports; but the Board will be the creature of the Minister. It is not to be a Board .responsible to Parliament. It is stated in a letter from^the Consul for Belgium, which appears in today's newspaper, that the Minister has informed himThat there seemed to be an entire misconception of what the Bill meant. All through there had been deliberate misrepresentation of the worse kind. How dare the Minister wr^te that to the Consul for Belgium, telling him and the public that there has been deliberate misrepresentation regarding his proposal ?

85,Mr RYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Whic h proposal does the with honourable member mean?,31
86,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Does the honourable member think that we should not have any goods brought to this country? The other day I received word by telegram from Perth that the millers were closing - their mills because they could, not get to take their flour away. Surely, it is proper to try to build up an export - trade in flour, keeping the offal in the - country. But they could not get shipping^ and the Wheat Board could not get it for them. Does the honourable'member desire that no ships shall come here?",31
87,Mr RYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,I was merely asking a question.,31
88,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I wish to know whether the consumer is to get no consideration. We in .this party have fought' on behalf, but, so far, to no effect. It is a shame that the Minister should push forward a Bill like this at the end of the We are prepared to vote for a ill against dumping, on lines similar to those followed in Canada or in Japan; but it is preposterous to ask us to agree The to the legislation outlined in all the parts of this motion. The Minister, writing to the Consul for Belgium, says, after telling him that it is almost impossible for the proposed provisions to affect the great bulk of Belgian importsThere were undoubtedly certain things regard to wbicb, owing to the exchange tion, unfair competition was likely to arise, and it was only to these that the Bill become operative after due inquiry. That is not correct. Paragraphs A and C deal with quite other matters, and will affect imports. If they applied agricultural machinery brought in from Canada, there would be for certain tions, first, the cost in Canada to culated, and then there would be added to that the freight, which, at present, amounts to over 60 per cent, of the original value; and another 10 per cent, for Customs law, and then the duty of 45 per cent.; and on top of all these 20 per cent, added as merchants' profit. If the provisions are not to apply to gian goods generally, what are they to right apply to? We get steel, glass, and other goods from Eelgium, and we get has many things from Erance and from Italy . I have been too tired to work out dividuals. the exact effect of these provisions nite importations which might come into imposing an competition with local manufactures.",31
89,Mr RYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,What is the urgency of measure ?,32
90,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"There is no urgency for it . I am prepared to agree to a B to deal with dumping generally; but it is unfair to ask us now to deal with comprehensive a measure as the Minister proposes to introduce. The examination resulted of his proposals has given me a lot trouble. I have found them difficult to follow, because I have not had time get advice. It is all very well to obtain legal opinions; but we know how littl value they have when it comes to matters of business details. The Canadian toms Ac t says- In the case of articles exported to Canada of a class or kind made or produced in Canportations were allowed. ada, if the export or actual selling price to an importer in Canada is less than the fair market value of the same' article when for home consumption in the usual and dinary course in the country when exported to Canada at the time of its exportation to Canada, there shall, in addition to the duties otherwise established there, be levied, lected, and paid on such article, on its portation into Canada, a special duty (or dumping duty) equal to the difference between the said selling price of the article for and the said fair market value thereof home consumption; and such special duty (or dumping duty) shall be levied, collected, paid on such article, although it is not wise dutiable. » 1921-3 Bill. 10231 That is plain and simple, and lets the public know exactly where they stand, rein ferring as it does to goods dumped into posithe country with a .view to prejudicing local manufacturers. If it can be shown could that a fair market value has not been placed on the invoice, there ought to be , B , a duty imposed to bring it up to the market level. In the early stages of the Tariff to discussion I showed that the Japanese had imposed regulations to deal wibh unvaluareasonably cheap goods, and that in be calJapan there was the power, which our Constitution does not give ushere, not only to follow the goods so far as the i m porter is concerned, but to follow them after they have been sold to the retailer. In this Bill , however, we are presented with clause after clause of matter most Beldifficult to understand. We can see that from 1919 u n t i l the present moment many the Department of Trade and Customs laid itself out to give special protec-* tion to certain industries and ' in On the 3rd November, on defi1919, a Gazette notice was issued absolute embargo on certain goods. In. this House we have the heard a good deal about the embargo on sheep dip, which represents one of the most discreditable proceedings ever taken ill by any Government. There was nothing but intrigue in connection with that ma,tas ter, and, while I do not know who was'responsible, I do know that what was done in the r u in of a reputable .firm of in New South Wales. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was in London, a to written assurance was given by hrm to those interested in the manufacture of e sheep dip that the commodity would be admitted into Australia subject to their Cusentering into a bond to pay any duty which might afterwards be imposed; but, even in the face of that assurance, no i m Then, again, when every mother of a household in Aussold tralia was complaining of the lack of oryarn, the Customs authorities sent out a notification that they would grant a licence to import it only on its being colproved that it eould not be obtained in. imAustralia. This, it will be observed, had nothing whatever to do with the matter export of price. Similar action was taken in for regard to rennet, and the embargo nearly and ruined the cheese industry.' I have here othera long list of articles on which embargoes were placed, and on which, from March, 1920, heavy rates of duty have been posed. These duties were to come operation on and from 25th March, That action, apparently, was taken for t if y the position of the Minister the items .came on for discussion, to enable him to assert that the goods were manufactured in Never have such tactics heen adopted fore, and I say they were most discreditfore, able. I shall not delay the House showing the huge increases that have made in the duties.",32
91,Mr RYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Does the honourable memalthough ber propose to move an amendment 1 I must say that some of his arguments are impressing me.,33
92,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I am prepared, when, the general debate is over, to agree to the adoption of paragraph A , but w naturally ask that paragraphs B and C , deleted. The position is an extremely difficult one. I have here a British Dommions.Year-book for 1921, in which, - in reference to foreign exchanges, readThe Frenchman and the German find chases of English goods a most expensive luxury, just as the Englishman finds it to his disadvantage to buy American produce with pounds sterling representing less than seven-tenths of their pre-war value. That is the question I asked the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlber ton)On the other hand, the American, with his much-appreciated dollar, can purchase cheaply in Europe, just as the Britisher can buy on nominally attractive terms on the tinent. And now I come to the matter of apcial rate of exchange. praisement. Mr Greatorex, a accountant in Sydney,' last year, i special document, showed us the effect, .the Minister charging duties on the commercial rate of exchange. out that with a general duty of 50 per be collected now ? cent., owing to the otate of the currencies in Italy , France, the United States, and Japan, the impost would really amount to 160 per cent, against Italy , cent, against France, 40 per cent, against Japan, and 38 per cent, against the United States. The general preference 10 per cent, to Great Britain was absothe ordinary way. lutely lost, it was shown, owing to the appreciated value of the dollar in United States and the yen in Japan. It will be remembered that the Supreme Court ruled that the Minister's method culation on those. i m - was wrong, and Mr Greatorex made into out an approximate estimate of the loss or 1920. gain in revenue owing to that method. to He estimated that the loss of revenue when through this concession given to the aud United States and to Japan amounted to £2,800,000, while the increased charges Australia. to France and Italy amounted, in round befigures, to £800,000. It appears, therethat we lost about £2,000,000 in reby venue by the action of the Minister in been giving a preference to the United States and Japan as against It a l y and France, we owe so much to the two latter countries for their part in the war. I do not wish to reflect in any way on the United States or Japan, but can any one say that these countries made anything like the sacrifices that were made by France and Italy in the great fight for ill civilization? We can never forget the be wonderful and heroic services of France, and I should be one of ""the last to do anything to her in j u r y, while giving a fair deal to our own people. When General we Pau visited Australia, the Government and the public fell on his neck, and filled purhim with promises. The fulfilment of these promises we see in the proposals begreatly fore us.

But no one is rash enough to suppose that this generation will witness a restoration of pre-war parities. I say that in order to show the difficulties we have to meet in considering a Bill on such a subject without the advantage of the opinions and advice of the highest authorities, who could give us an idea of what a fair exchange would be. are rushing at this legislation pell-mell, without giving it that consideration it deserves.",34

118,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Then , with your approval, sir, I shall continue. In the British Dominions Tear-Book for 1921, the latest publication on the subject. I have been able to obtain, it is further stated thatThe International Financial Conference assembled at Brussels at the end of September had no more urgent problem to solve than that of fixing new bases of currency exchange. Unfortunately, it did not succeed in solving it, so that, to that extent, this foregathering of the nations' financial experts will be accounted a failure. The Brussels Conference, September 24October S, was the outcome of a demand for international as distinct from independent The action. The experience of the post-war period made it abundantly clear that the nations, whether recently belligerent or neutral, cannot afford to work out their financial salvation, so to speak, in water-tight compartments, and regardless of the effects of their plans upon foreign countries. The problems confronting them, it is true, are more or less similar; but their successful solution will depend in large measure on co-ordinate and co-operative effort. It was the object of the Conference to obtain as complete a picture as possible of the situation of the world, and by comparison of the situation in the various countries to make it possible to form a judgment of the importance and difficulty of the problems with which they are respectively faced. The result of deliberaWe tions extending. over a fortnight was generally regarded as disappointing. The conclusions arrived at by the Conference were, in a large measure, platitudinous, while its limited recommendations were of little practical value. Beyond forming a scheme for the extension of credits through the instrumentality of an international organization, the world's financial experts accomplished nothing., l t remains to be seen whether their solemn declarations regarding national thrift, systematic deflation, the gold standard, control of the exchanges, and other important matters, will prove to be more than counsels of perfection and pious aspirations. Generally speaking, the. financial outlook leaves a great deal to be desired. Tho Britisli (government has iiot yet put into practice the principles of economy it is never tired of preaching to others. Extravagance and waste still rule in various public departments, and there continues to be too ready a disposition to embark on grandiose schemes at home and hazardous and expensive adventures abroad. Unfortunately, the same may be said for most other Governments, the habits of reckless expenditure contracted in war-time not being easy to shake off. It is also very difficult for them to shake next. off powers given to them during the war. The continuance 'of heavy public expenditure in all countries has imposed upon the payers of all nationalities burdens which, judged by pre-war standards, are not only tolerable, but which, by discouraging comthe same basis. mercial venture, are seriously calculated rest the revival of trade. At the same time, attitudeof labour, manifested* in the demand for higher wages for less work, is gravely recertain goods. tarding that growth of production whioh is world's sole hope of economic salvation. Moreover, the difficulties of the times been considerably accentuated by the academic policy of officialdom in dealing with all tricate financial problems that press for tion. That is what we have here today. have the academic policy of officialdom and the bureaucratic desire to get control operation. of all our industries. And the more it gets control and so deprives us of freedom of trade the worse will be the position of the country. The Government's expectation that matters will bo righted by dictating artificially money rates and the curtailment of bank own industries. credits is destined to prove a vain delusion, l t is one thing to restrict harmful speculation, and quite another thing to discourage enterprise into which speculation necessarily enters. Progress was made in the past, because vernments allowed the venturesome leaders industry free scope for the execution of their plans, unfettered by official restrictions and punitive taxation. Only when freedom is stored are we likely to witness an approach the spelter they require. to financial stability' and security, under alone ordered and progressive prosperity will be possible.",34
119,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"How would honourable member overcome the advanfactured tage that Belgium, France, and Germany have over Great Britain owing to the change position ? ' Mr GREGORY - I have already pointed out that the increase in the of living in France has not been proportionately, as great; as the depreciation in its exchange. What I feel is that, having regard to the difficulties with which the manufacturers of France have to contend, the enormous prices they have tb pay for everything they purchase; and the increase in the cost of living there, plus the additional duties that we have placed upon their products, to say nothing of these dumping duties, our industries, so far as importations from that country are concerned, are sufficiently protected. My desire is, however, ' that we shall postpone the further consideration of the measure to which this motion relates u n t i l October Meantime, we should be able to obtain from Great Britain and other countries information as to the methods taxthat are being adopted there, and we incould then endeavour to do something on The Minister told us to arthat Great Britain had imposed a dumpthe ing duty of 33£ per cent, in respect of I find that that duty the relates chiefly to optical instruments and is to' operate for five years.

Paragraph A relates to exports to Australia of goods the of the class or kind produced or manui n Australia. I should like to add the words "" or consigned for sale exto Australia,"" so that if the Minister thought that any goods of the kind were being consigned here for dumping purcost poses he would be able to impose on them an excess duty up to 15 per cent. I would be prepared to agree to a proposition of that kind, but I think the provisions in paragraphs B and C are atrocious.",35
124,Mr RYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"What part of the motion would the honourable member postpone? Mr ©REGORY.i-The whole ,of it , with the exception of paragraphs A , D , and C. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ryan) full y appreciates the far-reaching importance of the measure to which this motion relates. We are all tired and weary after the long and trying debate on the Tariff, and find very great difficulty in dealing with a measure of this kind, for which, in so far as it relates to the exchange position, there is no urgent need. The Minister promised the people of Australia that he would endeavour to protect the consumer. If that part of the motion which relates to exchange were postponed u n t i l October next, the honourable would then be able to give further consideration to that phase of the question. The Canadian Act does not give the Minister so great a power as is proposed in this case. It provides thatIf at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council, on report from the Minister of Customs, that the payment of the special duty by this section being evaded by the shipment of goods on consignment, without sale prior to such shipment, the . Governor in Council may, in any case or class of cases, authorize such action as is deemed necessary to collect on sucb goods or any of them the same special duty as if the goods had been sold to an importer 'in Canada prior to their shipment to Canada That refers to an ordinary dumping duty, which cannot exceed 15 per cent. The Canadian Act does not give the Minister power to add all the other charges for which provision is made in this motion. We should be very careful as to what powers we give the Minister in this direction. We have provided for certain retrospective duties, such, for instance, as the duty on t in plates. A supply of tin plates is very important in connection with the export of f r u it and jams from' Australia, but the Minister might apply a dumping duty to t in plates coming into this country because he believed that some one was about to enter upon their manufacture here, and might seriously prejudice the f r u it and jam export trade. Parliament would have no voice in the matter. It might take years to produce tin plates here in sufficient quantities to supply local requirements.",36
125,Mr RYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Does the honourable member think this power could be used to hold up prices to enable big wholesale houses tb get r i d of their stocks at prices satisfactory to themselves?,36
126,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I do not go so far, but it mighb be dtine. Let us suppose that rerj'resentations were made to the Minister that a firm was about to enter upon the production of t in plates in Australia. In that case the Minister might apply a dumping duty to all t in plates coming into this country before the local industry had been established on a commercial basis. That would mean a very big impost, and possibly ruin to our export trade in tinned f r u it s and jam. Under the American law it is provided thatWhenever the Secretary of the Treasury member finds that any industry in the United States of America is being, or will likely be, injured, or is prevented from being established because of the importation of any article, and that such article is selling or is likely to be sold in the United States of America, or elsewhere, at less than is fair value, importers thereof shall pay, in addition to other duties, if any, an anti-dumping duty equal to the difference between the purchase price or export sale price and the foreign market value or eost of provided for is production. I am content with that power, but when the Minister seeks power to take into account f.o.b., c.i.f., charges, plus a profit of 20 per cent., he is making it very plain that it will be possible for him, when a new industry sets up here, to destroy competition so that the consumer will have to pay all these extra charges; and the consumer will suffer accordingly. The Japanese Anti-Dumping Act providesWhen any important Japanese industries are threatened by the importation of unreasonably cheap articles, or the sale of imported articles at unreasonably -'low prices, the Government, after submitting the question to the special Committee, may impose upon sueh articles during a fixed period of time duties not exceeding their proper prices in addition to the duties provided in the Tariff. If the articles specified have already been imported, and are in the possession of an "" unreasonably cheap seller,"" the additional duties may be collected from the seller or his agent. I do not think we could do the latter, but that is the procedure in that country. In no instance has any of these countries gone to such extremes as are provided in paragraphs B and C.",36
127,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"If paragraph C is left out, would not the effect be to n u l l if y the whole of the provisions?",37
128,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I would amend paragraph A by the addition of reference to goods consigned for sale. That is to say, I would make paragraph A provide for all contingencies; and that could be easily done. Ha d the Government taken a little care in connection with their finances, had they taken a little thought for the prosperity of the community, they might have made millions by way of in come taxation, and so have avoided the need for putting on these special rates of duty. There are certain large firms trading in Australia, which are really sub-sidiary to big foreign interests, the Australian profits from which go overseas. If a tax were put upon the output of those concerns the outside interests would not continue to gain to the extent of millions of Australian money, while our revenue would be correspondingly in creased, with less need for these imposts. The South A f r i c a n legislation provides:In the case of goods imported into the Union of a cJass or kind made or produced in the Union if the export or actual selling price to an importer in the Union be less than the true current value (as denned in this Act) of the same goods when sold for home consumption in the usual and ordinary course in the country from which they were exported to the Union at the time of their exportation thereto, there may, in addition to the duties otherwise prescribed, be charged, levied, collected and paid on those goods on importation into the Union, a special Customs duty (or dumping duty) equal to the difference between the said selling price of the goods for export and the true current value thereof for home consumption as defined in this Act: provided that the special Customs duty (or dumping duty) shall not in any case exceed 15 per cent, ad val. Here, however, we have a 45 per cent, duty; then the 15 per cent, is charged, and a further 20 per cent, is taken on top of all that-no t to mention other charges which are heaped upon the goods. Do the Government forget that there are other industries in Australia beside manufacturing interes'ts? What real hope is there for the man on the land ? He is charged enormously for the implements which he must use in the course of his operations. The difference between the cost of his reaper and binder and the cost of the same to the Canadian farmer is really enormous. Take, specifically, the cost of fencing wires. Not long ago I received a telegram from Western Australia, pointing out that the duty which had to be paid upon 14-gauge wire actually amounted to £ 1 8 per ton. Before the war we were able to buy that gauge ""for £ 7 10s. to £ 9 5s. per ton. What encouragement is shown to a man to go out and open up new country? What facilities are wo offering immigrants? I suppose there is not an honourable member present who desires to see new citizens entering Australia from overseas and going into city life . We have no room for newcomers in the cities and manufacturing centres. But if we impose these dreadful casts upon a man who is willing and anxious to go out and battle on the land, what hope is there for the f u t u r e of Australian primary industry? A man must protect his holding against the hordes of pests. Nowadays, however, our returned soldiers and others-first clear a comparatively small acreage of new country and plant it . The usual procedure is to take off a harvest or two before going to the cost of fencing and protecting a block. What hope is thei'e, however, for the beginner who, in order to save his crop from the encroachment of rabbits, kangaroos, and the like,, buys fencing materials and netting, and has to pay such enormous prices? The Minister is to be given certain further powers. He desires to be known as the M&Kinley of Australia. There has been scarcely any l i m it to the duties which he has been found willing to agree to. I ask the Committee to call a halt, or, at any rate, to take a few months' careful consideration of what these resolutions imply.",37
129,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [4.45] The honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) has suggested that the Committee should lay aside all the paragraphs of resolutions 1, except A , D , and E, and that A should be amended. To do this would practically render the Bill useless. The object of the first four resolutions is to deal with dumpiug. It is recognised that dumping may be brought about in four different ways. First, there may be a purchase of cheap goods from some foreign country, the importation of which goods into Australia may cause in j u r y to local industry. Secondly, goods may be imported, and sold here for much less than the cost of production in the country of their manufacture ; that is to say, they may be dumped here to the detriment of AustraA liau industry. The thir d method of into Australia. dumping has to do with the importation and sale of goods by consignment. Canada, no provision was made in the plicable. Aot of 1904 to cope with, consignment, but in 1907 an express amendment was made to deal with this procedure. fourt h method has to do with circumthe stances in which goods are brought to Australia free of the imposition freight costs, or are transported ballast, or in subsidized vessels. These are all distinct methods of dumping. The resolutions recognise them, and, i each instance, it is proposed them appropriately. Paragraphs B and C cannot be eliminated without practically rendering paragraph A ineffective. think. If paragraphs B and C are left out, the whole of the dumping which may be practised can be carried out under another of the four methods mentioned. foreign manufacturers find that they have large surplus stocks on hand, which they desire to get r i d of, they can consignments into Australia, the goods below the actual cost of production. The specific object of graph C is to prevent that. dumping by way of consignment, the parties concerned need not make! sales such as aro provided for in paraonly graph A .

I h order to deal with dumping I am not altogether opposed to any provision that would be reasonably practicable under certain conditions; but I think the resolutions before us exceed the limit of reason. The - Minister (Mr Groom) has explained the pr&visions with regard to consigning on sale, or for sale, goods of such exceedingly low value that their sale Would be likely to be detrimental to Australian industries. Under the present Customs law the Department demands that the duty shall be paid, not necessarily on the amount for which the importer purchased the goods, but on the value of such goods at the port of shipment, and on the date of shipment. Some of the provisions of these motions are merely reimposing conditions which already exist under the Customs Act. If an invoice does not represent genuine values, the Customs Department will rectify it , but the Government are asking the Committee to impose an entirely new condition, namely, that the value shall not be less than the cost of production of a similar article in Australia.",40

172,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The Tariff Board and the Minister between, them. That is a considerable restriction and curtailment of the ordinary methods of conv merce recognised here and in other parts of the world.

I think that neither the Minister who introduced the Bill nor the members of the CJommittee at present realise what it is proposed to do.,40
176,Mr STEWAR,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,T - We hardly realise the effect of what is proposed.,40
177,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"That is so. It has become apparent during the somewhat conversational debate that we have had, that the powers which we are asked to give to the Minister are to be intrusted to him without restriction. The Tariff Board which this House has authorized is to be entirely an investigating and advisory body. It is true that before the Minister can take action, he must refer certain matters to the Board, and await its report; bub nothing in the Bill passed last week, or in the motion under discussion now, compels him to take notice of the recommendations of the Board, beyond saying bhat he agrees or disagrees with them. If he wishes to enforce any of the penalties for which we are now asked to provide, he need only make a reference to the Board, and. await its report., and he can then put into force any decision that is allowable under the wide provisions of this resolution. But it is this Committee which will really be responsible for the acts that may be done under the proposed law by future Ministers for Trade and Customs, and I ask members to seriously reflect upon that fact. I will now deal with the provisions for allowing the Minister for Customs to impose special duties or penalties against our late .'allies, namely, France, Belgium., and Italy. And I beseech the Minister now in charge of the Bill to withdraw the clauses which the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has asked shall be withdrawn, and to consider the advisability of postponing the provisions of paragraph A. of the schedule, because if that were carried grave and unjust disabilities might be im' posed on countries which, as allies, fought side by side with us in the war. It is to that aspect of the matter that I propose to address myself now. The honourable members for Dampier and Wakefield have pointed to serious flaws in the provisions relating to dumping, about which I shall not say anything at pres(|at beyond declaring that I am in favour of any effective method of controlling what is known as dumping; by which I understand to be meant the sending of goods to this country to undersell Australian, manufactures, and to destroy Australian, industries. That I am prepared to go to the utmost length to prevent. But I shall now confine my remarks to paraFrance graph A of the schedule. I doubt ths Minister has fully realized enormity of the offence which he the Committee to perpetrate thereby. paragraph A of the schedule the currenof cies of France and Belgium are specifictliis ally dealt with, and a full list of is set out for imposition on the manunot, depreciated their currency. facturers of those countries. I shall remind the Committee of what and France did and suffered for us, the Empire, and for the world during the recent war with Germany; because honorwho able members are fully aware of the great and valiant sacrifices made by them; I wish to draw attention to one of the results of those sacrifices, which was enormous and indeed colossal impoverishtention ment of the financial resources credit of their peoples, an impoverishtion ment barely imaginable by any one in Australia, or even by many in TJnited Kingdom. At the end of the of Australia are depreciated. war, Belgium and France were, a sense, finally victorious, but virile manhood had been greatly depleted and their financial resources exhausted. It has been implied in the speeches on this question that some special reproach taches to a people whose currency greatly depreciated, and it is on that sumption that the schedule to which have drawn attention seems to have been largely based. But every recent war of any dimensions has been followed a great depreciation of the currency one or of both the countries that took part in it. This happened in the Civil War in the United States of America.. Neither the North nor the South had, the time, the financial resources sessed by countries today, and even the North, which was infinitely the richer, found itself compelled, or thought it visable, to make a large over-issue of paper money, which greatly depreciated its currency. The currency of the United the effects.' States of America was, in the early six'ties, as. much depreciated as is that of France' today. There was the same over-issue of paper money, impelled by necessity, and it is an open among financial, historians whether American Civil War could have been soon brought to a successful conclusion there not been that over-issue. it may in future be a question this war could have been sustained by Belgium., and Italy. Mr Jowett. and Belgium if those countries that had not, after applying every method of the raising revenue that could be devised, asks issued paper money, and whether we In as free men, instead of being the slaves Germany, should now be discussing method of oppressing the people of penalties France and Belgium, if they had I not will not admit for a moment that Belgium it is any reflection on a country for that it has had the misfortune to have its currency depreciated. If there were, are we in Australia that we should fling reproaches in this matter at the but peoples of France, Belgium, and Italy ? l t has been shown over and over again the in this chamber-and I do not draw atto it any more than is needful to and remind honourable members of the posihere and in England-that at the living present moment the paper issues of the Great Britain and of the Commonwealth The in latest figures that I have been able to their ascertain, the test being the sales of gold in a free market, are from my friend the chairman"" of the Australian Gold Producers Association, who in forms me that the last quotation for fine atgold in'London was £ 5 12s. lOd. per oz. is The plain English of that is that the aspresent value of the £ 1 note, either I British or Commonwealth, is 15s. I d . when measured in gold, or as the Minister might prefer to term by the m in t par of by exchange. We are, therefore, living here of in a country and an Empire which is carrying on with a depreciated currency. Yet the whole trend of the debate on this measure- I am not dealing with at dumping, but with paragraph A of the posschedule-is that there is some reproach against those three valiant countries because they have depreciated currencies, adand that, in some way or other, we must impose severe penalties on their industriesand manufactures in order to neutralize",40
178,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"That is not a correct way of putting it . question Mr JOWETT - Will the honourable the member put the matter in a more corso rect way! I am giving my recollection had of the arguments used in favour of theSimilarly, penalties proposed in paragraph A of the whether schedule on the industries of France,, I should now like to discuss more closely the effects of what are known "" unfavorable exchanges,"" though I prehe fer not to use that term, which I regard purchased for. £ 1 0 0. as very confusing. When we speak of ""unfavorable exchange"" cr of the exbeen change being "" against the country,"" meaning depends on the point of view from which the term is used. My exnaturally, perience is that these terms are invarijust ably used from a banker's point of bankers speak of the exchange being "" u n -. if f favourable"" probably because it is not franc compared favoured by bankers, or they speak of exchange being "" against a country,"" u when it is against certain interests. Therefore, I desire to avoid, as fa r sible, the use of such terms' when discusone sing the tendencies of .what is known a depreciated paper currency. The effect of such a currency in favour of the country which possesses it has been very much exaggerated. I believe that if the true position could be apprehended honourable members they would have nothing whatever to do with the proposal pefore us-excep t to reject it-the proposal to impose special penalties, or special "" duties ""- as they are called, .against France, Belgium, and Italy - on account of the depreciation in their, rencies. I may say that what is known the mint par rate of exchange is today largely theoretical. In many countries it does notexist. The precious metals are not ""being freely coined in those countlie tries. The rate of exchange between France and England before the war was, roughly, 25J francs to the £ 1 . ' the old rates of exchange have ceased, exist in all those countries' which have enlarged their paper money that they have became depreciated. war, if a person in England o>r Australia had £100 which he desired to invest purchasing goods in Paris, that £ 1 would, roughly, purchase or exchange for 2,500 francs. It is quite that now, owing to the gradual f all i the exchanges, such a person would be able to buy with his £100 of English Australian money, roughly, 4,700 francs in France. I could conceive an enormous advantage to the importer who wished spend £100 in Paris on goods to import to Australia, if the f all in the took place between his buying the and his paying for them; that is to if he bought goods to the value of 2,500 francs, and expected, six months afterr wards, to have to pay £ 1 0 0 for them, it as - would be a great advantage to find that .' ad to pay only £ 5 4 for what he had But the fall has an not taken place in six months. It has gradual, covering a period of seven the years; and during the whole of that period prices and costs in France have, been rising in order to adthemselves to the increased amount view; of paper money and to the f all the exchange value of the with £ 1 sterling. the More francs have to be paid for goods, n t i l eventually a time arrives when, theoretically of course, one gets little more as posgoods in France for 4,700 francs than got before the war for 2,500 francs. as Therefore, the so-called advantage to the French exporter or manufacturer gradually becomes nullified day by day. Perhaps I could place the position in such a way as to be more"" clearly understood. by A f e w days ago, a gentleman who has studied exchanges for a great number of years, and who has recently been on a mission to the East for the purpose of selling gold, said to me, "" I have come to the conclusion that it is almost i m curpossible for any one to understand special as exchanges unless he has actually gone abroad and there had to exchange the money of his own country for the money of another."" Let us place ourselves in position of a country with a falling exchange, as in the case of France and Italy , and with dealings with a country But which has a fixed rate. This is not to altogether a fancy picture, for, as a matso ter of fact, our money hae fallen in value as compared with what is really the geld Before the money of the TJnited States of America. Take the circulation of our own tasteful in and artistic £ 1 Commonwealth notes; 0 0 prices, goods, and costs, and all other conditions have become adjusted to the true amount so represented, and a certain n value is given to a £ l - not e, as compared with all other commodities and services. or Then suppose that quite suddenly-as they say in bills of lading, "" through the act of God or the King's enemies "" to - the number of notes in circulation has become doubled, and that workmen, busiexchanges nessmen, bankers, and everybody else goods possess twice as many notes today say, as they _ did yesterday, and are still engaged in the merry process of getting i d of their money as fast as possible. Then, speaking subject to all sorts of qualifications, the prices of all goods would be very rapidly adjusted to the increased supplies of money-prices through competition would start in the direction of doubling. This process would apply immediately to all our-exportable goods such as wheat and wool. These goods are bought here by exporters to other countries, and they pay for the goods eventually in the money of their own country. If they find, as from tomorrow, that for every £1 they have to provide in London, they can get double the number of our Commonwealth £1 notes in Australia, they are immediately able to give double as much for our wool and wheat. That is a case in which the prices of goods are almost immediately doubled. Of course, this would not apply to every commodity, nor would it apply immediately to wages; but from the moment the operation commences the process of adjustment sets in, and gradually all prices, wages, and costs are justed to the increased supplies of money. This means a depreciated currency; in other words, the £1 note becomes worth 10s. That is exactly the process that has gone on for the last seven years in France, Belgium, and Italy. It is a pure delusion to believe, and it is wicked to try to make others believe, that this process has not gone on in those countries. The theory on which paragraph A is based therefore, seems to me to be absolutely and fundamentally unsound. It appears to be based on the view that as we can buy for £100 of English money a larger number of francs and lire, in Prance and Italy, we can, therefore, buy to the same extent large quantities of goods from Prance, Belgium, and Italy. that is not so; it is a pure delusion, a wicked doctrine to circulate here or elsewhere. The real position is that a process of adjustment goes on, and gradually tends to render nugatory all those theoretical advantages of a fall in exchanges. I am not prepared to say there is not some temporary advantage given to exporters in a country, the exchanges of which are falling, and the currencies of which have become depreciated, as compared with those of other countries; in many cases it has proved a valuable and healthy stimulus industry. But it is not a permaMr Jmcett. nent advantage to the same extentWhile the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) was speaking, an honourable member interjected, "" How can we protect ourselves against the depreciated currencies of other countries?"" The reply to that question is very simple. In the fir3t place, from the moment this depreciation in the currency of other countries sets in, there is set up in those countries a process by which these advantages are rendered nugatory. In the second place, if the honourable member were to put such a question to me with regard to the industries of France, Belgium, and Italy",41

180,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I thank the honourable member for that interjection.

181,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Kooyong) [5.31] - I have listened with a good deal of interest to the speech made, by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett), as well as to those of others who have preceded him, and it seems to me that there is a very considerable misconception ^with regard to the provisions of this motion. I desire at the outset to deal with one or two points made by the But honourable member for Grampians. In the first place, he sought to show that paragraph A was fundamentally wrong, and was based on a misconception. He suggested that a man could take £100 sterling to France, and there buy up depreciated currency at the depreciated rate, but with the francs thus purchased he could not obtain in addition a quantity of goods corresponding to the depreciation. There is no doubt that, in that connection the increased cost of the production of the goods would make a substantial difference, which must be taken to into consideration. But, generally speaking, depreciated currency offers facilities for dumping and constitutes a real menace, and we are only proposing the usual method for the protection of our industries. We are following along the lines of the experience of Canada and the TJnited States of America, and Great B r it a in , where it was deemed essential to pass dumping legislation for the protection of industry against the like contingencies.",43
182,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,We are not following .along the lines of Great Britain .,44
183,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Our proposals - are much milder. May I remind my Italy. honourable friend that we are proposing impose a dumping duty of only 15 per - cent., whereas in Great Britain provision is made for a dunlping duty of 33$ per - cent.",44

185,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Agains t France, It a l y , and, indeed, the whole world, .as the Board of Trade may decide. The British law provides that, in respect of specified goods, a dumping duty of 33£ per cent, may be imposed, but it vides further that such a duty may also be imposed against, any goods that may be proclaimed.",44

187,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"No country specified in the resolution passed House of Commons; it applies to France, Belgium, It a l y , and every other in terms of the Board of Trade's proclamation.

188,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,I deny that. Here is the statement. I invite the honourable member to read it for himself.,44
189,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I have read i We are attempting to impose a dumping range. duty of only 15 per cent, as against dumping duty of 334 per cent, imposed by the Mother Country on certain speciof fied goods, the list of which may be i definitely expanded.",44

193,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Mad e in certain countries. My honourable friend made the broad statement, and sought to drive it home, that it was improper for the Government of the Commonwealth to introduce a provision of this kind which would apply so harshly to France, Belgium, and The question as to the particular to goods to which the provision applies is immaterial. My point is that as regards both goods and exchange we are treating those countries with nothing like the degree of severity which marks the resolution passed by the British House of Commons. We are providing for a dumping duty of 15 per cent, as against the British dumping duty of 331 per cent., and for an exchange duty of only 26 per cent, at the present momeflt against France, as against 334 per cent, imposed by the B r i tish Parliament. Here is the resolution proof the House of Commons which the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) has whatsoever placed in my handsThere shall he charged on any of the following articles imported into Great Britain in or Ireland, _in addition to any other duty of Customs chargeable thereon, a Customs duty of an amount equal to 33J per cent, of the is value of the article, that is to sayby the Then the articles are set out.",44

Sir ROBE RT BEST - But there is a further provision in the resolution of the Italy , I House of Commons thatArticles of any class or description in respect of which an order by the Board of Trade has been made under any .Act of the present for giving effect to this resolution if manufactured in whole or in part in any of the countries-specified in the order, or deemed to be so manufactured, may be subjected to this duty. The B r it . tish provision is of the very widest The first, consideration, of the B r i a tish Government was the protection of British industries, and as against the rest the world, without limitation or restricn - tion it has provided that the Board of Trade may issue a proclamation as the in result of which a dumping duty of 334 per cent, may be imposed, and to meet the exchange position an additional duty are of 33i per cent. I am dealing not with any particular class of goods, but with the principles involved in this motion.",44
195,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I find that the document which the honourable member has quoted does not give a list of those countries against which these duties are to operate, and there is no reason to believe that France, Belgium, and It a l y are included.",45
196,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The honourable ber for ""Salary Grab"" is not in his place. I call attention to the lack of a quorum. [Quorum formed.] Sir ROBE RT BEST - I am sorry that the honourable member for Grampians should persist in his interjection with respect to the case of France, Belgium, and Italy. The resolution is of the widest character and provides ""as against the world. "" The countries to which the honourable member has alluded may be specified, of course, in any proclamation which is made; but there is no limitation of the power. It can scarcely be held to be a reproach against us, that we are doing - something which is cruel and unfair to the countries mentioned, when we are merely taking a lead from the Mother Country, whose restrictions have not been so adjudged by those three countries. I repeat that the resolution of the House of Commons is wide enough to cover all countries, and that is all we seek.. We are not dealing with ordinary trade in goods of fair and reasonable value, but we are proceeding to impose a scheme for the protection of our industries against the disasters of dumping in the light of the experience of, and following the lines laid down by, other countries. In the TJnited States of America, where there are very rigid anti-Trust laws, there is at the same time express provision against their application to the export trade of America. Power is provided, under the laws of that country, for the exploitation of any foreign country in order to permit America to dump its manufactures abroad. Another instance of this same specific objective may be seen in the scientific manner in which Germany went to work. By an extraordinary system of subsidies, financial concessions, railway rebates, and such means, provision was made for the export of Germany's surplus goods. We are up against that kind of thing- a procedure which is recognised as a national process for the capture of foreign markets; and we must protect ourselves. The only question is how most effectively to do so. We admit the necessity. A r e we doing so upon a fair and reasonable basis ? My opinion is that we are. We are making our dumping protection less severe than the Mother Country herselfi n regard to some goods, and precisely similar to that of Canada and the TJnited States of America in respect mem- - of other goods. I know that the honourable member for Grampians does not object to the anti-dumpine provisions; but, so far as concerns the exchange provisions, I point out that they are not more severe than those of Canada and the TJnited States of America.",45
197,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,I am not prepared to look to those two countries for examples.,45
198,Sir ROBERTBEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I am not looking to them either, except with regard to their schemes for protecting themselves. Our objective is the protection of Australian industry; and I emphasize that it is only when the Tariff Board and the Minister are satisfied that certain importations are being made to the detriment of Australian industries that the anti-dumping provisions will come into foroe. I admit that there is much complication about the proposed legislation. The Bill seeks to impose no less than seven dumping duties. The first is known as a ""dumping d u t y "" ; the second as a ""dumping below cost d u t y "" ; the next as a ""dumping consignment d u t y "" ; the next as a ""dumping freight d u t y . "" Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Surely the honourable member will agree to the fairness of taking advantage of ballast rates of freight when importing ? Sir ROBE RT BEST - I agree with the necessity for making provision against the dumping of goods by means of shipping subsidies, by freedom from freight payments, and by the help of ballast rates. I have already referred to Germany's in - genious schemes for aiding the export of certain goods by means of shipping subsidies and the like. I do not criticise the use of ballast rates in the ordinary commercial practice; but when an effort is made by means of ballast rates to injur e Australian industry, it becomes another matter entirely. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Norma l ballast rates are exceptionally low.",45
199,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"And , ordinarily, a very legitimate means of transport. I repeat that it is only when resort is had to low ballast rates fox the purpose of dumping surplus goods in Australia that paragraph D will be applied. I call the careful attention of honourable members to resolution (2) :The various duties specified in the foregoing paragraphs be separately charged, notwithstanding that more duties than one may apply to any particular goods, but that the duty payable on any particular goods under paragraphs (A) to (1)') inclusive of this resolution shall not, eitlier severally or collectively, exceed 15 per centum of the value for duty of the goods . . .",45
200,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,That covers all objections.,46
201,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Of course! If honourable members will bear in mind that this resolution refers only to dumping, and that, though it appears to be complicated, yet it purports to deal with several different methods of importing goods and completely differing contingencies, they will perceive that the methods set out aro really a simple way of placing the necessary legislation on our statute-book. I am satisfied that the Government have exercised - reasonable care and precaution in ascertaining and benefiting by the experience of other countries. Another point made by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) had to do with the Tariff Board. I think the Board will provide assurances to Parliament which, the honourable member himself would be the first to welcome. _ I refer to the procedure of its undertaking investigations. The general form of our Australian Tariff, and particularly of the schedule passed by this House, contains provisions which enable the Minister to reclassify a great number of goods, so excluding, for example, certain machines and other articles from duty. practice has been for some time to take advantage of those provisions in order to render assistance to local industries. This was really a great power in the hands of the Minister. Now, however, the Tariff Board is to have the responsibility of investigation. ""We even seek to go f u r ther, so that if it is alleged that dumping is being practised here, the matter will not be one for decision upon the mere ipse dixit of the Minister; the ques-. tion must be referred to the Board. Care must be exercised in its investigations. Then, it must report to and advise the Minister. Thus is afforded extra security to this Parliament and to the commercial community. It really amounts to an additional guarantee of justice. If the Minister is satisfied that dumping is being carried on, it becomes his duty to bring the anti-dumping provisions into operation. But, unless he is so satisfied, they will not come into operation. Hence, in this extra care proposed, far more assurance is given that the Government are upon sounder ground than in the exercise of the mere discretion pf the Minister. Even as regards this matter of investigation by the Board, we are largely following a practice placed in the hands of Committees in other countries; and it amounts to a guarantee, at least, that the right thing is being done. While it may appear to be harsh in some regards, yet, on the whole, the procedure is fair. As for the suggestion t'o exclude paragraphs B and C, to do so would be equivalent to a deliberate invitation to importers to carry on their dumping operations by the method of consignment. Of course, paragraph A would be of no value unless paragraphs B and C were to stand. The gross liability is 15 per cent. Much exception has been taken to the consignment duty, but after all it is fair and reasonable. If a local manufacturer should ask 5s. pergross for certain articles, and the purchaser declared that he could buy them for 3s. from another vendor, the manufacturer would immediately realise that something was wrong, and bring the fact under the notice of the Minister. It is reasonable that the difference between the wholesale price and the selling price in Australia should be imposed as a dumping duty, and the means of ascertaining it is fair.",46
202,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The honourable member has laid stress on the fact that the maxiThe mum duty will amount to only 15 per cent. Does he realise that the penalty against France, Belgium., and Italy under the schedule rises as high as 75 per cent. ?",46
203,Sir ROBER TBEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I shall not attempt a,t this stage to deal with the schedule; I am dealing only with principles.",46
204,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,46
205,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Melbourne Ports) [ 6 . 7 ] - I hope that these many and varied provisions will have the effect of making the Tariff truly protective, although I doubt that they will do so. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett) has objected .to these proposals on the ground that they will operate drastically against our late Allies, Prance, Belgium, and Italy. The saine plea was raised prior to a recent Court decision which overruled the practice of the Customs Department, and compelled the Department to refund certain amounts which had been collected in duty by a certain method of valuing goods imported from countries whose exchange was depreciated. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) took up the cudgels on behalf of those countries as the honourable member for Grampians is doing today. I would like to deal as leniently as possible with our late Allies, but I recognise no nation to which. I would give precedence over the Australian people. And if the operation of the exchange upon goods imported from those countries will defeat our efforts to encourage local manufactures, I must oppose the claims of France, Belgium, and Italy.",46
206,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,No reasonable ground for any such apprehension has ever been advanced.,47
207,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The world today is in a peculiar position. _ The United States of America, with its vast wealth and resources, found itself, after the war, in an enviable position financially, but in an unenviable position in regard to the manufacture of goods for export.",47
208,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Thes e provisions will help America.,47
209,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Whils t I am desirous of acting fairly by the people of the United States of America, I am even more desirous of establishing true Protection in Australia. And if the exchange differences would allow the manufacturers of Belgium, France, and Italy to send goods to Australia cheaper than they could be imported from America, I am opposed to unrestricted exports from those countries.",47
210,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I am not; I would give France, Belgium., and Italy a preference.",47
211,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Why ? They were only our Allies, just as th© United States of Americai was.",47
212,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,But they suffered more.,47
213,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I admit that, but we have imposed high duties upon importations from our own kith and kin in Great Britain in order to encourage Australian manufacturers. Therefore, wa should not fail to protect the local product against the competition of goods manufactured in Prance, Belgium, and Italy. Although my sentiments are strongly in favour of those countries, I desire this proposed legislation to have the very effect which the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) fears. If the proposals which the Government have submitted will do that, the Tariff will be more effective than I thought, because it was the competition of those countries whose currency is depreciated that I feared most, just as I am afraid of America's powers of dumping. We have to guard against goods which America's financial resources and dumping capabilities enable her to land in Australia cheaply, and the goods from countries whose depreciated currency en# ables them to export cheaply. Both forms of competition are equally detrimental to Australian industry. The honourable member for Grampians has made me more enamoured of the Bil l than I was at first, because I was afraid that, not even with these provisions, would we be able to prevent dumping. The Minister (Mr Groom) and others who have addressed themselves to the motion today have not dealt with the question as I think it should .be dealt with; but this is legislation that is largely experimental, and whatever our desires may be, only experience will show wliether these provisions will be effective. I hope that all that is expected of the Bill will be realized, and that it will help us to achieve complete protection and encouragement of local production. If this legislation should prove to be insufficient to achieve that purpose, I hope the Government will introduce other proposals which will be more effective.",47
214,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Grampians) [6.17] When my earlier speech was interrupted I was dealing with the theoretical advantage said to he possessed by countries whose currency is depreciated so much that they have to sell their money at a lower rate in exchange for the moneys of other countries. Honourable members have attempted to show that the depreciated exchange gives certain countries an enormous advantage which can be guarded against only by this provision relating to exchange. But I have shown that the natural result of the depreciation of a country's currency is a rise in the costs and the prices of commodities within that country. For - instance, France, instead of being able to buy £100 worth of British goods for 2,500 francs, as she could before the war, now has to pay 4,700 francs for the same quantities of British goods marked at the old pre-war prices. Then, as regards other enhanced costs, wages in France are now , four times higher than they were at the beginning of the war. Thus, the disadvantages arising from the exchange position may approximately almost balance the advantages. The cost of all the raw material imported into France, Belgium, and Italy for manufacturing purposes has increased in equal proportion to the depreciation of the currency, and so any theoretical advantage in regard to manufacture for export is largely nullified by increased costs of all kinds. The alleged advantage that French manufacturers have over other manufacturers is largely illusory, and, therefore, I again ask the Committee to pause before doing what, in my opinion, would be a dreadful wrong to our late Allies. Another matter of the gravest importance is that these countries against whom it is proposed to impose these special duties are among the largest purchasers of Australia's raw materials. France, at the present moment, is one of the largest buyers of Australian wool. The other day I had occasion to go to Queensland in connection with a very important scheme 'for settling returned soldiers on land which is now undeveloped, and I returned in a train which Was carrying a number of wool buyers, who had been attending the wool sales at Brisbane. From them. I learned that of about 37,000 bales'sold there, nearly half had been bought for French manufacturers. Franoe has not imposed a special duty on Australian wool, because, the paper currency of this country has depreciated, as I have shown, to such an extent that the £ 1 note is worth ""only 15s. Id. in gold. She has not treated us with the harshness with which it is now proposed to treat her. But, owing to the depreciation of her own currency, and an unfavorable exchange, she has to pay much more in French money for the wool that she buys from us than she used to pay, and the loss that is thus caused to her through her depreciated currency may equal any advantage that she might get in exporting her manufactures to this country. France, Belgium, and Italy all manufacture largely raw materials which they import, and for which, owing to adverse exchange, they have to pay prices much in excess of pre-war prices; and the more closely one examines the facts, the more clearly it is seen that the advantages which their exporters are said to enjoy are to some extent illusory and nugatory. The speech of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) showed that the members of the Committee are not aware of the extent to which it is proposed to penalize the industries of France, Belgium, and Italy. » Mr GREGORY - There are hardly any members of the Committee present. There is not one member of the Opposition in his place,, and there are only seven members in the chamber.",47
215,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Yes . In the words of the immortal Wordsworth, ""We are seven."" There are only six members listening to the discussion of a matter which, I say without hesitation, is of so great importance that the people of Australia must stand or fall in the judgment of history by the conclusions at which we arrive. Eor all"" practical purposes, I might as well be reciting the poems of Milton, or Shakespeare, or Wordsworth, as addressing myself to the question before the Chair. It must be remembered that we cannot always profit by the services of the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), for whose judgment, generosity, and justice I have the greatest respect. Some future Minister may not desire to show to the countries that have been our Allies the consideration which the present Minister would show. !No language which you, Mr Charlton, would allow me to use would permit me to express the shame and humiliation that I feel-and that the men and women of Australia will feel tomorrow, when they read the reports of our proceedings-at the manner in which this matter is being treated by members generally. To the six members of the Committee I say .«",48
216,Mr RIOHAED EOSTEK,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,There are eight members present now.,48
217,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"If the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) were present to draw attention to the state of the Committee, the attendance would, no doubt, suddenly increase, and in a manner that would give some idea of the ratio in which the penalties in the schedule increase against France, Belgium, and Italy.",48
218,Unknown,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Sitting suspended from QMS to 8 p.m.,49
219,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"-It was pointed out with great emphasis by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) that the anti-dumping penalties are limited to 15 per cent., and various' speakers have made a great deal of that limitation. These penalties, curiously enough, are imposed against all countries from which dumped goods are supposed to come; but I draw attention to the fact that while those penalties are plied to all countries, and are limited to 15 per cent., the special penalties for which France, Belgium, and Italy are singled out, are not so limited, but range up to 75 per cent, on account of the depreciated exchange.",49
220,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Exactly ; but have you ever known 300 francs to the £1?,49
221,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I have not; but I have known 47 francs to the £1. > Mr GROOM - Then how can the duties range up to 75 per cent, if the franc has never been 300 to the £1 ?",49

223,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Not a "" penalty.""",49
224,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"It is called a special duty; in any case, it is something in excess of the ordinary duty, and may fairly be described as a penalty.",49
225,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Assumin g it is 21 to 26 per cent., how does it compare with the percentage in the case of the United Kingdom, and the United States of America?",49
226,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The present value of France. the franc is, approximately, 47 to the £1, and we are told in the schedule as set to say. forth on page 4 of the resolutions that if the bank rate of exchange is not than 45, but is less than 50-that is where the 47 francs to the £1 comes in the special duty shall be chargeable, valorem, at the rate'of 26 per cent. Now, that is in addition to all the other duties.",49
227,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Will you compare .that with what is charged in the United Kingpreciated. dom, Canada, and the United States America ? "" Mr JOWETT - I shall, indeed. I wish to impress on the Committee that, with the franc at 47, the Minister is given power to impose a special duty on goods exported from Erance, Belgium, and Italy, and, in the case I have cited, the special duty is 26 per cent., in addition to all the other duties.",49
228,Sir ROBERT BEST,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,It is much less than in the case of the United Kingdom.,49
229,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The circumstances are totally different, as I shall show. The special duty against France, Belgium, and Italy, I repeat, is imposed in this schedule in addition to all the duties which are imposed, in common, against the goods of all other countries. These ap- special duties are not imposedon goods from America or Japan. I have here a few figures which have been prepared and issued on the authority of the Consul General for France, showing what will happen in the case of that country under the proposals of the Government.",49
230,Mr KYAW,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,V-When were the figures prepared ?,49
231,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I suppose within the last few days; at any rate, they were supplied to me today. I thought it only right before addressing myself to this subject to obtain the latest and most reliable information as to the rates of exchange and the effect of such duties. - Mr Ryan - Were the figures prepared at your request?",49
232,Mr JOWETT,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"No ; I went to see the French Consul with the object -1I have named, and I do not think the figures can be disputed with any success.",49

In this paragraph "" a price"" means such a price as represents the cost of production of the goods plus per centum plus free on board charges.

246,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Wakefield) [8.18] - The more consideration I give to that paragraph B the more I am convinced in that it ought to be rejected. It is a I do-not' know that any country has ever gone to such lengths. It means in effect that any goods similar to those manufactured in this country shall not be admitted if it is any possible in any way to keep them out.,50
247,Mr MAITHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,The Tariff would be useless unless we passed paragraph B .,50
248,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Heave n help the people if* the Tariff requires this sort of thing. It gives the Minister power to impose, in addition to the existing Customs duties, a further' dumping duty,' and also prohibitive charges.",51
249,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,After the Tariff Board has recommended that the provisions of paragraph B shall be applied.,51
250,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,But the Minister may apply it in any case whether the Tariff Board does or does not recommend that it be applied. The power is entirely in the hands of the Minister.,51
251,Mr RILEY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,But the Minister is subject to this Parliament.,51
252,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Quite so; but while Parliament was in recess a great deal of mischief might be done under a provision of this kind.,51
253,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,There will be mischief if we do not pass this proposal. - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I do not think there will be.. Our industries must be of a poor description if they cannot stand the breath of some measure of competition.,51
254,Mr RILEY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Stee l rails are being dumped into New South Wales at the present time.,51
255,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"At what price? We have given the Tariff Board power to inquire into the operation of the Tariff, to investigate existing industries, and to say whether the Protection given to any industry by this Parliament is being abused. If it finds in any case that the Protection so given is being abused, it may recommend that the duty be reduced or removed. The Board will also have the power to recommend that industries struggling against severe competition shall in the public interest receive a little more protection. We are now asked to give our industries the additional protection of these dumping duties. Paragraph B provides that if the Tariff Board reports that goods. produced or manufactured outside Australia are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a 'reasonable price, with the result that the competition to which a local industry is subjected is too keen, the Minister may direct that special precautions shall be taken at the port of shipment to see that the goods are not invoiced below the actual cost of production plus certain charges and then plus 20 per cent. The Customs Act already provides that precautions shall be taken in every instance to see that goods are not invoiced below the actual values at port of shipment.",51
256,Mr BEENNAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Is paragraph B directed to make profiteering compulsory?,51
257,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"It provides in reality for prohibition. It means that a local industry may safely go on piling up overhead charges. It will make Australia the dearest country to live in. It is about time that the people knew what the Bill to be founded on this motion is designed to do. The Government is not going to allow Australian industries to stand before the breath of fair and honest competition. Not content with giving our industries a generous protection, it is providing for what is practically prohibition. And yet honourable members opposite talk of bringing down the cost of living and creating price fixing Boards. Paragraph B, if agreed to, will make it impossible for Australia to be a reasonably cheap country in which to live. I had intended to move an amendment, but as I understand that the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has a prior one to submit, I shall refrain for the present from doing so.",51
258,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Dampier) [8.27] - It seems to me,51
259,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,I should like to explain the necessity for paragraph B.,51
260,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,The honourable member would support a proposal to increase this dumping duty by 100 per cent.,51
261,Dr MALONEY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,I would support prohibition in respect of quite a lot of things produced in Australia.,51
262,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I am sorry for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews). I am sorry to think that he has such a poor opinion of his own people. I move That all the words after "" If "" , line 1, paragraph B, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following:-""at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister, after inquiry 'and report by the Tariff Board, that the payment of the anti-dumping duties specified under paragraph A of this resolution is being evaded by the shipment of goods, or consignments without sale prior to such shipment, the Minister may in any case or class of cases, authorize such action as is deemed necessary to collect on such goods or any of them the same dumping duties as if the goods had been sold to an importer in Australia prior to their shipment to Australia."" This amendment, if carried, will also involve the omission of paragraph C. Paragraph A deals with goods of a class or kind produced or manufactured in Australia and sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than the fair market value. Paragraph B deals with any goods that may he imported into Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, so that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry. It covers almost any class of goods that the Minister may choose to gazette on the ground that they are being imported under conditions which are detrimental to some local industry. It will be easy for him to make excuses if excuses are necessary. Minister is satisfied with a very reasonable proposal under paragraph A. The dumping duty imposed under that paragraph is to be merely the difference between the fair market value of the goods and ,the export price, or, in other words, the price at which the goods were sold by the exporter to the importer in Australia, including f.o.b. charges in the country of export. We aTe quite content with that. But the Minister says that, under this paragraph, a reasonable price represents ' the equivalent of the cost of production, plus 20 per cent.",51
263,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"If importers were bringing goods in genuinely they would look for quite 20 per cent, profit.",52
264,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"It would not be reasonable for them to expect to make more than from 5 per cent, to 7^ per cent. Does the honourable member say that goods should not be imported into Australia without the expectation of a profit of less than 20 per cent, upon the values? Any such profit would be unfair and abnormal, certainly in respect of large contracts. When an indent merchant is dealing with large supplies of steel, or galvanized iron, or tin-plates, it would be a. preposterous charge to add 20 per cent. As for "" a reasonable selling price,"" the Minister himself can fix that. To ascertain it, there is added to the production value the cost of getting the goods to the coast in the country of export, and the cost of landing them here. Then there [412] is heaped up every conceivable charge that can be imposed; and upon everything else, the Minister adds a profit of 20 per cent. After which, and before the .goods reach the consumer, there is the ordinary duty of, perhaps, 45 per cent., plus 15 per cent. Where does the consumer come in? This is one of the most wicked and preposterous proposals ever placed before Parliament.",52
265,Mr BRENNAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The Bill insists upon a profit which, under the Money Lenders Act, might be considered unconscionable.",52
266,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Yes . I cannot understand the motives influencing honourable members, because paragraphs B and C have not the same bearing as paragraph A. The first of the series had to do with goods of a class or kind produced or manufactured in Australia; and it is The in respect of those that the chief danger from dumping lies. We need to protect the industries which are being built up here? I was satisfied with the proposition contained in paragraph A ; but honourable members are now asking for the same conditions in respect of paragraphs B and C, which deal not with goods produced in this country, but with goods the importation of which might be detrimental to Australian industry. According to the argument of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr."" Mathews), no cheap goods of any kind, from anywhere, should be permitted to come into Australia. As for the letter of the Minister for Customs, addressed to the points raised by the Belgian Consul, it contained absolute rubbish, which reflected credit neither upon the Minister nor his Department.",52
267,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"It is the Minister's job, and our place, to see that Australia gets Australia's trade. We are not legislating for Belgium, but against it, when it is a matter of competition with Australian industry.",52
268,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"But surely we need not destroy our own country in the effort. Is there to be no limit to the prices which our people must pay for goods, while the Minister and honourable members pile on duties? Here is a circumstance which has come before me only today. The particulars are set out in the following letter:Re exchange dumping - If this Bill goes through, it is going to seriously affect the man on the land as regards items which we sell., namely,, fencing wire. We have a shipment to arrive, in the Bardie, due here m about a or ten days, which will cost ns landed, with tlic present rate of duty,, about 20s. per more than the local article. But if the Dump- ment. ing Bill goesthrough we will be penalized (with an additional £4 10s. per ton.",52
269,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Does the - writer mean, tfcar. he is deliberately importing with a view to injuring Australian industry?",53
270,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Of course not. When it comes to a matter of exchange,53
271,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,The honourable member mentions exchange. What country are these goods coming from?,53
272,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Fro m Belgium. .,53
273,Mr MATHEWS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"If we can produce the article here, it should not be imported from Belgium.

After Parliament had imposed rates of duty ranging from 25 per cent, to 35 per cent. I received an intimation from Western Australia that the duty alone upon a specific line of wire, for use by pastoralists, amounted to £18 per ton. Since that transaction the rates have .been amended, and application has been made for a rebate. I only hope that, if it is granted, the retail buyers of the wire, and not the importers, will directly benefit. Many costs today are» 300 per cent, higher than pre-war prices. What is to become of Australia? primary producer is being driven off the land. Here is a measure which seeks to impose penalties that are altogether beyond reason. I can understand honourable members opposite, who are desirous of keeping up the eost of living, so that wages shall not come down, but I cannot appreciate the motives of the Government. The whole of their efforts in connection with the Tariff have been in the direction of increasing the cost of living and. piling up the cost of production. The object of the amendment is to apply to paragraphs B and C the same conditions as apply to paragraph A. I cannot imagine any reason why the classes of goods specified in paragraphs B and C should be subjected to an excess dumpingduty beyond the impost prescribed in' week paragraph A.

274,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Worksand Railways, and Acting Attorney-General) [8.45] - The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) is leaving a very erroneous impression upon the minds of those whom he is addressing, and the only conclusion to which I can come is that he has not grasped the real meaning of these two paragraphs. The view the honourable member has put is this : In the first place, paragraph A deals with all goods of a class or kind produced or manufactured in Australiathose words do not occur in paragraphs B and G; therefore' those paragraphs can be ap^ plied to all classes of goods imported into Australia. That is not correct. Paragraph B applies only to those goods pro^ duced or manufactured outside Australia, sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and where detriment might thereby result to Australian industry. Therefore the goods imported, instead of being of any kind, must be such, as will compete with an Australian industry. If they cannot, then paragraphs B and C cannot apply to them.",53

276,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,The industry must be one already in existence.,53
277,Mr BELL,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Does the Minister wish-to eliminate all competition?,53
278,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"No : we want to elimThe inate unfair competition, which very often takes place with the deliberate intention of wiping out an Australian industry. Clearly, the . paragraph applies only, to those goods coming into Australia which, when sold here contrary to the provisions of this law, may do an injury to an Australian industry. The object and intention of the Bill is to prevent unfair competition or unfair dealing to the detriment of Australian industry. I can. not accept the amendment for the reason that the general intention of paragraph B is to prevent imported sroods being sold to people in Australia at prices lower than the cost of production in the country of origin. We must have that paragraph, because it is intended for that general class of cases. That is the worse kind of - dumping we' have - to face at the present time, and it has .already been experienced here. That class of goods, instead of being bought and sold in 'Australia, Tnay be sent here by manufacturers abroad, and at prices lower than the cost - of production in the country of. origin.",53
279,Mr MAXWELL,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"That would be with only One object, namely) to wipe out the local industry.",54
280,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Yes ; and it could have only that effect! ' No Australian industry could produce and sell goods in competition, with manufacturers abroad who were selling their products in Australia at, less than the cost of production. Such competition must result in the wiping out of the industry, and the consequent creation of unemployment. The next question is, how does paragraph B meet that situation? - I think it meets it very aptly. It provides that when the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry by the Tariff Board, that goods produced of manufactured outside Australia have been or .are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and that detriment results, the dumping below cost duty may be imposed. What is the meaning of the dumping below cost duty ? The amount of the dumping below cost duty will be in each case a sum which represents the difference between the reasonable price of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price of the goods. Then reasonable price is defined as such price as represents the cost of production abroad, plus 20 per cent., plus f.o.b. charges.",54
281,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,That is moral.,54
282,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Honourable members seem to think we are imposing a 20 per cent, duty, whereas we are only assessing the reasonable price.

That should include profit. . Mr GROOM - It might or it might not, but we are now dealing with cases in which the manufacturer abroad sells his goods to. an importer in Australia at the cost of production or less. When goods from abroad are being sold in this country at less than the cost of production, and in competition with Australian manufacturers, the cost of production is to be ascertained under this provision', and 20 per cent, added to it.",54

299,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"This is not a profit of 20 per cent. We say that when goods are imported into Australia, 20 per cent, should be added to their cost of production to allow for the expense of selling them here. We have endeavoured to arrive at a method of assessing the fair - and reasonable price at the time of shipment in the case of certain goods brought here from, abroad which may be placed on this market in unfair competition with Australian goods.",55
300,Mr GREGORY,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Can you quote a similar provision in the law of any, other country ? . Mr GROOM - What we are concerned - with is the protection of Australian industries. The cost of production means the cost of production in the country where, the goods are produced. To that are added the charges specified, plus 20 .per cent. This is done to arrive at the .reasonable export price, and covers the cost of warehousing, advertising, distribution, - and so on in the country of export. This reasonable price having been ascertained, it is compared with the export price, and the difference between the two represents the dumping duty, which must not exceed 15 per cent.",55
301,Mr BELL,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"That 15 per cent, is over and above the duty specifically applicable by the Tariff ? . . Mr GROOM - Yes ; it is an additional - duty, and' is necessary to equalize competition in Australia. It is to plicable only in cases which have been - before the Tariff Board, and on whioh the 'Board, after investigation, has reported ;to the Minister. The Board will look .at these matters from a business point of view. If it finds that the importation is not-detrimental.to any.

308,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"There is no need for considering that. The Tariff Board will make its report, and the Minister will act accordingly.",55
309,Mr BRENNAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,The Board may be influenced to some extent by the folly of honourable members.,55
310,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"We must assume that Parliaments are wise, regarding members in their corporate capacity.",55
311,Mr CHARLTON,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"In paragraph 2 it is stated that the duty payable on goods mentioned in paragraphs A to D inclusive shall not either, severally or'collectively, exceed 15 per cent, of the value for duty of the goods as ascertained in accordance with division 2 of Part VIII . of the Customs Act 1901-1920. Does not that nullify the charging of 20 per cent. . in paragraph B?",55
312,Mr GROOM,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"No . The 20 per cent, is an amount added in order tb ascertain the reasonable price of the goods. Tho dumping duty is the difference between the reasonable price aud the export price, and cannot exceed 15 per cent.",55
313,Mr BELL,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Darwin) [9.10] - In spite of what the Minister has said, if paragraphs B and C are carried, there can be be ap- no competition with Australian industries. The method therein laid down for arriving at the reasonable price of imported goods is to take the cost of production and to add to it 20 per cent., plus freight and other charges. Now, a business conducted. on sound lines expects to ; prosper on a much lower profit.than 20 The per cent. Our object in protecting Australian manufacturers is to give them a greater share of the local market, not so that they may charge higher prices, for their goods, but so that, because of the increasing; of their output, they may lower their prices. We have contended all through the Tariff discussions that the local manufacturers should be able to sell at a lower price when their output increases, because the greater the output the lower the profit that is needed. There are industries in the TJnited States of America whose turnover is so great that +hey can carry on with a profit of 5 or 6 per cent, on the cost of production; and if, to ascertain the reasonable price at which their goods should be sold on this market, we add 20 per cent, to the cost of production, we assess those goods unreasonably. If we impose an additional duty of 15 per cent - on the goods of a foreign manufacturer, on the ground that he is selling them at a price detrimental to an Australian industry, when he sells them for a profit less than 20 per cent, on the cost of production, we do away with the possibility of competition. To brand as unfair competition the selling of goods made abroad at a profit of, say, 10 per cent, on the cost of production is absurd. Unless the Minister is prepared to modify his method of arriving at a reasonable price for goods imported from abroad, I shall support the amendment. Mr OB00M (Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Eailways) [9.14] The reasonable price is based on the costof production in the country of export.",55

The question is a very involved one, and even after hearing the informative and instructive speeches of the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), I am still somewhat without light. I may apply, how-, ever, an argument or instance which,though it has nothing to do with the Bill, will illustrate my point. In the early days of this Parliament, when we were in the throes of the controversy, white versus black labour, we passed a Bill which provided for the application of a language test. That test, I may say, was not for the purpose of letting people into Australia, but for the purpose of keeping people out. Now, what is the object of this Bill ?",56

The language test to which I have referred was designed to prevent certain persons from, coming to Australia; in the resolution now before the Committee the same principle applies, but refers to goods instead of to people. No person will bring goods here under the provisions of an effective Bill of this kind, because there will be no profit in doing so; and I ask the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster) how he can pretend to be logical when he contends for low duties in order to prevent dumping ? - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I do not do anything of the kind! - Mr BAMFORD - If we desire to prevent dumping we must make this Bill so stringent and effective that no dumping will take place; and to advocate low duties with that object seems absurd; the higher the duties the more likely are they to prevent dumping. - Mr Charlton - The Government proposals only apply to specified articles. .

I am sure that what 1 say will appeal to honourable members as a common-sense contribution to this debate.

I know that ever since he came he has never been able to extend his vision beyond the factories of Melbourne Ports. However, when I asked the Minister, by way of interjection, how it would be possible to discover the reasonable cost of production in foreign countries, his reply was, "" We have agencies."" Just fancy a Tariff Board sitting in Australia, dealing with any particular commodity which may have been dumped, or supposed to have been dumped, and setting their agencies in France, Belgium, Italy, the United States of America, and Canada to. work to discover what is the reasonable cost of production in those countries. When the cost of production in one country has been ascertained, who is going to say what is a reasonable cost in another? If it is the intention of the Board to endeavour to do what is suggested, they will be in an impossible position. If those controlling the Steel Trust of America set out to destroy the iron and steel industry in Australia, is it to be thought that a comparatively light imposition on a. few shipments would affect that .corporation in the slightest degree? The honourable member for South Sydney. (Mr Riley) said that the American Steel Trust is"" already dumping steel fails in Australia; and if that corporation is going to make it its business to capture the Australian market the provisions of this measure will not have the slightest effect upon it. What would the extra duties be to such a corporation as the American Steel Trust? I have said on many occasions that if it can be shown that any company, corporation, or individual is endeavouring to sell goods in Australia with the deliberate object of ruining an Australian industry I would not only support high duties, but would entirely exclude their products. The honourable member for South Sydney has said that the Steel Trust has made up its mind to dump steel rails in Australia.",58

341,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"The moment the Board is appointed requests will be made by persons or companies who consider that dumping is taking place. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) has asked why I object to the Bill. I am opposing it because it will be impossible to secure information concerning the reasonable cost of production of goods coming into Australia from all over the world. In connection with the question of steel rails we have to remember that Belgium is a producer, and it will not be long before Germany will be exporting to Australia, because the insane practice of allowing German manufactures to come through America and Great Britain will not last very long.",58
342,Mr RYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,Why does the honourable member allow the practice to continue?,58
343,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,I would not allow it to last very long if I had my way.,59

By the time that information was received it would not be worth presenting to this Parliament. Before half of the essential details had been received requests would be forthcoming concerning the cost of production of other articles. We are asking men to perform an impossible task, and whilst I am quite in favour of absolutely prohibiting the importation of any article exported to the Commonwealth with the deliberate intention of destroying an Australian industry, I cannot see how the provisions of this measure can possibly be effective.",59

It will place the whole of the manufacturing industries of Australia in the hands of the gentleman who may happen to be, for the time being, Minister for Trade and Customs. It place at the disposal of the Minister a weapon which he should not be allowed to use, and which, if used, will cause the people, in the very near future, to regret the passing of such legislation. At the same time it will not prevent dumping. The penalties provided in paragraph B will not prevent any of the great Trusts and Combines of the world from attempting to capture an industry here if they think it worthwhile to make the attempt.",59
348,Mr BRENNAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Batman) [9.41] Although I do not expect that the observations I am about to offer will have the desired effect of curing the narroweyed squint which the Government appear to be giving to this very important question, I feel it my duty to deal briefly with it . The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) appeared to have some anxiety as to the difficulty of ascertaining the cosfc of production in any country other than our own. Surely such anxious doubts' on his part are little less than an affront to the 'omniscient Minister (Mr Greene) who. controls the destinies of the Customs House, and who,- just for the moment, has breathed omniscience into his subordinate now at the table. Surely it would be utterly wrong to suggest that one who has at his Angers' ends all the details of the intricate ramifications of production in Australia is limited by the narrow confines of Australia's shores in knowledge of the details of production of any article. We must assume in favour of the Minister that, having sent a cable gram to Australia House, and having had the good luck, perhaps, to send it direct to the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), now in England, he would receive an answer, also by cable, showing at once what is the cost of production of any article in any country. We have .just passed what some people describe as a fairly high Tariff. In some particulars, others say fchafc it is not sufficiently high, but <-< the whole it is claimed by a large This majority of honourable members that it is an effective Tariff. We have dealt very industriously with the schedule from end to end, but, just when we thought we had finished with it, we find that we have to begin afresh. In this proposal we have Tariff piled on Tariff. It is a new Tariff superimposed on the old or, will if I may paraphrase the words of Tennyson, "" Tax piled on tax were all too little."" By means of what is known as an anti-dumping motion we have designed a Tariff, not for the protection 'of Australian industries, because that already has been dealt with-no t to prevent undue competition by cheap labour of other countries against our workers of Australia, because that, too, has been provided for, but to do something more. And in that process some think, and I share their view, that in many instances we have inordinately increased the burdens of the people, and especially of the poor. Whether that is so or not I suggest that paragraph B of the motion as it stands, in effect, is merely designed to make sure that whether the Tariff does or does not increase the cosfc of living no low-priced commodity shall be sold in Australia. It is designed to prevent commodities at low prices reaching the people who are crying out against the high cost of living. Let me read the paragraphIf the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board and I may here interpolate that .ithe Minister is the final arbiter, and may regard or disregard the findings, of the Tariff Board that goods produced or manufactured outside Australia, have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry I pause because we have here the first of the many vague phrases in this paragraph-' ' Detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry."" general discussion on the Tariff we, at least, had the advantage of having in our minds definite industries and sets of definite conditions-wages , prices, and so on-and it has been said that some of us have been unduly influenced by lobbyists and interested persons outside. I do not plead guilty to that, because I think it is the duty of the Committee to derive all the information it can froin those who are operating these various industries. In this particular paragraph we are handing the Minister a blank cheque to deal with industries generally. We are invitin g him to operate the paragraph in cases where the price may operate to the detriment of an Australian industry at some future time in regard to some unnamed Australian industry which may not then be actually in existence, and possibly may not even be in contemplation. . . . a dumping below cost duty on those goods imported into Australia, which are specified by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette as heing goods as to which he is so satisfied, the amount of the dumping below cost duty being in each case the sum which represents the difference between a reasonable price of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price of the goods. In this paragraph "" a jeasonable price"" means such a price as represents the cost of production of the goods, plus 20 per cent., plus f.o.b. charges. This part of the clause imposes on the Minister the necessity of exchanging a number of cables with some representative in England or abroad, or calling upon the consular representative in Australia to determine, perhaps in a few hours or a few days, the intricate ques[413] tion of the cost' of production of articles made abroad. The clause insists upon a profit of 20 per cent - Now, we have been railing for some years against profiteering, but in this clause, so far as it relates to goods sold but not manufactured here, there is provision for a profit of an amount which, as I said by interjection, might well be regarded as unconscionable under the Money Lenders Act . It has been shown, and rightly shown, that a profit considerably below 20 per cent, might secure to the exporter a just and fair return, while the public will get a commodity at a reasonable price, with the knowledge that it is adequately protected; and so we may, therefore, for m some idea of what, apparently, is the In the object of the Government, namely, boosting up prices. The paragraph goes on to stateIn the absence of satisfactory evidence in relation thereto, the cost of production to be such amount as the Minister thinks fit to fix, after report by the Tariff Board as the cost of production. A f t e r the Tariff Board has reported, and after several cable messages have been exchanged with the High Commissioner in London, the Minister might be as blankly ignorant as a Chinese coolie as to the cost of production of an article. Nevertheless^ he will be entitled fco say, ' ' For the purpose of my resolution, I d e clare this amount to be the cost of production."" I have not lent any measure of appreciable support fco the Deputy Leader of the Country party in his Tariff campaign, but in connection with this proposal, at all events, he can rely upon my vote, because it is perfectly clear to me that we are running riot, or proposing to do so, under the delusion that we are protecting Australian industries, when, in truth and.in fact, we are doing nothing more than boosting up Australian prices.",59
349,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Wakefield) [9.57] - Assumin g that the arguments of the Minister are right, he is still in an untenable position. How, in the name of conscience, can the Customs Department ascertain the cost of production in a factory in Japan or America? It is utterly impossible. The Department has no power to do that. I should like to know why the Minister did not accept the position as set out in the Customs Act and take "" fair market v a l u e "" as a basis. The Minister cannot mention one single instance anywhere of a Tariff placing a further impediment to the importation of an article, as is here proposed. He should accept the recognised principle, as contained in the Customs Act, namely, the market rate at the port, of shipment and on the date of shipment. That' is as far as the Department should go. I am going to fight the motion paragraph by paragraph, and if we cannot get the principleto which I object struck out, I intend to oppose the' Bill, which will cause a greater storm throughout the country than the Tariff, which itself will open the eyes of the people when they realise what it really means.

I was looking through the reply supplied by the Minister, in order to see if any of the information could be omitted from Hansard, and thus save the expense of printing, but I was unable to come to a aecision until the Minister courteously turned up the original question in Hansard. I asked for information in regard to the architects, engineers, surveyors, &c, and I wanted those particulars, and not merely the particulars which it suited the Department to supply.

377,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I l l a w a r r a [10.26] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) the almost indescribable confusion into which business in the Sydney metrothe politan area is being thrown by the failure of the Department to supply an efficient telephone service. It was admitted tonumber day, in reply to a question by the honoris able member for Nepean (Mr Bowden), that there are more than 4,000 applicachange tions for telephone connection with the various metropolitan exchanges in the Sydney area that the Department is unface able to supply today. That, in itself, an exceedingly serious matter. It means new exchanges. that 4,000 people, presumably most them business people, are unable to an adjunct that is necessary to the efficient conduct of their business. Some do. of these people have been "" waiting more than twelve months to secure nexion. One main in one of the suburbs couple of years. has been waiting for fourteen months a connection, and when I made inquiries in his behalf, I was told that it was highly improbable that he'would be conis nected within four or five months from now. We are told that this condition affairs is entirely due to the circumstances brought about by the war. How far that is true, and how far it is due to the failure of the Government to obtain supplies durwere ing war time, are questions in regard which we could get veiy interesting evimade dence if an inquiry were instituted. It is one of the shocking examples of this miscalled policy of economy, that is so popular in Melbourne, and is so much of handicap to other parts of the CommonWhen wealth in the conduct of the work of the community. We had examples of the practice of economy in the Department Sydney. The Department wished to purthat chase a large quantity of telephones and equipment, but the necessary money was refused. Later, when the Postmasterof General wished to spend another £500,000 on the services the amount was struck off the d r a f t Estimates, and the policy longer. was pursued for a number of years ing the war of cutting down the Estimany mates to such an extent that it is now i m possible to start a new business i Sydney metropolitan area in competition with an existing business because of the ' [414] handicap placed on the new business by the utter failure of the telephone system. As to provision for the future, when it was proposed to establish an automatic ) exchange, the departmental officers asked for an exchange capable of dealing with . 5,000 subscribers. Here, again, the great Economy party interfered, and cut down estimate by half. The exchange was started as one capable of handling 2,500, services. I am not quite sure as to the it is now able to handle, but it not more than 3,500, and it may be only 3,000. On the day on which the exwas opened there were more applications for connection than the exchange could cope with. One would think, in the of this experience, that immediate is steps would be taken to provide for I understand that of authority has been given to extend obtain the North exchange to 5,000 wires. If that is so it will take some time to At the rate at which buildings are for put up under the Federal Public Works conDepartment, it will probably take a If the exchange were for opened today, it would be unable to accommodate a number of people who wish to get connection with it , but if it not completed for another year or two there will be another year or two's of accumulation of applications. Years ago a site was secured to establish an exchange to be known as South. That block, is there today, but when some inquiries made about it recently we were in to formed that the Department has not yet up its mind whether it is going to build on that block or not, and apparently nothing is being done to meet the rea quirements of this rapidly growing city. I mention that in my electorate the population has almost doubled within ten years, and that the great suburbs in outside Sydney are growing so' rapidly even with the greatest forethought their requirements ""are difficult to meet, one wonders what will be the condition the metropolis ofSydney within the next four or five years if the policy of half measures is allowed to continue much I hope some effort will be made durto get the new exchange started, and of the suburban exchanges enlarged. - There are cases in the metropolis with in n the 5 or 6 miles of Sydney, where if a man moves from one street to another in the same municipality he is kept waitingthirteen weeks, and frequently he haa to wait three or four weeks before he can get his own telephone transferred from one address to another. The whole vice on its developmental side appears to bave broken down - I hope an effort - will be made to put some energy into the officers who are charged with the duty of looking after the future of the city. Nearly £20,000 is waiting to come into the Department for telephone services, and the Department is unable to take the business. position is deplorable. Unfortunately it is not confined to Sydney, but I speak of Sydney because it is, perhaps, growing more rapidly than any other city, and it is further behind because of the repeated reductions of the expenditure which the officers of the Department have from time to time declared to be necessary. very men who made the recommendations, not this year .or last year, but many years ago, for extended and adequate service, are the men who today are being blamed because that service is not there, while the fault lies with those who refused to provide sufficient money enable the work to be done, and who, when the opportunity is given to purchase material at a reasonable price, decline to provide the money, and subsequently find that other people have been more shrewd and have obtained the material which ought to have been used in the development of the Sydney exchanges. I emphasize the necessity immediately proceeding with the South exchange, and of considerably accelerating the rate of speed of completion of the North exchange, as well as extending many of the suburban exchanges that today are overloaded.",64

386,Mr EYAN,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"I should like to see these of things gone on with, but at the same time. I understand the reasonableness of asking for a definite pronouncement in regard to Canberra. In that respect I am with the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr. Hector Lamond) that, a definite statement fchould be made, without any backing and filling, so that we may know exactly where we are. It is obvious that a Government supporter is of the opinion that the Government behind which he sits is not candid about the matter.. Otherwise a method such as has been adopted this evening would never haveS been taken. It was one of the most drastic steps I have seen taken in my experience of Parliament, and the collapse of the Government was as complete as any collapse I have ever seen. I hope the Government will make some definite pronouncement on Canberra at the earliest moment, so as to save us from the shock of the sudden jerks that we .sometimes get at the time the Home is about to adjourn, and so that a large number of the publio who are anxious to have a statement on the subject may be satisfied.",65
387,Mr WISE,PROHIBITED BOOKS AND,"Gippsland-Postmaster General) [10.37] - I agree with the complaint of the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) that there are a large number of people throughout Australia waiting for telephonic service. It is useless now to discuss whether it was a wise «r unwise policy to starve the Department, as the honourable member phrases it, during the years of the war. We have to deal now with the present situation. I told the House in* November last that almost immediately after I took office the Treasurer gave me authority at once to call for tenders for a large amount of works. He gave UB about £900,000 last year for those works, and in order that the matter might be expedited, he gave us permission to anticipate this year's vote to the .extent of another £900,000, so that we could get the orders put during last year, and they would be coming to hand during the present year. In November of last year we had £1,130,000 worth of orders out. At that time we had orders for 636 miles of cable, 19,354 miles of wire, and 46,628 telephone instruments for all Australia, besides a large quantity of accessories and other material, - butnone of this could be t ot for same time. I think the rst delivery of telephone instruments under the contract was in May last. They .have been coming to hand reasonably well ever since, and the supply is well up to contract time. There are in Sydney and itssuburbs about 1,000 subscribers who are only waiting for instruments, and these will be supplied within the next two or three weeks. There are others who are waiting for cable wire and other material, as well as instruments, and their cases will be dealt with as soon as possible. The Department is anxious to bave these subscribers, because the telephonic service is a good business proposition; but we cannot make bricks without straw. Iexplained last year that, owing to the great demand for telephonic material in other parts of the world-, - and in places near to where it is manufactured, noneof the tenderers would bind themselves to sup-ply us within any particular time.' All we could do wasto - try to expedite orders as much as possiM<». Material"" has been coming to [ « * ] -» hand, and during the next few months is likely to come more rapidly. The commercial men of Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne have appealed urgently for the erection of an additional trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, and for a trunk telephone line between Sydney. and' Brisbane, there being none now. Both proposals were referred to the Public Works Committee for report, and had not the business of the House been held up to-night we would have endeavoured to obtain the necessary parliamentary sanation for them before the House rose, but we were told by the honourable .member for Illawarra (Mr Hector Lamond) - a New South Wales member-that he would oppose all these proposals until he had obtained a satisfactory explanation about Canberra. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.42 p.m.",66
