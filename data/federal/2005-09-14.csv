Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The aim of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is to ensure that Australians have affordable access to high-quality necessary medicines in the community. It does this by subsidising the cost of PBS medicines and limiting the amount that people pay for prescriptions at the point of sale. In addition, PBS safety net protects individuals and families who need a large number of medicines from high cumulative costs. The PBS serves Australians well and is justifiably regarded as one of the best systems of its kind in the world. Expenditure on the PBS and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for veterans has grown at an average rate of 12 per cent per annum for the last 10 years. The cost to Australia of the PBS and the RPBS was around $6.5 billion in 2004-05. This bill implements government budget measures designed to support the affordability of the PBS into the future. The bill increases the PBS safety net threshold over the next four years and introduces new safety net arrangements for early supply of some PBS medicines. The measures recognise that the PBS is important to the health of Australians. The sensible and practical steps in this bill demonstrate determination to preserve this valued part of the Medicare system for our children and future generations. We have a responsibility to keep watch on the cost of the PBS for the community as a whole and the costs for the individuals and families at the time of purchasing PBS medicines. The measures also recognise that everyone who obtains PBS medicines plays a role by accessing and using those medicines wisely. The proposed changes will increase the amount of the PBS safety net threshold. The threshold for general patients will increase by an amount equal to two general patient copayments and the threshold for concessionals by two concessional copayments each year from 2006 to 2009. This means that the general safety net threshold, currently $874.90, will increase the progressively by amounts equal to two indexed copayments each year for four years, resulting in a safety net threshold in 2009 which includes eight additional copayments. The concessional safety net threshold, which is currently $239.20 and equal to 52 prescription copayments, will increase by two copayments each year to 54 prescriptions in 2006; 56 in 2007; 58 in 2008; and 60 in 2009. These increases will come into effect on 1 January each year and will be in addition to the usual annual indexation based on CPI. These incremental changes will result in a gradual adjustment of the thresholds over several years and will help to rebalance the way costs for the PBS as a taxpayer funded scheme are shared between the community as a whole and individuals using medicines. The reduction in patient copayments after reaching the safety net thresholds will remain the same. For concessional patients, PBS medicines will continue to be supplied free of charge after the concessional threshold is reached. For general patients, the copayment will reduce to the concessional amount once the threshold is reached. The safety net copayment rates apply for the remainder of the calendar year, except for an early resupply of a specified medicine which is not eligible for safety net entitlements. The amendments also introduce new safety net arrangements for some PBS medicines for long-term therapy when a repeat supply occurs within 20 days of a previous supply of the same medicine for the same person. The existing PBS ‘immediate supply' provisions allow for subsidised resupply of some medicines to occur within 20 days if the medicine has been destroyed, lost, stolen or is required without delay for treatment. If this were to occur for a medicine subject to the new safety net 20-day rule, the copayment will not count towards the safety net threshold or, if the safety net threshold has been reached, the usual copayment amount, not the reduced safety net copayment amount, will apply. The medicines which will fall under these new provisions will be subject to expert advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to ensure that the new rules apply only to those medicines where it is appropriate. The measure supports the quality use of PBS medicines by discouraging patients from obtaining additional or early supplies in excess of needs. It will help to reduce wastage and reduce the risk that excess medicines in the community can pose to patients and others. The proposal encourages responsible use of PBS entitlements and safety net arrangements. It removes the incentive to obtain extra PBS medicines for the purpose of accessing safety net advantages. The safety net 20-day rule will mean that patients will achieve the best value for PBS copayments by complying with standard PBS entitlements, not by attempting to maximise safety net benefits by obtaining excess supplies. The safety net 20-day rule is a sensible way to reduce inappropriate demand. The new rule will only apply to PBS medicines where, on expert advice, it is appropriate. It is reasonable that, if an additional or early supply of one of these medicines is required, it should be eligible for PBS subsidy but not be eligible for safety net benefits. This approach will discourage unnecessary supply of PBS medicines and reduce wastage costs. Importantly, this proposal continues to allow for access to additional supplies of PBS medicines under the ‘immediate supply' provisions when that is required. It is fair for the individual, the PBS and the community as a whole. The safety net 20-day rule will not apply to PBS medicines supplied on prescriptions relating to treatment at a hospital or day hospital facility. This means that PBS medicines prescribed in private hospitals, discharge medicines prescribed at participating PBS reform hospitals and outpatient medications supplied at public hospitals will not be affected. This bill delivers two measures which support responsible and affordable access to the PBS. The safety net will continue to play an important role in protecting people from high out-of-pocket costs for PBS medicines. The PBS and all who use it will benefit from changes which reflect sound management and a commitment to fair, affordable access. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA (IMMUNISATION PROGRAM) BILL 2005 First Reading  bott, and read a first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (9.08 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The government is committed to ensuring that Australians can continue to access free vaccines to protect the population against vaccine preventable diseases through the National Immunisation Program (NIP). Our immunisation system is world class. Immunisation coverage rates for 12-monthold children have been above 90 per cent for the last five consecutive years. The proof of the success of the program can be measured by the large declines in rates of vaccine preventable diseases and, in the case of polio and smallpox, eradication of the diseases from Australia. This government is proud of its record of achievement in funding vaccines. Australian government expenditure on vaccines has increased 22-fold from $13 million in 1996 to $288 million in 2004-05. The Australian government provides funds to state and territory governments to purchase vaccines under the NIP. The states and territories then provide the vaccines free of charge to providers so that the target population can be immunised against vaccine preventable diseases. In the 2005-06 budget, the Australian government announced an expansion of the role of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) to include evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new vaccines for funding under the NIP. The increasing numbers of new vaccines and expensive technologies have made examination of the costeffectiveness of vaccines more critical. The PBAC has a long track record in examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceuticals and in advising government in a transparent and rigorous way. The PBAC, a statutory body established under the National Health Act 1953, provides advice to government on drugs that should be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). In making a recommendation for a drug to be listed on the PBS, the PBAC is required by law to consider the costeffectiveness of the drug compared to existing alternative therapies. The PBAC has developed a reputation as a world leader in the rigorous application of evidence based assessment in developing funding recommendations. The PBAC process is being copied by other countries around the world. It is only reasonable that we apply it to government expenditure on vaccines here in Australia. The PBAC process rewards truly innovative medicines that demonstrably improve the health of our people. It ensures that medicines that provide the same health outcomes are priced the same. The bill will allow the functions of the PBAC to be expanded to include providing the Minister for Health and Ageing with advice about vaccines to be funded under the NIP. The PBAC will also continue to have the authority to recommend to the government subsidisation of vaccines under the PBS. The amendments in this bill will come into effect in early 2006. These amendments will enable the Australian government, working on behalf of the public, to receive highquality advice through a strong emphasis on cost-effectiveness considerations via an established, transparent and rigorous evidence based process. The PBAC process will allow government consideration of vaccine funding in a more timely and controlled manner. The new advisory arrangements will clarify for industry and the community the process for recommending vaccines for Australian government funding. A strong NIP is important not only for government but for all Australians. As new and more complex vaccines are developed, steps must be taken to ensure that the immunisation program is as efficient and as possible. We need to put into place advisory arrangements that assure the costeffectiveness of the vaccines provided under the NIP. The bill reaffirms the government's commitment to the NIP. The bill will strengthen the cost-effectiveness evaluation of vaccines and streamline the consideration of proposals to fund vaccines under the immunisation program. In the 2005-06 budget, the government also announced administrative arrangements to improve vaccine pricing processes. In future, pricing for all vaccines recommended by the PBAC for funding under the NIP will be set by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority (PBPA). This change allows the PBPA to recommend appropriate prices for vaccines. The PBPA's established discipline and methods for price determination will provide a mechanism through which prices for vaccines funded under the NIP can be independently assessed and reviewed. Taking these sensible and bold steps demonstrates the government's determination to protect Australians against vaccine preventable diseases in a responsible and efficient way, for the benefit of both current and future generations. The government will ensure that our national resources, including our expert advisory committees, are used in a way that provides maximum benefit to Australians. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2005 First Reading  effective bott, and read a first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (9.14 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Health Legislation Amendment Bill 2005 proposes a number of amendments to legislation within the Health and Ageing portfolio. The Health Legislation Amendment Bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to extend until 30 June 2006 the existing arrangements for approving pharmacists to supply medicines subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme-the PBS. The National Health Act 1953 currently provides for the establishment of the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority-the ACPA. The ACPA's role is to consider applications made by pharmacists for approval to supply PBS medicines and to make recommendations as to whether or not such applications should be approved. In making its recommendations, the ACPA must comply with a set of rules determined by the Minister for Health and Ageing in accordance with the act. These rules, known as the pharmacy location rules, prescribe location based criteria which must be satisfied in order for a pharmacist to obtain approval to supply PBS medicines from particular premises. The act currently provides for the pharmacy location rules and the ACPA to cease to operate at the end of 31 December 2005. The bill amends the act to provide for the pharmacy location rules and their administration by the ACPA to continue to operate until the end of 30 June 2006. In accordance with a commitment made in the third community pharmacy agreement between the Commonwealth and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, a joint review of the pharmacy location rules has been undertaken. Extension of the existing arrangements until the end of 30 June 2006 will enable the government, in consultation with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, to carefully consider the findings and recommendations of the review in relation to the pharmacy location rules and the role of the ACPA. Schedule 2 contains proposed amendments to a number of provisions in the National Health Act 1953 and corrects a number of technical loopholes in the existing legislathe tion. A number of the regulatory provisions governing private health insurance in the act inappropriately apply only in respect of the payer of health insurance premiums to a private health insurance fund, the ‘contributor', and do not include reference to the dependants of the contributor, who are also members. Literal interpretation of a number of existing provisions could result in dependants being excluded from cover. For example, current provisions relating to hospital purchaser provider agreements could be argued to only apply where the contributor is the patient receiving hospital treatment and not where the contributor's dependant is the patient. The situation arises even where the contributor has paid for his/her dependants to be covered by private health insurance. Schedule 2 will amend specified provisions in part VI and schedule 1 of the National Health Act 1953 for the purpose of ensuring that these provisions adequately cover the contributor's dependants and, thereby, clearly indicate that the regulatory scheme governing registered health benefits organisations applies to all members of a health insurance fund with appropriate coverage. The aim of schedule 2 of the bill is to ensure that health funds continue to cover a member with appropriate cover receiving medical-hospital treatment whether that member is classified as a dependant or a contributor to that health fund. The amendments will ensure that all members of health insurance funds with appropriate insurance cover are adequately covered by the existing regulatory scheme. In addition, the amendments to provisions inserted in the National Health Act 1953 by the National Health Amendment (Prostheses) Act 2005 will ensure that the application of the new provisions providing for the regulation of health insurance funds in relation to prostheses arrangements also provides adequate coverage of all persons covered by private health insurance policies. Schedule 3 of the bill makes two amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973. The first amendment clarifies the scope of the power to make the Medicare tables. It has been a long standing practice to specify, in the Medicare tables, conditions that must be the met for Medicare benefits to be payable for health services. The amendments remove any doubt as to the validity of including such conditions in the tables. The second amendment to the Health Insurance Act is to insert a new power that allows the minister to make a legislative instrument determining that Medicare benefits are not payable in respect of professional services rendered in specified circumstances. A power of this kind is required to allow swift action to be taken to prevent medical practitioners claiming existing Medicare Benefits Schedule items for services which they were never intended to cover or which the government does not wish to fund through Medicare. Problems in this area most commonly arise in relation to the development of new medical technologies. Medical practitioners sometimes claim new medical technologies under existing Medicare items before the government is satisfied that the new technology is safe or that it represents value for money. With the rapid advances in medical technology this has the potential to drive up the costs of Medicare and to impact on the broader health system through, for example, increased private health insurance premiums. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA BILL (No. 2) 2005 First Reading  bott, and read a first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (9.20 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005 being introduced today amends the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to remove the need to undertake unnecessary patent searches for certain applicants seeking to list or register a therapeutic good on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. The amendments seek to rectify an unintended consequence of previous amendments which came into force from 1 January 2005 to introduce into the marketing approval process certification requirements in relation to patents. The current patent certification provisions under the act require applicants seeking to include therapeutic goods in the register to certify either: - that they will not enter the market in a manner that would infringe a patent on the product, or - if they intend to enter the market before the expiry of any applicable patent on that product, that they have notified the patent owner of their application. This bill responds to concerns raised by representatives from the complementary medicines industry, over-the-counter medicines sector and the Australian biotech industry that the current patent certification requirements are onerous and are broader than they need to be. This bill narrows the circumstances in which the patent certificate is required by applicants seeking to have therapeutic goods included in the register. This bill amends the act so that patent certification will only be required by those applicants: - who are required to submit safety or efficacy data for the purposes of applying for the inclusion of the goods in the register, and - who rely on safety or efficacy data previously submitted to the Therapeutic Goods Administration by another person in relation to an approved product, as part of the process for applying for the approval of that product. Under the bill, all applicants seeking to list or register therapeutic goods (except therapeutic and medical devices) in the register will either notify the secretary that the patent certification requirements do not apply or provide a patent certificate. This amendment will remove the unnecessary requirement for the owners of those products for which the patent certification requirement under the act is not relevant. The practical effect of this amendment will mean that the majority of complementary medicines, over-the-counter products and originator medicines will no longer be subject to certification requirements. Over 90 per cent of over-the-counter medicines are registered medicines. Of these registered over-the-counter medicines, around 80 per cent are formulated from welldocumented active ingredients where adequate information on the use and formulation are contained in standard reference texts. In these cases, the sponsors are not required to submit safety or efficacy data on the product. They would therefore not be required to certify in relation to patents. For the other 20 per cent of registered over-the-counter medicines, sponsors are required to submit both safety and efficacy data. They would therefore be subject to certification requirements if they rely on safety or efficacy data previously submitted to the TGA by another person in relation to an approved product as part of the process of applying for the approval of that product. The two main exceptions to note for over the-counter medicines are sunscreens and medicated throat lozenges, both of which are listable products. Listed products under section 26A of the act do not have to submit evidence or information to establish the safety or efficacy of their product as part of the application process for the listing of goods in the register. They are therefore not required to provide a certificate in relation to patents. In the case of complementary medicines, over 90 per cent are listable. Listed products under section 26A of the act do not have to submit evidence or information to establish the safety or efficacy of their product as part of the application process for the listing of goods in the register. Therefore they are not required to provide a certificate in relation to patents. The remaining 10 per cent of complementary medicines are registered medicines. This is because they either contain higher-risk ingredients, for example ingredients that are scheduled or that have not been assessed as low-risk ingredients, or make higher-level claims. For these registered complementary medicines, sponsors are required to submit both safety and efficacy data. Therefore they would be subject to certification requirements if they rely on safety or efficacy data previously submitted to the TGA by another person in relation to an approved product as part of the process of applying for the approval of that product. For prescription medicines, which are registered medicines, sponsors are required to submit both safety and efficacy data. They would therefore be subject to certification requirements if relying on safety or efficacy data previously submitted to the TGA by another person in relation to an approved product as part of the process of applying for the approval of that product. This represents a change from the current requirement, whereby sponsors of all products are required to provide a certificate in relation to patents, irrespective of whether they have relied on someone else's data in relation to the safety or efficacy of another product, to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of their own product. In the case of originator medicines, the majority of products (including those registered by biotechs) will not have to certify because, although they are required to submit safety or efficacy data, they do not rely on safety or efficacy data previously submitted to the TGA by another person in relation to an approved product as part of the process of applying for the approval of that product. Applicants who are required to submit data to establish the safety or efficacy of therapeutic goods as part of the process of applying for inclusion in the register, and who rely on safety or efficacy data previously submitted to the TGA by another person, will continue to be subject to the certification requirements. This will ensure that sponsors of generic medicines will have to provide a certificate in relation to patents. This amendment will have no added burden on industry. The notification process being introduced as part of the amendments is simply an administrative process to ensure that an application for marketing approval is not delayed by a failure to provide certification where it is not required. This will not impose a burden, as applicants will know whether or not they are required to submit evidence or information to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of their product and whether or not they are relying on the data submitted by another party. Therefore, the notification process will be less of a burden than the current provisions around providing a certificate in relation to patents. While the amendment simplifies the administrative burden on industry, it in no way changes or diminishes industry's responsibility in relation to supplying medicines that fully meet all the existing safety, quality and efficacy requirements as set out in the Therapeutic Goods Act. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (VIDEO LINK EVIDENCE AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Mr RUDDOCK,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to combating terrorism. We have worked hard to ensure that there is a strong legislative framework in place, with tough laws that target terrorist activity. We are also making sure that our terrorism laws are enforceable. It is becoming clear that, to successfully prosecute a terrorist, it will often be necessary to rely on evidence from witnesses who are living overseas. In some cases a witness may be unable to travel to Australia to give evidence. For example, the witness may be incarcerated overseas. This bill will ensure that, in terrorism cases, so long as the defendant's right to a fair trial is not infringed, important evidence from overseas witnesses can be put before the court using video link technology. The new video link provisions will apply to the prosecution of terrorism and related offences, and to proceeds of crime proceedings relating to a terrorism offence. The provisions will require a court to allow a prosecution witness to give evidence by video link unless to do so would have a substantial adverse effect on the right the defendant to receive a fair hearing. They will also allow a defence witness to give evidence by video link unless to do so would be inconsistent with the interests of justice. The new video link evidence provisions strike a balance between facilitating the admission of video link evidence while ensuring that fundamental safeguards are maintained. The court will be able to require that an independent observer is present at the point where the witness is giving the evidence by video link. This person will be able to report to the court on the physical circumstances under which the evidence is given. This is a safeguard that will ensure that the court is aware of everything that is occurring at the point where the witness is giving the evidence. Another important feature of the new video link rules is that, if a court refuses allow a witness to give evidence by video link, that decision will be capable of being appealed. The bill will also make corresponding changes to the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 to facilitate the use of foreign material, such video tapes and transcripts of examinations, as evidence in terrorism cases. This will be important in cases where it is not possible to use video link technology, perhaps because of the laws of another country. These changes do not affect the rules of evidence, and the normal protections which apply under those rules will continue to apply to terrorism proceedings. Although the major focus of the bill is on video link evidence, it also includes a number of other important legislative amendments. The bill will amend section 4AAA of the Crimes Act 1914 to deal with a constitutional issue regarding the conferral of non-judicial powers and functions on judges of the Federal Court of Australia and federal magistrates. The bill will also amend the Crimes Act 1914 to facilitate the sharing of DNA profiles between Australian law enforcement agencies over a national DNA database system. The bill will also expand the definition of ‘tape recording' in the Crimes Act 1914 to enable new technologies, such as digital audio recording technology, to be used by federal law enforcement agencies to record interviews. The bill will also amend the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 so that, when a surveillance device has been installed under an authorisation, a warrant can be obtained to allow that surveillance device to be retrieved. The bill also amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to ensure that third parties, to such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which carry out examinations for the Commonwealth can be paid out of the confiscated assets account. It will also address a technical problem which has cast doubt over the validity of a number of examinations that as were conducted under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 after changes were made to the regulations authorising members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to conduct examinations. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT (STORED COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",26
3,Mr RUDDOCK,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 to extend for six months the operation of the provisions that enable access to stored communications without the need for a warrant under the interception act. The bill also makes a number of important improvements to the interception act to better equip agencies in the fight tion committed by police and other public officials. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Act 2004 introduced into the interception act the concept of a ‘stored communication' and provided that a stored communication could be intercepted without the need for a telecommunications interception warrant. Access to such communications could therefore be obtained by other lawful means, such as by a normal search warrant. These amendments were intended as an interim measure pending a thorough independent consideration of how best to regulate access to communications in the everchanging world of technologies. As an interim measure, the amendments included a 12-month sunset clause meaning that the provisions will cease to operate on 14 December 2005. In March this year I appointed Mr AS Blunn AO to conduct a review of the regulation of access to stored communications and I have now received the report from that review. I thank Mr Blunn for his work. I am pleased to present a copy of Mr Blunn's report to the House and to advise that it will shortly be available on the Attorney-General's internet site. Mr Blunn has made a number of recommendations in relation to stored communications. This is a complex area of the law, complicated further by the rapid expansion of new and emerging technologies. The Blunn recommendations need to be fully considered in order to ensure that the interception act is able to keep pace with against corrup- these changes. I therefore propose that the current provisions dealing with access to stored communications be extended for a further six months. This will maintain the status quo to give the government sufficient time to fully consider the recommendations in relation to stored communications and other issues contained in the Blunn review. However, the main focus of this bill is on updating the interception act so that agencies that have been established to combat corruption are able to access and use lawfully obtained intercepted information where it is appropriate to do so. These proposals have been developed separately to the issues addressed by Mr Blunn and demonstrate the government's continued commitment to stamping out corruption. Corruption by public officials, including police, may endanger the stability and security of societies and undermine the values of democracy. Corruption may also be linked with other forms of crime, in particular organised crime and economic crime, including money laundering. Australia has a number of authorities that have been established with the specific aim of investigating and punishing those public officials who abuse the trust that their office brings. Recently the Victorian government has contributed to this fight against corruption by establishing the Office of Police Integrity. The objective of this body is to ensure that police corruption and serious misconduct is detected, investigated and prevented. Intercepted material often provides vital evidence of corruption and therefore this bill will make the Victorian Office of Police Integrity an eligible authority for the purposes of the interception act. This means that the director will be able to receive and use lawfully obtained intercepted material for the purpose of fulfilling its statupublic tory obligation to investigate police misconduct including corruption. This amendment follows extensive consultation with the Victorian government about the need to ensure that there are appropriate accountability and oversight arrangements for the Office of Police Integrity. I welcome the Victorian government's decision to enact legislation to address the Australian government's concerns. Nevertheless, the amendments proposed by this bill will not commence if those amendments have not been enacted or if they fall short of the applicable standards. The bill will also amend the Interception Act to enable the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission and the New South Wales Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission to use lawfully obtained intercepted material for the purposes of their statutory function of investigating corrupt conduct. These bodies are already eligible authorities for the purposes of the Interception Act but were restricted in the way in which they could use intercepted material. The amendments made by this bill correct that anomaly and will assist those agencies in their ongoing fight against corruption. Accountability and transparency are key elements of public authorities. To this end, the New South Wales government has created the Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption to audit the commission's operations and to deal with complaints about the commission (including complaints about abuse of power, impropriety and other forms of misconduct by the commission or its officers). As with other bodies that are established to deal with complaints about misconduct by officials, having access to intercepted material will greatly assist the new inspector to fulfil its statutory role. The bill will therefore make the inspector an eligible authority so that it may use intercepted material for the purpose of its function of dealing with complaints. The final anti-corruption measure is to clarify the expression ‘officer of a state'. It includes all members of the police service of that state. While the definition currently includes all people who are employed under a law of a state, such as the civilian component of police forces, there is some uncertainty. The amendments will ensure that intercepted material may be used in relation to the investigation of misconduct, including corruption, committed by all persons who are employed under a law of a state. The anti-corruption measures illustrate the Australian government's commitment to the fight against corruption. Finally, the bill will make technical amendments to the Interception Act to remove references to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 consequential on the enactment of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. I commend the bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA (COMMONWEALTH GAMES) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",28
4,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005 contains an amendment to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to provide duty-free entry for goods for use in, or for purposes related to, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. Similar concessions were provided for the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is expected that Commonwealth Games participants and officials will bring with them a variety of goods that are to be used in a non-commercial manner. These will include give-aways, hospitality samples and other consumables that will be used for team promotion and for cultural and hospitality activities. It is intended that the concession will not apply to alcohol or tobacco products or extend to importations of a commercial nature. Existing provisions under Customs legislation relating to personal effects and temporary importations will also be available for purposes relating to the Commonwealth Games. I commend the bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 4) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Nelson, and read a first time. Second Reading",30
5,Dr NELSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (9.42 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Before I introduce the specific measures in this bill, I would like to recap some of the significant achievements in higher education reform to date in Australia. The government's continuing commitment to the higher education sector is to provide students with better facilities and more course options across a range of campuses. The Australian government's priorities for higher education are to ensure that universities continue to diversify, that they are a part of an internationally competitive higher education sector and that our best universities continue to remain in the top tier of world rankings. Laying the foundation for this commitment is an increase in public investment in higher education of more than $11 billion over the next 10 years, from 2005. As honourable members would be aware, in this year's 2005-06 budget, Australia's higher education sector will benefit from a record $7.8 billion investment from the Australian government. The bill now before the House is a clear expression of our commitment to students to provide real choice in their higher education studies. The bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to enable high-quality foreign universities to establish institutions in Australia and offer education and training services to international and domestic students. The first of these universities is the Carnegie Mellon University, which proposes to establish a branch in Adelaide. This proposal has received the resounding support of the Premier of South Australia, Mr Mike Rann, and I must commend the extraordinary efforts by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo. Carnegie Mellon is a high-quality education and research institution which ranks 38 out of 200 on the Times Higher Education Supplement ranking of the top world universities and 54 out of 500 on the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's ranking of the top world universities. In 2006, Carnegie Mellon was ranked first by the US News and World Report magazine survey of graduate schools in information and technology management. The Australian branch of Carnegie Mellon University is expected to attract more students to Adelaide from the Asia-Pacific region and contribute to its plan to transform Adelaide into a global university city of excellence. It will also further internationalise the South Australian economy, bringing further revenue and prestige to that state. The introduction into the sector of such a highly regarded international university will increase diversity and choice within the Australian higher education sector, make Australia more globally competitive and part of the global higher education marketplace and attract students from around the world who are seeking a high-quality education experience. Carnegie Mellon will welcome its first intake of students in March 2006. The students will be a mixture of both Australian and international students, who will be offered postgraduate courses in public policy and management and information technology. It is expected that the university will attract around 50 domestic students in the first year and up to 200 domestic students by 2009. The amendments contained in the bill will extend limited Australian government assistance to the Australian branch of the Carnegie Mellon University by enabling the university's eligible Australian students to obtain assistance such as FEE-HELP. The application by Carnegie Mellon University to operate in Australia as a foreign owned and operated university is the first such application to be received under protocol 2 of the national protocols for higher education approval processes, which have been in existence since 2000. On 4 July 2005, my South Australian ministerial colleague made a determination under the South Australian Training and Skills Development Act 2003 recognising Carnegie Mellon University as a university for the purposes of that act. That legislative action made it possible for me, as the responsible Australian government minister, to proceed with this bill so that Carnegie Mellon University can begin operations next year. This bill also contains a number of amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to strengthen and better reflect the policy intent of the tuition assurance requirements which all non-table A providers are required to have. Tuition assurance provides comprehensive and robust consumer protection for students in the event that a provider ceases to offer units in which they were enrolled. The amendments will improve the current protection mechanisms which allow students to choose either a course assurance option of switching to replacement units in a similar course with another provider or a student contribution or tuition fee repayment option of obtaining their money back for uncompleted units. In addition, the changes will ensure that, where students choose the option of student contribution or tuition fee repayment, their Higher Education Loan Program debt will be remitted and their student learning entitlement and FEE-HELP balances will be recredited. Where students choose the course assurance option, they will not incur any additional cost for those units undertaken with the second provider that replaced units uncompleted with the first provider. In the case of replacement units, the changes will protect students who are forced to withdraw because of special circumstances and institutions which provide the replacement units without any fee. Students will be able to get a refund without any impost on the second provider and the higher education provider guidelines will set out the basis for this refund. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA NA BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Nelson, and read a first time.

6,Dr NELSON,OVERSEAS STUDENTS AMENDMENT,"Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (9.49 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is fundamentally important to the future of our international education export industry. It highlights the value the Australian government places on protecting our world-class quality assurance and consumer protection arrangements and our commitment to responding to emerging challenges in a globally competitive environment. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, the ESOS Act, safeguards the reputation of our onshore industry to ensure that international students receive the education and training for which they have paid. It establishes key elements for the national regulation of international education and training services. It aims to protect the reputation of Australia's education and training export industry and strengthen public confidence in the student visa program. These protections have brought worldwide recognition of our quality and innovation in education and training and led to the development of an export sector which holds a pivotal role in Australia's future. The bill before the House is a clear expression of the Australian government's ongoing commitment to investing in Australia's international education engagement. The amendments contained in this bill will enable high-quality overseas education providers to establish institutions in Australia and offer education and training services to overseas students. Specifically, as a consequence of amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003, a foreign owned university-in this case, Carnegie Mellon University-will be able to operate as a registered provider of education services to overseas students in Australia. The amendment proposed by this bill reflects the Australian government's commitment to giving students greater choice in where they may choose to pursue their studies. That we were able to attract such an application by a prestigious American university is a recognition not only that the Australian government's higher education reforms are working but of international confidence in our own quality frameworks. The other amendment proposed to the ESOS Act reinforces the capacity for registered providers to charge a tuition fee to international students which covers the costs incurred by those providers in meeting their obligations under the ESOS Act and its national code. The amendment recognises the ESOS Act's aim of strengthening public confidence in the student visa program by ensuring that only genuine students come to Australia. The ESOS Act seeks to ensure international students are appropriately supported in their choice to study in Australia and it requires registered providers to meet a range of obligations to do this. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LOSS NA MEASURES) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Brough, and read a first time. Second Reading",32
7,Mr BROUGH,RECOUPMENT RULES AND OTHER,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.52 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia's taxation and superannuation system. Firstly, schedule 1 introduces reforms to the company loss recoupment rules. A company can deduct losses incurred in earlier income years if it satisfies the continuity of ownership test or the same business test. Listed public companies and their whollyowned subsidiaries can use a modified continuity of ownership test to determine whether they have the same owners. These amendments extend the range of companies that are eligible to use the modified continuity of ownership test to include all widely held companies and eligible subsidiaries. The amendments will make it easier and more certain for these companies to apply the modified continuity of ownership test by relaxing the rules for tracing ownership under that test and by specifying the times at which these companies will need to test for continuity of ownership. The amendments also make various technical changes to clarify the operation of the continuity of ownership test for all companies. The changes to the continuity of ownership test will reduce the need for large companies to rely on the same business test to be able to claim deductions for prior year losses. Large companies with diverse businesses have difficulty in satisfying the same business test. Therefore, the amendments will remove the same business test for companies (including consolidated groups) whose total income is more than $100 million. Schedule 2 replaces the existing foreign dividend account provisions. The changes provide tax relief for conduit foreign income, which generally is foreign income received by a foreign resident through an Australian corporate tax entity. These rules will allow Australian companies that receive foreign income on which no Australian tax is payable to pay dividends to foreign shareholders that are also free of Australian withholding tax. This measure will provide foreign investors who structure their foreign investments through Australian entities with more neutral Australian tax outcomes when compared to foreign investors who hold their foreign investments more directly. This will further enhance the ability of Australian entities with foreign investments to compete for foreign capital. It will also improve the attractiveness of Australia as a location for regional holding companies. These amendments represent the sixth instalment of the government's reform of Australia's international tax arrangements. Schedule 3 denies deductions for expenditure incurred in the furtherance of, or directly in relation to, activities where the taxpayer has been convicted of an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for at least 12 months. Deductions will be denied for all expenditure where the activities are wholly illegal, such as drug dealing or people smuggling. On the other hand, there will be cases where a taxpayer is conducting a lawful business but is convicted of an illegal activity while carrying on that business. In these cases only the expenditure that is incurred directly or in the furtherance of the illegal activity will be denied. Expenditure that is incurred in undertaking the underlying lawful activity and that would have been incurred regardless of the illegal activity will continue to be deductible. This is because the expenditure cannot be said to further or be directly related to the illegal activity. The expenditure is too remote to the illegal activity. Schedule 4 will include copyright in a film in the general effective life depreciation of the uniform capital allowances provisions. Under effective life depreciation, taxpayers will have a choice of using the Commissioner of Taxation's safe harbour effective life determination or self-assess the effective life of their copyright in a film. They will also be able to choose between the diminishing value method and the prime cost method when depreciating their asset. These amendments will apply to a copyright in a film acquired on or after 1 July 2004. Schedule 5 provides tax relief, in certain circumstances, for employees who participate in employee share schemes. When an employee is issued new shares or rights as the result of a corporate restructure or 100 per cent takeover, they will now be able to treat their new shares or rights as a continuation of their old shares or rights. This ensures that a taxing point does not arise for employee share scheme participants in the event of a corporate restructure. It also ensures continuity of treatment for capital gains tax purposes. In this manner, the amendments further support the development of employee share schemes and the alignment of employer and employee interests. Schedule 6 provides relief for employers who may potentially have to make a double payment of superannuation contributions. Currently, employers who make a late contribution to a superannuation fund may be required to pay this amount again as part of the superannuation guarantee charge payable to the Australian Taxation Office. This charge includes the full amount of any shortfall, even though a contribution relating to the relevant period had subsequently been paid into an employee's superannuation fund or retirement savings account by the employer. These amendments will allow late employer superannuation contributions, which have been made for an employee to a superannuation provider within a month of the superannuation guarantee due date, to be used to offset the portion of any superannuation guarantee charge that relates to that employee for the quarter. To ensure there continues to be a strong incentive for employers to make superannuation guarantee payments by the due date, late payments will not be tax deductible. Employee entitlements will not be jeopardised, as employees will still receive their full superannuation shortfall plus interest to compensate them for the late payment. These amendments will apply to late payments of contributions made on or after 1 January 2006. Schedule 7 clarifies that mandatory employer contributions under the superannuation guarantee arrangements are payable on wages or salary paid in a quarter following the termination of an employment relationship. This ensures employees do not lose their superannuation guarantee entitlements as a result of being underpaid during their employment. Full details of the measures in this bill contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend this bill and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned. NA OPPORTUNITIES BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Entsch, for Mr Macfarlane, and read a first time. Second Reading",33
8,Mr ENTSCH,ENERGY EFFICIENCY,"LeichhardtParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources) (9.59 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 is to establish the mandatory energy efficiency opportunities assessments announced in the government's energy white paper Securing Australia's energy future in June 2004. The bill establishes the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program, outlines the broad obligations imposed on large energy using businesses, and allows for regulation making to provide detailed requirements for assessment, reporting and verification, and other elements of the program. Energy Efficiency Opportunities will require large energy using businesses to assess the potential to improve their energy efficiency and report publicly on the outcomes. The energy white paper identified the improvement of Australia's energy efficiency performance as a key part of the government's energy policy in order to achieve greater prosperity, sustainability and energy security. EEO takes its place alongside a range of measures to pursue the benefits of using enare ergy more efficiently-energy market reform, solar cities, improved appliance and building standards and targets for reduced energy use in government agencies. The broad range of energy efficiency measures announced in the energy white paper has the potential to increase economic welfare and lower the rate of growth in greenhouse emissions. Improved energy efficiency reduces overall demand for energy and will also delay the need for new energy generation equipment. Energy Efficiency Opportunities could deliver as much as $975 million even if only half of them were taken up. The EEO measure is directed at increasing the uptake of commercially attractive energy efficiency opportunities in end-use energy in the industrial, resources, transport and commercial sectors. It will be targeted at Australia's largest energy users-those businesses using more than half a petajoule of energy per year. Half a petajoule would be regarded as a large amount, being equal to the electricity needs of 10,000 Australian households and costing over $5 million. The energy white paper estimated that up to 250 companies each use more than half a petajoule of energy per year in Australia. Together, these large energy using companies account for 60 per cent of total business energy use in Australia. Improvements in energy use in the business sector will have significant potential to improve Australia's energy and environmental performance, as well as that of individual firms. Australia's energy efficiency is not improving as quickly as that of other countries. The energy white paper recognised that lagging energy efficiency in Australia could be for a number of reasons. These include information failures and organisational barriers, which work against businesses being able to properly identify, assess and implement what would otherwise be privately cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities. To facilitate the uptake of these opportunities, the government announced in the white paper that it will require large energy users undertake rigorous and comprehensive assessments of energy efficiency opportunities every five years starting in 2006 but that commercial judgments by firms will determine whether investments are pursued. The white paper announced that businesses would publicly report the outcomes of their assessments. This approach ensures that all large energy users will be able to demonstrate to the community that they are efficiently managing their energy, without the government becoming involved in commercial decisions. Public reporting will be designed to provide the public with useful information while protecting a firm's reasonable commercial interests. From 2006, if a business uses over 0.5 petajoules in a year within its corporate group, it will be required to register under the program. Once registered, it will have to prepare an assessment plan that spells out how it is going to assess the various parts of its business over the five-year program cycle. In line with its plan, the business will have to undertake assessments of the energy use of various operations and to identify costeffective opportunities to more efficiently use energy. The business may wish to plan to do this in stages, to assess different operations in different years instead of assessing all parts of its operations in a single year. For example, a corporation may wish to focus on its coal mining operations in one year and on transport or commercial retailing parts of its business in other years. The business will then be required to publicly report on the results of these assessments and to include its responses to the opportunities identified in the assessments. The firm will be free to make decisions on the opportunities identified as part of its normal business decision-making processes. The government is working closely with to industry and state and territory agencies to maximise energy savings for minimal additional regulatory burden. Some state and territory governments already require businesses to monitor energy. Some businesses already have systematic energy management in place, undertake energy assessments and report on energy management as part of sustainability reporting. We will ensure that this measure is flexible enough to enable activities that already comply with the EEO to be recognised and minimise the burden placed on businesses. Stakeholders are involved in intensive and continuing consultations to develop the program. This will ensure that businesses are fully informed about their obligations and are confident that the program is practical and designed to fit their business processes. The government is working with industry and other expertise to build on the best of what works for business in identifying significant energy savings. The government will continue to work closely with industry leaders to develop guidelines, materials, training and support to undertake effective assessments. Recognising and learning from leading companies and their innovative approaches to identifying and implementing energy savings will be an important strategy for achieving a step change in Australian industry's energy efficiency performance.

9,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (10.07 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Office replacement of the Bureau of Meteorology at Willis Island, Coral Sea, Queensland. The Bureau of Meteorology proposes to demolish and replace the meteorological office and staff facilities at Willis Island, which is located 250 nautical miles, or approximately 450 kilometres, east of Cairns. The current estimated cost of the construction is $7.691 million, and a further $1.2 million will be needed for re-equipment. In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The bureau accepts and will implement these recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is planned that work will commence as soon as possible and be completed by the end of the year. I thank the committee for its work, and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Public Works Committee Reference",37
10,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (10.09 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Fitout of new leased premises for Australian Customs Service at 1010 La Trobe Street, Docklands, Melbourne. The Australian Customs Service proposes to relocate from its existing Melbourne headquarters building shortly before the end of the current lease, which expires on 31 May 2007. Construction work on the new building, known as the Port 1010 Building, comthe menced in June this year, and Customs proposes to undertake a fit-out of these new leased premises. The proposed fit-out is estimated to cost $12.5 million, inclusive of GST. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out and associated installation of services will, to the maximum extent possible, be integrated with the base building construction in order to reduce costs. The building is planned for completion in December 2006, and Customs anticipates occupying the building progressively throughout February and March 2007. I commend the motion to the House.

11,Mr FITZGIBBON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Every member of this House will be acutely conscious of the crisis we had in this country a few years ago when community based groups in all of our electorates were struggling to secure the insurance necessary to continue with their very good community work. I certainly had a number of them in my electorate. I recall one particular group in Singleton raising money for victims of cancer. They had been running a street stall of sorts in Singleton for many years, raising significant funds for that very worthy cause. On this occasion-I think it was two years ago-that street fair was at very great risk. It looked if it would have to be called off because of course, understandably and responsibly, they were not prepared to go ahead with the street stall without appropriate insurance cover. Thankfully, on that occasion Hunter Health, now Hunter New England Health, came to the rescue and managed to put the fundraising activity under the umbrella of Hunter Health's insurance cover, so that was a good news story. But there have been many others I recall, also in my electorate. The Richmond Vale historic railway, which had been doing very good work for many years, had volunteers putting old locomotives back together in wonderful style and providing historic train rides for both locals and tourists. In doing so, they were making a significant contribution to the Hunter's economy, diversifying our tourism base and doing very good work. That closed down as a result of that organisation's inability to secure insurance. I have a very good organisation now operating in my electorate known as the Cessnock Woodturners-an organisation I suspected might have three members, but I was surprised to learn that they have 70 members. These are mainly retired men who are looking to perpetuate their trade and who do so in a very good way. More importantly, this group of men help dementia patients in the local nursing home by giving them hands-on activities, which I understand are very good for them in a medical sense. In addition, they take high school students, largely students with learning difficulties, and they give them something to do that they are really interested in-that is, working with their hands and learning a trade rather than sitting in the classroom struggling with academic work that realistically is never going to be of any real benefit to them. These are the sorts of organisations which as were under threat as a result of their inability to secure insurance cover. Appropriately, the Commonwealth and the states got together and discussed ways of overcoming these significant problems. The states agreed to reform their tort laws to restrict payouts for damages in circumstances where someone has been injured by the actions of a community based group. Effectively, they cut payouts so that insurance cover became less expensive. As a consequence of this, the Commonwealth decided that amendments to the Trade Practices Act would be necessary to prevent people from forum shopping-that is, turning away from the state based tort law and shopping around for a statute that might provide them with more generous compensation. There was concern that they might look to part V of the Trade Practices Act to secure those more generous compensation payments. The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004 is about bringing the Trade Practices Act into line with state based tort law to prevent that forum shopping. Key provisions of part V, division 1 are included in sections 52 and 53. Section 52 prohibits corporations from engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct, and section 53 prohibits false representations that goods or services are of a particular standard, ity or grade. The government argues that these reforms are necessary to support state and territory tort law reforms which were introduced in response to the rapid increases in public liability insurance. The government has also argued that the removal of the right to seek damages under the Trade Practices Act will not adversely affect consumers because they can still seek damages for negligence under state law. Labor does have some concerns in this area. We have to be clear: although the national model applied to capping common law damages by statute, this bill seeks to go an extra step and totally removes the cause of action under section 52. It removes the protection in the act against deceptive and misleading conduct. It is a different and more radical statutory model. When this matter was first presented to the parliament, Labor had concerns about this approach and sought to have the matter considered by a Senate committee. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee was presented with a number of scenarios where consumers would have no remedy available to them if the bill were passed in its current form, as actions in ligence would either be unavailable or face very high evidentiary burdens. Labor's position is that the bill carries the danger of undermining the culture of care that has developed in Australia since the enactment of the Trade Practices Act and may consequently expose consumers to a greater risk of injury. The Law Council noted the positive effect of the cause of action in the Trade Practices Act. In its evidence to the committee, the Law Council said: On the whole, I would say that it has led to general improvements and one should be loath to go down a path of in a wholesale way taking out whole areas of action. In its submission to the original Ipp review, qualthe ACCC strongly opposed amending the Trade Practices Act to remove liability for personal injury. The ACCC's argument was based principally on literature known as the ‘economics of accidents'. Simply stated, this work suggests that liability for the cost of accidents should be assigned to the party that could most easily and cheaply take the actions needed to minimise the risk of an accident. Some significant points made by the ACCC include the following. Firstly, section 52 of the TPA provides an important incentive for business to behave fairly and to have regard for consumers' safety. Without the availability of this important remedy, the standard of behaviour that consumers are entitled to expect may break down. This is very significant. Secondly, limiting the scope of part V is economically inefficient in that it forces consumers to incur greater search costs to determine which suppliers are reliable. Thirdly, such a limitation also undermines the competitive process by allowing firms that engage in misleading and deceptive practices to win customers at the expense of those who do not. Fundamentally there is no reason to exneg- cuse companies that engage in misleading and deceptive conduct which causes personal injury or death as a consequence of their action, so the opposition sees that the retention of the cause of action under section 52 does have merit. However, at this point it is also worth addressing another major consideration in the framing of this bill: the concern about forum shopping. Forum shopping is where a plaintiff or their solicitor, faced tougher laws, seeks to craft their actions so they fall within the current provisions of the Trade Practices Act and to avoid restrictions imposed under state and territory tort law. Labor does not share this concern about forum shopping. This is a situation where one can see the phenomenon sometimes labelled as ‘the cult of experts'. Professional trade practices lawyers who are concerned about these issues seek a theoretically ideal outcome from the perspective of the legal practitioner. But Labor's concern is more practical. We support the rights of persons who have suffered injury and we support the claims of those related to those who have died as a result of misleading and deceptive behaviour. We are reluctant to allow the elimination of the basic rights of persons to legal compensation for such abuses in order to deal with the theoretical concerns of legal experts. We tend to be swayed more by social justice concerns than by the desire for trade practices professionals to eliminate perceived concerns about forum shopping, which seem to have no actual empirical evidence to support them. The Ipp review, Treasury and the Insurance Council of Australia place much emphasis on the fact that section 52 of the a strict liability provision. This means that the intent of a company that misleads and deceives is not relevant in determining liability under the act. They argue that it is easier to bring an action under the TPA as there is no requirement to prove fault as is required in negligence cases. The fact is that section 52 of the Trade Practices Act has been a strict liability provision since 1974. The Law Council stated that, if it were significantly easier to bring an action for personal injury than for negligence under section 52, it would have been used in many more cases. In short, there is no evidence that forum shopping is currently occurring nor that the with state and territory reforms make it more likely. I seek the House's indulgence to make some comments on the Assistant Treasurer's second reading speech of 9 December 2004. It appears the minister has made some embarrassing errors in his speech, and they should be noted. On this side of the House, such errors are now so commonplace that we affectionately refer to them as ‘Brough-ups'. Although we keep a ledger of them, it is becoming arduous work as they grow in number. In the second reading speech, and I quote from Hansard, the minister stated: The bill effectively gives an opportunity to the legal profession to jump from state to federal jurisdictions and, in doing so, circumvent the very purpose of tort law reform. I think the minister was a little confused. Was he proposing a bill to the House that would have had that effect? His words suggest as much, but that could not, I trust, have been his intention. Rather, he must have meant to say that he believes the current act, not the bill, may lead to forum shopping, as he does not support forum shopping. Of course, even with the correction, the argument fails, as forum shopping is not a real concern in this instance. I invite Minister act is Brough to correct the ‘Brough-up' and change his statement in the Hansard. I began by saying that this bill was developed to address some very real concerns in our community. Those concerns were largely brought on by the collapse of HIH and other matters. They were very real concerns that needed addressing. The states have acted appropriately, and the tort law reforms have proved efficient and have offered relief to community based groups. Labor are effectively saying that we agree that there is some risk of forum shopping but, again, we do not see any real evidence of that. We will support real and meaningful reforms to address those concerns, but we still fear that this bill goes a step too far.",38
12,Mr TUCKEY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (10.23 am)The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004 is one of the final building blocks-to the great credit of state and federal parliaments-in preventing the rush of Australia towards an American litigation system. It is litigation that, in case, just transfers the costs to someone else. On a recent trip to America with my wife, she got the flu and it turned into pneumonia. We had to go to an American medical clinic, which, contrary to many of the comments made in this place from time to time, seemed to work very well. Later on at the clinic, I watched local elderly people getting their prescriptions for $10. We paid substantially more than that. The interesting point to me was that the doctor who attended my wife made a virtually immediate and very accurate diagnosis of her condition but was obliged by their system to send her downstairs for an X-ray, which exactly confirmed his diagnosis. Why do they do that in America? Why does the cost have to multiply with pathological tests and every other thing? Because ambulance chasing is a substantial part of the American system and a doctor cannot afford to make a diagnosis based on his own skills without taking every other practical measure to confirm it. They have to do that, and there are huge costs to the general community as a result. Friedman, an eminent economist, said that there is no such thing as a free lunch. We have this wonderful myth that some people, particularly their legal representatives, are entitled to extract money from the system. That then has to be paid for by everyone else, to the extent-as we discovered in Australia-that our wonderful volunteer and social organisations have virtually had to close down. Not only could they not raise the cost of the cover, if it were available, but the volunteers concerned-people who work for nothing-were not prepared to be put under attack by the ambulance chasers of the legal profession. Previously, I have drawn to the attention of this House the evidence of a film starring Julia Roberts-I did not bother to see it. She every was a heroine of the legal profession who saved a town; I think the character had a southern European type name. She battled and fought for these poor people and saved the community. Her legal firm took $40 million out of that case and she got $3 million. That is some degree of altruism! It was a historic case, and Australia was going down that road. The other day, I saw that a floor once applicable to bar chambers in Sydney sold for $500,000. Why? It is because, since the collapse of ambulance chasing in Australia, no-one can afford to pay the rent. That is a great outcome. Contrary to these people who stand up and say, ‘These individuals have rights,' I think it is disgraceful. They turn their ankle-as a woman did in Perth while training some kids in hockey-and get $40,000. Where does that money come from? It comes from the local council. Who funds that? The people do. We have this myth that money materialises and rains down from the sky into the pockets of someone who frequently has not suffered any serious injury and does not need financial assistance. Their medical costs and other matters, even lost employment, are covered by the welfare system of Australia, and that is the right place for it. In general terms, I am delighted to think that we have cut off another avenue, and by a most professional process. Four eminent Australians were requested by this government and state governments to look into this. I frequently have a few words of criticism to say about certain state governments, but on this occasion Bob Carr led the way-of course New South Wales had the biggest problem. These eminent Australians-Justice David Ipp, Professor Peter Cane, Associate Professor Donald Sheldon and Mr Ian Macintosh-looked into this problem. One of their recommendationsrecommendation 19-was that the Trade Practices Act be amended to prevent individuals bringing actions for damages for personal injury or death under the misleading and deceptive conduct and other unfair practices provision of part V, division 1. Recommendation 20 recommends that the act be amended to remove the power of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission-the ACCC-to bring representative actions for damages for a person's injury or death resulting from contraventions of part V, division 1. In general terms, this legislation responds to that recommendation-a recommendation taken by people in the legal profession to prevent an improper use of legislation designed for quite different purposes. Consequently it has my full endorsement. NA",41
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"With the indulgence of the honourable member for O'Connor, can I ask the Deputy Clerk to pause the speech clock.

NA (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed.",42
14,Mr TUCKEY,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I will add to your remarks; I am very glad to see Garry. We all get withdrawal symptoms from this place, and no doubt he has come back for a bit of a fix! I will return to my speech in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004. The whole system, of which I have had some fairly significant words to say already, was quite embarrassing to me. It goes further than just a simple culture of some sections of our community seeing an opportunity for profit and portraying it as not having an effect on the rest of the community. As I said, on this occasion it wiped out hundreds, if not thousands, of our volunteer organisations. A group of pensioners came to me to say that they could no longer afford to operate their support system for other pensioners, simply because of the issues that had arisen with public liability. Small businesses' premiums jumped from hundreds to thousands of dollars, and for what purpose? In many cases, they had never had a claim. I find it quite amazing: we read just the other day that apparently there is still a niche market for the ambulance chasers, and that is in the medical profession. Again, we wonder why, all of a sudden, the consultation fee at a GP's surgery jumped 50 per cent across the board. It did so because these people were suddenly obliged to pay these massive premiums, and, in some areas, they just abandoned it. The reality was that it was supposed to do with negligence. In medical practice, if there is substantial evidence of negligence why can an insurance company settle a claim? The affected parties might, for instance, have lost a child at birth, so what the money going to do for them? More particularly, if a case of severe negligence is established, surely using the licensing regime for medical practitioners is the appropriate response. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, Queensland has a bit of a discussion going on about that at the moment. If the fellow had not escaped the country, would everybody be saying, ‘Don't worry about taking his job off him; just let him carry on, as long as everybody gets paid'? What an illogical position, and why, in so many of these circumstances, is money the solution? I have stood in this House and talked about asbestos in that regard. I can differentiate between ambulance chasing and somebody losing their life through the negligence of an employer or somebody else if they have dependants or a situation of dependency is arising; as I have already said, we have a lot of provisions in our welfare state to address those circumstances. Sometimes I think that maybe there could be less money for that sort of workers compensation situation, and better welfare outcomes. I remember visiting a hospital where there was a training scheme to teach paraplegics to drive. One fellow there was clearly disadvantaged compared with the rest, because he had fallen off the roof of his own house and injured himself. Why is there a difference? Clearly the welfare system had to look after him, and it was a bit inadequate, in my view; everybody else looked pretty good. So why not rely on the welfare system in these cases? I think the words ‘minimising risk' were used by the previous speaker, and I wrote ‘cost'. When someone goes and buys something in Australia, the provider of those goods, whether they be a wholesaler, a manufacturer or a primary producer, expects to get paid according to their costs. If, as we now find with the wool industry in severe is trouble in Australia, we have OH&S people running around every shearing shed in Australia demanding upgrades for tens of thousands of dollars, which usually results in the farmer selling his entire merino stock and buying some meat variety or South African goats or something, the reality is that the cost must transfer to the woollen jumper; it must transfer along the line. Of course, wool producers do not have the luxury of just adding a few cents or a few dollars, so they go out of business and the cost is then in other people's jobs. You cannot get a free lunch. In our society costs get transferred, and consequently this measure is one that is going to cut off another avenue of dumping costs on the ordinary citizens of Australia by the abuse of a piece of legislation never designed to line up with tort law, where the basic opportunity for these actions exists. There is no doubt about it. Compensation should have strict rules as to what and where, and should only be paid where there is a cash cost. Money does not change such things as pain and suffering. I limp around this place because I tried knocking down trees with a Lamborghini in 1976. If someone had given me $100,000 at the time, my leg would still be just as sore today as it was then. So what has $100,000 got to do with it? I got good medical treatment at the time and I am still here-and I am pleased about that. This legislation is back for the second time. I appreciate that the opposition seem to have indicated they will not oppose italthough that has become academic. The opposition opposed the bill previously. I wonder who their opposition to the bill was supposed to assist. It certainly would not have assisted the general public. It would not have assisted the volunteer groups of Australia, who were wiped out when Australia became addicted to ambulance chasing. It could only have assisted those sections of the legal profession who have made ambulance chasing a culture and a career, and that is wrong. It silly concept. There are better responses to negligence-be it in the medical profession or in the workplace. The issue of self-reliance is a factor these matters. I made some comments about people still being in New Orleans when there was clear evidence that they should have left, and 90 per cent of the large amount of correspondence I received said, ‘We're glad someone said it at last.' A person writing to the West Australian newspaper said, ‘Good grief! Is he next going to tell us that we should take some responsibility for ourselves?' I am saying that now. If you are in a workplace, the first thing you should do is be careful. You have a personal responsibility. Danger is to be found on a crosswalk, notwithstanding that it has been painted on the road and everyone knows the rules. It is little help to you if you take a risk on that crosswalk when a car seems to be approaching at above the speed at which it can stop. It is a good idea to get off the road, because I can tell you what-the car is going to win. Some people think that if you get knocked down on a crosswalk you will get a heap of money. I know what I would prefer. In other words, as we were taught at school: look to the left and look to the right, whether it is a crosswalk or otherwise. Similarly, when my father taught me to drive, he said: ‘Never, ever anticipate that the other fellow is going to stop. Take care.' He gave back his licence when he turned 83 because he was involved in a minor accident. I said to him: ‘But the other fellow was wrong,' and he said, ‘No-I didn't see him. I have ceased to be a competent driver.' I make those points because I think they have relevance. People should take responsibility for themselves. That should be the culture in Australia. It certainly used to be. In regard to actions brought through tort law and the capping of claims, earlier I made is a remarks about the American medical system. During the period when I was the shadow minister for health I read about the system in America and the huge cost it is to the comin all munity. Two American states capped claims-as has now occurred in Australiaand have seen a dramatic reduction in the health costs to their community. Why? Because the medical profession no longer has to do as I explained, and order 25 pathological tests to make sure that the ambulance chasers could not contact people and say there was some negligence. Most of the tests were unnecessary. The medical practitioner had the skills in 999,000 cases out of a million to make a decision without the support of those tests, but the system had created a circumstance where they could not afford not to order the tests. Who ended up bearing those costs? They came out of the pockets of the patients who attend the surgeries, because of the fees charged-or, if the government was involved, they came from the pockets of the taxpayer. Our health minister reported the other day that the cost to the government of our health system is some $20 billion. That is a lot of money. It does not materialise out of thin air; it has to be contributed through the tax system. We should not add unnecessary cost to that system because a small section of the community sees a profit to be made in circumstances where no financial assistance is really needed.",42
15,Mr KERR,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004 is appalling, it is ill-conceived and it fails to address the substantial issues that this parliament and the community ought to be concerned about. The member for O'Connor has, quite rightly, pointed out some of the anomalies that exist with respect to the way we deal with people in our community who suffer accident and loss. If we were serious about addressing those matters in a rational and coherent way, we would revisit the proposal first put forward and passed by this parliament in the mid-1970s for the introduction of a national compensation scheme so that there would be no recourse to law and so that any person injured, whether by way of an injury at home or on the roads or at work, would be entitled to their injury being compensated and their medical treatment being provided for. But we never pursued that course. It is a course that has been pursued in New Zealand and it works effectively. A number of the anomalies that were present in that scheme when it was first introduced have been ironed out. But, essentially, it provides a safety net, which does not benefit the so called rapacious lawyers, which does enable any person who suffers serious loss by way of physical injury to be properly rehabilitated, and which does make sure that they are not in a position of impecuniosity as a result. The present system is completely bizarre. It has no rational and coherent underpinning. A person who is injured in the workplace is entitled to compensation under the various state workers compensation regimes. The measure of damages and the treatment regime differ from those that apply should they be injured in a motor vehicle, where there is a compulsory third-party insurer. A person injured in other environments may have the availability of damages should they be able to establish fault under various regimes relatinto ing to negligence, but a person who is injured in the home or in some other place where fault cannot be attributed must suffer that consequence without the availability of any assistance, other than the most miserable of support through the provisions that are made for very minimal welfare payments. This results in an absurd situation whereby a person who has suffered a serious, debilitating injury has many different kinds of measures of damages depending on the circumstances and the place of that losswhether they are travelling to and from work under a workers compensation regime, whether they are a passenger in a motor vehicle, whether they were injured as part of some voluntary activity which they were undertaking or whether there was some fault. It leads, of course, to people who are seriously injured having to create arguments in relation to fault. Not unsurprisingly, sometimes those are contentious. For example, the instance of a man who dived and became paraplegic by striking his head on a sandbar has often been the subject of discussion in this context, but his injuries were just as debilitating as if they had occurred at work. We do not have a consistent regime and so it lends itself to very proper criticism. An appropriate response for us as parliamentarians is to look to measures which would establish a national compensation scheme and to have a process that is immune from the kinds of differentiation and abuses that are inherent in these very narrowly defined circumstances in which injury is recompensed in some instances but not at all in others. Former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam says in his reflections on his period in government that his greatest regret was that that particular legislation was not implemented; it was passed by the parliament but not brought force by proclamation. I share with him that judgment. It was the greatest regret that I have about his period of government. There were other aspects of that government, of course, which made landmark changes-the introduction of universal health insurance and a whole range of other social initiatives which pioneered the kind of Australian community that we have inherited. Most have endured, including the trade practices legislation that is subject to amendment today, which imposes rules that ensure competition between private sector enterprises, which governs false and misleading advertising and the like, and which makes certain that we have a competitive and open free market where abuses of monopoly are restrained and the like. The most significant legislative initiative, however, that was not implemented in that period was the scheme for a national insurance program, which would have dealt with all of these kinds of abuses that people refer to. I will come to the particular provisions in this legislation. A period where insurance premiums increased dramatically was behind it. You do not require a degree in economics to understand why that occurred. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and every member of this House will recall that at that time there were two major events: firstly, the domestic collapse of HIH, the largest insurer in this try, a matter whereby the insurance market in this country was dramatically affected; and, secondly, planes flying into the twin towers in the United States. All of a sudden, risk premiums, which were already under pressure because of a cyclical change in the insurance market, spiked upwards. Oddly, the HIH collapse gave an opportunity to the insurance industry, which it took, which it had never previously been able to take advantage of. It had to shift the blame from what was a catastrophe of economic management in terms of the internal management of HIH, which our regulators had not detected or addressed; it had to address the increased premiums in public risk liability that would come from the potential impact of terrorist activities; and it also had deal with the poor investment climate where investment insurance companies and the fragility of the reinsurance market-particularly in the United Kingdom through various weaknesses in that reinsurance market, particularly through Lloyds-had been identified. There had to be a point at which blame could be attributed elsewhere. Who got the blame? Suddenly the victims became the people responsible for the crisis in insurance premiums. Those who had suffered injurythe victims of physical injury-and their ‘rapacious' lawyers would be identified as the cause of the spike in insurance premiums. How this was solved still puzzles me. We transferred accountability and responsibility from a collapse of the major domestic insurer in Australia, HIH, and the poor prudential oversight of that. We had the increased risk that necessarily flowed from September 11 and the planes crashing into the twin towers; the problems of reinsurance and the reinsurance market in London; and the poor investment climate which was making insurance in Australia a less profitable business investcoun- ment. Suddenly, somehow, this was translated into responsibility going to those who have suffered injury. It was a ‘blame the victim' response which was accepted not only by parliamentarians in this federal parliament but, to my great regret, by some of the state premiers and my state parliamentary colleagues in the various jurisdictions around Australia. The trigger for this legislation is the Ipp report. The Ipp report was commissioned by this government to respond to very legitimate concerns about increasing premiums, particularly in the area of community activities. Let me say bluntly that I believe this was a constructed crisis. Let me say quite bluntly that I believe that the insurance industry knowingly, wilfully, wrongfully and to corruptly increased its premiums in relation to community organisations which had no risk profile and many of which had had no claims. As the member for O'Connor pointed out, even in relation to small businesses, many of those organisations with no claim history whatsoever were struck by premium increases from minimal amounts to very large amounts, putting them on the threshold of going out of business and creating a climate which demanded responses from parliamentarians to actually do something to cap liability. How did we respond? In a Pavlovian manner. We set up an inquiry whose terms of reference were directed to getting the outcome that the insurance industry was constructing, that it wished to have effected. It was a bit like Alice in Wonderland and the Red Queen: first we will have the verdict; then we will consider the evidence. Let me look at the terms of reference for the Ipp report. The terms of reference for the Ipp report demanded that the judge conduct the inquiry according to the following framework. This is what the terms of reference actually said: It is desirable to examine a method for the of the common law with the objective of limiting liability and quantum of damages arising from personal injury and death. So the judge was given a directive to report on how that could be achieved rather than examining the wisdom of achieving it. It was a matter of first giving the verdict and then giving the reasons. The reasons would never have sustained the conclusions that were drawn. The reasons for the increased spike in those premiums were self-evident, but no attention was to be directed to them. Instead, the burden would fall on those who had suffered catastrophic or near-catastrophic injury. Their benefits, after they had suffered an injury, would be the subject of capping, and we would remove entitlement for compensation for matters where the injury was of a so called ‘minor' nature. What was the actual impact subsequently? The working through of this has been horrific. There are people whose lives have been shattered but who, because of the method by which the exclusion from an entitlement to pursue damages at common law has been worked out in the various state regimes which have been subjected to the Ipp report through the advocacy of this federal government, cannot even establish an entitlement to compensation. The member for O'Connor made a point about taking some personal responsibility. Of course we should all take personal responsibility. But he drew attention, for example, to the medical negligence matters that are now the subject of enormous controversy in Queensland. He said that no amount of money was ever going to compensate those people and that the real response was to punish the errant doctor-or supposedly errant doctor; I must give him the benefit of the doubt, although it appears pretty plain that he was ill equipped to undertake the surgical reform tasks that he was charged with-who is now in the United States. Let us get real about this process. The criminal punishment of that doctor, if he ever is extradited to Australia, will never restore the health of the patients who went to him in good faith. What are you supposed to do? What is the so-called exercise of personal responsibility? Aren't you entitled to go to a hospital anywhere in Australia and expect a standard of medical practice by a reasonably competent medical practitioner? Is each of us instead supposed to make some sort of individual assessment about the competence and professional capacity of a person held out by a health service to offer medical services? And if we do suffer liability and injury as a consequence, are we to be held from our full measure of damages, if our lives have been ruined, because of a capping regime which, after a Red Queen piece of investigation whose terms of reference were stacked so as to exclude consideration of the real reason for the increases in liability, has been put place in response to an enormously orchestrated campaign by the insurance industry to increase its profit levels back to where it lieves they should be. This is disgraceful legislation. This is fensive to the way in which we as parliamentarians should behave. And it extends outside this House. It extends, sadly, to my state partions liamentary colleagues of all party persuasions who have gone along with it. It is not altogether a case that the Trade Practices regime is at the centre of these particular debates. The liability provisions that we are discussing today are in the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act. They cover a whole range of matters in which we enable people to recover their full measure of damages if they suffer economic loss. So if you suffer economic loss as a result of a violation of these laws, no matter how great your loss is, if you are affected in business, you can recover all your losses; but if you are a small punter and you lose your leg or you are paraplegic as lation of these provisions, we are now going to pass a law that says you cannot even use these provisions. What kind of social conscience or framework of justice does this represent? What kind of nonsense? Wrong as it would be if the sole response had been to pick up the state capping regimes and apply those to the Trade Practices Act, which is another provision that I understand this government is pursuing in bill No. 2, it would not be as offensive as thiswhich is to exclude the capacity for pursuing remedies where the consequence of the breach is not economic loss but actual physical loss. How absurd. One of the great advances that we have seen in the laws of negligence, which impute responsibility where fault is attributable to industry, to corporations and to individuals, in is that it does lead people to exercise some foresight as to their own behaviour. None of us ever likes being sued, and a regime that beattributes these consequences has led to improvements in consumer safety outcomes, in ofstandards of workplace safety, in automobile safety and the like. Removing the strictures, reducing the economic costs to those violaand not paying out the full cost of those things to the people who are injured as a consequence is a violation of that and will lead to increasing indifference to the full cost that a company participating in the market should pay for the consequences of their behaviour. What we have to be careful about is rolling back what has been a method of risk sharing. (Extension of time granted) In conclusion I return to my initial premise, which is that we ought to get away from the situation where people who suffer catastrophic injury are compensated differentially as a consequence of how and where they are injured and we ought to reintroduce consideration of a simple, national no-fault coma result of a viopensation scheme.",44
16,Mr ROBB,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I rise today to strongly support the passage of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004. The bill seeks to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974. These amendments are based on recommendations made by the Ipp review into the law of negligence. In 2002, in response to rising public liability insurance premiums, which were impacting in a hugely negative way on small businesses, recreational facilities, small clubs and community organisations, the state and the territory governments met together with the federal government to jointly discuss the best response to what the media had dubbed the public liability insurance crisis. There has been a desperate need to restore balance in relation to claims relating to personal injuries, a balance between taking personal responsibility for our own actions and negligence in the case of accident and loss. We have just heard what I find to be an extraordinary and unfortunately misguided contribution from the member for Denison. I can only say thank goodness that his state colleagues, the Labor state governments around the country and in the territories, and the federal government, do not agree with him. If the prescription being presented by the member for Denison were followed by the state and federal governments it would have led very quickly to a very serious breakdown of his community, of all our communities. The very fabric of volunteer organisation was being seriously eroded and under serious attack by this insurance crisis. The member for Denison suggested that it was due largely to spiking insurance premiums that grew out of the HIH and 9/11 incidents. The member for Denison claimed it was a crisis constructed by the insurance industry. This is not so. It is a crisis that grew out of a cultural change that has been taking place within our courts over many years. Where has the member for Denison been over the last 15 or 20 years? We have had a continuously growing culture of avoiding responsibility for personal actions, aided and abetted by some rapacious lawyers and some compliant courts. This community attitude has, in an insidious way, grown over 15 or 20 years. It has manifested itself in this instance in seriously high insurance premiums being applied to very many organisations that were unable to afford them. Failure to restore balance in this area would have meant the winding up of a very large number of activities that are fundamental to our way of life, because of the exponential impact on the cost of insurance claims and, in turn, on the cost of insurance premiums. Even further, in numerous cases, because of the costs and risks associated with many personal injury claims, insurance companies were starting to make insurance unavailable to many organisations within our community. In other words, small pony clubs, sporting operations and many other activities that are an intrinsic part of our community were being denied insurancethey had to go bare-and in most cases they had to stop their activities. This was a crisis of major proportions. Underpinning this crisis has been a cultural change, with a shift in personal responsibility. Many in the community, wittingly or unwittingly, in an insidious way, have begun to look to blame somebody else for activities or misfortunes that might befall them. In this instance, something has had to be done to get balance and common sense back into this area of activity. A panel consisting of the Hon. Justice David Ipp, Professor Peter Cane, Associate Professor Don Sheldon and Mr Ian Macintosh was assembled to look into three things: firstly, the application, effectiveness and operation of the common-law principles of negligence to limit liability arising from personal injuries or death; secondly, a principled option to limit liability and quantum of awards for damages; and, thirdly, options to limit claims for negligence to within three years of the date of the event. In addition, the panel was asked to consider the interaction of the Trade Practices Act 1974 with common-law negligence claims. The review also considered options to amend the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals from commencing actions with reliance on the Trade Practices Act in order to circumvent changes to the common law passed by the statesand the bill before us today does just that. It is required so that normal action that would be taken through the states-action that people cannot avoid as a result of legislative changes made by the states in relation to caps and other things-cannot be circumvented by using the Trade Practices Act. It is a complementary piece of legislation to assist in restoring that balance I spoke of lier. It is these amendments that are the subject of the bill before the House today. One of the key concerns of the panel was that, following reforms to state and territory tort law, the Trade Practices Act would allow plaintiffs to circumvent the tighter laws of a common-law action in negligence and pursue actions under the Trade Practices Act. If plaintiffs were able to engage in forum shopping, the underlying purpose of the reforms-to rein in damages awards and restore a balance to the public liability insurance crisis-would be undermined. This is an important piece of legislation to stop such forum shopping. This bill implements recommendations 19 and 20 of the review, which relate particularly to the operation of part V division 1 of the act. Recommendation 19 found that the Trade Practices Act should be amended to prevent individuals from bringing actions for damages for personal injury and death under part V division 1 of the act. It should be noted that personal injury is distinct from other types of injury, such as injury to property. Recommendation 20 advised that the Trade Practices Act should be amended to remove the power of the Australian Competition and Consumer Council to bring representative actions for damages for personal injury and death resulting from contraventions of part V division 1. Part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act contains consumer protection provisions, such as protection from misleading and deceptive conduct or unfair conduct. In particular, section 52 of the Trade Pracprovides tices Act provides that a corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. Section 82 of the Trade Practices Act provides that a person who suffers loss as a consequence of the contraear- vention of section 52 can recover damages for that loss. Schedule 1 to this bill amends section 82 of the Trade Practices Act by inserting two new subsections. Subsection 82(1AAA) will be amended to prevent a person from taking civil action to recover damages from another person for loss or damage to the extent to which that action would be based on a contravention of part V division 1 and where the loss or damage relates to death or personal injury. Actions in respect of death or personal injury arising from smoking or tobacco related injuries are exempt from the operation of this section. Subsection 82(1AAB) will amend the ability of plaintiffs to launch an action under the Trade Practices Act for smoking or tobacco related injuries. When this legislation was first introduced, one of the issues raised by members opposite and the opposition and minor parties in the Senate was that this could damage the ability of tobacco litigants to receive damages payouts. This concern has been taken into account and the legislation has been amended to reflect those concerns, while still maintaining the necessary balance in the whole area of insurance. People pursuing an action under part V division 1 for smoking related injuries are exempt from section 82(1AAA); however, section 82(1AAB) will mean that these actions will now be subject to division 2 and division 7 of part VIB of the act. Division 2 of part VIB of the Trade Practices Act relates to the limitation periods within which someone is able to pursue a claim for damages due to contravention of the act. This section that a court will not be able to avoid damages if proceedings are commenced by the plaintiff after the end period of three years after the date of discoverability. As such, a plaintiff in relation to a tobacco or smoking related action for damages will now have three years from the date of discoverability-meaning the date from which the personal injury or death was discovered or occurred-to commence legal proceedings. The government feels that this is a reasonable amount of time within which to commence legal proceedings. It should be stressed that the limitation is from the date discoverability-not the date on which that person started smoking, but the date on which they discovered a smoking related personal injury. Three years is ample time for plaintiffs to commence legal proceedings. Smoking related claims for damages under part V division 1 will also be limited by division 7 of part VIB in terms of the court's broad power to grant an injunction under section 80 not being extended to the awarding of damages. The concerns of the opposition in relation to people suffering from smoking or tobacco related personal injuries have been addressed, and the government believes that these measures are fair and reasonable and balance the needs of the plaintiffs with the underlying motivation of the government to restore balance to the awarding of damages. In addition to section 82 being amended, section 87 will be amended under schedule 1 of this bill. Section 87 confers on the court a wide power to make other orders if the court considers that such other orders will compensate a person who has suffered loss or damage through contravention of parts IV, IVA, IVB, V and VC of the Trade Practices Act. These new subsections will be inserted into section 87. Subsection 87(1AA) will prevent the court from making an order to compensate a person for loss or damage where that order would be based on a contravention of part V division 1 and where the damages were in compensation for a personal injury or death. Smoking or smoking related personal injuries or deaths are exempted from subsection 87(1AA). Subsection 87(1AB) will amend section 87 to ensure that any orders related to smoking or tobacco related claims for personal injury or death will be subject to a three-year limitation period, as discussed previously. Subsection 87(1AC) will ensure of that orders in respect of death or personal injury resulting from smoking or tobacco use will be subject to division 7 part VIB in relation to structured settlements. Members on the other side of the House have argued that the changes in this bill will create hardship or disadvantage plaintiffs. The government disagrees with this proposition. These changes bring the Trade Practices Act in line with state and territory legislation which is designed to achieve a balance between imposing a reasonable burden upon individuals to take care of themselves and the burden on society to take care of others. In that respect, the comments by the member for Denison on a national compensation scheme and other schemes ignore the existence of the very comprehensive welfare system that we have in this country, one which is the envy of the rest of the world. We have lots of provisions which complement the thrust of the legislation and the changes that have been moved at the state and federal levels. The Ipp review felt that in recent times the balance had been tipped too far in favour of society bearing the burden for individuals, with this imbalance leading to the insurance crisis. As I mentioned at the outset, this has been a trend over a long period of time. It is not something that has been the product of an insurance spike because of one or two events this century. It is something that has developed in an insidious way, with people increasingly starting to expect others to assume all responsibility for actions that they might take. This legislation, with the other pieces of legislation passed by the states and territories in relation to negligence, is designed to restore that balance while maintaining the rights of plaintiffs to pursue reasonable damages to compensate for personal injuries or death. The insurance liability crisis left many small businesses, particularly those in the recreation industry, and many of our volunteer organisations-the fundamental fabric of our communities-unable to pay premiums or denied insurance because of the associated risks. Many were forced to go out of business or to stop or severely constrain their activities. This caused enormous stress within small businesses and many volunteer organisations and caused upset within our communities. In addition to the businesses which suffered, local communities suffered severe hardship as a result of the crisis. Many local communities were forced to cancel long standing festivals and activities due to an inability to afford public liability insurpublic ance or, in fact, due to an inability to gain any insurance or to be offered any insurance in the first instance. The member for Hunter told stories in the House about his local football clubs and the local school eisteddfod which were forced to end because of the insurance premiums they were being forced to pay. It is absurd that, as a community, we can have school eisteddfods, local football clubs and these sorts of activities circumvented-stopped; vented-because premiums have grown to such a point. Ambulance chasers who have aided and abetted this sort of insidious cultural change have led to a situation where reasonable insurance is not available. For many community events run by volunteers and provided free of charge this has been devastating. This legislation achieves the necessary balance and ensures that the hard work undertaken by state and territory governments to reform common-law negligence laws is not undermined or circumvented by the federal Trade Practices Act. These measures should not create undue hardship. People will still have the mechanisms to pursue action for common-law negligence in the courts. They will just no longer be able to use the Trade Practices Act as a backup. I commend these measures to the House.",48
17,Mr HAYES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"For some time community groups, individuals and businesses have all expressed concern about the rising cost of public liability insurance. No doubt many members on both sides of the House have been lobbied at various times about the cost of such insurance to various community based groups that have sought to obtain public liability insurance or, more appropriately, as the member for Hunter pointed out, that have found that it is just not available to them. The problem of liability insurance premiums is one of the principal reasons that the government has brought the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004 before the parliament, but it is also a reason that I find somewhat lacking. The government has brought this bill before us on the basis of arguments that, after some closer analysis, are particularly unconvincing. The Trade Practices Act has undergone many amendments but remains an important prepiece of legislation, outlining a number of key consumer protections and governing the activities of companies and some individuals. The provisions of the act allow for: the prohibition of unfair, unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct; the right of consumers to purchase goods of acceptable or merchantable quality; consumers injured by defective goods to seek compensation for their injuries; the Commonwealth minister to set product safety and information standards; and the Commonwealth minister to ban supply of unsafe products or to order their recall. These are significant and important provisions that should not be discarded lightly. The provisions of this bill seek to remove an important provision from the Trade Practices Act. As the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer correctly noted in his second reading speech, part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act prohibits, under civil law, unfair practices, including misleading and deceptive conduct, from trade and commerce. Penalties for such actions are provided under part VC division 2 of the act. As the minister noted: The measures contained in this bill will amend the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals, and the ACCC in a representative capacity, from bringing civil actions for damages for personal injury or death resulting from contraventions of part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act. Obviously such a significant reform to the act poses the question: ‘Why?' The minister went on to explain: These reforms are aimed at limiting public liability claims costs in order to reduce pressure insurance premiums and assist in delivering affordable public liability insurance. I have no doubt that those groups and individuals who have faced considerable increases in public liability insurance premiums and those who have been unable to obtain public liability insurance at all would welcome any action to reduce the upward pressure on premiums. However, like everything that seeks to sweepingly remove important provisions in legislation, the consequences-perhaps not the immediate ones but certainly the ones in the not too distant future-also need to be taken into account. It is far too simple to say that the problem will disappear or that a solution will present itself when we simply remove sections from legislation. Often when we try to apply a quick political fix to a situation some unintended consequences are missed. Before we take action to throw the baby out with the bathwater, I think it is time for a closer examination of the issues. There is no doubt that the premiums associated with public liability insurance have been the source of much concern over recent years. We all remember the headlines about the community groups, about the local scouts and about the school fetes that could not go ahead because of high public insurance premiums-or because such insurance to underwrite an event in the first place could not be secured. As the minister has noted, the driver for this legislation is to reduce public liability claim costs and reduce pressure on insurance premiums, in order to assist in delivering affordable public liability insurance. I find it interesting that this remains the driver for this legislation, given the trend in public liability premiums. For example, the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce conducted a survey which indicated that there was a 43 per cent reduction in the number of businesses having difficulty obtaining public on liability insurance over the 12 months to July 2003. Another example is that a leading commercial insurer, CGU Insurance Ltd, has cut its commercial liability insurance rates by 10 per cent in New South Wales-and, I assume, in other states. In addition to this, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission commenced monitoring premium prices in July 2002 to assess whether the insurance industry is reducing public liability and professional indemnity insurance premiums. In January 2005, the ACCC reported that the average public liability insurance premiums had decreased by 15 per cent between 31 December 2003 and 30 June 2004-a reversal in the pattern of premium increases that was certainly obvious during the period around 2000. Of course, this evidence is probably not enough for the government, but the government did commission two Commonwealth reports which found that public liability premiums were down by between four and five per cent in the year to December 2004. When the minister released these reports, he said that the results came about because of the tough action of federal, state and territory governments. Needless to say, the results that the minister took the opportunity to praise make you wonder why the government continues to pursue these amendments. It makes you wonder why, with these amendments, the government is pursuing removing the rights of consumers. I was looking through the bill and thinking that there must be something else to keep this alive-that maybe there was an industrial relations implication. But, after going through the bill, I find there is not. It seems that this is just another example of the government's pursuit of bottom standards on so many fronts. That is the likely driver for the continued existence of this bill. If the evidence of the insurance premiums is not enough for the minister and not enough for the government, maybe they should have a look at the dissenting report of Labor senators of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. It noted that the justification for the bill-the fact that the Trade Practices Act has the potential to undermine state and territory reforms-was regarded as less than convincing. The Law Council presented evidence to the committee that only nine examples of cases could be found in which people had tried to recover personal injury damages based on part V, division 1. These nine cases were not in the last six months-they were not even in the last 12 months; they were between the years 1989 and 2002. That is, nine cases were found over 13 years. And, of those nine cases, there were a number through which no damages were recovered. But enough about why this legislation is not needed because of the movement of insurance premiums or the number of actions brought about through the Trade Practices Act. Let us consider exactly what we will be losing under the provisions of this bill. Once the Trade Practices Act is amended it will remove the capacity for individuals, or the ACCC acting on behalf of individuals, to bring civil action under part V of division 1. Granted, while the option to pursue civil action may be removed, government members have been quick to point out that the ability to pursue damages under common law will remain. We have all seen the difficulty of the individual to pursue things under common law, and that will be particularly so once the government rams through its industrial relations agenda. Those of us on this side of the House know that having an action at common law for most of us is the equivalent of not having a means of appeal at all. An appeal based on the common law for damages for most people is near on impossible. People cannot afford to take long legal actions against major companies through the courts. Even if an individual has a legitimate case, the company they are up against can in most cases economically starve them out of an action through protracted litigation. Oftentimes it is a David and Goliath battle in which David, in this instance, would not stand a fighting chance. To naively rely on the common law to solve problems is an economically inefficient approach. The costs associated with bringing an action would, from a societal perspective, no doubt outweigh any benefit. The Trade Practices Act has had an important influence on the psyche of Australian business. The provisions of the Trade Practices Act, particularly in part V, division 1, have created what is often referred to as a ‘culture of care' within the Australian business community. As the Law Council noted in evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee: One of the consequences of that legislation, I think, has been that it has significantly improved the standards of behaviour that we have seen across the whole corporate world ... in terms of product safety and the actions of corporations in terms of their potential to cause physical harm to individuals, there has been this strong benchmarked potential liability imposed upon them. On the whole, I would say that it has led to general improvements and one should be loath to go down a path of in a wholesale way taking out whole areas of action. This is an important piece of evidence that the government and the minister have clearly ignored. Product safety is important to consumers. Consumers have rightly developed through time an expectation that they will be able to purchase products that are safe and, after taking into account the marketing hype, will, to a greater or lesser degree, do what they are supposed to do. It is also interesting that both the minister and the government have managed to ignore other evidence to the Senate committee. They have ignored the fact that, even though a number of groups expressed opposition to the bill, they expressed some support for alternative arrangements. The government has managed to ignore the fact that the proposals had a common theme in that the parties thought that the Trade Practices Act could be amended so that damages for breaching part V, division 1 could be bought into line with state and territory laws. That being achievable, the justification for this bill would be very weak. I find it difficult to believe that nine cases over 13 years-a number of which were, as I indicated earlier, unsuccessful-have driven up insurance premiums and will cause people to jurisdiction shop. I have no doubt that rational individuals, if they think they have a better chance or have a chance at achieving greater damages, will exploit the rules in any situation, be it through the Trade Practices Act or any other means. If nine cases in 13 years is the most that the Law Council could find in terms of the use of these provisions of the Trade Practices Act, it is probably a measure of the success of the act. As I noted earlier, the fact that these provisions exist and that actions can be taken against companies for misleading or deceptive conduct that results in injury or death has created a culture of care amongst manufacturers and suppliers. The fact that legislation exists in which a means is created for consumers to seek redress and that legislation exists that creates a potential liability, be it implied or otherwise, has certainly held producers to a higher standard. The numbers tell the story. Nine cases over 13 years is a measure of the success of these provisions, not a justification for their removal. The number of cases and the amount of damages should be judged, quite frankly, as the effectiveness of this piece of Commonwealth law. A small number of successful cases being actioned under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act are a measure of the strength of the law, a measure of its success, not the justification for its dilution. They are a measure of the seriousness with which producers take the act and a measure of the discipline that is imposed throughout the corporate world. In this case, Labor's proposals should be adopted. Under the proposals of the opposition, the important protections that have existed for some time would remain, the protections described by the Law Council as having ‘significantly improved the standards of behaviour that we have seen across the whole corporate world' would remain, the protections about which the Law Council also noted that they would be ‘loath to go down a path of in a wholesale way taking out whole areas of action' would remain, the ability for David to take on Goliath in something that looks like a fair fight would remain. The opposition's amendments are simple. They will retain the long standing consumer protections under part V, division 1. They retain the essence of the rigour that is imposed on companies, implied or otherwise, under the Trade Practices Act. The culture of care that has emerged as a result of these provisions will remain. The discipline that companies have imposed on themselves because of the consequences of having the Trade Practice Act in existence will also steadfastly remain, because there is no escape clause. However, as we pointed out, the bill could be constructively amended to minimise jurisdiction shopping by aligning the damages for breaches of the act where that would be consistent with those within the state or territory jurisdictions. But there is no way of dismissing the genuine concerns of people in relation to death or serious injury by saying that the only recourse they have is by applying the rigours of the common law. This government may be in a race for bottom standards when it comes to the conditions of working Australians, particularly in relation to the industrial relations agenda. It may be willing to throw everything away in an effort to outbid everyone else in a quest for the cheapest, but there are some protections that should remain and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, quite frankly, are one of them. I cannot support the removal from this act of the capacity of individuals, and the ACCC in representing individuals, to obtain redress through civil claims. I do not believe the evidence supports it, and I do not believe that the public wants it.",52
18,Mrs VALE,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004, which will implement the remaining recommendations from the Ipp report of the review of the law of negligence and complete the government's tort law reforms. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to implement review recommendations 19 and 20. Recommendation 19 is that the Trade Practices Act be amended to prevent individuals bringing actions for damages for personal injury and death under the misleading and deceptive conduct and other unfair practice provisions of part V, division 1 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Recommendation 20 is that the act be amended to remove the power of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to bring representative actions for damages for personal injury and death resulting from contravention of part V, division 1 of the act. Other legislation has already been used to implement other recommendations from the review. The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 had the purpose of amending the Trade Practices Act 1974 to implement recommendations 17 and 21 of the review of the law of negligence final report. By way of background, most of us will be aware of the insurance crisis in Australia that was characterised by rising premiums and unavailability of cover. It reached crisis point in 2001 following the collapse of HIH Insurance. On 30 May 2002, a ministerial meeting on public liability comprising ministers of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments jointly agreed to appoint a panel of experts to examine and review the law of negligence, including its interaction with the Trade Practices Act. This was the second ministerial meeting held to discuss public concerns about the cost and availability of public liability insurance. Afterwards it was stated that the unpredictability of the interpretation of the law of negligence was a factor driving up insurance premiums. Within this broad context, the terms of reference for the review of the law of negligence in Australia, which was chaired by the Hon. Justice David Ipp, stated that the award of damages for personal injury had become unaffordable and unsustainable as the principal source of compensation for those injured through the fault of another. It was therefore desirable to examine a method for the reform of the common law, with the objective of limiting liability and the quantity of damages arising from personal injury and death. The terms of reference and the breadth and range of the responses the review panel received in submissions and consultations indicated that there was a widely held view in the Australian community that there were problems with the law, which stemmed from perceptions that, firstly, the law of negligence as it is applied in the courts is unclear and unpredictable; secondly, in recent times it had become too easy for plaintiffs in personal injury cases to establish liability for negligence on the part of defendants; and, thirdly, damages awarded in personal injuries cases were frequently considered to be far too high. The expert review panel made 61 recommendations that were largely targeted at reforming personal injury laws at the state and territory levels. I understand that New South Wales has amended its consumer protection legislation that replicates part V, division implement recommendation 19 of the Ipp report. Other jurisdictions, for example South Australia and Queensland, were also looking to implement this recommendation and indicated they were waiting for the Commonwealth to pass the amendment to this bill before proceeding with their own amendments. The Ipp report also recommended that changes be made to the Trade Practices Act so that the reforms to negligence laws that make it harder for a person to claim damages in negligence would not be undermined by a plaintiff bringing a legal proceeding under the Commonwealth trade practices legislation. The options available, including maintaining the status quo, would not achieve national consistency on this matter. Further, it could undermine state and territory civil liability reform by providing an alternative right of action to claim damages for personal injuries or death. This is the point that answers the comments of the member for Werriwa a little earlier. The only feasible option available to achieve the government's objectives is to amend the Trade Practices Act in accordance with Ipp review recommendations 19 and 20-that is, to prevent individuals and the ACCC in a representative capacity from bringing an action for damages for personal injuries or death resulting from contraventions of division 1 of part V of the Trade Practices Act. Other orders and remedies under the Trade Practices Act for conduct in contravention of division 1 of part V that involves personal injuries or death will continue to be available. The benefits for business include an increased certainty for the business sector, including small businesses as a potential source of claims. Related costs arising from personal injury and death claims will be re1 to moved. The removal of potential rights of action will also create increased certainty for insurers in the assessment of the risk and the calculation of insurance premiums. It will also reduce insurers' legal costs in that they will no longer be required to defend alternative rights of action brought under division 1 of part V of the trade practices legislation. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report indicated that the Ipp review recommendations 19 and 20 are essentially administrative in nature and cannot be said to have a direct financial effect. However, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report did not assess the cost to business or the community if the Ipp review recommendations were not implemented and state and territory civil liability reforms were undermined. Allowing the Trade Practices Act to undermine state and territory reforms may impose an indirect but substantial financial cost in that it would prevent the benefits of state and territory civil liability reforms from being achieved. The principal benefit to businesses of these reforms is to assist in delivering affordable public liability insurance by reducing pressure on insurance premiums. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report estimates the benefit of the implementation of the review's recommendations for rules on quantum of damages to be a reduction in the cost of public liability claims by 14.7 per cent. This comprises an approximate 19.6 per cent reduction in personal injury claims cost, with no reduction in property damage claim cost. All things being equal, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report estimated that these reductions in claims costs may translate into a cortionally responding reduction in insurance premiums of 13.5 per cent, on average, subject to a number of factors, including the adequacy of current premiums and the prospects of windfall gains. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report notes that these findings are very uncertain and are relative to the pre 30 June 2001 public liabilof ity environment. They also rely on jurisdictions adopting all the Ipp review recommendations at the same time. While such an outcome is unlikely, adoption of the recommendations by a majority of the larger states would be expected to deliver significant savings, and it is pleasing that New South Wales has quickly moved to introduce amendments consistent with the Ipp review's recommendations on the quantum of damages. The benefits to the community are ensured by measures that provide that division 1 of part V does not undermine state and territory civil liability reforms so the full benefits of those reforms can be achieved. These reforms are intended to reduce pressure on insurers to increase insurance premiums and to ensure that adequate insurance protection is still available for consumers. When this bill was previously introduced by the government, it was opposed both by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. However, this bill is required because reforms have already been undertaken by some state and territory governments to help contain the cost of liability claims and to make liability insurance more affordable and available. Commonwealth, state and territory ministers agreed on a package of reforms that implements key recommendations of the Ipp review of the law of negligence at the November 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance. Ministers agreed that the key Ipp review recommendations that go to establishing liability should be implemented on a naconsistent basis and that each jurisdiction agree to introducing the necessary legislation as a matter of policy priority. At the November 2002 ministerial meeting, the Commonwealth also confirmed that it would amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to support the states' reforms so nationally consistent reforms are achieved in all areas Australia. In areas where national consistency cannot be achieved, ministers agreed to examine options for amending the Trade Practices Act to ensure that state and territory legislation would not be compromised. These are long-awaited amendments that will benefit Australian businesses and Australian consumers. I commend the bill to the House.",56
19,Mr HATTON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Blaxland) (11.52 am)The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004 is a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. It is misplaced and should not have been brought back into this place in the form that it is in. The Labor Party will be moving amendments in the Senate, as we did previously with regard to this bill. The bill seeks to introduce an propriate change to part V of the Trade Practices Act. It will limit the act so that consumNew ers and their advocates, in relation to the ACCC, will be forbidden from taking action for the recovery of damages in areas where they have traditionally been able to. We have just heard the member for Hughes and others argue the case as to what the Commonwealth has done. They have said that here is a really persuasive case where, in the face of a public liability firestorm across Australia, the Commonwealth is working in tandem with its state and territory colleagues in a ministerial council to address this problem. The Commonwealth's part, based on the Ipp review, is to take this substantial measure-it is only minor, but it is still substantial-to help fix the problem of civil liability across Australia. It is what the states ritories want. It will fix the situation with regard to negligence and it will bolster what the states have already done with regard to tort claims. If that were fully the case, if the government really did seek to fix that in a substantial manner, then the ACCC would not have given the evidence that it did to the Ipp review; and the Australian Labor Party, in determining its view, would not have taken into consideration the substantial case put forward by the ACCC that it should be, as it has been in the past, the champion of consumer groups with broad claims. With regard to the tobacco industry, I note that in the explanatory memorandum and the minister's second reading speech it says that the provisions on claims resulting from tobacco injury will be maintained, provided that they are done within the three-year window. This bill takes away an entire class of actions under the trade practices law, to fix the possibility-not the actuality-that there inap- could be forum shopping. There has been a strong tightening of tort law, particularly in South Wales under Minister John Della Bosca and in Victoria-two Labor jurisdictions. All state and territory governments, community groups and local councils have been faced with the problem of a dramatic increase in the cost of premiums. Why was that? Was it because there was forum shopping between state jurisdictions and the Commonwealth with regard to section 52, part V of the Trade Practices Act? Was there already a significant case of forum shopping? The answer is no. Was it prospectively likely that there would be a great deal of forum shopping? The answer is no. Was there a significant problem with the fundamentals of tort law in the states and the question of negligence? I do not think that that was fundaand termentally the case either. We saw the destruction of one of Australia's great companies, HIH. The insurance industry, or at least the part that took the vast majority of public liability insurance onto its shoulders, imploded in front of our very eyes. We have seen the outcome of that. Two people who were significantly involved in that company were jailed and, previously, under Larry Adler, FAI Insurance was folded into HIH. That implosion and its effects led to the public liability crisis and the March 2002 and November 2002 reviews. At the time, Minister Coonan was responsible for this area. In the explanatory memorandum to the bill, and canvassed in part in the Bills Digest, it says that this position was entirely agreed to between the state jurisdictions and the Commonwealth, this was the way to fix it and this was a major thing being done. Last year there were some other measures incorporated into the Trade Practices Act. Those amendments were generally supported. Those measures did not go to proscribing the ability of the ACCC or other parties to use part V of the Trade Practices Act to act on behalf and in the interests of consumers. The measures went to establishing-as the states and territories have done-a capping regime. Faced with the implosion of HIH, the problem of reinsurers, the rocketing price of public liability, community groups being unable to pay those premiums and no-one having a ready answer to that, the state jurisdictions and the territoto ries said: ‘We have to answer this in some way. Probably the best thing we can do in the face of this explosion is to place a cap on it.' So, in the face of some serious opposition and questioning about taking away the rights of individuals to pursue damages claims for injury or death and about individuals being harshly dealt with in that circumstance, Premier Carr and Minister Della Bosca said it was important, in the communal interest, to cap the amount of benefits. In the case of New South Wales, Minister Della Bosca underlined-at a Labor conference, from memory-what he was doing, arguing that someone who suffers serious injury is faced with a lifetime of medical expenses and significant problems. In the past, what has generally happened is that millions of dollars were given to people to ensure that they were properly looked after. Minister Della Bosca said that what was most important was to ensure that they would be looked after for the rest of their lives. So other measures could be taken, rather than a monetary reward, apart from the capping of those payouts-the public hospital system in New South Wales and the facilities open to government could be used to provide for people in those circumstances. They were the key issues driving the question of payouts in tort cases and in the area of negligence. There have been a series of those involving a number of councils in New South Wales. The difficulty that state governments faced was over a broader area. Firstly, they chose to cap, which the federal government did with this act last year by putting in a capping regime. Secondly, they said, ‘We need to tidy up this area of the law and, where possible, make sure that there is a commonality across the Commonwealth.' I do not gainsay that; that is an important thing do, but the case from the government has rested on the utility of doing that and the argument that this change will in fact fix things. The Ipp review has been mentioned time and time again. The power of the ACCC, in its capacity to act under section 52 of the act, has been called into question and would be completely curtailed if the government's measure goes through. This is what the ACCC had to argue. It said: Section 52 of the TPA provides an important incentive for businesses to behave fairly and have regard for consumers' safety. Without the availability of this important remedy, the standard of behaviour that consumers are entitled to expect may break down. limiting the scope of Part V is economically inefficient in that it forces consumers to incur greater search costs to determine which suppliers are reliable. such a limitation also undermines the competitive process by allowing firms that engage in misleading and deceptive practices to win customers at the expense of those that do not. With regard to the whole question of whether or not it was possible, given the fact that people would face problems with the changes that have happened in state jurisdictions and therefore would look for a way to get out of it federally, the ACCC said that the argument has been put forward that it would be very easy for people to do this. You are not dealing with strict liability, so it is argued that it is simpler for people to launch an action under this. Therefore, the government is putting the argument that, in closing off those avenues, it is likely that lawyers or others will discover a way to pursue this under the Trade Practices Act. The Ipp review and the Treasury picked that up, and the Insurance Council of Australia laid a fair amount of emphasis on that in giving evidence to the Senate committee. But the Law Council of Australia statedand I think they would be reasonably well briefed in this area-that, if it were significantly easier to bring an action under section 52 for personal injury than on negligence, then it would have been used in many more cases. I counsel the government to take a look at what the Law Council had to say in this regard, at the effect they expect this provision to have and the narrowing of the current provisions of the act. The government should also look at Labor's amendments in the Senate with a more careful eye. I will quote the Law Council in full because it bears quoting. The Law Council said: The elements of common law negligence, in terms of duty of care and breach of duty and causation of the damage, are different from the notion of loss occasioned by false and misleading conduct, but just because they are different does not mean that, in terms of the Trade Practices Act, somehow it is easier or simpler or that there is no fault or wrong involved. It is based on false and misleading conduct, and that itself has to be established. If somehow that was an easier way of making claims, we would have the balance of claims being made under the Trade Practices Act. That is simply not happening. The changes in the state law are not of a nature that will drive people to the Trade Practices Act, in our view, because the substantive facts of what has to have occurred and the circumstances in which it has to have occurred are quite different. That is, if you think this is really based on forum shopping, you should think again, because there is a wide area that is currently covered to protect consumers at large that I think needs to be retained. So part V, division 1 of the TPA has that important role, and what Labor is saying is that that should be reinforced. Personal injury and death can strike in all families and in all places. With regard to this, the Commonwealth-as I have covered so far with regard to the narrowing of what is available in the Trade Practices Act, and being in conjunction with what happens at the state and territory level-leaves out a significant part of the question. You would have to ask, in terms of public liability and its coverage and how to solve the problem we have been faced with, whether or not the Commonwealth has done the job. I also make the point that, in terms of negligence and common-law remedies, the Commonwealth is saying that it wants to cut out the avenue where individuals or othersrepresented, for instance, by the ACCCcould seek to use this to find some other way to seek large damages with regard to personal injury or death. I know from practical experience just how difficult it can be for relatively powerless individuals taking a case at common law to get a reasonable result out of those entities. I know how difficult it was to do that in 1966 and in 1972. There may be a result and there may be no necessary justice in the common law, because the fundamentals of individual cases are based on what people do and what people say in evidence. I have some significant concern in relation to that, because I have personal experience. My father worked for Auburn County Council. He was a driver who had many years of experience. But at the age of 43, after a double hernia operation, on a very wet weekend when he should have been at home in bed he spent the entire weekend on callout. At nine o'clock on Monday morning my father was electrocuted. His long-term partner, his linesman, was on long service leave. There was a qualified linesman there but he did not go up the pole. He asked my father to go up the pole because he was not experienced. My father did so, in contravention of the perception of what should be done. The actual practice of Auburn County Council was what the drivers did. My father was extremely competent-far more competent than me in manual tasks. Despite the fact that the guy on the ground was qualified, phases A, B, C and D were open and this bloke turned off the wrong phases. My father was electrocuted instantaneously. I found out two hours afterwards, when Father MCCarthy came to the school and took us home to see my mother. Because my mother had worked all of her life, and because the Auburn County Council took the view that it would pursue the case at common law as vigorously as possible, the case took five years to get to court. My mother received not one penny-not one cent-for 12 months. After that, she received the grand sum of $18 a week to support her four sons who were not over the age of 18. My older brother Kerry was. In the fifth year the matter was taken to court in one of the most bitterly contested cases that had been seen at common law. It cost $3,000 for the barrister. Because my mother worked, she was penalised. The total value of my father's life, all up, was held to be $22,500. If my father had lived to the age of 65, he would have earned $500,000, in 1971 terms. That payout included, from my memory, a sum of $12,600 that was the ‘value' of my father's life. I can tell the House that the value to to my mother and to my family of my father's life was much greater than that. To this very day I have dreams that my father is still alive and with us-or that he has gone away somewhere else, that there is a reason for him not being here. I was 15 years of age at the time. No-one who is at the other end of a case like this should think of it in terms of the cases spread across Australia's newspapers, where millions of dollars are paid out to people with major injuries. None of them could suffer more than we did, who suffered the damage, injury and hurt of the loss of a father who loved us and whom we truly loved. My father was generous to a fault. He had the love of the people whom he worked with and of his friends. No compensation can make amends for such a loss. But what bitterly hurt me was the fact that absolutely every one of the witnesses who went to that common-law case-all of those people who worked with him in the Auburn County Council for years-lied through their back teeth to protect their jobs. Only one person stood up in the court and said, ‘Yes, it is true. Drivers go up the poles and they do the work of linesmen.' The size of the payout for the value of my father's life meant that my mother had to struggle to bring up five sons, effectively on her own, without much help from the community at large. We did not expect, I certainly did not expect and I do not think there should have been, a massive payout in our case. But there are cases that have to be dealt with at common law, and the common-law caps that the state governments have put on-coming from another area altogether, public liability-affect real people. They are not just Daily Telegraph headlines. There should be an actionable cause that can be launched under part V of the Trade Practices Act where there has been wilfully misleading me, conduct on the part of Australian companies. This government should not knock that on the head in the misguided belief that it is doing something to fix up the problem with public liability. This government should also not be proscribing-as the state governments should not be proscribing, in trying to deal with the public liability firestorm-the individual rights of common and ordinary people. Those who suffer personal injury, or families who are assailed by the death of their loved one and breadwinner-in my case my father-should not be deprived of their rights at law, because it is the only redress they have. In my family's case, that redress at law was not met in a fully just way because human beings decided to lie to protect their jobs and their backs and to deny the actuality. So the law itself will not entirely fix this, and it will not entirely fix the problems of public liability insurance. It is from the hearts of human beings and their actions that we need to seek redress. I think it is reasonable that there is a capping of damages, but the very heart of tort and negligence should not be torn out as an easy way out for the Commonwealth government.",58
20,Mr TURNBULL,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"The very powerful and touching recollection by the member for Blaxland of the death of his father moved everyone in the House. I compliment him for having the courage to talk about that in the way that he did. All of us have fathers. Some of us know them better than others and some of us, like the member for Blaxland and I, have lost them in violent accidents. It is good that we speak from the heart. Perhaps we should do so more often. In March 2002, the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers, together with the President of the Australian Local Government Association, met to discuss the problems of rising insurance premiums and the reduced availability of public liability insurance. The ministers agreed that a program of tort law reform was required to address the rising cost of claims, an increase which had been driven by changes in the courts' views of what constituted negligence and was thus an effective expansion of liability and of the appropriate compensation for personal injuries claims, and thus an increase in the damages likely to be awarded. These changes had the consequence of rendering past provisioning by insurers inadequate. The meeting requested that the Council of Australian Governments at its meeting on 5 April 2002 endorse their approach to tackle the challenge of tort law reform. Senator Helen Coonan, then the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, announced the review of the law of negligence on 2 July 2002 to be conducted by a panel chaired by the Western Australian judge, the Hon. David Ipp. The background to that review, as described in the report, was that there was a wide community perception that the law of negligence as applied in the courts was unclear and unpredictable, that in recent times it had become too easy for plaintiffs in personal injury cases to establish liability for negligence on the part of defendants, and that damages awards in personal injuries cases were frequently too high. The Ipp review was given a very clear objective in the terms of reference to look at methods that limit ‘liability and quantum of damages arising from personal injury and death'. That was the brief that the governments of Australia gave Mr Justice Ipp. There is no doubt that there had been some baroque developments in the law. All of us are familiar with the case of Kevin Presland, which was fortunately reversed on appeal. This was a gentleman who presented to the John Hunter Hospital with a self-inflicted head injury. He was later referred as a voluntary mental patient to the James Fletcher Hospital. He was released and then went home with his brother. He became psychotic and attacked his brother's fiancee, violently murdering her. He was found not guilty by reason of that mental illness. He then sued the Hunter Area Health Service, claiming they had a duty to detain him under the mental health act, and that by releasing him they should compensate him for the pain and suffering occasioned by his murdering his brother's fiancee and his incarceration. The court agreed and awarded him $225,000 for pain and suffering and another $85,000 for lost earnings. It was an extraordinary decision which met with public outrage. It was reversed on appeal. Another decision which gave this area of the law a particularly bad name, which was confirmed in the High Court of Australia, was Cattanach v Melchior. The High Court gave $105,000 in damages to a woman who had had a sterilisation, but had then conceived and given birth to a baby who was healthy and, as far as we know, a very well loved baby. The woman sued the doctor who had performed the sterilisation operation. It is an extraordinary case where the law saw a child not as a blessing but as an injury to the parents. These are examples that hit the headlines, but there has been no question; all of us understand that the tort system had got out of control. The Ipp panel noted that legal and administrative costs represented 40 per cent of the total costs of the personal injuries compensation system. A key element in the Ipp panel's approach was that reform should be principle based-that is to say that the changes in the law should encompass ‘general rules governing as many types of cases and as many categories of potential defendants as is reasonably possible'. The reason for that, of course, is that, if the liability or damages rules differed from one cause of action to another, a plaintiff could choose to sue in contract rather than in tort or, as is particularly pertinent to this bill, under the Trade Practices Act. The necessity of ensuring that the same rules applied to claims under tort, contract or statute became recommendation 2 of the Ipp report. The Ipp panel had only a few months to deliberate and it sought to effectively restate the common law but in terms of principles that were more conducive to the stated objective in the terms of reference of ‘limiting liability and quantum of damages arising from personal injury or death'. At common law the standard of care depended on whether a risk was foreseeable. The Australian case law-Wyong Shire v Shirt-had concluded that a risk was foreseeable as long as it was not ‘far fetched or fanciful'. Ipp recommended, for example, that only risks held to be ‘not insignificant' should be regarded as being foreseeable. This has now been incorporated in the law in the various states and territories. A key recommendation in terms of medical negligence was, in effect, the reintroduction of the Bolam test, a UK principle, which held that a doctor could not be held to have acted negligently if what he or she did was consistent with a practice regarded as proper at the time by a responsible body of professional opinion. This protection had been rejected by the High Court of Australia in Rosenberg v Percival in 2001 where the court had held that the practice of the profession was relevant but not conclusive. Ipp recommended, therefore, that a medical practitioner would not be held to be negligent if the treatment provided was in accordance with an opinion widely held by a significant number of respected practitioners in the field, unless the court considered that the opinion was irrational. Another key recommendation in terms of public liability was that providers of recreational activities should not be liable for the materialisation of an obvious risk. This recommendation was no doubt inspired by the cases where swimmers injured at surfing beaches by being dumped in the surf on a sandbar had successfully sued their local councils. The Ipp reforms were conceived very rapidly and they have also been implemented rapidly as well by the various states and territories. They have had the effect of significantly limiting the amount of compensation that can be claimed by injured personsdamages have been capped, discount rates increased, limitation periods reduced. It has been a remarkable, perhaps unique, period of law reform and it has not been without its critics. The Ipp report noted that, if the reforms to the law of negligence which it recommended were successful, lawyers would inevitably look for other different causes of action on which to base their claims. Ipp concluded that it was not necessary to prohibit claims for personal injury and death being brought under part IVA of the Trade Practices Act, which deals with unconscionable conduct, principally because liability under that part requires the plaintiff to lish fault on the part of the defendant-as distinguished from part V where liability is strict. Accordingly, Ipp recommended simply that the Trade Practices Act be amended so that the rules relating to limitation of actions and quantum of damages to apply to negligence in the common law apply to claims brought under part IVA for unconscionable conduct. Part V of the Trade Practices Act contains section 52-a distinct difference from part IVA-which imposes a liability for misleading or deceptive conduct without any need to establish fault. A plaintiff suing under section 52 simply has to prove that a statement was misleading; there is no need to prove negligence or deceit. Indeed, a defendant who has conducted himself or herself with the most scrupulous honesty and care can nonetheless be liable. Given the strict liability nature of part V, the Ipp report's recommendation 19 was that the act be amended to prevent individuals bringing actions for damages for personal injury and death under part V, division 1, and its recommendation 20 was that the ACCC's power to bring representative actions for damages for personal injury and death be similarly prohibited. These two recommendations are, in effect, the subject matter of this bill. The Ipp panel was of the view-correctly, I believe-that the Trade Practices Act was never intended to provide a vehicle for bringing claims relating to personal injuries or death. Of course, in the absence of this bill there is a risk that, as plaintiffs gravitate to the Trade Practice Act as a better forum in which to bring personal injuries claims, the entire purpose of the Ipp reforms could be defeated. For example, the Ipp reforms clarify the law of medical negligence, linking the required standard of care, as I mentioned a estabmoment ago, to an opinion widely held by a significant number of practitioners in the field. A plaintiff suing under section 52 would simply have to establish that the advice given by a hospital turns out to have been mistaken. There would be no need to prove any kind of negligence. The government's approach to the Trade Practices Act, therefore, in the light of Ipp's recommendations, was to implement recommendations 19 and 20, which prohibited personal injury and death claims pursuant to part V, division 1. This bill was first presented in 2003 and was rejected by the Senate, the Labor Party and the Democrats, who contended that a person should be able to recover damages for personal injury or death under part V, division 1, of the Trade Practices Act, subject to a cap. As far as the other parts of the Trade Practices Act, the subject of the Ipp report, are concerned, the panel's recommendation was that the rules relating to limitation of actions and quantum of damages recommended for the law of negligence should apply to those parts. These recommendations, recommendations 17 and 21, applied therefore, as I have said, to the unconscionable conduct provisions, part IVA, and the product safety provisions, part V, divisions 1A and 2A, and part VA. In a nutshell, these changes served to reduce, substantially, the quantum of damages that can be recovered and halved the limitation period to three years. This approach of harmonisation-as opposed to that of prohibition, which is the approach taken in this bill-was contained in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Act (No. 2) 2004. This bill does not, however, operate as a complete bar to the use of part V, division I, for death or personal injury. It provides, in subsection 82 (1AAB), that actions in respect of the death of or personal injury to a person resulting from smoking or other use of tobacco products will be able to be brought, but subject to the provisions of part VIB of the act, which encompass the provisions relating to limitation of actions and quantum of damages, as I mentioned earlier, and which were introduced in the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Act (No. 2) 2004. Tort law reform, as I observed earlier, has not been uncontroversial. But it has largely been implemented-and for the most part by state and territory Labor governments. This bill can be seen as a tidying-up exercise. The strict liability provisions of the Trade Practices Act were never designed to be a backdoor route for personal injury claims. It would be ridiculous indeed for it to be allowed to remain so. It would undermine the whole move towards tort law reform that has been undertaken, as I said, really on a bipartisan basis. The bulk of the heavy lifting on tort law reform has, for constitutional reasons, been taken by state and territory parliaments, and it has been overwhelmingly Labor governments that have led that-and none more vigorously than the government in New South Wales. Part of the objective of tort law reform was to make general insurance more affordable. That was a key focus of the original initiative by Senator Coonan when she was the minister and of the member for Longman, the current Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. The latest results on the affordability of insurance released by the minister on 11 August showed that public liability insurance premiums have, over the 12 months to December 2004, fallen by between four and nearly five per cent. Professional indemnity premiums have, over the same period, fallen by between 0.3 and four per cent. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has provided its price monitoring report on insurance premiums to the government. Meanwhile, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority provided its first national claims and policies database to assist the insurance industry in appropriate pricing and premium setting. Both reports were commissioned by the Commonwealth, honouring the government's commitment-a commitment that, as I say, is a commitment of all Australian governments-to continue to put downward pressure on premiums. It is a great pity that the Labor Party in this parliament-in this parliament alone in Australia-is so resistant to tort law reform. In every other parliament, Labor members and Labor governments have acted in a responsible way to, in the words of the former Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, ‘systematically wind back the culture of blame and restore the notion of personal responsibility'. It is important to remember that there are many victims of a tort system that was out of control. The tort law reforms across Australia have not only resulted in great savings to the community at large and made it much easier for businesses to get insurance but also served to protect workers-particularly doctors, nurses, police and council workersfrom senseless and speculative claims. The culture of blame-the victim culture-is a particularly corrosive one. I imagine that members opposite will be unmoved by my words, but I hope that they reconsider their position on this bill and act as Labor governments have done, even though those opposite are but an alternative government in this House.",63
21,Mr BROUGH,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (12.30 pm)-in reply-I would like to thank all of the speakers on both sides of the chamber who have participated in this important debate today. It brings to a conclusion, in this place at least, the important reforms that, as the member for Wentworth so rightly pointed out, have been undertaken by both state and federal governments over the last few years in an attempt to restore confidence in the insurance industry and to put a cap on premiums, making them more affordable for the average person and business and, rightly, also for professionals. In doing so it brings some certainty into the law. The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2004 has been brought about because in the previous parliament the opposition, the Labor Party, sought to block this particular measure in the Senate, in contravention of all the state jurisprofessional dictions, who have agreed that this is an appropriate measure to ensure that we do not have jurisdictional jumping by those who seek to litigate. I will go to some of the cerns that have been raised by the opposition in an attempt to have them support the legislation in the other place as it moves through its processes. In short, this bill will implement recommendations 19 and 20 of the review of the law of negligence. It will prevent individuals bringing actions for damages for personal injury and death under the ‘misleading or deceptive conduct' and other unfair practices provisions of part V division 1 of the Trade Practices Act. It will also prevent the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission from bringing representative actions for damages for personal injury and death under these provisions. The government considers that these measures are important. Continuing to allow damages for personal injury and death claims under part V, division 1, risks undermining state and territory tort law reformsimportant law reforms that are now in place in many of the jurisdictions. This is because a number of actions that would not be possible under those state and territory negligence regimes could be brought by using part V, division 1, of the Trade Practices Act. The review of the law of negligence argued that, because part V, division 1, does not require fault to be established, and because it has been interpreted very broadly by the courts, lawyers will find it easy to frame claims that come within its requirements. Without the measures contained in this bill the recent falls in pubic liability and professional indemnity premiums will be placed at risk. The ACCC and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, APRA, have recently reported falls in public liability and indemnity of up to 4.8 per cent. This is very welcome throughout the Australian economy, as insurance is such a significant part of our business cycle and our econcon- omy in general. Also at risk would be the foreshadowed future falls in insurance premiums. This is not the end game; this is simply an important step in ensuring that insurance is affordable, that it is available, that the ucts that meet the market are there and that the industry remains stable. There would be considerable uncertainty regarding the prospect of future claims being made under the Trade Practices Act and the potential for cost savings resulting from state and territory reforms to be eroded by an alternative course of action. As I have explained, this bill will prevent actions for personal injury and death under part V, division 1. Some of the questions that have been put during this debate by those who sit opposite were asking us to point to the evidence that actions under the Trade Practices Act 1974 are undermining state and territory reforms. The government acknowledges the difference between an action in negligence and an action under the Trade Practices Act 1974 for misleading or deceptive conduct. For example, there is a requirement of the Trade Practices Act that the conduct be ‘in trade or commerce' and this requirement does not exist in negligence. For a claim to succeed under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act there is no requirement to prove that the defendant was at fault. I will say that again: there is no requirement to prove that the defendant was at fault. The plaintiff merely has to prove that the statement was misleading or deceptive, even if the defendant made the statement with the utmost care and with complete honesty. This is what we are trying to prevent from happening. However, despite the differences, actions under the Trade Practices Act for misleading or deceptive conduct do provide significant scope for plaintiffs to evade state and territory reforms to limit liability under the law of negligence. The ACCC has acknowledged in its evidence to the Senate committee that lawyers will often plead liability under the Trade Practices Act for misleading or deceptive conduct as an alternative to liability in prodnegligence. In simple terms: they cannot prove negligence so they go to this misleading and deceptive conduct provision in order to get a case up. If there is little scope for one course of action to be substituted for the other, why are they so frequently pleaded in the alternative? The review of the law of negligence acknowledged that, up until state and territory civil liability reforms had been implemented, claims for misleading or deceptive conduct had been rarely relied on for personal injury or death claims. It was unnecessary to pursue a claim under the Trade Practices Act because, before the state and territories introduced tort law reform, there were no statutory limits or claims for personal injury or death under state and territory legislation. However, the review also identified the potential for claims under part V, division 1, of the Trade Practices Act to be used as an alternative to claims in negligence and therefore a mechanism by which the reforms to the law of negligence could be evaded. Indeed, in the past two years we have seen a number of cases where plaintiffs have pleaded a claim for personal injury or death under the Trade Practices Act to circumvent the state and territory reforms. It would appear that these claims have generally arisen as the plaintiff would be prevented from claiming any damages under state and territory law. This is what we seek to prevent and it is the reasoning for us reintroducing this bill. So what do the states and territories have to say? As many speakers pointed out, it was the leadership of the federal Howard government and my predecessor, Senator Helen Coonan, working with the state ministers to bring together tort law reform on a basis that gave us some consolidation and conformity around this great nation. So the states and territories have actually demonstrated-and I point out that each and every one of them is a Labor government; we all know that-their strong and continued support for this bill. The states and territories know that, if the amendments proposed in this bill are not made, there is a risk that plaintiffs could evade the reforms to the law of negligence that have been made, as I have previously explained. Furthermore, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania have already passed amendments to make equivalent changes to their own fair trading acts. Businesses in this country call regularly for uniformity across jurisdictions in areas of business so that, when they are operating a business or a branch of their business in, say, Queensland and another in Western Australia, they do not have to deal with different laws, even when conducting basically the same business with the same proposals and staffing arrangements. This will also give them certainty in understanding what they are dealing with. That is just a by-product of the bill. It is also important to acknowledge the response of the ACCC, with its economic analysis and commentary on the likely impact of this bill. I say that because I think has been used by those opposite to suggest why this should not go ahead in its current form. In previously opposing the bill, the opposition cited some of the economic analysis provided by the ACCC in its review. The opposition then noted that preventing consumers from seeking damages for misleading or deceptive conduct could reduce the incentive for firms to minimise misleading or deceptive conduct, be economically inefficient or undermine competitive processes by allowing firms that engage in misleading or deceptive conduct to win customers at the expense of those that do not. The government considers that there will continue to be strong incentives for firms to avoid behaviour that may lead to personal injury or death, including misleading, deceptive or unfair conduct. Firms will continue to be subject to a range of orders or remedies under the Trade Practices Act and firms will also continue to be liable under the law of negligence. These amendments do not alter actions for misleading or deceptive conduct in any way; they only affect personal injury and death claims. Consumers are not likely to incur greater search costs to find reliable suppliers, because existing provisions will ensure that firms will continue to have strong incentives to avoid conduct that may lead to personal death or injury. Finally, there is this important question: will people be left without a right of action? These amendments support state and territory civil liability reforms by preventing easy substitution of a Trade Practices Act damages action for a common-law action. Plaintiffs will still be able to pursue personal injury or death claims under common law, as modified by state and territory civil liability legislation, rather than to bring that action under the Trade Practices Act-for example, misleading and deceptive conduct. Therefore, there is no restriction on their ability to it take a case before the courts; it will be done under the state jurisdiction. Unlike actions in tort, proof of misleading or deceptive conduct or any other unfair practices prohibited under the Trade Practices Act does not require any finding of fault. Subsequently, if there has been a personal injury or death and the plaintiff is unable to prove any fault on the part of the defendant, they may be left without a right of action. The plaintiff will be prevented from taking action under the Trade Practices Act and, in the absence of evidence of fault, they may not be able to establish an action in tort. However, regarding existing case law, Trade Practices Act claims are usually pleaded in the alternative with common-law claims. Consequently, it is not expected that a significant number of people will be left without any right of action. As I have explained, this bill will prevent actions for personal injury and death under part V, division 1. However, firms that engage in unfair practices, including misleading or deceptive conduct, will continue to be subject to the Trade Practices Act. The government is confident that the prevailing Trade Practices Act remedies the orders and will ensure consumers are protected and competitive processes are not undermined; these include criminal sanctions under part V(C), division 2. Remedies are also available in contract and tort. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",67

25,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (12.43 pm)The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 lays bare the Howard government's extreme ideology, because it holds universities to ransom by making $838 million of desperately needed funding for our universities conditional upon meeting the government's unreasonable industrial relations requirements. Quite simply, the government is blackmailing universities into implementing John Howard's industrial relations policies. The bill imposes on the funding of higher education institutions unprecedented workplace relations conditions that have nothing whatsoever to do with the core functions of universities, which are teaching, research and community service. At one end of the spectrum, this bill contains absurd attempts at micromanagement of issues that any sane person knows should be left to the management of universities and their staff. At the other end of the spectrum, the government is seeking to diminish terms and conditions of employment in areas like redundancy pay and maternity leave, to allow Australian workplace agreements to override existing agreements and to remove limits on excessive levels of casual employment. These are drastic changes that have nothing whatsoever to do with teaching and research. They are clearly matters that should be left to vice-chancellors and staff, not propriated by heavy-handed politicians with axes to grind who are carrying out an extreme ideological agenda. The government wants to force universities to put these coercive industrial relations funding conditions ahead of improving teaching and learning for students and our community. This government has been responsible for cutting $5 billion from Australia's universities since it was elected. It has refused to properly index university grants and it has forced universities to over-rely on student fee income. So we have seen this government leave our universities in a dire financial position. But, not content with the disarray that this has caused, the government is now bullying our universities into implementing an extreme and divisive workplace relations agenda. Universities should be allowed to focus on their missions and their core functions-teaching, research and community service-and not have to serve as a testing ground for the Howard government's attack on the working conditions of Australians. There is no question that the changes we are debating today will cause massive disruption on our university campuses. University teaching and research will be the first casualties to suffer, while staff and management are forced to focus on these industrial relations changes instead. I want to go through some of the details of the bill we are debating. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 compels universities to put the government's industrial relations agenda before educational standards and quality and harshly penalises many of the government's higher education critics. We have already seen this government's extreme piece of legislation to end current funding arrangements for vital university services for students-legislation which even members of the coalition parties ap- are now criticising, because they know it is only being driven by ideology. Just as the anti student services legislation will effectively wipe out the capacity of student organisations to represent and advocate for the interests of university students, so this current bill attempts to neuter the ability of the organisations which represent staff in higher education institutions to successfully carry out their functions. The bill provides that, under the terms of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, the grants provided to universities may be increased but only if certain unreasonable conditions are met. To be eligible for future additional funding, this bill will force universimatter ties to observe the new higher education workplace relations conditions. We are not talking about peanuts here; we are talking about significant additional funding-2½ per cent of each university's basic grant in 2005, five per cent in 2006 and 7½ per cent after that. This bill incorporates these workplace relations conditions into the Commonwealth Grant Scheme guidelines and also requires the Minister for Education, Science and Training to be satisfied that these higher education workplace relations arrangements have been implemented if universities are to receive the additional conditional funding. For universities facing a critical shortage of funds because of the now 9½ long years of funding cuts under this government, this additional funding is not merely optional or voluntary. Universities will have no choice but to accept these conditions because, basically, the Howard government has starved them into submission. Effectively, this is industrial and economic blackmail. There are five specific conditions which must be met, and I want to go through each of them individually. The first relates to choice in agreement making. Under this provision, universities must offer Australian workplace agreements to all new employees employed after 29 April this year and to all other employees by 31 August next year. Until 30 June next year, universities are exempt from offering AWAs to casual employees engaged for a period of less than a month. Any certified agreements made by a university and certified after 29 April 2005 are to include a clause that expressly allows for AWAs to operate to the exclusion of the certified agreement or to prevail over the certified agreement where there is any inconsistency. At the moment, universities may offer AWAs to staff under existing certified agreements. This was the result of the education minister's arm twisting the last time this was in the Senate in 2003. But apparently that was not sufficient for the government and now we see their obsession with total control. They want to get their own way, without regard for the rights or opinions of anybody else. A new condition imposed in this bill is that every single university employee must be offered an AWA by 31 August 2006. That demonstrates the minister's complete disregard for the smooth day-today management of our universities and, certainly, his lack of concern for how employees on Australian workplace agreements fare. By mandating that every employee must be offered an AWA rather than leaving it as one among various options, this provision goes well beyond the existing position. In the process the government is seeking to introduce a stipulation for the higher education sector that is way in excess of its own extreme industrial relations policy for the work force generally. We know that employees on AWAs earn two per cent less and work six per cent more hours than those on registered collective agreements. What is more, for women in particular, those women who are employed on individual contracts earn 11 per cent less an hour compared with men employed on collective agreements. Currently, women receive around 90 per cent of the hourly pay of men employed on collective agreements. That percentage is reduced further under AWAs, where women earn only 80 per cent of the hourly pay of men. Casual and part-time employees on AWAs earn 15 per cent and 25 per cent less respectively relative to their earnings under the terms of collective agreements. So we know from the current experience that when employees are put on individual contracts they are, on average, worse off. It certainly is the case that AWAs are bad news for employees, especially for women, and we know that women represent over 50 per cent of university staff. The Minister for Education, Science and Training protests that AWAs are subject to a no disadvantage test and no-one can be coerced into accepting them, but in reality it is very clear that the government's no disadvantage test, applied by the Office of the Employment Advocate, is merely a rubberstamping exercise and that there is little considered evaluation of the underlying terms and conditions of employment in the relevant award. The second part of this bill that I want to go to relates to direct relationships with employees. This condition stipulates that university workplace agreements, policies and practices must provide for direct consultation between employees and the institution about workplace relations and human resource matters. Further, so-called third party involvement in representation of employees must occur only at the request of an affected employee. Other details under this condition are that consultative and other committees must include direct employee involvement and that employee involvement in negotiations on industrial relations issues must not be restricted only to third party representation. It is clear that what the government is really trying to achieve through this condition is the exclusion of unions from a role in consultative processes relating to staff. If third party involvement can occur only at the request of an individual employee and not as a right, it is all too easy to imagine that university staff will feel intimidated and forgo the opportunity to be represented at all. There will be immense pressure brought to bear on individual staff not to nominate an experienced union official to represent them in critical industrial relations negotiations. Labor certainly cannot support such an unreasonable and unbalanced system of workplace representation that is clearly designed to just hobble the legitimate role of an industrial association or union. The next condition I want to talk about relates to workplace flexibility. This condition states that new workplace agreements should expressly displace previous workplace agreements and relevant awards. These new workplace agreements are not to limit or restrict the ability of universities to make decisions and implement change in respect of course offerings and associated staffing requirements and limitations are not to be placed on the forms and mix of employment arrangements. It is clear that the Howard government wishes to use these provisions to nullify the impact of the existing higher education contract of employment award. This award was made by the Industrial Relations Commission. It regulates fixed term employment by limiting the circumstances in which fixed term employment may be used. It was arbitrated by the Industrial Relations Commission because of the widespread use and abuse of fixed term contract employment in our universities. Likewise, under this condition the government is taking aim at the vital protections in place through restrictions on casual employment that were agreed between the universities and unions in the last round of enterprise bargaining. The level of casualisation in the higher education sector has reached extremely high levels, to the point that its incidence is second only to that in the many hospitality and tourism industry. Such high levels of non-continuing and insecure employment certainly jeopardise the quality of research, teaching and learning. The abolition of these safeguards would result in an obvious escalation in the level of casualisation, and that too is an outcome that Labor is certainly not going to support. There can be no doubt that, if this bill is passed, the government will press universities to strip back essential protections from their agreements until the result is something resembling very much hollowed-out safety net awards. The next area goes to productivity and performance. Universities' workplace agreements must include a fair and transparent performance management scheme to reward so-called high flyers and must also include efficient processes for managing poorly performing staff. However, this seems to ignore the fact that all universities are ready able to reward the high flyers-and, indeed, many do so through the use of salary loadings and the payment of market and merit loadings. Approximately 30 per cent of university staff are employed on contracts that contain such mechanisms. Furthermore, existing agreements already provide for mechanisms to deal with unsatisfactory or poor performance. So the real agenda here is not as it is stated, because those things are happening in our universities; the real agenda here is for a wholesale expansion of punitive measures to make it far easier to terminate the employment of staff that universities deem to be unsatisfactory. This would certainly be achieved when this provision is coupled with others, such as those designed to expel representative employee organisations from industrial relations negotiations. The next issue goes to freedom of association. Under this bill, university enterprise agreements must be consistent with freedom of association principles contained in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, and institutions must neither encourage nor discourage membership of unions. This bill also imposes a condition prohibiting universities from using Commonwealth Grant Scheme funds to pay union staff salaries or to fund union facilities. The prohibition on the capacity of universities to use Commonwealth Grant Scheme funds to assist in the resourcing of offices, facilities or salaries of the local branch of a relevant union once again certainly exposes this government's anti-union agenda. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Prime Minister and major employer groups have, as we all know, repeatedly expressed the view that employers and employees should be free to choose the form of agreement that best suits them and should be free to determine for themselves alwhat should be included in their agreements. Yet here we have the great uninvited third party, the Commonwealth government, muscling into add confusion, complexity and regulation, in contradiction to their stated aims of choice and flexibility-the stated objects of their own primary piece of industrial relations legislation. The government is not seeking to prevent Commonwealth grant funds from being used to support facilities and salaries of non-union negotiators who may be involved in local bargaining; it is only seeking to prevent the funds from being used to assist the union negotiators. Once again this is a clear indication of this government's anti-union attitude. It is clear beyond doubt that this bill is yet a further attempt by the government to implement what can only be described as an ideologically driven, extreme industrial relations agenda-this time in the higher education sector. They are blackmailing our higher education institutions to create an environment where unions are weakened or destroyed so as to substantially diminish the terms and conditions of employment of staff. In contrast to this high-handed approach by the government to industrial relations, I want to highlight the principles that Labor has for industrial relations policy. The six key features of our position are that a Labor government would recognise the need for a strong safety net of minimum award wages and conditions; a strong independent umpire to assure fair wages and conditions and to settle disputes; the right of employees to bargain collectively for decent wages and conditions; the right of workers to reject individual contracts which cut pay and conditions and undermine collective bargaining and union representation; proper rights for Australian workers who are unfairly dismissed; and the right to join a union and to be represented by a union. These are the principles that Labor will base its industrial relations policy on. commitment is for a productive and fair industrial relations system and it wants to see a return to dignity as well as productivity in the workplace. If this bill is any guide, dignity and productivity in the workplace hardly seem to matter to this government. Through this bill, this government is creating a vehicle for the erosion of salaries and working conditions of university employees. Many of these very hard-won employment conditions will be wound back or lost if the bill proceeds. I just want to touch on some of the conditions that staff have previously negotiated and now enjoy but which will go. One area that universities, their staff and the unions have negotiated to improve is maternity leave. Maternity leave provisions have certainly been much improved in very many of our universities. The community standard for maternity leave under the Howard government is no paid leave at all. That is the community standard that universities will have to measure themselves against. So we could see thousands of university staff having their paid maternity leave conditions stripped back to that standard. We could see university staff across the country facing a major loss to their conditions. The best practice familyfriendly entitlements are 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and that has been offered at some 27 of our universities-very significant conditions at a large number of our universities. At a small number of universitiesseven universities-they actually have 36 weeks of paid maternity leave. Our concern is that those excellent family-friendly entitlements are going to be taken away from those staff if this legislation goes through. But paid maternity leave is not the only area where we are concerned there will be a reduction in conditions. There will also be threats to the restrictions on the number of casual staff that are employed in our univerIts sities. We currently have restrictions on the number of casual staff that can be employed. The Labor Party are certainly very concerned that as a result of this legislation those conditions will be removed. Another area where we may see a reduction in conditions is in redundancy pay arrangements. These are just some examples of areas of improved conditions that staff, their unions and the universities have negotiated over a period of time. The universities, the staff and the unions recognise that these are in the interests of the universities as well as in the interests of staff. That is why they have been negotiated and agreed upon. Now we have this incredibly heavy-handed legislation coming into the parliament saying that these conditions can be undermined by individual contracts that may have much lesser conditions. The government seems to have no regard for these hard-won conditions of employment that university staff and their unions have negotiated. These are conditions that staff depend on. We also know that students will be the great losers, particularly if staff lose the restriction on the number of casual staff employed in our universities. Students do need to know that there will be a decent number of full-time and ongoing staff, not huge numbers of casual staff that they can never find. It seems to me that this bill can only be described as following the extreme ideological agenda that we know this government has. I say very clearly to the government today that the Australian Labor Party will have no truck with legislation of this kind. We will not be supporting this bill. We will be opposing the bill with as much energy as we can muster and we will certainly be taking the fight on this legislation and this industrial relations agenda out into the community to support the conditions of university staff and to support the students' demand for high-quality education. We know that that education is going to be fundamentally threatened by this legislation, so we will certainly be strongly opposing it.",71
26,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I thought the last comment by the member for Jagajaga was probably the most illogical. The idea that a process that gives university administrations both an opportunity and a responsibility to select the best possible teachers and to reward those who are in that category is somehow harmful to students takes a little bit of working through, just does to refer to such an arrangement as some sort of extreme ideology. The extreme ideology is that of confining university educators to one category. It does not matter what their thoughts are or what subject they teach, but when it comes to remuneration you can put them in a box. Why do you need a box? Because that creates a job for certain people who have 50 per cent of the preselection rights over every Labor member in this place. That is the box and that is the situation. It was interesting when the figure dropped from 60 per cent to 50 per cent. What that means is that now you need just one other vote. The reality is that this legislation, the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005, is highly beneficial to students. University administrators are obliged to do no more than offer the choice of an AWA to those who might think that is the most appropriate way. If in that process the university thinks it is in its and the employees' interests to have extensive paid maternity leave, that is not prohibited under an AWA. The deal can be of any nature. The only prohibition, as I recollect, is that it cannot be worse than would be offered under the award system. As a consequence, a university administrator may decide that there are highly qualified good teachers-and the ability of a person to teach, as compared to the sum of their knowledge, is an aspect of education that is oft overlooked. When the university administrator takes that decision and if you are a HECS-paying student, then through whatever efficiency gains are involved-for instance, as this legislation requires, not having to divert scarce capital to pay union repsisn't there a possibility your HECS might be somewhat less as a consequence? Or is it laissez faire for university administrators to as it rack up the costs and impose them on the students? They have to pay their HECS out of their future personal income. Surely there is a responsibility on this parliament to ensure that university administrators cannot be bullied into a narrow employment program when it is probable that they could do better for their students, for their institution and, I might add, for the Australian taxpayer. We get this idea in here that the Minister for Education, Science and Training is the sole determinant of what people who are in receipt of huge sums of taxpayers' money can do and that he and possibly the residents of this place are the only people who should have a say about this. I would welcome the member for Jagajaga going out and telling students that any attempt to lower their HECS cost should be resisted at all times and that they, through their HECS, should pay union officials. I would like to participate with her in that argument. I would also welcome her telling students, what is more, that universities should not be efficient in attracting quality people to address and either tutor or lecture their students. What do you want from a university-some closed club that benefits only those who live there? I would have thought it was the other way around. There is an uninvited third party involved in workplace arrangements, according to the member for Jagajaga, whom she portrays as the government. No, it is the taxpayer. The uninvited third party, if one exists, is the payer, because that is whom we represent in this place. It is about time that certain people aspiring to government realised that the taxpayer votes. Sometimes I think they forget it. We are Australians. We do not come from one of these dictatorships that says one size fits all. Mr Fitzgibbon-It's changing.",76
27,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"If you want to have a bit of a gamble on the next election, you see me later and we will decide on the odds. But the reality is that people in Australia want choice. They demonstrate it by voting with their feet in primary and secondary schools. Do not tell me that is only occurring in the high-quality leafy suburbs of our capital cities. I remember opening the extension of a private school in the electorate of Brand. It was a religious school and it had to have all these extra classrooms because, within two years of opening with an estimated 50 or 60 students, it had exploded to something like 300. Who made that decision? Mr Fitzgibbon-Why didn't you get the local member to do it? Did you invite the local member?",77
28,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I welcome the interjection, because it is just evidence of how distanced the opposition are from the desires of the average Australian. I hope they keep it up. They can fight against these sorts of reforms as much as they like, because there is only one side of the parliament that you can occupy when you talk like that. It is great; it guarantees the re-election of the Howard government in future years, because the people make these decisions. I think at some point the member for Rankin, who interjected, said, ‘They're not stupid.' He is quite right. But he does not behave in that fashion when he interjects on me when I raise these logical arguments that the cost of running a university is a direct cost to taxpayers and taxtheir children which is added to their HECS tax burden. There is the issue of casualisation. Casualisation is highly beneficial to many people seeking employment who do not want a full time job. I have worked extremely hard to get a small university development in Geraldton in my electorate. We had to talk with the locals. It is quite unique in that places were granted in a town that had no university. It has one now, and it has a $3 million taxpayer funded investment in the buildings that will be associated with that university. We talked about the local human resource to tutor and the things we could do if a university facility was operating in a town of 30,000 people. We were astounded. We had PhDs coming out of the air-retirees who wanted the challenge of part-time work, who wanted to be a casual worker because they did not want full-time work and who wanted some mental stimulation. They had these wonderful qualifications to assist the kids of Geraldton but, to hear the member for Jagajaga, that is some sort of criminal activity. The same applies to families seeking to add to their revenue, where one partnerwho would be supporting the children during the week-wants to work on weekends. But we still have all these silly ideas that, if you take casual work on a weekend, you have to be paid twice as much to do it. So the employer says, ‘I'm sorry, I've just locked the gate; I cannot afford to employ you on the weekend,' yet there are people asking for that type of work because it suits their family arrangements-and I could expand on that with past experience. There is the idea that one size fits all, the member for Jagajaga told us that the body of all bodies-the Industrial Relations Commission-came to some decision, as though that was the only one upon which people were entitled to arrange their employment. I would imagine Joseph Stalin or someone like him would think that was a good idea. Personally, I hold to the view that, if someone wants to go to their employer, if they cannot be exploited under the law-in other words, there is a minimum wage that has been set and this legislation accommodates that, as does all the AWA legislationwhy can't they do it? Let me say that, with respect to 36 weeks paid maternity leave, it is great if you can get it, but that is a very expensive process considering who pays the bills. I think it is grossly unfair to married women with children who go back to work because income is needed to pay the mortgage and to pay for other things, or maybe to save enough money to put their kids through private school. One of the more surprising things in my life has been the number of government school teachers I know who are back teaching in government schools so they have enough money to put their kids into private schools. Mr Fitzgibbon-Name them.",77
29,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I do not do those sorts of things; that is the preserve of the opposition. They go and blackguard people by way of questions, and of course the member for Jagajaga has had more experience in that than most people. All in all, this legislation takes nothing away. It creates a further option for the employer and the employee. Recently, I did some checking because of the hoo-ha about the proposed new industrial relations legislation and the advertising that was conducted by the ACTU that said that virtually overnight everyone would be on an AWA. and There are a lot of opportunities for AWAs under present legislation and only 15 per cent of workers are so covered. That has been a matter of choice. There are employers who do not care or do not want to do it and there are employees who would decline it. One matter that I have raised in this place on many occasions is that, whether you be the vice-chancellor of a university or the person who does the hiring and firing, you do not have a habit of sacking your best worker because you got up feeling a bit grumpy that morning, which is an inference we hear from the other side so frequently. If I were an active small businessman today, I would be trying to get a class action for defamation relating to that advertisement that shows a typical small business employer-who happens to conduct his business during the night, and there are a few-ringing one of his employees, who he knew had two children, and telling them to come to work or risk the sack. For a start, that would be illegal under future legislation, because it is unlawful. But the reality is that it is a terrible indictment, an insult to the typical small business person-who probably lives next door to some trade union official or attends the same church-to suggest that they would ever do that. I believe it is defamatory, but of course people have got so used to these sorts of protestations that they pass through to the keeper. The reality is that, under these arrangements, those people who manage and administer universities will seek out the best people they want to keep. It is those people to whom they will be offering AWAs and, as is typical in the other AWAs, the remuneration and the rewards will be higher. I use the example, published in the West Australian, of a bulldozer driver in the Pilbara-he had his name published and had no difficulty-who said: ‘I took an AWA. My wages went up by $20,000 a year and I was given staff superannuation.' As I have said in writing in my electorate, you wonder how the employer could be so generous. It was because they were able to escape the industrial agreement and did not have to have two drivers for that bulldozer at all times and a shed for the driver who could not fit on the bulldozer to sit in and read books or play cards with others in the same category. Imagine it-an industrial agreement, negotiated by trade unionists, which creates two jobs when a bulldozer seat can only fit one person! That is not good for anybody-and it filters through. And worse, when it relates to institutions such as universities, which are primarily publicly funded, it is a terrible burden on the taxpayer. This legislation has a simple purpose. As is probably necessary, it gives some protection to the administrator by insisting that, when they attempt to have some AWAs, they will not have another group of trade unionists saying it will not mark kids' papers. We know that has happened in the past. The legislation gives them that protection. Otherwise, it says to them and to the employees, ‘You have the freedom of choice to operate under award conditions-with the difficulties, costs and relatively low rewards that that encompasses-or to sit down and negotiate a fair arrangement with someone you probably went to university with in the first place.' If you are good, and the AWA is not good enough, your employer knows that you have the opportunity to go somewhere else. I see that Telstra executives have denied today that they have made a crash-and-burn decision to dismiss some 14,000 people. I doubt that sincerely, and they have denied it. When one looks at America and around the world, there is an interesting history. When rationalisation of work forces commencedand the newspapers were each day full of very substantial redundancies-the more redundancies there were, the less unemployment there was. In other words, businesses got efficient and created other jobs. Anyone can check the statistics. When we had all the mass redundancies, unemployment did not go up; it started to come down. It is quite interesting. As I think I read in the US when it was happening, a typical worker was unemployed for only 30 days before they got another job-even though tens of thousands were being made redundant at the time. I think those statistics are worth consideration. Everybody feels sad for a person who loses their job, but, if the economic system is working well, another job is just around the corner. There is a suggestion that casual work is an anathema in the workplace-but it is not. It is considered highly desirable by a large percentage of people because of family or other circumstances. Maybe they are retired or would just like to be doing something that adds to their income. As I said, in the case of universities, it can give people the stimulation that they suddenly realise they abandoned by going into retirement. If that is bad, I would like proof thereof. I think it is part of the process and not necessarily the result of AWAs. Of course all employers should offer AWAs to those who want them. The evidence is that not everyone takes them-that is in the statistics.",78
30,Dr EMERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is the responsibility of any government to ensure an equal opportunity in life for all of its young citizens, yet this government has spectacularly failed to do so. When we look back at the nine long years of this government, it is easy to recall a range of scandals that have plagued it. But the great scandal of the Howard government's term in office is its neglect of higher education-its unwillingness to ensure that every young Australian has the capacity to go from school to higher education irrespective of their income or their ents' income. Surely it is a most fundamental right in a democratic society that everyone has an equal chance in life, but that is not a philosophy with which this government agrees. Instead, the government uses legislation such as the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 to pursue its extreme ideological agenda. It is obsessed with changing the industrial relations arrangements in every part of the Australian work force-in this case, the university work force. Where are the massive inefficiencies and restrictive work practices in the university sector that this government alleges it is attacking through this legislation? By and large, the work force in the university sector is flexible. There are opportunities to pay the better-performing academics at higher rates. A case has not been made by this government, or by its supporters, for this legislation. As we know, the government extends its extreme agenda into other areas of the university system with its ideological pursuit of student unionism. The big kids on the other side of the parliament who practised student politics in preparation for parliament continue to practise student politics to get square with those they took exception to in their university days. As a result, the debate on the government side of this parliament about university education consists almost entirely of arguments about changing the industrial relations arrangements and changing the student unionism arrangements. Therein lies the scandal, because there should be a proper debate across this parliament about university funding and the performance of our universities. That debate has not occurred on the government side. On many occasions we on the opposition side have sought to engage in that debate, which is so vital to Australia's future. The shadow par- education minister routinely comes into the chamber to argue for a better system of higher education in this country, but we always get diverted into arguments about voluntary student unionism and industrial relations changes. The coalition government's attitudes to university education mark a huge departure from the philosophy of the last three decades in Australia, which emphasised talent and hard work over capacity to pay. The government's philosophy was no better demonstrated than in the Prime Minister's statement on 6 March 2005: ... 30 years ago, we started getting this foolish bind that everybody had to go to university. What is wrong with going to university? What is wrong with making a university education available to every young person who is committed to doing the hard work and who has the talent? This government practises a prejudice whereby the sons and daughters of affluent and already privileged Australians have some automatic right to go on to university but the sons and daughters of working Australians do not-they should be diverted into technical and vocational education. We know that the Whitlam Labor government introduced a university education that was free of charge and that the Hawke Labor government embarked upon a very ambitious program of expanding the number of university places. The philosophy that bound the Whitlam and Hawke Labor governments was one of ensuring that every young Australian had the opportunity to develop their talents based on hard work at university. The Hawke government introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, or HECS, which is a loan to students repayable out of future income designed to enable them to make some contribution to the cost of their university education. Vitally, though, the extra funding generated out of HECS was used to expand the number of university places so that all young people could have that equal opportunity in life. The repayment of HECS was conditional upon the graduate reaching a specified income threshold and those who did not reach that level of income were not obliged to repay the loan. The Hawke government set the level of HECS fees so as to only partially recover the full cost of a university degree, and that was around 20 to 30 per cent of recurrent costs. The purpose of limiting cost recovery to only part of the full cost of a university degree was a recognition of the wider benefits to the community of our young people going on and gaining a university education. This government does not seem to accept that there are wider benefits to Australia from having people undertake a university education. Why do I say that? Because in 1997 the Howard government increased HECS charges by between-wait for this-31 and 119 per cent, depending on the course. At the same time, the Howard government reduced the income threshold at which repayments of HECS begin by 30 to 40 per cent. It also provided for full fee paying Australian students but without a loan scheme. Consequently, the take-up rate was very small, presumably because students did not have the money to pay full up-front fees. An analysis of the socio-economic composition of university enrolments from 1988, just before the introduction of HECS, to 1999, well after the introduction of HECS, found: ... HECS did not discourage university participaHatton, tion in general or among individuals from low wealth groups. It also stated that HECS: ... has had no discernible effects on the access of the disadvantaged to higher education. That analysis was conducted by the architect of HECS, Professor Bruce Chapman. The fundamental problem here is that, since coming to office in 1996, the Howard government has increased grants to universities at a rate slower than the cost increases that those universities have experienced-in other words, less than full indexation. But, if the saga that I have already described is not bad enough, in 2005 profound changes were made to the funding arrangements for universities by the Howard government. First, universities were allowed to increase their already substantial HECS fees by up to 25 per cent, and most universities took the opportunity to do that. Why? Because they are starved of cash-a deliberate policy of this government. Second, the HECS repayment threshold was lifted from $26,500 a year to just over $36,000 a year. In itself that was a step in the right direction, so I recognise that. But, third, a massive retrograde step was taken in that universities were permitted to fill up to 35 per cent of places for Australian students with full fee paying students. Fourth, to assist these full fee paying students an income related loan like HECS called FEE-HELP was introduced, but it was capped at $50,000. So, if the cost of the course was greater than $50,000, you could only get FEE-HELP up to $50,000. We know from the minister's own mouth that there are at least 47 university degrees that cost more than $100,000 and some cost up to $200,000. So a FEE-HELP arrangement capped at $50,000 does not help constituents from your electorate, for example, Mr Deputy Speaker who do not have the ready cash to make up the difference between a $50,000 loan and the $100,000 and $200,000 university fees. Of the four measures, the lifting of the income repayment threshold for HECS was a positive move, and I acknowledge that. It benefits those students, especially women, who might expect their incomes following graduation not to exceed $36,000 a year. In those circumstances those graduates would never had to repay their HECS debts. But the other changes will be very damaging. Cash starved universities will need to avail themselves of alternative funding sources such as HECS fee increases and full fee paying students. Most universities took the opportunity to increase their HECS charges by a full 25 per cent and the FEE-HELP arrangements will encourage a much bigger take-up by full fee paying Australian students. The effect of capping FEE-HELP at $50,000 for courses that cost more than that is to oblige students to make an up-front contribution before they have completed their university education. An analysis of the HECS fee increases conducted by Professor Bruce Chapman and Gillian Beer concludes: ... the government will be transferring the problem associated with indexation shortfalls away from taxpayers to students. It is difficult to lieve that the current pre-2005 HECS levels are markedly below what they should be. It also says the 2005 HECS increases rest: ... uneasily with the economic rationale for public sector additional financial support, which suggests that activities associated with spill-over social benefits should be subsidised by taxpayers; in other words, that students should pay less than the full costs of the activity. Hear, hear! I agree completely. The same analysis by Professor Chapman and Gillian Beer of the capping of FEE-HELP at $50,000 concludes that it has the: ... potential to jeopardise the access of those who expect to receive relatively low future incomes. It says this is: ... very regressive when viewed in a lifetime context. Cash starved universities will have every incentive to lift the proportion of their students who are paying full fees and to correspondingly reduce the proportion of subsidised places-that is, places subsidised by HECS. In what must be the most celebrated interview that has occurred in the nine long years of this government, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, on 4 August 2004-the morning after Professor Bruce Chapman had delivered his verdictengaged in an extraordinary dialogue with Jon Faine. I do confess to having mentioned this before, so I will not go through the entire transcript, as entertaining as that is. But to give members a flavour of this interview, Jon Faine said: Well don't you think it's fair that anyone from any family no matter what their capacity to pay but just on their sheer ability should have an equal chance? That is a very good question. The minister replied: be- Well the situation in theory, you are right. The minister went on to say: ... the situation we have got at the moment is that ... you miss out on a HECS place, whether you are rich or poor the university will offer you a full fee paying place, at the moment, until our reforms start next year, if you are poor, you are just as likely to say ‘I can't afford it, love to do it'. So instead you take up a HECS place in a uni you don't want to be at. Jon Faine says: And someone else who can just write out a cheque … Nelson: Exactly! Faine: … because Daddy has got the money in the bank … Nelson: Exactly! Faine: … buys that place and that is not fair. Nelson: You are absolutely right Jon. This is government policy. The minister very confidently went into the cabinet room to get that $50,000 limit on FEE-HELP removed and got rolled by his colleagues the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Instead they have diverted down this path of trying to change the workplace relations arrangements in universities and have a crack at student unionism. What should have happened is that the minister should have won that battle. The fact that he did not win that cabinet battle makes him impotent and it also demonstrates that this government does not believe that there are wider benefits for our society of young Australians completing a university education. The truth is these fee increases that have come into effect from 2005 have made Australia an even less affordable place to go to university. An international comparison of the affordability of a university education finds that Australia ranks a lowly 11th out of the 15 countries-these are developed countries-that were examined. Australian university students must find an average of more than $14,000 a year to meet education and living costs, making Australia the fifth most expensive place to study. That was before these fee increases came in.G Australia stands out among OECD countries as the one country where increases in private spending on education have substituted for rather than complemented extra public spending. The OECD said: In fact, many OECD countries with the highest growth in private spending have also shown the highest increase in public funding of education. This indicates that increasing private spending tertiary education tends to complement, rather than replace, public investment. The main exception to this is Australia, where the shift private expenditure at tertiary level has been companied by a fall in the level of public expenditure in real terms. Now we hear the Treasurer fondly quoting the OECD all the time. According to him, it is a great, reliable source and a very reputable outfit. Here is the OECD fingering Australia as one of the very few countries-the main exception amongst OECD countrieswhere there has not been an increase in public funding to complement increases in private funding of universities. I said at the outset of this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 that the higher education performance of this government is a scandal and that is best summarised by the OECD with that damning indictment. We have to increase the number of university places, including HECS places, in Australia if we are to be and remain competitive in this, the Asian century. India alone will be the third largest economy in the world by about 2015. It has 500 million Indians below the age of 25 and it churns out more than six million university graduates a year, two million of whom speak English. China, nearby, produces 3.4 million university graduates a year. Australia produces 215,000 graduates a year. Of course, we are not the size of India or China, but 215,000 are far too few. In 1970 only around eight per cent of Australian high school leavers went on to higher education. The introduction of HECS by the previous Labor government allowed the number of university places to be expanded, helping to double the proportion of school leavers going on to university from 15 per cent in 1983 to 30 per cent in 1999. But, following the coalition government's changes to HECS and its unwillingness to adequately on fund universities, all of the growth in commencing undergraduate numbers since the change of government in 1996-this is very towards important, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - has been in acforeign full fee paying students. There has been no discernable growth in the number of Australian students going through our universities. All of the growth has been in foreign full fee paying students because cash starved universities have no option but to prefer foreign full fee paying students to Australian students. Surely that is a scandal of massive proportions in this country-that Australian universities must choose foreign full fee paying students over Australian students just to keep those universities going. Of course we support the education export industry in Australia, but it should not be the expense of Australian students-yet it has been in a most spectacular way, and the results are already coming in. Following the changes in 2005 universities responded in the expected way: they reduced the number of HECS places by more than 8,000 while increasing the number of full fee paying places by 2,500. The increase in HECS fees has contributed to 12,000 fewer applications for university study by Australian students. This is a damning indictment of this government. We need to harness the best of private resources and public resources to ensure that all young people have that great opportunity in life of a higher education. That is why I am proposing that we engage with the private sector in the development of the cept of human capital contracts, where the private sector itself can be involved in the financing of the higher education of Australian students, so we can actually create ciety here in Australia in which every young person who works hard and has talent is able to go to university and not be deterred by massive fees.

31,Mr CADMAN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Mitchell) (1.47 pm)Australian universities are attracting overseas students because of the quality of the education they provide. Higher education is an extremely competitive commodity in the world and students from Asia, from the Middle East and, in fact, from countries where there is a more than adequate university vision look around the world to find a university which best suits the components of their professional career-and Australia is a part of that competitive environment. Students from Singapore will look just as easily to the United States as to Europe, to Britain or to Australia. Why is it that we are attracting so many overseas students to our places of higher learning? It is because of the quality and the components of the courses that students coming to Australia can participate at in. They are relevant to our environment, they are relevant to the South Pacific and South-East Asia, they carry a typical Australian practical bent and they are usually linked with a capacity to acquire the English language. That, as a package, is something that really attracts students to our shores. Unless we remain competitive, in the sense that we continue to offer the very highest quality and the very best value in higher education in this competitive world, students will not want to come to Australia. What does that mean? That Australian universities would not carry the regard in the international community that they now carry. They would not be looked upon as great places of learning. They would not be regarded by con- businesspeople, governments and academia around the world as a place for an appointment, for a placement or for an opportunity to begin a career or a profession. That is a sowhat this Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 is about. This legislation is about providing and building on the groundwork already laid down by successive governments, but it is only through this government that the competitive edge and the need to meet that competition and to survive in the world around us has been recognised. It will not serve us well if the universities of Australia were only for Australian students, if our universities were not open to pro- this competitive demand. What would it mean? We would become an isolated academic backwater where our students would work within Australia and provide for Australia's needs perhaps but would not be in demand, as they are at the moment around the world, to go into high positions of all types. The number of Australians running large corporations throughout the world, in Europe and the United States indicates the quality of our education. You can go anywhere in academia, in large corporations and in government and find Australians punching well above their weight because the quality of that individual and their training and their education is valued-and it is valued because they can make a contribution in the wider universal environment. This legislation seeks to retain that tage for this nation. I know there are some who would say, ‘We have a brain drain going on; we are losing some of the best people.' Most Aussies come back-most of them say home is where they want to be eventually. They may marry overseas, they may have some of their family overseas, but eventually they want to come back here. What is it about Australia that attracts Australians back and attracts overseas students as well? It is the lifestyle, the environment and the attitude that Australians have of being able to cope with any problem and to use their initiative to solve anything that confronts them. This combination of environment, lifestyle and basic, quality education is what we must foster and what we must encourage. This legislation seeks to do that in a very mild way. Listening to the Labor Party, you would think that the sky is going to fall in. But what is the proposition in this legislation put forward by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson? The proposition is that universities should offer a choice to their staff of whether they go onto salary and conditions set by an academic board or whether they should be given an individual contract, an Australian workplace agreement. Minister Brendan Nelson has said that universities need to do this to stay competitive to attract some of the best people from around the world. But he has gone a step further and said, ‘Unless you have done that by the middle of next year, you are not going to have the advantage of increases to your budget supplied by the federal government.' Universities are strange: we supply all the money and they come under state law-but that is Australia. So universities will not be able to gain the increases in funding of five per cent in 2006 and 7.5 per cent in 2007 unless they give that choice. It does not seem a difficult proposition, yet it is being opposed by the Australian advan- Labor Party, who cannot understand why people should have choice and why they should not be regimented into a single stream of academic control. We need to make this change. The Australian government has committed an additional $11 billion to higher education over the last 10 years, including through the 2003 package, Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future. That seeks to provide the funds but, to listen to the Australian Labor Party, it is all about the money and not about the quality. It is not about the working conditions and your aspirations. It is not about your visions, your goals and what you are seeking to achieve; it is about how much money there is. That is not the total consideration. There must be more to it than that. If we are going to maintain our position in world education then we need to start with the questions: ‘What are our universities going to be offering over the next five or 10 years? Are they going to remain as competitive, relevant and significant in our region?' That is what this legislation seeks to do. On 29 April 2005 this provision was announced by the Hon. Kevin Andrews, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and Dr Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training. They announced these reforms, which are consistent with the government's agenda. There is no coercion or force behind this; there is just the offer of choice for people about the circumstances under which they may choose to work. It adds greater flexibility than certified agreements. It allows universities to choose particular staff of great value or prize and to offer them-that is, the individual staff member-something a little different to what is currently being offered. As with collective agreements, these Australian workplace agreements are subject to the no-disadvantage test, so a person coming in at a certain level will not get less; they will get the same or more. The nodisadvantage test applies to this choice being offered to people coming into Australian universities. This enhances the flexibility. gives people an opportunity to broaden the courses offered. It means that they do not have to continue with courses that have lost relevance and are no longer significant in the Australian environment or in demand in the international community. That flexibility of staff is something that universities have been seeking for some time-the flexibility to be able to offer courses that are relevant to needs, that will respond to market pressures and that will respond to the demands of our immediate environment. By November this year, all universities will need to meet the requirements in their workplace policies and practices, except where compliance with the requirements would be directly inconsistent with a higher education provider's obligations under its existing certified agreements as at 29 April 2005. These are reasonable propositions. It is not a harsh process but one of encouragement to move in a certain direction and at the same time remain flexible and competitive. All universities will be required to comply with the workplace reforms and national government protocol every year after 2007, in order to maintain their funding. I think the advantages are many. Australia needs to be committed to promoting the sustainability of universities, to enable them to attract, retain and reward the very best people in their academic staff. This legislation is in line with the government's broad workplace relations agenda. The reforms are not driving down the conditions and wages of university employees or giving staff fewer rights than other Australians. The reforms are designed to support a workplace relations system in universities that is focused on greater freedom, flexibility and individual choice. There can be no argument about the benefits of that, and Australia is moving, in a general sense, in that direction. The workplace relations reforms that will be in place It before the end of this year in the broader community will reflect the government's wish and, I believe, the wish of most Australians that there should be greater freedom, flexibility and individual choice in our workplaces. The Australian workplace agreements offer greater facility than the certified agreements commonly used in universities. Australian universities need to be able to attract and keep the very best staff and reward them appropriately so that those staff can provide for the graduates who add lustre to Australia's reputation and who can take the positions that they go into so easily in any part of the world and return to Australia, making a wonderful contribution to our life here. If universities fail to attract and retain those talents, Australia is the loser. It is not the intention of this government to focus on a narrow unionor academic-driven agenda that restricts choice and options as regards staff and limits our opportunities and capacity to compete in the wider world of education. In response to issues raised by this sector, there have been two amendments to the legislation. I commend this legislation House.",84

33,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Acting Prime Minister, in the gallery today are a number emergency service workers, firefighters, who risk their lives for others every day. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that career firefighters in Victoria are currently entitled up to eight weeks annual leave and 12 days sick leave a year, more than the government's proposed minimum of four weeks annual leave and eight days sick leave per year? Will the Acting Prime Minister guarantee that under the government's industrial relations changes these firefighters will not have their annual leave or sick leave reduced to the government's minimum standard?",87
34,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I refer him to comments that the Prime Minister has previously made with regard to the development of this legislation and the government's tion, particularly those relevant to existing conditions that people have in their employment. Foreign Aid",87
35,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Acting Prime Minister, Minister for Trade and Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the Acting Prime Minister outline to the House how Australia is enhancing its foreign aid program? How can effective aid, good governance and trade liberalisation lift to the people out of poverty?",87
36,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and his interest in this matter. Members would be aware of the announcement made by the Prime Minister in New York this morning with regard to our aid contributions into the future. The Australian government believes that it is the combination of aid, improved governance and trade liberalisation that provides the greatest opportunity for developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty. It is not one individual element or another. As the Prime Minof ister has announced overnight at the UN world leaders summit, Australia aims to double its foreign aid commitment to more than $4 billion a year by 2010. This is projected to to take our commitment to 0.36 per cent of gross national income, the highest level since 1986. The government's decision is a reflection of the generosity of the Australian people, as evidenced in the response by the Australian people to the tsunami disaster in Indonesia recently. Importantly, the aid will be conditional on strengthened governance and reduced corruption. Australia is already taking a leading role to assist developing nations, particularly in our own neighbourhood, the Asia-Pacific region, as evidenced by our strong support for the RAMSI mission in the Solomon Isposilands and our enormous program of assistance in Papua New Guinea. However, as the Prime Minister has said, aid alone will not end poverty. It can make a significant contribution, but it will not end poverty. On the trade front we have liberalised our markets, giving 50 least developed countries tariff-free access to the Australian market as a contribution to poverty alleviation, and we continue to push, through the Cairns Group, for a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organisation Doha Round, where reform of agriculture, so crucial for developing nations, has become a major sticking point. To make the point again, Australia has announced that we propose to significantly increase our level of overseas aid. That will significantly help, particularly in our neighbourhood, the alleviation of poverty. But with that we need to see improved governance and as well as trade liberalisationand, most importantly and particularly, trade liberalisation in the area of agricultural trade liberalisation-to help alleviate poverty and lift many of the least developed countries and developing countries out of that poverty trap that they find themselves in today. Education: Funding",87
37,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to Minister for Education, Science and Training. I draw the minister's attention to the OECD's report Education at a glance 2005. Isn't the minister ashamed that Australia is the only country in the OECD to actually reduce spending on university and vocational education as a proportion of GDP since 1995? Does the minister understand that public funding for tertiary education in comparable OECD countries has risen by 38 per cent since 1995, while public investment in Australia fell by eight per cent in that riod? How does the minister explain that every student in the United States benefits from almost $4,000 more in government funding than Australian students? Minister, do you now accept the evidence proving the government is deserting Australian students?",88
38,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The simple answer to the question is no. In fact, across the OECD, participation in higher education is measured differently. In this country we have increased over the last decade the proportion of Australians with a university education from nine per cent to almost 20 per cent of the Australian population. I might also add that in the last nine years the revenues available to Australian universities have increased more than $4 billion-and $2½ billion of that has come from the Australian government. On the question of universities and university funding, however, I was a little bit surprised this morning when I woke up and I read this in the Australian newspaper under the headline ‘Student “stocks” to bolster unis': Banks and superannuation funds would be called on to help students through university by offering “education stocks” under radical proposals to double the number of university places by 2020. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question is all about public investment in our",88
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is in order.,88
40,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked about the financing of Australian universities and the participation by Australians in education and university in particular, compared to other countries. The story in the Australian goes on to say that we should double the number of university places by 2020 and move toMs Macklin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance once again. What the pe- minister is going on with now has nothing to do with the question.",88
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind all members that, when a lengthy question is posed, it does offer a minister the opportunity to answer all parts of that question. I would expect the minister to address the question.",88
42,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of financing education and university education, and the number of Australians who actually attend university: the Australian goes on to report that the member for Rankin apparently has a book that is forthcoming-one of a number of books. In it, he is proposing that he would finance participation in universities with a ‘human capital contract'. He says: Under this proposal, you would basically enter into an arrangement with a private financier to cover tuition costs and living expenses. He goes on to say: This is an equity investment. What distinguishes equity from debt is you get a percentage of future earnings rather than a flat amount. So here we have the member for Rankin proposing, firstly, to double the number of Australians in universities by 2020 and, secondly, that Australian students would actually go along to a private bank or superannuation fund to get the financing for it and that the bank or fund would make an equity investment in the education of the person taking it. In other words, the Labor Party, which today has a policy that bans Australians from paying full fees in their own universities, would propose to ban the government sponsored loan scheme for those students, yet the Labor Party backbench is proposing to send loan schemes out to the private sector. I point out to the member for Rankin, firstly, that Labor Party policy is totally opposed to what he is proposing, but if he wants to have a chat to me about it I am happy to see him. The second thing he needs to appreciate is that, if we were to double the number of Australians going to university by 2020, we would need another 700,000 Australians in the system. By 2020, population growth will be less than half of one per cent. We are currently growing at 1.2. The Treasurer said in last year's budget, in relation to the baby bonus: ‘Have one for yourself, one for your wife and one for your family.' You would have to add to that: ‘Have nine for the universities.' The Labor Party is totally obsessed with higher education. It wants to double the number of people going to university. We will be trawling through nursing homes saying: ‘You look all right. Why don't you go back and do an economics degree?' That is the kind of madness that is gripping the Labor Party: ideologues on the front bench who are opposed to the private sector and ideologues on the back bench wanting to send students off to banks. Foreign Aid",88
43,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of the recent developments in relation to Australia's aid and efforts to reduce global poverty?,89
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question. I can inform the House that in the current financial year of 2005-06 the Australian government has allocated $2.5 billion for international aid. That is a very substantial sum, and it compares to the allocation in the year 2000 of $1.6 billion. Since the year 2000-01, Australia has increased its international aid by over 30 per cent in real terms. That is aid which is going out to people in the Third World particularly who need improvement in services such as health and education. Overnight, the government announced that it is proposing to increase Australia's aid commitment by 2010 to around $4 billion-that is, from $2½ billion up to $4 billion in 2010-where the aid to GDP ratio would be around 0.37 per cent on current expectations. Australia focuses its aid program particularly in the Pacific and in our near neighbourhood. For example, under the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development, Australia made the largest single aid commitment it has ever made in the history of this country when Australians opened their hearts and their wallets to help people affected in Aceh by the Boxing Day tsunami. That money is now being allocated to important projects not just in Aceh, where Australia is building hospitals and schools, but throughout the whole of Indonesia, as Australia uses that calamity to draw closer to our nearest neighbour and to reach out a helping hand from a strong economy to help the people of Indonesia. As we increase our aid, we will be focusing it on the Pacific in particular. Why? Because it is in the Pacific that Australia can make the biggest difference. The Pacific is Australia's area of obligation and Australia's area of influence. Many of the European countries which have been colonial powers in Africa naturally focus on Africa rather than on the Pacific, which is Australia's specific area of interest and influence. So we will ensure that as that aid grows it is focused on areas where it is needed, it is done in a transparent way, it is done in a way which is accountable to Australian taxpayers, it gets past corrupt governments and it gets to the people who really need it. The last thing I would like to say is that, with the increase in aid, we should never, ever forget this principle: as good as aid is, can only go so far in helping developing economies and people in poverty. The biggest contribution that could be made to people in developing countries would be to reform the world trading order. Let me give you these figures. The World Bank has estimated that trade liberalisation would deliver an additional $350 billion to developing countries by 2015. This compares with an estimated total overseas development aid from all developed countries of around $79 billion in 2004. If you want some idea of proportion, overseas aid is delivering about one-quarter of what trade liberalisation could deliver to the developing world. Although Australia will increase its aid allocation, as announced by the Prime Minister, we should never take our eyes off trade liberalisation to allow economies to develop and to give better standards of living to those who are now living in poverty in the Third World.

46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The leader will come to his question.,90
47,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"but my question, first, is to the Acting Prime Minister. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Earlier this year you ruled on preambles. The Leader of the Opposition continues to flout your ruling and I ask that you sanction him for that.",90
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have asked the Leader of the Opposition to come to his question.,90
49,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister guarantee that there will be no radiit cal moves to strip Telstra workers out of rural and regional Australia following the passage of the legislation to fully privatise Telstra?,90
50,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question on Telstra and the process of privatisation that is currently being debated. At the same time, it is important to note the overall Connect Australia package that the government has put forward as part of the policy setting for the future of telecommunications in Australia. It is very important that we recognise what that will do. Telecommunications services to rural and regional Australia will be significantly enhanced by the injection of $3.1 billion. It is important also to note that that will require the commitment and the investment of Telstra into the future. The conditions that we are putting on the licensing arrangements for the work that they have to do to maintain those levels of services across Australia, and particularly in regional Australia, will obviously require a very large work force as far as Telstra is concerned. I make the point that, yesterday, the Australian Labor Party-both here and in the other place-asked questions about some report on the staffing of Telstra into the future. Those questions were based on some commentary in the media over a week ago. It forced Telstra to release a statement yesterday which said that there was no such report. Telstra sent a letter to the ASX which, in part, said: Telstra has not taken any decision to cut 10,000 jobs as stated by Senator Conroy or 14,000 jobs as reported in the media. Senator Conroy has referred to a 104 page document. Telstra is not aware of the specific document referred to. are no documents of which Telstra is aware recommending job cuts of the magnitude referred to by Senator Conroy. I table the letter from Telstra. I repeat: the commitment the government is making to the future of telecommunications across Australia is to ensure there is adequate investment in future technology so that services are maintained, particularly in regional Australia, and, as a result, there will be greater competition in the telecommunications sector across Australia. Telecommunications",90
51,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Would the Acting Prime Minister inform the House of the importance of telecommunications to rural and regional areas? Would he also inform the House of any alternative views?,91
52,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. Ever since he joined this place, the member for Hinkler has taken a very keen interest in telecommunications as Chair of the Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services, which looks after the interests in this area. The member asked about the importance of telecommunications Australia-wide but particularly in rural and regional Australia. This government takes the issue of telecommunications and its importance to Australians, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, very seriously. I point out again that the Connect Australia telecommunications package will give Australians access to first-class telecommunications services. The $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband and mobile phone services will start on 1 January 2006. When was the last time you ever heard of an Australian Labor Party policy proposal that spent that sort of money on telecommunications-over and above that There which is being invested by the major provider and other providers? When was the last time you heard it? You have not. The package also delivers a $2 billion communications fund. Earnings from that fund will be available to provide new communications technology for rural Australia into the future. It will provide a more robust regulatory framework to give assurance to consumers across Australia about their services. Importantly, it enhances the competition framework and further strengthens safeguards to protect consumers. Yesterday afternoon in Canberra, this package received the support of the National Farmers Federation. This is quite significant because the NFF have been in active consultation with the government for many months on this package. They have been working constructively with the government to ensure that their members and those electors across regional Australia receive what they deserve. Mr Martin Ferguson-You sold them out.",91
53,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is not what Peter Corish said. He did not say that they were sold out; he said he supports the package. I quote from the NFF release, which said: NFF believes that the proposed legislative package, associated funding and assurances from Government in regard to programs and other matters, will secure quality affordable telecommunications services now and into the future for farmers and rural Australians, irrespective of the ownership of any provider. NFF supports the passage of the current package of Telecommunications Bills through Parliament. That is the peak farm body of Australia out publicly yesterday supporting this package because they agree with the government. They agree with the government that this will deliver a much improved telecommunications system to rural and regional Australia tomorrow and well into the future, with the guarantees attached to that. I table a copy of their press release. NA",91

55,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and follows the one I asked previously on the existence of radical plans to cut the Telstra work force. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to an email sent by Telstra's Chief Operations Officer, Mr Greg Winn, to other Telstra executives on 16 August 2005. It states in relation to Telstra job losses, ‘Do not expect any radical moves to strip people out until we are ready.' Acting Prime Minister, isn't Telstra waiting for the Telstra bills to pass before cutting thousands of jobs across Australia? Why won't you come clean before the bills are passed?",92

58,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is a matter on the public record in terms of what Telstra proposes to do. All I have to say in response to the Leader of the Opposition with regard to employment in Telstra is that, under the guidance of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the relevant minister during the eighties and nineties, there were 20,000 jobs cut from Telstra's predecessor, Telecom, in New South Wales alone. Business Reforms",92
59,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of recent international reports on the ease of doing business in Australia? What reforms would improve opportunities and what are the barriers to those reforms?,92
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question. Yesterday the World Bank released a publication entitled Doing business in 2006: creTelstra ating jobs. It ranked 155 economies around the world on the basis of 10 indicators. Of those 155 economies, it ranked Australia as the sixth-best business-friendly economy in the world. There were five in front of Australia: New Zealand, Singapore, the US, Canada and Norway. There were 149 behind Australia, including such economies as the UK, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany. Australia ranked very well on starting a business, which was the second easiest in Australia of anywhere in the world; on getting credit, where we ranked very well; and on business taxes. The survey found that a medium sized company in Australia had to spend 107 hours and pay 37 per cent of gross profit in taxes. The OECD average was 192 hours, paying 46.1 per cent of profit in taxes. Areas where Australia could improve its business environment are in securing rights to property, investor protection, and hiring and firing workers. That is what this government proposes to do to improve industrial relations and make Australia an even better place to do business. I am asked what the barriers to reform in Australia are. The largest barrier to reform in Australia is the Australian Labor Party. Mr Tanner interjecting",92

Kind regards, Mark Latham. ‘That thing' is the description of the modern Labor Party given by the former Labor leader-‘that thing'. It is ‘that thing' that stands against reform in Australia.

I have had a number of conversations with the ACCC, and I am not aware of the particular briefing that the member for Fraser refers to. I will seek information from the minister responsible. What have I told my National Party colleagues? I have told them how important it is that we see this money invested in regional Australia, how important it is that we see this level of investment in new technology in rural and regional Australia, to ensure that those services are there in the future and to ensure, as a part of this package, that there an underpinning of those services in terms of accessibility, as well as the regulatory regime that is put into place.

69,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney inform the House of developments in the trials of those accused of involvement in the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta one year ago?,94
70,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. Obviously we welcome the demonstration of Indonesia's commitment to fight terrorism, with the conviction yesterday of Iwan Darmawan, alias Rois, for his role in the bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta on 9 September. The South Jakarta District Court has sentenced Rois to death for his involvement in the bombing. That is the most severe sentence possible. The Australian government, of course, does not support the death penalty. However, given that Rois is Indonesian, it is a matter for Indonesia and the Indonesian legal system as to what penalties are given to people who commit such heinous acts of this kind. He was a key player in the attack on our embassy. He recruited trained personnel, raised funds and materials for the bomb making and planned the logistics of this terrible crime. I am particularly delighted that Indonesia has demonstrated its commitment to fighting terrorism by pressing on to ensure this conviction. The conviction underlines its determination to prosecute to the full extent of the law those involved in terrorism and to ensure that they are caught. Its successful record in is doing so and in collecting evidence and obtaining convictions shows that Indonesia is on target to deal with terrorism within its own borders. Rois is the fourth terrorist convicted for his role in the embassy bombing, and two other suspects are currently on trial. Forty people have been tried and convicted Indonesia-wide for their roles in relation to the Bali bombings. Over 300 Jemaah Islamiah members and other suspected terrorists have been arrested throughout the region. In this matter we work closely with Indonesia and other governments in the region through cooperation in areas such as law enforcement and maritime border and transport security. This counter-terrorism cooperation is unprecedented in its scope and intensity. But we are not complacent. We know that there are those who continue to plot, and we are committed for the long haul in protecting Australians and their interests. Telstra",94

Acting Prime Minister, the National Farmers Federation  and I note that you have the press releasethat the NFF has received a guarantee from the government on future pricing parity for both basic telephone and broadband services for country and city consumers. Could the Acting Prime Minister clarify where that guarantee on parity for country people is in the legislation?",94
72,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for his question. It is good that he was paying a great deal of attention to what the NFF had to say. I refer the honourable member to the minister's ministerial statement to the Senate; I think he will find it there.,95
73,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House on what measures the government is taking to make the health system sustainable in the long term? Are there any alternative policies?,95
74,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, the GP bulk-billing rate in Kalgoorlie has gone up by five percentage points over the last 12 months. As its record shows, this government will do what is necessary to make our great Medicare system sustainable. There is no such thing as free medicine, and even in the very best of causes it is necessary to ensure that taxpayers are getting value for their dollars. That is why the government has increased the co-payment for the PBS. That is why this government never pretends that there can be 100 per cent bulk-billing. That is why the government has introduced a mandatory price cut for generics. That is why the government is insisting on a $460 million pharmacy saving over the next five years. The government is getting support from some unlikely quarters. The member for Rankin is not much good on education, but he knows what he is talking about-he has got something-when it comes to health. I quote: We can't afford to have so many older Australians having access to health care at zero cost or very low cost. Budgetary circumstances dictate that we won't be able to provide free health care for all Australians. That is a bit of sense from the member for Rankin, which guarantees his permanent exile on the Labor back bench because Labor's policy is something called ‘Medicare Gold'-a copper-bottomed con job with a $4 Health billion funding black hole. I went on to the Labor Party's policy web site this morning-and there were pretty thin pickings. I discovered that their policy on Telstra was 40 words and their policy on Tasmanian forests was 69 words; they had 152 words on national security but 172 words on Medicare Gold-and that is the one policy that should not even be there, because the Leader of the Opposition said in January: Medicare Gold disappeared with Mark. You know-the ghost that is coming back to haunt the Labor Party this weekend. The Leader of the Opposition thinks he can control petrol prices by having the 46th inquiry in 15 years, he thinks he can fix Telstra with a bit of good old-fashioned nationalisation, he thinks he can win the Ashes by changing the Prime Minister, and he cannot even take Medicare Gold off his own web site. I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: he will be judged, not on what he tells other people to do but on what he does himself. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to prove he is a tougher leader than the member for Lalor by getting her policy off his web site. Fuel Prices",95
75,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that the consumer confidence index has recorded a 13-point drop, the eighth biggest drop in the history of the survey? Does the Treasurer accept that this is due largely to the impact of very petrol prices? When will the Treasurer direct the ACCC to investigate petrol price gouging, as suggested by the Labor Party 51 days ago?",95
76,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have seen the Westpac consumer confidence index for the month, and it is true that consumer confidence has declined to something like the long-term average. In the last couple of months there have been enormous volatilities, with a big decline after the interest rate rise back in March; a huge rise after the budget in May; and a recent decline, which could well be related to petrol As I said yesterday, petrol prices are punishingly high. These high petrol prices are punishing consumers. High petrol prices are not good for business, high petrol prices are not good for the government, and high petrol prices are not good for the economy. If anybody is welcoming high petrol prices, let me suggest to them that it is not in the interests of the Australian consumer or in the interests of Australian business. Unfortunately, as we know, the reason why petrol prices are increasing is the world oil price. As to improper conduct by any oil company or service station operator or retailer in Australia, the ACCC is instructed to take action against them. It has full powers to take action against them. It does not need any recommendation from the government, but I give it on a daily basis. As soon as there is any evidence whatsoever of any improper market conduct, the ACCC will investigate and, if there is a breach of the law, it will take a prosecution and, if there is a conviction, it has heavy penalties at its disposal. It needs no instruction from me to do so; but, as I say on a daily basis, the moment it finds any evidence, it should do so. Unfortunately, any action by the ACCC in Australia is not going to reduce the world oil price. Nor is it going to increase world refining capacity. We wish that it were the case that petrol prices could be reduced by a simple investigation or prosecution by the ACCC. As the member for Rankin said-and I know he is getting a lot of favourable mentions, and unfavourable ones: It may seem like clever politics to suggest to Australians that there is an easy fix to world oil prices, but Australians are too clever for that. They know that petrol prices are up around the world. They know that petrol prices are up around the world because of world oil prices, and they know that until such time as world oil prices come back down or refining capacity increases we will, unfortunately, have to live with high petrol prices. That is in nobody's interests, but it will certainly not be ameliorated by opportunistic and cheap politicsunfortunately the kind in which the member for Lilley excels. Education: Schools",96
77,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House of the government's policy to support choice in Australian schools? Are there any alternative policies? How might they work?",96
78,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell. It is great to have him here in the parliament doing a wonderful job for the people of Dobell. All Australian parents make extraordinary sacrifices for their children. This government believe that in education, in schooling, all parents should be free to choose the kind of school that they think best suits the aspirations that they have for their children and the needs of those children. We strongly believe that parents of the 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools throughout this country, whilst recognising they will receive less public funding for their children's education if they choose to send their children to a Catholic or independent school, should receive financial assistance in support of their children's education, and it will be largely according to the means of the families. Today is 14 September 2005. One year ago today the landscape for education in this country was changed when the then leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Mark Latham, supported by the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party, announced that funding would be cut to 178 non-government schools in Australia, adversely affecting the education of 160,000 children. For the first time in Australia, the Australian Labor Party was promoting a policy that would actually cut the funding for the education of Australian children. What we had was a policy presented that would punish parents for sacrifices that they make for their children. It is important that members understand that it was not a list confined to 178 schools. The way in which the list was intended to work would be that over a six-year period all non-government schools in Australia would hit what the Labor Party described as a resource index. Once the total level of funding for a child was reached, the funding to that school would increase at a rate half of what does today. During the election campaign, at a meeting of Brisbane Catholic parents and friends on 16 September, the deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party was asked if Catholic schools in Australia would reach this resource index. She said: ‘We don't expect any Catholic systemic school to reach the standard until 2012.' In other words, Catholic systemic schools in Australia would reach Labor's hit list six years after the implementation of the policy. It is worth remembering that on 28 September last year a number of leaders of churches in Australia, led by Cardinal George Pell, said of Labor's policy in part: Labor's proposal to effectively cap government funding to schools within the non-government schools sector is regrettable. They went on to say: We express our concern at the lack of clarity in Labor's proposal and the potentially divisive mechanism of redistributing funds within the nongovernment schools sector. This policy today is Labor's policy. Australians need to understand that in two years time, if they elect a Beazley led government, they will be voting for a government that will be cutting the funding to Australian schools. The deputy leader of the Labor Party affirmed it was Labor's policy again after the election last year on 30 November. She said: ‘Federal Labor will retain its schools policy.' One year after the introduction of Labor's policy, Labor's hit list would move from 178 schools, affecting 160,000 students, to 272. After one year a quarter of a million Australian children would have the funding for their education cut under a Labor government. This government have a help list. We have 8,500 schools on it that are getting up it to $150,000 to support children's education. The Labor Party has a hit list. Under no circumstances will we reduce the funding for the education of Australian children. NA",96
79,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge, a former minister. On behalf of all members. I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA",97
80,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the Prime Minister's remarks in this place last week where he said: I think it is the obligation of senior executives Telstra to talk up the company's interest not to talk them down. That is a view which I have communicated very directly to the chairman of the board on behalf of the government. Does the Treasurer agree with the Prime Minister's statement?,98
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said on numbers of occasions, it is the obligation of directors to act in the best interests of their company. What that means is ‘in the best interests of their shareholders'. Directors are appointed by shareholders to so manage the company as to derive profit and to increase value. Having said that, the Corporations Law, and indeed the common law, puts other obligations on directors-a duty to disclose to the market anything that may have a material effect on a share price, a duty to act honestly in the discharge of their duties, a duty not to improperly use their position for personal advantage, a duty not to improperly use information for personal advantage. There is a common law duty and there is a statutory duty, but the principal duty of directors is to act in the interests of a company. Workplace Relations",98
82,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister update the House on support for workplace relations reform and a national workplace relations system? Are there any alternative points of view?,98
83,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for his question and his interest in the continuing reform of workplace relations Telstra in Australia. I note, in the context of his question, that today there is a delegation of unionists-led by the former secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Mr Leigh Hubbard-touring parliament and meeting with MPs. I was fortunate enough to obtain of off the back of a truck the lobbying document for this delegation headed ‘Discussion point for lobbying'. It contains such detail as where they will be based in Senator Gavin Marshall's office, how they find their way there and a lot of minutiae, including that, at the point of the lobbying exercise, they should hand up a copy of the joint union statement. I knew that the union movement are into pattern bargaining; I did not know they were now into pattern lobbying. This document contains a number of falsehoods. It says, for example, that ‘economic prosperity has little if anything to do with industrial relations changes'. I do not know where these unionists got this advice from. It certainly was not from the IMF, who told us yesterday in their reportA government member-Or the OECD. Mr Swan-I wouldn't be quoting too many OECD reports if I were you.",98
84,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Or the OECD or any other independent bodies that have looked at that and said that, if Australia wants to continue its economic growth, then a key component of this is changes and reforms to the industrial relations system. They certainly did not even get it from the Secretary of the ACTU, Greg Combet, who, on 6 July, told the National Press Club, amongst other things: Since its inception in 1994, decentralised collective workplace bargaining ... has unleashed enormous productive potential. He went on to say that industrial relations reform is part of the success. So they did not get this information from Mr Combet. Other falsehoods in the document include saying that people will be undermined because awards will go. That is quite plainly false; the award system will remain in place. They say that penalty rates, public holidays and so on will go; yet they will stay. But there is one kernel of truth in this document. It says: Even Labor will be tempted to refer the powers in idea. the future. What we have in this document-this ‘Notes for lobbying of coalition MPs', this document from the union movement-is a statement that, in the future, even the Labor Party will be tempted to refer their powers to a national system. This points out what a number of union leaders have said-what the likes of Bill Shorten and Richard Marles have said: that it makes sense to have a national system of industrial relations in Australia. Even the member for Perth has acknowledged the economic benefit of having one national system of industrial relations in Australia. On top of that, just this week we had the state industrial relations minister in New South Wales, John Della Bosca, say that he would give consideration to giving up state jurisdiction over both occupational health and safety and workers compensation. It is good enough for Mr Della Bosca in New South Wales, the industrial relations minister, to say that we can have one national system for occupational health and safety and workers compensation, yet others say it is not a good idea to have a national system for industrial relations. The reality is that this document once again points out what everybody knows: a national system of industrial relations is a policy whose time has come in Australia. Mr Crean-Your time has come.",98
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham is warned!,99
86,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The only people standing in front of that for political reasons are the Australian Labor Party.

87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that the Chairman of ASIC, Mr Jeffrey Lucy, has stated: Last evening I advised the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services that the comments attributed to the Prime Minister regarding obligations of Telstra executives were included among those matters being consideredthat is, in an investigation by them into the provision of information to the markets. Is he further aware that Mr Lucy said: I can categorically state that ASIC is not undertaking any investigation of the Prime Minister.

88,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of those statements because ASIC has released a media release today which says them. I will come to the gravamen of the allegation that is put in a moment, but I can confirm that certainly my office has been in touch with Mr Lucy.

99,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. May I first thank the Speaker for his kindness in presenting me with an Australian made wool scarf to keep me warm to replace my Crows scarf, which has been banned by your good self. Thank you, it was much appreciated.",100
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Makin will come to her question.,100
101,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Would the very kind Minister for Revenue advise the House of initiatives the government is taking to help Australian women save for their retirements? Is the minister aware of proposals that will limit these initiatives?,100
102,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin. She looks very smart in her scarf, as she did the other day. She is a great Crows supporter. Since the Lions are not there, I wish her all the best in her support. We brought to the House's attention yesterday the wonderful success of the government's co-contribution and the fact that those who sit opposite are opposed to it. The member for Makin will be pleased to know that there were 5,700 recipients of the Howard government's co-contribution in the first yearbut, most particularly, she would be interested to know that 3,650 of those were women. This is a very important message. It is not only people in the work force but ple who are not in the work force who should be contributing to their own superannuation, whether they are getting the co-contribution in the work force or whether they are contributing as they leave the work force, perhaps to have a family. The problem that we have with the Labor Party is that not only are they opposed to co-contribution of the Howard government, and will deny all of these Australians $1.50 for every $1 that they put into their own perannuation accounts, but they actually have an active policy, a backward-looking policy, a policy that has no place in a modern for Lilley. Australia, not to allow people who are not in the work force, particularly women who have left the work force to have a family, to make a contribution whilst they are having a family. I turn to page 4 of the Labor Party policy. It has an author on the front page, I noteone that we will probably hear from again shortly. Mr Costello-It's Latham, isn't it?",100
103,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is correct, Treasurer. He is there; someone that they are all hoping they will forget. I am sure he will come back to us very clearly very soon. Maybe they are going to dump the policy as they dumped their leader, because it says in here: Labor will reverse the Howard government's budget measure which removed the work test for individuals under age 65 to contribute to superannuation. That means that, when many of the women in the member for Makin's electorate go to have a family, they can no longer contribute to their own superannuation. That is Labor policy in a modern Australia: you should be denied a right to make a provision for your own retirement. I ask the member for Sydney, who had peo- nearly 1,000 women contribute to the cocontribution: do you, as the representative of women on behalf of the opposition in this place, believe that women should not be able to make a contribution to their superannuation accounts at a time when they are out of the work force? Or maybe the member for Jagajaga. The member for Jagajaga had over the 3,000 women make a co-contribution. So she not only wants to deny them that; she wants to deny them the right to also have a chance su- to put money into their retirements when they are not in the work force. And the member for Lalor. And of course the member The member for Lilley had 5,063 women contribute to the co-contribution. That is a fantastic effort, I have to say-I congratulate the women up there for doing that. But I wonder whether he has mentioned to the member for Griffith, his neighbouring seat, that the women who work in the Mater Hospital, or perhaps to the member for Brisbane, his other neighbouring seat, that the women who work at the Brisbane Women's Hospital should be denied the right to be able to contribute to their own superannuation. I draw their attention to a press release by HESTA, the specialist super fund for health and community services. They have some 500,000 members and they report that there has almost been a doubling of their almost exclusively female work force and contributors who have made a contribution in the second year of the Howard government program-something the Labor Party says they cannot and should not do. This is a shame on the Labor Party. Their policies are, like they are, dinosaurs that belong in the past. Telstra",101
104,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and follows the answer he gave to my previous question. Given that Mr Lucy has confirmed that ASIC is still investigating the continuous disclosure obligations of Telstra, will the Treasurer ensure that the ASIC investigation is able to extend to all people, including himself and the Prime Minister, who have had access to market sensitive information or who were present at the 11 August 2005 meeting with Telstra?",102
105,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have no objection whatsoever to ASIC investigating every single person that they think is relevant-none whatsoever. I will make this point: the obligation on disclosure to the Australian Stock Exchange falls on a company. It is a company that is in possession of information that would have a material effect on the share price that has an obligation to disclose. Let me say this entirely clearly too: if Telstra were in possession of information that would have had a material effect on the share price, it had an obligation to disclose it. did not, then there ought to be an investigation. But, as I understand the situation, Telstra says it was always observing its duties that it had disclosed to the Stock Exchange such information as would have a material effect on the price. Telstra says it was complying. If there is a suggestion that it was not, you have an investigation-that is what ASIC does. We welcome the investigation. ASIC will investigate and in due course will announce its results. I would encourage ASIC to make inquiries of anybody that it believes can assist in relation to that investigation. It ought to be open, it ought to be transparent, it ought to be thorough-there is no objection from this side of the parliament to that. As it turns out, ASIC does not believe that the Prime Minister has any obligation in relation to disclosure and has issued a statement to that effect. I would have thought that was obvious. The Prime Minister is not a director of Telstra, he is not an executive of Telstra and he does not discharge a function on behalf of Telstra; neither does he come under the Corporations Law, which requires the company itself to disclose. I would have thought that was pretty obvious; the statement makes it clear. But, if Mr Lucy wants to investigate anybody, he knows that he does not need an instruction, because he is a statutory officer. He knows that he has the power to do it. He knows that he has the protection to do it. He knows that he has the investigative powers to do it. He knows that he can take evidence. He knows that he has rights in relation to civil liberties. And he will do it. I know him to be an honourable man who will discharge his statutory duties, as this government would expect. Workplace Relations",102
106,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business If it and Tourism. Would the minister advise the House how the government's proposed exemptions from unfair dismissal laws will assist small business? FRAN BAILEY-I thank the member for Bonner for his question and I thank him for being prepared to stand up for the thousands of small business people he has in his electorate. He, like every member on this side of the House, understands that 95 per cent of all businesses in this country are small businesses; that they are a vital source of economic growth, jobs and innovation; and that they have a very real concern about the current unfair dismissal laws. In fact, the Australian Business Ltd survey found that 65 per cent of those surveyed either had experienced or knew of people who had experienced speculative unfair dismissal claims and that a further 37 per cent reported that the practice of paying go-away money occurs regularly. This government, in its industrial relations reforms, will exempt from these current unfair dismissal laws businesses that employ up to 100 people; those businesses will be exempt. It is only this government that will deliver a flexible workplace for small business and for all businesses. We know that the opposition does not support such flexibility. But I can advise the House that there is at least one member of the opposition who believes that reforming unfair dismissal claims is good for small business. I can advise that that is the member for Hunter. I can further advise that the member for Hunter has been prepared to be on the record for a long time-in fact, since 1998-on this. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that in an interview, the member for Hunter said: ... my wife consistently tells me she could to put on one more person or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismisssaid: as ... I say to the member for Hunter: tell your wife that this government is fixing the problem. Mr Vaile- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA",102
107,Mr VAILE,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS," Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer I gave earlier in question time.",103
108,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,103
109,Mr VAILE,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"I was asked a question by the member for Fraser about alleged lastminute representations to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts proposing amendments to the Telstra sale bill, because the ACCC believed that the bill did not properly protect competition in the interest of consumers. In adding to that answer, I will just make a few comments. The ACCC has been extensively involved with the government in developing the operational separation arrangements. It is no secret that the ACCC has indicated in the past that it has concerns about the structural arrangements in the telecommunications industry. At the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee hearings on Friday 9 September 2005, the ACCC indicated that it had considered alternative models for operational separation. At that committee hearing, the ACCC also indicated that it believes a number of matters relating to operational separation will need to be carefully addressed during the process of developing afford the operational separation plan. The ACCC acknowledged that the model can work and The government's proposed model for the operational separation of Telstra maintains the balanced approach of the existing regulatory regime. The proposal recognises that Telstra is in the unique position, through its monopoly over the local access network, of being able to stifle competition and innovation by frustrating its competitors' investment plans. For this reason, the ACCC welcomes changes which would increase transTelstra parency and equivalence in the way Telstra provides key access services to its own downstream operations relative to those of its competitors. Senator Brandis stated: ... it strikes me that if the government's announced model has the likely outcome that you have anticipated, it is not just going to be good for Telstra; it is going to be good for the entire industry. Telstra Commissioner Mr Willett replied: And the economy as a whole. Senator Brandis then asked: And consumers? Mr Willett confirmed: And consumers and ACCC Chairman Mr Samuel confirmed: And consumers. I think that makes it quite clear. Immigration",103

112,Mr JOHN COBB,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Yesterday the member for Watson threw an incredible slur upon the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and accused it of falsifying documents of identification. Absolutely nothing could be further from the truth. That is an incredible slur on a department that, in fact, has done an incredible job in identifying the people concerned. Mr Albanese interjecting",104
113,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The member for Grayndler is warned!,104
114,Mr JOHN COBB,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"The Kolas came to Australia in December 1999. Three weeks later they applied for a protection visa as refugees. They then changed their name to Kola, or claimed to be the Kolas, because under the Albanian identification with which they originally came to Australia they obviously would not have been eligible to apply for refugee status. During the course of the next four years, they exhausted every process possible to obtain protection visa status-all the way through to the Federal Court, including numerous applications to the minister. When all these were exhausted, the department made preparations to remove them from Australia, as they have to for anybody who remains in Australia illegally or unlawfully. The department went to incredible lengths, because at this stage information came to their notice which cast doubt upon the identification the Kolas were running with. They identified that the Kolas were not who they said they were, when the government of Serbia and Montenegro said that they were not who they said they were. Interpol also assisted with that. More to the point, with information given by our department in the form of photos and fingerprints, the Albanian authorities identified exactly who the Kolas were. The Albanian authorities stated that they are in fact Albanian citizens and their true names are Pali and Vata, the names they entered Australia on. During the course of his question yesterday, the member for Watson cast incredible slurs on the department. He made these claims because the name of an officer was deleted from an FOI request-as indeed it would be; that is common practice. The department has to do rather distasteful work when people attempt to stay in Australia by falsifying their identification, and quite obviously the departmental officers who deal with it do not want to be identified. Standard practice is that their names are deleted. Mention was also made of the fact that an officer said he had known the so-called Kolas for one year and five months. That was in fact true, and that same officer helped identify them in Albania. It is quite obvious that the member for Watson went out on halfbaked information and threw an incredible slur on the department for no good reason. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think we have been extraordinarily generous, but can I make two points? This would not have been the earliest opportunity for the minister to clarify this but, more importantly, the matters he is going to now cannot possibly be adding to yesterday's answer because they happened after question time yesterday. If he wanted to be asked a question by his own side, he should have arranged it.",104
115,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"The minister sought leave to add to the answer to a question, and the minister is adding to his answer to the question. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, further on the point of order: the purpose of adding to an answer is for a minister who has come upon more information to provide the information in answer to that question. What he is doing now is referring to events that happened after yesterday's question time. They cannot be matters about which he was asked in yesterday's question time, because they had not happened yet, so it is out of order.",105

I understand that many of these workers were advised that they had to remove their work uniforms before they could enter the public gallery. This included their work jackets and overalls.

119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,Order! The member for Grayndler will remove himself understanding order 94(a). I thank the Chief Opposition Whip. I will look carefully at his question and report back to him as appropriate. Authentication of Quotations,105
120,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I was contemplating seeking leave to make a personal explanation, but there appears to be no point. Instead, I will ask you a question. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism did today what she has done on many other occasions-just like her predecessors-and quoted me inaccurately and out of context. The last time she did so, given that I had taken a number of personal explanations, I suggested to you that in future she should have to authenticate any quote by producing the transcript for it. She has not done so. Mr Speaker, I ask you-and you can get back to the House at a later date-to consider ruling",105
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member will not reflect on the chair. The member for Hunter will come to his question.,106
122,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"My point is that I do not expect you to make this ruling now, because it will be quite a significant one. I ask you to consider whether in future you will rule out of order any such quotes for which there has already been a personal explanation and on which the minister cannot provide some accuracy and authenticate that quote. I ask you to very seriously consider that issue. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is not a question at all. It is a complete abuse of questions to the Speaker, and the member should be sat down immediately. Mr MCMullan-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: there is precedent for the point which the member for Hunter raises, and both the member for Hunter and you were in the parliament when the precedent was established. It was in relation to the then member for Sydney, Mr Baldwin, who raised exactly the same point with regard to repetition of statements about which personal explanations had been made. Previous Speakers have ruled that out of order, and I ask you therefore to take seriously the point raised by the member for Hunter and ignore the interjection from the Leader of the House.",106
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Fraser. Mr Abbott-Further to the point of order, Mr Speaker, it would be almost an obscenity in a parliament dedicated to free speech if people were able to use personal explanations to gag debate in this place.",106
124,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The member for Hunter has raised a point which I am happy to respond to. It is not the responsibility of the chair to vouch for any statement that a member makes in this place. As standing orders and House of Representatives Practice make quite clear, the chair has to accept that a member brings any statements to this House in good faith, therefore I cannot rule any statement out of order. However, there are other ways under House of Representatives Practice and standing orders that a member may wish to pursue this, but it is not the chair's responsibility to vouch for the validity of a statement. In response to the member for Fraser, he would be aware that, while he raises a valid point of some time ago, subsequently that has been overtaken and rulings that have been made since have not upheld that earlier ruling.",106
125,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"On the point of order, Mr Speaker; while you are going through that process, Mr Speaker, could you also give us a translation of the answer that was given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs?",106
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Does the member for Hunter have another question?,106
127,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"While I accept the genuineness of your response, could I simply ask youMr Vaile interjecting",106
128,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I do not need your help, mate. Mr Speaker, I ask you to take a look at House of Representatives Practice-I have not had the time to do so during this short exchange-because there is a requirement that members do authenticate such transcripts and publications. I might be wrong: it might not apply in this example. But I ask you to look at that requirement in House of Representatives Practice and report back to the House.",106
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I can inform the member for Hunter that it is not the requirement of the chair to authenticate a statement by a member. Mr Fitzgibbon-It's the responsibility of the member.,107
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"The member can be challenged, but not by the chair. Ms Gillard-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: perhaps I could assist-and I think the matter might require some reflection by you. What you said, Mr SPEAKER - which I agree with absolutely-is that if a member is making a statement in good faith then it is not a matter for you to intervene. The question you are really being asked to consider is whether it is possible that a member is making a statement in good faith when what is being asserted by the member is a fact that has been denied by way of personal explanation by a member in this place on a number of occasions. Is it conceivable that a member who has heard someone deny the fact five, 10, 15, 20 or 25 times is continuing to make that assertion in good faith? May I suggest, Mr Speaker, that that is a matter that might require some reflection. On another matter, Mr Speaker, could I ask you to clarify whether the Leader of the House is now conveying to the House that he is opposed to the use of the guillotine and gagging of debate, because that is something we would like to know before tomorrow?",107
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. Clearly, her last question should be directed to the Leader of the House. On the first point, it has been practice for some time now that the usual method available to a member where he or she feels that they have been unfairly represented is to make a personal explanation. There have been occasions when that has been done repeatedly. Parliamentary Behaviour",107
132,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I am seeking clarification in relation to some rulings that my good friend the Deputy Speaker has made in recent weeks. It relates to the use of the word ‘bribe'. On Monday the Deputy Speaker called the member for Perth to order for that reason. Some weeks ago I was evicted for using that word when in fact earlier in the day I think you would remember that I had used exactly the same phrase. I do not intend to use it today-I am not doing this for some sort of political grandstanding reason. I used it earlier in the day and you accepted the phrase when I believe you were in the chair. I think we do need some clarification in the use of this word and I think it has to come from your office. For your information, Mr Speaker, on 22 May 1996 the member for Page, the current Deputy Speaker, used these words: ... it is clear that the previous Labor government bribed the maritime unions of Australia so as to encourage the sale of ANL ... Also, for your information, Mr Speaker, on 12 October 1988, the current Prime Minister made this statement: Unbelievably, a Prime Minister of a Labor government went twice to Ipswich trying to beg and bribe the traditional voters of that Labor Party heartland in Queensland to vote for him. I note that in a search of the computer database the current Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is a serial offender in relation to use of this term and that the term has been used 332 times since 1991. Could you report back to the parliament some clarification as to the Deputy Speaker's rulings?",107
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I am happy to respond to the member for New England now, and I thank him for indicating that I was to be asked this question this afternoon. On the first point, the member for Perth was asked to withdraw a statement and I believe that he did so. If a member is asked to withdraw and does so, that is the end of the matter. If a member refuses to, then the member is, of course, defying the chair. To give you a full answer on the question of offensive expressions, the context in which words are used and the atmosphere in the chamber at the time are important considerations. As outlined on page 499 of House of Representatives Practice: ... the determination as to whether words used in the House are offensive or disorderly rests with the Chair, and the Chair's judgement depends on the nature of the word and the is used. With regard to the recent examples that the member for New England is referring to, page 502 of House of Representatives Practice makes it clear that an accusation made against an identifiable group of members of the House will be regarded as unparliamentary and offensive, as if it were made about an individual member, and it should be withdrawn on the chair's request. In practice, the requirement for the withdrawal of a reflection on a group of members depends on the severity of the reflection; in the first instance, depending on the context, reflections should be personally offensive. Many remarks that offend political sensitivities would normally not require withdrawal. Where a member refuses to carry out an instruction from the chair, such as to withdraw a certain expression, the offence is compounded so as to constitute defiance of the chair. It is in the interests of our parliamentary institution that members obey the directives of the chair, and refusal to do so warrants stern intervention. I again draw the attention of members to the guidelines quoted in House of Representatives Practice that ‘Good temper and moderation are the characteristics of parliamentary language,' and that this is never more desirable than when canvassing the opinions and conduct of opponents in debate. To add further to the examples that the member for New England drew of previous occasions, it really is not productive to draw comparisons on the basis of the written record alone in any matter. With offensive expressions, the context in which words are used and the atmosphere of the chamber at the time are also important considerations. Equally importantly, a request for withdrawal must be made at the time, and I note that none was requested at that time in the context in which it earlier cases. Authentication of Quotations",107
134,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, have you read page 529 of the current House of Representatives Practice, which does contain a requirement that quotations from newspaper articles or transcripts used in a question must be authenticated? Unfortunately, I am wrong. Because she was answering a question, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism had no obligation to authenticate the quote. However, that is an obvious flaw in House of Representatives practice or in the body of the law developed in this place. If the minister had any morality about her, she would apply that principle to her answer as well.",108
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I would make the point to the honourable member for Hunter that I think I have answered the first point of his question. The House of Representatives Practice has just been revised. If he wishes to discuss the matter further with the clerks, he is very welcome to do so. I would also ask the member for Hunter to check that he is reading from the latest edition of the House of Representatives Practice. Parliamentary Behaviour",108
136,Ms HALL,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I am very mindful of the answer that you just gave to the member for New England. One thing that I would not like to do would be to ever hold the chamber or you in contempt. I do not quite understand what the parameters are that determine the ‘atmosphere' within the House. Could you clarify that a little bit for me and other members.",108
137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Shortland. As I have made it clear, the occupier of the chair at the time is the person who has to make that decision. I think all members who have occupied the chair would be well aware that, at times, it is not an easy decision. Nonetheless, I believe that all people who occupy the chair do so in good faith and do so in an endeavour to allow proper debate to occur and to allow all members the opportunity to put their points of view. Authentication of Quotations FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen-Minister for Small Business and Tourism) (3.37 pm)-At the end of question time, as members would know, the member for Hunter challenged on what basis I answered a question.

139,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Batman proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to direct the ACCC to formally monitor fuel prices and to adequate measures to build Australia's transport fuel self-sufficiency and provide a buffer against future global oil price shocks. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",109
140,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think we all appreciate that high petrol prices rank as the biggest issue of concern in the Australian electorate today. That is why we are having this debate. But, more importantly, from the opposition's point of view, the debate is about not just the immediate difficulties confronting the Australian community with high petrol prices but also a genuine endeavour to try and force the development of a long-term vision about where Australia should go, in an endeavour to build a buffer against future global oil price shocks and make a huge step forward on the self-sufficiency front. In terms of high petrol prices being a huge electoral issue, I note that they are not only of major concern in Australia but also of global concern, and I refer to the panic purchases of petrol in the European Union at the moment. In Australia, perhaps it is about time the Howard government understood that petrol prices are an issue of great concern to the so called battlers that the Prime Minister liked to talk about so much in the lead-up to the March 1996 election. In that regard, I will briefly refer to the Shell Sydney petrol prices. The pump price today is 131.8c per litre. The 28-day average is 124.9c per litre. I therefore wonder why the Treasurer on a number of occasions this week has sought to use question time to dismiss any concerns by the Australian community about the price of petrol at this point in time. I simply say that take perhaps the Prime Minister and ‘that thing', the Treasurer, ought to finally accept that Australian motorists are hurting. I will tell you why they are hurting. They principally bear the burden of unprecedented petrol prices. The Prime Minister and ‘that thing', the Treasurer, have repeatedly brushed them off",109
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Batman!,110
142,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"and told them there is nothing that they can do about it. Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is the arrogant and extreme approach that the Treasurer has adopted day after day in the House this week in relation to questions about the price of petrol. I simply suggest this afternoon that, in accordance with the five-point plan issued by the Leader of the Opposition, there is plenty that the government can do about petrol prices if it actually has a will to do something to accept the concerns of the Australian community. First and foremost, the government could direct the ACCC to formally monitor fuel prices. The Treasurer likes to suggest that the government should not do this type of thing. In terms of investigations and responsibilities, how many times did the Treasurer labour the point in question time today about ASIC and Telstra and ASIC's responsibility to have a full and proper investigation about the performance of Telstra? If it is good enough for ASIC to accept those responsibilities at the request and direction of the Treasurer, perhaps it is time for the Treasurer to direct the ACCC to formally monitor fuel prices. Perhaps that might not produce the result that the consumers want at the moment, but it would provide a certain peace of mind to Australian motorists that someone cares about them and that someone is prepared to investigate their concerns to the fullest. I do not consider that oil companies should mind. If you have a look at the media, you will see that in some of the tabloid journals there have been some pretty cheap shots by some second-rate journalists about the problems that confront us on the oil price front at the moment. Some of those shots are directed at the oil companies. I would have thought that the oil companies had nothing to hide from the ACCC formally monitoring fuel prices on a regular basis, because they are the ones whose reputation is being damaged the moment, with blame being apportioned for price gouging and no-oneparticularly the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-bothering to give the Australian community a decent explanation about petrol prices both within Australia and internationally. I believe that is what we should be doing. We, as the elected representatives of the Australian community, have a responsibility to explain the challenges and the difficulties that confront ordinary Australian workers as they seek to live from week to week because of the huge jump in petrol prices in recent times. It is a weekly challenge to these people. Every week they now confront serious questions: do they have enough money to fill the petrol tank or, alternatively, do they purchase some food to feed their kids? Can they afford the pair of runners to put shoes on the feet of their children or, alternatively, can they afford the school excursion? That is why they are crying out for an explanation from the Australian government. There is a lot of goodwill in the Australian community. If you are prepared to take them into your confidence and seek to fully and honestly explain what is going on, they are prepared to accept your word. Their contempt for the Australian government at the moment is due to the fact that the Australian government, as displayed in an arrogant manner by the Treasurer this week, has simply dismissed their concerns. I say that the best answer is for the Australian competition watchdog to front up to its responsibilities. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission thinks it is good enough to issue a glossy magazine entitled Understanding petrol prices in Australia. I might have read it, but mums and dads at the breakfast table each morning do not have time to read it. They are more concerned about how they will make ends meet. The problem is that the Treasurer does not mix with those types of people. He mixes with the top end of town as he hobnobs it around Collins Street and all those leading business houses. When the Treasurer and his mates, such as the Krogers, sit down to conspire about lopping off the head of the Prime Minister, they do not know what ordinary battlers are experiencing. The head of the Australian competition watchdog said in an off-handed way, ‘Something funny is going on with refiner margins.' Tell us what is going on, Mr Samuels. Maybe then we will take you seriously too. All we want is an explanation. I raise these issues because it is about time someone sought-as we will seek this afternoon-to give a bit of an explanation to the Australian community. That explanation goes to the fact that the increase in oil prices and petrol prices is largely because consumers around the world have been worried about petrol shortages after Hurricane Katrina caused the shutdown of refineries in the United States. There has been panic buying in America and in Europe. We also have to handle the fact that the fastest-growing economies in the world, China and India, have an insatiable thirst for fuel at the moment. In many ways, we are beneficiaries of that insatiable thirst for resources. Australia is a resource rich nation so, in the same way that there is pressure on fuel prices at the moment, we have also benefited from that economic growth. In the last 12 months, Australian producers have obtained record increases in the export price of our resources: a 120 per cent increase in the price of our coking coal on the international market; a 20 per cent increase in the price of our thermal coal and a 70 per cent increase in the selling price of iron ore in this year alone. That is part of the explanation. Why don't the Prime Minister and Treasurer bother to try to explain these issues to the Australian community-the people who put their faith in the government at the last election-and try to do something to solve the problems that are confronting Australia? The problem is that this government is not about solving problems; it is about removing political issues when it thinks they will concern it electorally. There is no long-term vision, no capacity to think through the problems that confront us as a nation and no capacity to work out how we put in place mediumand long-term solutions to issues such as terrorism, skills and infrastructure shortages and, now, fuel prices that will guarantee Australia a very bright economic future. It is up to the opposition to lay the challenges before the government to try to force a debate about where Australia is going in the 21st century. That is the crux of the debate this afternoon. It is not only about the price of fuel; it is also about how we as a nation develop an alternative industry so as to create some opportunities to improve our degree of selfsufficiency into the future. Because we are rich in resources, we have the capacity to take up those challenges in the same way the Australian resource sector has, in the context of the coal industry, taken up the greenhouse debate. It is talking about sequestration and clean coal, because that is about guaranteeing the future export of Australian coal, which is about jobs and a larger economic cake in Australia. We as a nation also have to come to terms with future endeavours and to create a buffer against future global oil price shocks. I these issues because, by 2010, net crude oil import reliance in Australia is likely to be about 40 per cent and rising to 50 per cent by 2020. Our problem as a nation is that, for the last few decades, we have consumed oil three times faster than we have added to our reserves. So there is a fairly basic we have to do more to look after our future because, if we do not do it, no-one else will do it for us. That is what governments are elected for: to try to work out how to position ourselves for the future-not to run away from the hard issues and merely have a strategy in government to neutralise political issues rather than to create long-term opportunities for Australia to solve its domestic and international problems. This is a very serious debate. I only wish that the Treasurer had the guts to front up to a debate such as this, rather than sitting in his office and spending all his time counting numbers for a ballot that, because he does not have any ticker, may not happen. This debate is about ticker too. It is about confronting hard policy issues. Australia is rich in gas. One of the challenges to us as a nation-as it is with the debate about clean coal-is whether we have the intellectual integrity and the capacity of leadership at a national government level to embrace the gas to liquids debate. Gas to liquid technology is there to be opened up. We need to ensure that we create liquid transport fuel markets both in Australia and internationally. In the same way, we should be doing something about the biofuels industry, which the member for Capricornia will touch on at length. I say to the government: lead, do something, make some hard decisions. Gas to liquid technology has not been used on a global scale before simply because global oil supplies have been so abundant and crude oil refining has been less expenraise sive. The world is now changing. Recent occurrences have opened up new opportunities if you want to grasp them, but that requires a bit of commitment, integrity and leadership at an Australian government level. If Qatar can do it and seek to become the gas to liquids leading centre of activity in the challenge: world, so can Australia. We as a nation have prided ourselves on playing above our weight, be it in research and development and the historic importance of the CSIRO or on the sporting field. We have always sought to take on the tough decisions and the tough challenges. I am laying down a challenge to the Australian community today: force the Australian government's hand. Unless we stand up as a community and force their hand, they will do nothing. In conclusion, I raise these issues. We cannot sit on our hands. We do not have control over petrol prices internationally, but we can determine our future by getting serious about turning our abundant gas supplies into liquid transport fuels, thereby increasing our self-sufficiency and reducing our reliance on Middle East imports. If we ever needed to do that, we need to do it today. In 1996 the Prime Minister wanted to know the ordinary battlers-now he has dismissed them as irrelevant; he has used them up enough. I simply say: front up to your responsibilities. (Time expired)",110
143,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Wide Bay-Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (3.53 pm)-I note the contribution of the honourable member for Batman to the debate on the importance of providing fuel to our industry and to transport at an affordable and reliable price. Unfortunately, the reality is that the honourable member for Batman is full of criticism but not terribly many solutions. As a farmer and as someone who lives in a regional area, I know as well as anyone the real impact of rising fuel prices on the household budget. It affects every family in Australia. It means that money that would otherwise be available to spend on things that might be a family priority needs to be used to power the family motor vehicle or undertake other tasks in the region. It affects some industries more than others. Obviously, the transport sector faces increased costs, some of which are being passed on by special fuel surcharges. It affects those people who need a lot of energy to undertake their daily work. That includes farmers and quite a lot of people in industry. It also affects the tourism industry, particularly in areas where there is a dependence on the motoring public. All of that clearly has implications that we would prefer not occur. All Australians want lower fuel prices. It is true-as the honourable member for Batman acknowledged-that we are a significant exporter of energy, so in relation to the balance sheet there have also been some positives associated with the higher price of energy around the world. Very little of that flows directly to the person who is pulling up at the petrol station, to compensate for the higher cost associated with filling their tanks. As the member for Rankin has said on a number of occasions, and as was confirmed today by the member for Batman, Australia's record petrol prices have one cause and one cause only-that is, high world oil prices. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said that. The government have not been running away from that issue. We have not sought to not tell the Australian people what the facts are; we have done precisely the opposite. Fortunately, there is a degree of unanimity around the place. There is the odd witchdoctor or conspiracy theory but in reality most people acknowledge-and most people at home appreciate-that this is an issue largely outside the control of a country like Australia. Graeme Samuel, from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, added another important comment when he said: Although we only import a very small level of our total petrol needs into Australia, most of it's refined in Australia. The Australian refiners of course have the option to sell into the world market, on for example the Singapore market, or to sell it to Australian motorists. He makes the very valid point that, even if we were to try and artificially manipulate the prices in this country, the effect would be one of there being no available fuel in this country, because people would take the economic answer, the best financial solution for them, and export it to other parts of the world. So petrol prices in Australia are closely linked to international prices because our refiners have the option to sell it anywhere they choose in the world. There has been criticism during question time-and this was briefly alluded to by the honourable member for Batman-that perhaps the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission should do more to somehow or other reduce the price of fuel. It is not correct to say that the ACCC does not monitor petrol prices. In fact, I am told that it monitors petrol, diesel and auto LPG prices at around 4,000 sites across Australia. The ACCC can also conduct additional random monitoring in remote areas and investigate complaints about price changes. This is not about a lack of information; we all know that the price of fuel has gone up. What we would like to see are ways to effectively address the cost of fuel. It is also important to know that the ACCC is equipped to take action under the Trade Practices Act if there is evidence of anticompetitive behaviour, including undertaking informal monitoring, investigations and court cases in the petroleum area as appropriate. For example, the ACCC has instituted proceedings against 16 respondents, alleging a number of competitors in the Ballarat region were part of a long standing arrangement to fix retail petrol prices. On 17 March 2005, the Federal Court imposed penalties totalling $23 million in response to these allegations. So the ACCC not only has the power; it has exercised it, and very significant penalties have been imposed. I encourage anyone who has evidence of illegal practices within the Australian fuel retail, wholesale or refining sector to report it to the ACCC. Labor should put up or shut up if they believe that there is evidence of price manipulation or ineffective competition in the marketplace. The member for Rankinwho is not just an ordinary backbencher of the Labor Party; he happens to be chairman of the federal Labor caucus economic committee, so presumably he is speaking with some kind of economic authority from the other side-has written: Nor is it true that an oil cartel is artificially ing petrol prices ... the petrol retail market is highly competitive. The opposition has effectively ruled out the conspiracy theories and the arguments about a lack of transparency. It has ruled out all those things. So it is unfortunate that, from time to time, we get this crass attempt to break out on those sorts of issues and seek to blame people who cannot reasonably be held responsible. Mr Martin Ferguson-We didn't seek to do that, Warren.",112
144,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have done it, whether you sought to do it or not. People on your side have certainly been very active in so doing.",114
145,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! We do not need a debate across the table.,114
146,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Australia's retail petrol prices remain amongst the lowest in the developed countries. Again, I know that is no comfort to people who are pulling up at a petrol station. They think the price is too high and the fact that ours is the fourthcheapest price amongst the 30 OECD countries is of little comfort. The United Kingdom pays around twice the price for petrol that we do. According to the International Energy Association, Australia has the fourthlowest fuel taxation in any OECD country and, consequently, the fourth-lowest petrol prices. So it is a fact that, even though our prices are high, much of the rest of the world has to endure an even greater burden. One element that is frequently brought into focus when people are concerned about the cost of petrol is the level of fuel taxes. That has not been such a strong theme this time, because the public also know that this government has done more than any other to stop the increase in fuel prices as a result of spikexcise. That is not true for those opposite. For the record, it needs to be said that, when the Hawke Labor government was elected on 5 March 1983, federal petrol excise stood at just 6.155c a litre. From that time on, there has been a ruthless march upwards in excise levels. Within three years, Labor had doubled the excise figure to 15.776c a litre. Within another year, it had trebled to 19.2c a litre. And then who can forget the infamous Keating budget of 1993, where Labor promised it would not increase taxes but petrol went up another 3c a litre. In fact, in the 13 years of Labor, fuel excise went up by 590 per cent-that is, 15 per cent a year for 13 years compound. They were great taxers. When Labor left office in March 1996, the fuel excise stood at 36.325c a litre. So it is pretty hypocritical when we hear people on the opposite side say that their answer is a new theory to take 3c or 4c a litre off the price of fuel. The reality is that Labor have never cut fuel excise levels. They have an appalling record of massively increasing those levels. Mr Crean interjecting",114
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Hotham has already been warned.,115
148,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And do not forget that the current Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance when many of those increases were put in place. Contrast that with what this government has done. We have frozen the excise level. It has not gone up for four years. We also reduced excise significantly when we introduced the new tax system, and then a further 1.8c a litre a little time later. This has been a government that, for the first time ever, has been out cutting taxes on fuel, and that is almost unprecedented in our national history. There is one tax that goes up when fuel prices go up-that is, the GST. Of course, the full impact of the GST-the full benefits of that price increase-goes back to the states. So if anybody has a capacity to cut taxes, to reduce the cost of fuel, it is obviously the states. Mr Crean interjecting",115
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Hotham will remove himself from the House understanding order 94(a). The member for Hotham then left the chamber.,115
150,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They could accept some kind of a freeze on GST, if they chose to do so-I am not expecting that they will. It is also true to say that business users get their GST refunded for the fuel they use for business purposes. The change in taxation policy makes a huge difference to the price of fuel, and I think it is part of the reason why the public have been a little more understanding about the current price than they have been in the past. To put this into some kind of context, a family who uses 50 litres of petrol a week is now saving $174 a year in excise as a result of the changes that we have made. If Labor had still been in office and there had been no change to the tax system, the fuel excise now would be 52.8c a litre, or 38 per cent higher than it is. So Labor comes into this debate with a fair bit of history, with a fair bit of dirty linen. I note that the honourable member for Batman, in a very important contribution to the debate, spoke about the need for us to look towards alternative fuels. I agree absolutely that we need to consider what other options are available. Of course, as prices go there up, all of these other options become economically more attractive. One area where again the Labor Party's record does not stand up to their current visionary claims is in relation to ethanol and biodiesel. They have organised a systematic campaign to vilify ethanol as a fuel. This burgeoning industry has been effectively destroyed in its infancy by outrageous statements made by the opposition. Their dishonesty and the way in which they have peddled stories about engine failure and the like have seriously damaged the growth of the ethanol industry around Australia. It has been left to the government to try and foster this industry. We have provided very substantial financial support for the ethanol industry. We have indicated that we want 350 million litres of ethanol to be used in Australia by 2010. That is a pretty modest target, yet we have gone backwards over a considerable period of that time because of the vilification of biofuels by the opposition. Mr Katter interjecting",115

152,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the opposition want to make a constructive contribution, why don't they start supporting ethanol and biodiesel? Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting",116
153,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Batman has had his 15 minutes.,116
154,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Why don't they give us a chance to substitute renewable fuels for oil and the other fuel mixes that we have at the present time? I acknowledge that there will be a future role for gas, hydrogen and who knows what else in powering motor vehicles in Australia. A lot of that technology is not yet there. I understand that the honourable member for Capricornia is about to speak, so she might like to explain why the Labor Party are so opposed to the shale oil developments in her own electorate. There are plenty of options around for us to provide an opportunity to develop domestic, homegrown renewable and other fuels to power our industry into the future. I do not believe that the solution is as suggested by the former President of the ALP and the member for Fremantle, Carmen Lawrence, when she addressed a large rally in Western Australia last year and advocated $2.50 a litre as the price of petrol-that we try to force people off the road by charging outrageous prices for petrol. In fact, that $2.50 in today's terms would probably be close to $4 a litre. Now that is not a reasonable approach to take. The ALP's approach to fuel pricing 12 months ago, ‘Oil: living with less', was an irresponsible approach. It tears away at the credibility of the Labor Party and their crocodile tears in relation to fuel prices at the present time. I think we can work constructively as the government and as a community to encourage alternative fuels, to seek to deliver the that we have in the most efficient and effective way, to use our energy more sparingly so that it can be available to share with future generations and also to make a genuine effort towards developing new energy technologies and growing the ones we already have such as biodiesel and ethanol. So stop criticising this; give it a go and it can make a contribution. Let me say that the fuel companies should follow as well. If they want to deliver cheaper fuel than at present, they should add some ethanol, because it is cheaper than oil. (Time expired)",116
155,Ms LIVERMORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The debates that are going on in this House today say so much about what has changed in the attitude of the Howard government over the last couple of years and particularly since the 2004 election. This week we have had a clear illustration of just how out of touch the government have become and how far removed they are from the real lives of average Australians. Gone are the days when the Prime Minister could proudly claim to be finely tuned into the views of the electorate and government policies would be scrapped or rewritten after just one bad session on talkback radio. Just have a look at what is going on in parliament this week and it is obvious that the Howard government has stopped listening to what the Australian people are saying. In the Senate the government is voting for the sale of Telstra against the wishes of 70 per cent of the community and contrary to all the evidence mounting by the day that this is bad policy-bad socially, bad economically and just plain bad for this country's future and all the people who would actually like a stake in that future. In this chamber we have tried for three days now to make the government realise just how badly our constituents-mums and dads, pensioners, small business people and oil primary producers-are suffering from the record high petrol prices we have seen in recent weeks. We have tried in vain to have the Treasurer step up and act as the leader he aspires to be and end the apparent price gouging that is indicated by the gap between world crude oil prices and the price for refined petrol here in Australia. But the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have consistently refused to act, to do what is in their power to stop our constituents from being ripped off. Instead they shrug their shoulders and say, ‘It's got nothing to do with us; it's just the world oil prices.' In other words, to all those people around Australia whose budgets are stretched to breaking point by high petrol prices this is to say, ‘You can cop it sweet.' This week we have seen a shameful display of the government washing its hands of any responsibility for high petrol prices. And equally shameful is the fact that for nine long years the government has been sitting on its hands while Australia has become increasingly reliant on imports for our energy needs. That reliance on imports makes us more vulnerable than we need to be to future global oil shocks and fails to capitalise on our own potential to develop new industries in our important energy sector. As someone who proudly represents a region that is at the heart of Australia's resources sector, supplying energy to Queensland and exporting coal to the world, I was shocked to learn that our country, so rich in natural resources, imports 60 per cent of the oil we need to make petrol and diesel. Since we are currently consuming oil three times faster than we are finding it, that figure can only worsen. The outlook for the prices we are paying for those oil imports in the world market is not expected to improve greatly either. All that coal going out of my electorate to steel plants and factories is making China and the other Asian nations wealthier by the day and with that development and rise in living standards comes even more demand for oil. On present trends, we will be competing with these huge nations for the same oil resources for which we are competing right now. That can only mean one thing: higher petrol prices are here to stay. However, the question is whether Australia is merely a victim of higher prices or a player in the market, able to benefit from the world demand for energy and make our own domestic prices more bearable. We in the Labor Party believe that more can be done and that more should have been done by this government to just develop our own sources of transport fuel. As someone who sits in question time every day, I sometimes think that the government's worse characteristic is its arrogance. As someone who cares deeply about the future of this country, I think the worse thing about this government is its complacency. This issue is a classic example of that complacency and laziness. The Howard government has had nine long years to come up with a plan to address our growing import dependency and exposure to the whims of the OPEC cartel and Middle Eastern oil producers, but here we are in 2005 and, after nine long years in power, the government is wringing its hands about Hurricane Katrina and saying, ‘That old world oil price: what can you do?' They could start by getting serious about the potential for natural gas to be converted into liquid fuel. There is a significant opportunity for Australia to develop a large-scale alternative fuels industry producing ultraclean diesel, using vast natural gas reserves which, until now, have been stranded in terms of their economic value because of their remoteness from markets and infrastructure. As my colleague the member for Hunter told the House yesterday, there are 150 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves in Australia that could be converted into uid diesel. This is precisely what is happening in Qatar in the Middle East, as the member for Batman pointed out, and there is no reason why Australia could not be developing that same capacity and establishing a whole new industry around those resources. Growing up in Central Queensland, I watched the Bowen Basin coal industry develop from paddocks into a multibillion dollar export industry employing thousands of people and sustaining some 15 vibrant communities. So I have seen what strategic support for an industry can achieve for a region and for our country. The other component of an alternative fuels plan, which is music to any Queenslander's ears, is ethanol and biofuels. Mr Windsor-Hear, hear! Mr Katter-Hear, hear!",116
156,Ms LIVERMORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you for that support from the Independent members. What a surprise-good on them! This is something we can do even more quickly to address the issue of self-sufficiency. The government has to stop looking at this industry through political eyes. It is always looking at it in terms of what it can horse trade with the National Party or how it can give a leg-up to this or that producer. As my colleague the member for Hunter said yesterday, while this government is a friend to certain ethanol producers it is no friend to the ethanol industry because it has no plan for the industry. The government needs to start looking seriously at the ethanol industry as an industry which has real potential to boost Australia's energy self-sufficiency and the long-term viability of many of our rural communities. Labor has always supported the development of the biofuels industry in Australia. It is a shame that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is not here to learn liq- about this. It was the Keating government that introduced an 18c a litre production bounty for ethanol in the 1993-94 budget, in addition to the zero excise rating. Let us not forget that it was the Howard government that abolished the bounty scheme one year early in the 1996-97 budget. In the last parliament alone the Howard government changed its mind three times about excise on ethanol. How can you expect people to invest in an industry when there is that lack of vision and coherence coming from government? Instead, it has been Labor state governments that have been left to show leadership and promote and develop the ethanol industry. In Queensland and New South Wales the Labor governments have been actively promoting ethanol blends-including using ethanol blends in government fleet vehicles-and they have been working with the oil companies, including independent chains, to grow the market for ethanol products in those states. For example, the Queensland government has helped many service stations to convert their underground storage tanks to hold E10-and I believe that that has just happened in one service station in Rockhampton, in my own electorate. I have another question for the ministerit is a shame he is not here. How hard would it be for the Prime Minister to require the Commonwealth fleet to use ethanol blends where possible? It would cost him nothing to be generous in supporting the development of the ethanol market in this way. So perhaps, instead of pointing the finger at us, the minister who was here in the chamber should be talking to the Prime Minister and seeing what the Commonwealth government can be doing in a realistic and practical way to help the ethanol industry. These are typical forward-looking, industry-supporting, nation-building Labor initiatives-the kind that this country is calling out for but never sees from this government. This government should not condemn Australia to being merely a victim of high fuel prices when with some foresight and commitment we could develop our own resources. We can become more self-sufficient and be a player in the market, generating the kind of revenue that will set up our country's future rather than sell it short.",118
157,Mr JOHNSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am very pleased to speak on this MPI because it demonstrates to the parliament and the people of Australia that the federal opposition are quite unfit for office. Indeed, they have never been more unfit for office than they are today. I thought that they would have been more engaged in policy development, but instead in question time today the opposition highlighted very clearly that they have no capacity to do things in the interests of this country. The other thing that this MPI demonstrates is that the opposition is clearly touch with the dynamics of international economics and how that impacts on the people of Australia. The MPI shows that the Labor opposition does not understand how the global economy functions. I thought the shadow minister would have some understanding of this, but quite clearly he does not have even an elementary understanding. The government is fully aware of how significant the increase in petrol prices is Australians right across this country. Petrol price increases are certainly not good for businesses or families. As the Treasurer indicated today in question time, these increases are not welcomed by the government and it seeks to do as much as it can to alleviate the impact. The government fully understands the economic and social pain that these increases are having on Australians right across this country. As I mentioned, the government is not very happy about it at all, but I say to the opposition that there is limited scope for the federal government to take action. I think the Australian people appreciate this. The overwhelming majority of Australians appreciate the scope of a national government to intervene in a situation of global economics where a product is highly influenced by international relations, international politics and international economics. What we heard from the shadow minister the member for Batman, and his colleague the member for Capricornia, was cheap politics. It was hollow politics which tried to stimulate people in the community into thinking that we could do things in this parliament that are beyond the capacity of the federal government. I am disappointed that the member for Rankin, who is a Queensland member and a former shadow minister, has left the chamber because I wanted to quote him. I think that he would really appreciate what I would like to quote in this debateout of but I will come to that in a moment. This MPI calls on the ACCC to get involved in this issue. Of course, as the Treasurer mentioned, it is true that the ACCC has the authority and the responsibility to monitor petrol prices. It already does this informally around the 4,000 sites across this country. The point to be made here is that the Labor Party has clearly not done its homework. It is trying to lecture the government for about what to tell the ACCC, but it does not realise that the ACCC has put out a statement saying that it is already doing that. Today is 14 September, and in a press release dated 12 September the ACCC said: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has confirmed that it is closely monitoring developments in petrol prices both in Australia and overseas. Recently there have been significant increases both in the level of petrol prices in Australia and also in the difference between petrol prices and crude oil prices. This phenomenon is occurring not only in Australia but also internationally. It is primarily a of a shortage in the supply of refined product in the US Gulf following Hurricane Katrina and the Chinese government's recent decision to take steps to halt the export of petrol because of an acute shortage of fuel in several of China's provinces. This is from a press release issued by the ACCC on 12 September. In today's MPI debate, the shadow minister for primary industries, resources, forestry and tourism, the member for Batman, called on the Australian government to direct the ACCC to monitor fuel prices in this country. It is not for me to counsel the opposition, but I suggest that it might want to do some homework before it starts lecturing this government on its policies and what it can do to alleviate petrol prices. This is a major own goal. This statement clearly says that petrol prices in this country are heavily influenced by external forces that are beyond the control of this government. The shadow minister was asleep at the wheel there. I want to make it very plain that at this point in time there is no evidence that domestic price increases are linked to any anticompetitive action or practiceMs George-That's not what Graeme Samuel said.",119
158,Mr JOHNSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"which is the implication of what the shadow minister is calling for to be looked at. He is calling on the government to direct the ACCC to take a certain course of action on the basis that there is anticompetitive practice. As the Treasurer said, the ACCC has powers, it has full awareness of its powers and it is in a position to act as is appropriate. If there has been any breach of the law, there will be a prosecution and there will be heavy penalties if they are warranted. But the ACCC does not need this government to instruct it on how to act in this situation. I want to talk about Australian petrol result prices in general because, as I have alluded to, the opposition quite clearly does not understand. Australian petrol prices are linked to international prices around the world. Two-thirds of the oil used in Australian refineries is imported. It follows, therefore, that the rise of crude oil prices will clearly have an impact on what people pay at the bowser. Let me repeat this for the member for Throsby and all those sitting opposite: this country has little influence over petrol prices-certainly not to the extent that the shadow minister is trying to imply and to shamelessly portray to the people of this country. It is also very clear-it should be very clear to the opposition-that fuel excise is a fixed amount levied on the quantity of petrol sold. Therefore, revenue collected by the government is not increased or affected by petrol price fluctuations. I know that shadow ministers and members opposite are trying to stir up the public and trying to give the impression that when petrol prices increase there is a wash of money flowing to the federal government. That is absolute nonsense. It is not correct and it is important that members of the government stand in this chamber and clearly communicate what the true position is. In 2000, following the commencement of the new tax regime, excise was reduced by around 6.7c per litre. The government further reduced petrol and diesel excise by 1.5c per litre in March 2001 and, very importantly, abolished the half-yearly indexation of fuel excise. It is incumbent upon members of the government to make this very clear in this chamber and it is incumbent on the opposition to tell the full story. We on this side of the chamber all know that, whatever the opposition say, either they do not tell the full story or they exaggerate. We have to check because we do not want to take anything they say as gospel. I know that the people of my community, the constituents of Ryan, will be fully aware of how they suffered under the last Labor government. It is very important that they are reminded of how the former Labor government managed the economy of this nation. When they were in government in 1993, with a deficit of $17 billion, the government of Paul Keating increased excise by 3c, thereby pounding motorists throughout Australia and, in my case, very significantly hurting the motorists of the electorate of Ryan. Thankfully, with the economy on the ropes, a coaliin tion government was elected in 1996. It is very important to state that since 2001 the government has frozen excise, unlike the position that prevailed under the Labor Party, when indexation twice a year bludgeoned family budgets. It is very important that we continue to say this and that members of the government remind their constituents of what damage can be done to family budgets if the opposition ever takes office. I want to conclude by calling upon all governments around this country to use the GST revenues, of which they are awash, to reduce the impact of petrol prices. My home state of Queensland is forecast to get over $7.7 billion in GST revenue in 2005. Other states are also awash in GST revenue and they can do something. They can follow the lead of the Queensland government, in this instance, and try to alleviate the impact of petrol prices. The Australian Labor Party comes to this parliament being very lazy and sloppy in its policy development. It is an opposition that is failing to do its homework. It is in policy freeze and the people of tralia should know that. (Time expired)",120
159,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I listened with interest to the member for Ryan, the previous speaker on this matter of public of importance. There were a couple of comments that I would pick up on, though. He spoke early in his speech about the global economy, quite rightly, and I think he inadvertently hit on an issue that we really do need to address. What we do in this country is produce a lot of products internally, surplus to our own needs, and export those products, generally into corrupt world markets. There have been a number of initiatives to try and break that nexus. The grain industry, in particular, exports something like 20 million tonnes of grain, and the same applies the sugar industry. I think 80 per cent of sugar is exported into corrupt world markets at what we would consider to be below the cost of production. To become more competitive globally and within the domestic scene, rather than exporting all that product we could be manufacturing renewable fuels. That could have a significant effect not only internally in our regional communities-the general economies of our towns et ceterabut also on the health of the nation. The other day we listened to the Minister for Health and Ageing saying that in the future we are going to have to make sure that we try to reduce illness, and, in doing that, we will make some savings in relation to the health budget-and I agree with him. But this government is sitting on its hands in relation to this issue of ethanol and biofuels. Rather than exporting grain onto corrupt markets-taking the price that is available and seeing more and more farmers leave their farms because they cannot handle a domestic cost structure and a corrupt world market-and then using some of the receipts Aus- to go out and buy oil on another corrupt world market to feed the nation with some energy, what we should be doing is bypassing that so that we do not become so reliant on those global markets that the member for Ryan spoke about. In doing that, we would ensure that our regional communities would not only get major investment but also get jobs. We would underwrite, potentially, the grain price and have a much greater impact on the domestic grain price, which is totally dominated by export markets at the moment. The government recognised that in 2001; it put in place a policy to aim for 350 million litres of biofuels by 2010. We are nearly halfway through the decade. There is a cabinet task force that will report in a week days on this issue, and their report will be essentially what they said in 2001-that we aim for 350 million litres of biofuels by 2010. The fuel industries know full well-and I am sure other members in here know-that, unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon the fuel companies, they will not accept biofuels, because they see that as removing some of their power in the marketplace. So it will require a government mandate, as in other places all over the world. The United States are building an ethanol plant at the rate of one every 23 days; in its sugar industry, Brazil is increasing its ethanol production at the rate of one Australian sugar industry a year; and, last week, the Philippines mandated the use of ethanol in petrol. For people in this place to say, as they have in recent weeks, that a mandate is something that a coalition government should not look at is absolute nonsense. We have mandated the non-use of lead in petrol for health reasons, and we have taken out high sulfur levels for health reasons; we have mandated that. I was disgusted the other day to see the Grains Council of Australia, when they are there to represent the grains industry, saying that motorists should have choice. I used to be a member of that body, and I am disgusted at their performance in trying to encourage higher grain prices for grain producers. In recent days the minister for health, again-and I agree with him-has been talking about the use of Opal fuels in some parts of Central Australia, for health reasons, for Aboriginal communities. That is a mandate. Why can't we mandate 10 per cent and move, over the next decade, to a gradated introduction of ethanol into our fuels? In my view, this dogma we are being fed that it or 10 would reduce choice in the marketplace is code for saying that we are captive of the fuel companies. The government is captive of the fuel companies. If the government could approach it in a completely new direction, it could listen to the scientists who are sayingMr Katter-Hear, hear.",121
160,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"that the addition of ethanol is not only good for country towns, sugar producers and the farmers et cetera; it is also successful in oxygenating fuel-it is a natural oxygenator of fuel. What is happening in California and in other parts of the United States, in particular, and in other parts of the world-because of the fine particle emissions from our modern engines, the need for our modern engines to have high-octane ratings, and the carcinogenic additives that are put into the fuel mix to generate those high-octane ratings-is that they are using ethanol to replace the nasties, the MTBEs. I am sure the member for Kennedy will reflect on that. If the government is not keen on coming from the direction of assisting agriculture, and the National Party wants to walk out on the farming community once again, why not adopt the direction that they have on leaded fuels, with the removal of lead; on the removal of high sulfur from diesels; and on the introduction of Opal fuels to help prevent petrol sniffing and the death of Aboriginal youngsters? Why not come at it from that angle and move away from the dogma that the Grains Council has adopted that the motorist must have choice? We live in a community where we regulate. We have spent days here talking about how we are going to regulate Telstra. I did not hear those same people jumping up and down and saying that it should be fully deregulated. Of course, governments are there to do something in relation to the health of the nation. The other thing that the member for Ryan talked about is that the government has frozen fuel excise at 38c a litre. But it also removed the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, which was put in place when the goods and services tax was introduced, to cover the gap between the higher price that country residents paid and the lower price that city residents paid and the difference in the goods and services tax between the two prices. The government removed that. Essentially that means an increase in price to country people. So, even though I agree with freezing the 38c a litre excise-the government has done that there has been an increase of 1c to 3c in fuel pricing under the government's taxation regime because of the removal of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. The federal government raises about $14 billion federally in excise. The states raise about $4 billion-according to my calculations-in GST. Currently we are hearing that there has been a 25 per cent increase in price in the last three months. That is an extra pense to motorists of $9.3 billion. If we look back, particularly at city areas, where it was 70c and is heading for $1.50, we see that an additional $2.4 billion in GST has been raised through that gap. I agree with the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who was here earlier, when he said that the states can do something in terms of their GST receipts and they should do something. But the federal government can do something as well. We pay 51c a litre tax in this country for fuel by way of goods and services tax and the federal excise. So, when people say we have to be globally competitive, we really have to look at the taxation structure that we have in relation to fuel, and the states and the federal government have a role to play. If we are serious about addressing this issue and making this nation as globally competitive as it possibly can be, we have to look at those taxation-raising measures from both a federal and a state perspective. I conclude by saying we must look at renewable energies for the future. (Time expired)",122
161,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will review the world situation, as did the previous speaker, my colleague the honourable member for New England. It never ceases to amaze me in this place that we keep being told that we must accept the inevitable, that we must have free markets. I just get so sick of hearing that. That anyone in a position of influence, such as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, could still be preaching that garbage, when even a dull-witMr Johnson interjecting",123

Even a person like that would have to know-for the information of my fine friend over here, who is passing pejorative remarks about me-that you ex- simply go to the OECD web site to find out that 49 per cent is the average subsidy for agricultural commodities in the world. You sit here, my friend, and you laugh at people like me. Instead of coming in here and laughing like a hyena and making like a galah, it would be desirable that you take yourself off and do a little bit of homework so that you do not come in here and make a fool of yourself, such as your colleague the honourable minister",123
163,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.,124
164,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Brazil is on 22 per cent. We have heard from the government and from the oil companies and from the NRMA-they are a spokesman for the oil companies. There is a club here. The NFF belongs to it; the NRMA belongs to it; all these people belong to that club. We have heard that cars break down if you put ethanol in them. There are about a hundred million cars in Brazil. They are all breaking down, are they? Minnesota has been on 10 per cent ethanol for 15 years. All the cars in Minnesota are breaking down, are they? California, with 26 million cars, is now on 10 per cent ethanol. Are the people that occupy the state and federal legislature in the United States all dimwits? New York is on 10 per cent ethanol. The United States passed legislation last month to move to five per cent by the year 2012. We say that we must get in step with the rest of the world. If we got in step with the rest of the world, our agricultural industries would enjoy subsidy levels of 49 per cent instead of about two per cent, which they are presently on. The EU transportation and energy committee has recommended a target of seven per cent for the European Union. It is now so lucrative that for the last two weeks we have been fielding telephone calls from Geneva and London and those sorts of places wanting to get hold of Australian ethanol. Sadly, Australia does not have any ethanol. This did not make a lot of publicity because the United States is already on three per ethanol by law. It is not a law that says you have to put ethanol in; it is a law that says you have to have healthy tailpipe emissions. That is what forced the issue in the United States and that is why they are on three per cent. Japan, as the national media in Australia has reported, is already trialling it with Brazil. There are discussions and negotiations taking place right at this moment. The only reason Japan is reluctant is that the only place it can get supply from is Brazil. It is desperate for Australia to come in; Japan will then feel much more comfortable. The Philippines, as my colleague has already mentioned, has moved to mandated ethanol. China and India are both building plants as we speak. The only country on earth that appears to be doing nothing about it is the country that believes its farmers can work off a level playing field whilst the rest of the world lives off 49 per cent. We are talking today about the price of fuel. I talk about things that I know about here. Wright Killen and Fluor Daniel of Texas did work for the Queensland government which dates back to 1890-I should say 1990, although they were using ethanol then, I might add. The figure used by the Queensland government study, the figure used by us, the figure I have been working on, is 600 litres per tonne. I was corrected the other day by a Brazilian, who said it is between 650 and 720: ‘Your figures are old, Mr Katter.' I said, ‘They are; they are 1990 figures. Technology has moved on.' It is 600 litres a tonne. If we require in the sugar industry $360 a tonne for our product, then that is 55.4c you pay the food stock producersthe sugar industry. There is a 9.5c processing cost for grains, which is much cheaper with sugar. They have to convert to sugar, then go to alcohol. We are already at sugar; we do cent not have that conversion. So it is much cheaper. But I will use the figure of 9.5c and an excise of 12.5c. This government is the only government in the world that has taxed ethanol, as far as I can make out. Certainly in Europe it is not taxed. So this is the only government on earth that taxes it. And the transport minister has the hide to come into this place and say, ‘Why don't you do something about ethanol?' But let me go on. That is 77.4c a litre. I repeat that to the House: that figure is 77.4c a litre. We can provide for you petrol at 77.4c a litre. The retail is put top of that, so let us say that is 6c, and there might even be another 6c for transport costs-I will be very generous and allow that-so that would take it to 90c. Out there we are paying $1.30 and $1.40 a litre for petrol. The answer is right here. You can move on it tomorrow. You just might rescue the ailing sugar industry of Australia and you just might be able to make the grains industry of Australia competitive. On behalf of the people in the boondocks, I ask the people that represent these industries to please discount them. They are irresponsible people; they have never represented the people they are supposed to represent. Doug Anthony introduced, over the top of the leaders of the wool industry-he trampled all over them and rode a steamroller over them-the wool bill and it doubled the price of wool. So we laughed and scoffed at the so-called industry leaders at the time. I have quoted figures that are very conservative. The real figures are about $300 a tonne for sugar and there are 650 litres to 720 litres to a tonne, but again I will take the conservative figure. That works out at 46.2c a litre plus 8.5c. I will deduct 1c a litre for the processing cost, which I think is very conservative, and will add the 12.5c a litre for the government charge. That is 66.2c a litre. This document has petrol at 45c, which it was. If you add 38c excise, it is 83c a litre-plus retail, that was about 90c a litre when this document came out. It is now at $1.40. When is the government going to act? That is not the reason why other countries have gone to ethanol. America challenged Brazil in the WTO; the case was thrown out. Brazil said: ‘We have a right to produce our own oil, and we have two of the most polluted cities on earth where people are dying that do not have to die'-Sao Paulo and Rio on de Janeiro. Professor Ray Kearney, the leading authority in the country in lung disease, has said that people are dying that do not have to die. Tom Beer, the leading authority on air pollution in Australia, has said that people are dying. Both of them-both leading authorities in this country-are on record as saying that more people are dying from motor vehicle exhaust than from motor vehicle accidents. That is verified for anyone who is interested. If you get the congressional report, the information paper which is given to congressmen and senators in Washington DC, you will see exactly the same thing in that report. I have mentioned on many occasions the journal of the AMA in the United States. On page 1137 there is a graph which shows that when the pollution levels double in the United States the number of people that die of lung cancer doubles. What is the government doing about it? Mr Truss, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, came into this place and had the hide to accuse the ALP and to say they should get on side and support ethanol. What is he doing to support ethanol? Would someone tell me? He is the government minister for transport. When I first proposed ethanol, he attacked me and said: ‘It will only help the Brazilians.' When that was laughed to ridicule, he then said: ‘You cannot mix it. It would have to be brought down to Brisbane to be mixed, so you cannot do it.' I was at a seminar and the bloke said: ‘It is very difficult to mix.' Another one he came up with was ‘It causes cancer' and ‘Your car will break down.' He has produced a report that says not to do it. Who do we blame? We blame him. (Time expired)",124

As a consequence, the minister finally tabled the transcript to which she had been referring. I note that she did not take the opportunity to read the transcript in full. Anyone who reads the transcript will clearly understand that I was speaking about a perception in the small business community over unfair dismissals-a perception deliberately brought up by former minister Reith. I made the point that, yes, my wife is concerned about unfair dismissals off the back of that perception, but her employees work under state awards. My point was that Peter Reith had been deliberately placing this perception in the small business community, putting fear into the minds of people who are not even affected by federal legislation.

172,Ms GEORGE,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I must say how good it was to sit and listen to the speeches of the member for Kennedy and the member for New England and hear them actually articulating some creative strategies in terms of the need for this country to take seriously the issue of renewable energies. It is certainly a contrast to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005, which I am now going to speak on-a bill that I oppose. This bill is not creative thinking for the future; it is another reflection of the hamfisted bullyboy tactics that we see coming from the government, particularly in trying to foist its regressive IR changes onto the work force and specifically, in this bill, onto the workers in the higher education sector. For those reasons, I oppose this bill. It is ham-fisted, it is another indication of bullyboy tactics and it reflects a desire by this government to micromanage the higher education sector by forcing onto that sector conditions of employment and IR changes that really have nothing to do with that sector. In the era of enterprise bargaining, that sector has shown that it is quite capable of managing to negotiate good outcomes through enterprise bargaining. In a sense, I think this bill reflects the desire of the government to thwart those productive relations by trying to insist that conditions of employment that are not necessary for that sector be a condition of future funding. As we know, in late 2003 this parliament allocated funds for universities for the period 2005-07. These funding arrangements are now about to be changed-retrospectively if the bill sees the light of day and gets through the Senate, where similar proposals have been blocked in the past. The government wants us to amend the Higher Education Support Act to provide for the inclusion of new ‘workplace relations requirements'and of course that is code for ‘individual contracts'-as a precondition of eligibility for the $280 million of additional assistance funding that was promised to the universities under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. These increases to the basic grant will, if this legislation gets through, depend on the universities consenting to a raft of regressive IR changes. In the end, the funds will be contingent on the minister's approval. It is certainly transferring a lot of power to the ister, who, as we know, seems to want to ensure that his view of the world is imposed on the workers in that sector. What I find most offensive is that $280 million of additional funding-which is sorely needed in that sector; universities desperately need that money-will be at risk unless universities comply with a range of conditions that the minister wants to impose and will tick off. This is blackmail of the worse kind. Through these new requirements, the government is seeking to directly dictate the form of industrial agreements that should be offered to staff and to micromanage conditions of employment. I find that amazing, because the government has double standards on this issue. On the one hand, it says that the unions ought to leave the field free for employers and employees to negotiate their own arrangements-precisely what is happening in the sector-but, on the other hand, when those arrangements do not suit, when the outcomes of those arrangements do not suit, the minister wants to override them and impose on that sector very regressive and backward-looking industrial relations changes. Whilst today the federal government provides only 40 per cent of university revenue, increasingly forcing the burden onto students and their families, it wants to control 100 per cent of university workplace relations. It is a joke. As I said earlier, the government tried to link similar changes to university funding in 2003, but that was stopped in the Senate. We are naturally very concerned about the fate of this bill when it gets to the Senate, with the changed composition in that chamber. As I say, ‘workplace relations requirements' is really code for the notorious individual contracts which this government sees as the centrepiece of its deregulation of the industrial relations sector. It is clearly an attempt to min- erode the successful enterprise agreements that have been negotiated on behalf of staff across the nation, in every university, in particular by the NTEU, the union in that sector. Because of changes to the award system, minimum conditions of employment for university staff are now set out in collective agreements. Agreements reached between universities and local branches through the enterprise bargaining process are now very much at risk. It seems to me to be nothing but a ham-fisted approach when you consider that universities are now in their fourth round of successful enterprise bargaining, which they have conducted very successfully at every university across the nation. In this sector, enterprise agreements cover all staff, and they provide for key employment conditions-not just salaries but issues to do with parental leave, Indigenous employment, intellectual freedom, collegial decision-making processes, peer review committees, workloads, redundancy matters, classification issues and the regulation of contract and casual employment and related matters. I stress that latter aspect of the gains, because across the work force we are genuinely concerned about the huge growth in contract and casual employment. The issues of tenure and precarious employment are very big issues in the tertiary education sector. What the unions have successfully achieved is a guarantee that the actual conditions and rates of pay are better than the minimum standards that applied in the award system. For example, if you take the closest university to us, the Australian National University, the award rate of pay for a senior lecturer is $57,000, but due to the success of the negotiations, the enterprise rate for that senior lecture is around the $72,000 mark. For a level 6 general staff member, the award rate is $38,000, compared with $48,000 under the enterprise agreement. These outcomes clearly indicate the success of the unions in that sector in sitting down and negotiating with employers and university management to produce outcomes that are in everybody's best interests. As I said earlier, this is the fourth round of negotiations that have occurred in that sector. The success of the university enterprise agreements in protecting the wages and conditions of staff-both academic and support staffhas obviously become a thorn in the side of the government's deregulation agenda. Put simply, in the government's eyes the union has done too well in protecting the interests of its members. Otherwise there would be no rationale for this legislation coming before us. To break these very successful arrangements, which have applied for years, the government now has to actually legislate to extend the reach of individual contracts, AWAs, into the university sector. The bill prescribes that universities must offer AWAs to all new staff members employed after 29 barApril 2005 and to all existing staff by 31 August 2006. This makes a mockery of the government's professed commitment to the principle that negotiations are best left to the parties at an enterprise level. They drag out rationalisations that are totally inconsistent, depending on the outcomes they want to achieve. We were told that the negotiations ought to be left at the enterprise level; now we are being told that you cannot leave them because the spread of AWAs has not been to the extent that they want. As we can see, if the outcomes that are freely negotiated-as they have been in this sector-are not to the government's liking, they will resort to a legislated option to push their agenda. What they have failed to realise, or what they perhaps have not studied closely, is that agreements in the university sector already allow managers to offer individual contracts in accordance with the government's Workplace Relations Act. But the conditions that are currently on offer under individual contracts cannot override the enterprise agreement. So there are protections built into the system; there is a floor beneath which workers in that sector cannot fall if they sign up to an individual contract. The government is arguing that AWAs are needed to attract and reward top staff, but again it does not seem to understand what is going on in the sector. Individual contracts can already be offered under current enterprise agreements, provided that these contracts do not provide conditions below the enterprise agreement minima. Existing agreements in this sector currently provide for performance based contracts for senior managers under which certain provisions of the agreement, like tenure, do not apply. The government should understand that around 30 per cent of staff in the sector are already employed on individual contracts of some sort and the payment of market and merit allowances is widespread. That being the case, the government's decision to legislate the spread of individual contracts is clearly unnecessary and is nothing more than an ideological obsession. As people are aware, individual contracts in the tertiary education sector are approved by the Office of the Employment Advocate on the condition that they pass the no disadvantage test. In the example quoted above, the relevant benchmark for approval of an AWA for a senior lecturer or level 6 general staff employee at the ANU would be $57,000 and $38,000 respectively-up to $15,000 lower than the actual rates of pay under the agreement. But, as we all know, if the government has its way this will change in the future as pay rates in AWAs will be measured against the minimum wage and not the relevant award standards. You can see where this is heading. You cannot divorce this bill from the overall agenda that the government will bring before this House in pursuit of its ambition to reduce minimum standards to a handful of legislated conditions and to allow the award system to wither on the vine. The new requirement that institutions must include a clause in agreements that expressly allows individual contracts to operate to the exclusion of the enterprise agreement means one thing and one thing alone. Under this bill, if carried, AWAs will be able to unUniversity dercut conditions in agreements-make no mistake about that. This must be of concern to all employees in the sector but, I would argue, of particular concern to all future new employees looking to make a career in the tertiary education sector. So that is the heart of it. The government want to enforce the imposition of individual contracts of employment and to micromanage industrial relations in the university sector, to have 100 per cent control, even though their contribution in terms of funding arrangements is about 40 of the total cost. Let us go on to discuss some of the details of the other provisions in the bill. The government say that university agreements, policies and practices must provide for ‘direct relationships with employees'. We know what that means. That is code for trying to get rid of the unions from the sector. The government want to exclude the unions from having a role in consultative processes for staff in negotiating university agreements. Third party involvement-as they refer to it-must only occur at the request of an affected employee and not by right. Let us look at the issues to do with so called ‘workplace flexibility'. We know that in the jargon of the industrial relations debate flexibility is always a one-way street-it is flexibility that suits the needs and aspirations of the employers rather than flexibility that meets the needs of workers in the sector. What the government wants is for university agreements, policies and practices to not limit or restrict the university's ability to make decisions and implement changes in respect of course offerings and associated staffing requirements. So the government wants to abolish existing agreement provisions that guarantee certain processes prior to management initiated change, including changes that lead to staff reductions, to restructuring and to downsizing. It requires: agreements policies and practices must not place limitations on the forms and mix of employment arrangements, and must be simple, flexible and principle-based, avoiding excessive detail and prescription. Talk about jargon. I think what the government is saying is that, through this provision, it is seeking to wind back award based agreement provisions that regulate the use of fixed-term and casual employment and remove many of the detailed consultative and committee procedures relating to unsatisfactory performance, misconduct and termination. The government's focus is on removing the limits that currently exist in many of the agreements for casual employment. Once it does that, this can only exacerbate problems facing university staff and it will lead to cessive workloads, spiralling staff-student ratios and greater job insecurity in that tor. Finally, let me say something about the productivity and performance criteria in the legislation. The government wants to ensure that university agreements, policies and practices include performance management systems that reward high-performing staff and ‘efficiently manage core performing staff'. We know what that means. It means that the government has as its objectives abolition of skill based classification structures and incremental progression provisions-which appear in many of these agreements and are quite common in the education sector-and movement to a point where it can replace them with a single pay point for each classification with discretionary so-called performance based additional payments. Lastly, let me say something about the freedom of association provision. University agreements, policies and practices, the government says, must be consistent with the freedom of association principles contained in the Workplace Relations Act 1996. We know what this means. It is code for trying to restrict the rights of unions to freely represent their work force while having provision for reasonable rights of entry. I can see this meaning that universities will look at not including in future in their agreements provisions that encourage union membership or provisions that might fund or support a union in any way, shape or form. In short, the provisions under this bill, which I oppose, will put at risk up to $280 million in university funding if universities do not comply with this minister's policy directions. These provisions will force universities to offer individual contracts to all university staff-and potentially on conditions inferior to those in current agreements. They will limit the scope of current and fuexture standards. They will undermine the role of a union in agreement making and in represec- senting members. In addition, agreements reached between universities and unions will now have to be vetted for compliance. These measures, in my view, directly threaten the autonomy and independence of universities and the employment conditions of university staff that are freely negotiated between the union representing the workers and the management. Of great concern is that one person-the minister-becomes, in effect, the judge, jury and executioner on university industrial relations. Under this bill, the minister can decide whether the provider is meeting the guidelines; the minister can refuse funding to any provider the minister deems not to be meeting the guidelines and, it seems, can change the guidelines at any time the minister sees fit. This bill would allow the government to tell universities what to do when employing staff and would allow it to interfere with their management processes and their everyday running. This, regrettably, is a taste of things to come under the Howard government's extreme and divisive IR agenda, where we know that the wages and conditions of employees will be cut under its new deregulation model. If that is not the intent, why is it that, despite repeated attempts, we have not been able to get the Prime Minister to guarantee that no employee will be worse off under the government's changes? On this occasion, universities desperately needing funding will be blackmailed to accept the government's ideological agenda. It will be hard for many in the sector to resist the imposition of unjust, unfair and unwarranted changes when they are struggling with totally inadequate funding arrangements from this federal government. Australia's investment, as we know, has dropped substantially and I think this direction is quite unacceptable. (Time expired)",126
173,Mr HENRY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It is certainly interesting listening to the member for Throsby's remarks about restricting the rights of unions and her comments about the principles of freedom of association. But, in reality, she is talking about reducing the rights of individuals to choose whether they want to be in a union and whether they want to enter into agreements of the sort provided by the higher education sector. In the higher education sector, the union movement has created a nice cosy closed shop environment that does not provide the choice that the Howard government wishes to provide through its reforms in this workplace relations bill. Choice is what it is all about-the opportunity to offer alternatives in the employment relationship between employer and employee. It is my belief that workplace relations form in Australia is crucial if we are to remain competitive in world markets and to continue to enjoy the fruits ing and modern 21st century economy. The reforms are designed to ensure that Australia's work force and the work practices that operate within the work force, when benchmarked against international standards, are flexible, productive and cost effective. They are designed to remove anomalies-some of which are ridiculous and some of which are sublime, but all of which are entirely gratuitous-and increase choice as well as to reward those who work hard in whatever is their chosen field of endeavour. No sector of our economy can-or, indeed, should be allowed to-stand aloof from the workplace reform imperative that is essential for Australia's continuing economic success. Indeed, the IMF, the OECD and Access Economics have all commented on the need for further workplace relations reforms to increase labour market flexibility if Australia is to continue to prosper and grow. Our nation's universities and higher education institutes are certainly no exception to this rule; they have a part to play. That is why I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to the House in support of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. Unlike the Labor Party, the idea that academia can stand detached from a changing world, resistant to change and the need to be competitive, is not one I would promote or in any way could champion. Indeed, I support the view expressed by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations when he said that the higher education system is not immune from the global pressures faced by other industries. The reality is-and the minister is spot on-that our universities are operating in a dynamic environment. They face rea number of challenges: overseas competition for students and staff, the rise of private education providers and increasing commerof a robust, growcial activity. In relation to competition, the number of students opting for a private university education is increasing considerably. Publicly funded universities must adapt to this new reality or they will become irrelevant. An article entitled ‘Students flocking to private universities' in the 7 January edition of the Sydney Morning Herald noted that from 2003 to 2004 student enrolment in New South Wales universities dropped by more than five per cent. It was fairly wide but grew strongly at Australia's two principal private universities. Notre Dame, a private university in my own state of Western Australia, saw student numbers increase by almost 25 per cent during this period. The need for universities to compete nationally and internationally is well recognised. Workplace reform as outlined in this bill will help them achieve that. An article entitled ‘Great brain robbers' that appeared in the Perth Sunday Times on 9 January 2005 highlighted the drain of the state's top students to eastern state and foreign universities. The article noted that the state's top students, whose results in the year 12 exams were frankly outstanding, chose to head east or overseas to undertake their degree studies. The journalist writing the article posed the question: have Western Australian universities done enough to ensure that they represent an attractive alternative to a trip abroad or across the Nullarbor? My argument would be that, by embracing the reforms outlined in this bill, those universities-Edith Cowan, Murdoch, Curtin and UWA-will have the tools they need to attract top students. Through the reforms set out in this bill, the universities will be able to attract and retain the best staff available and, in doing so, they will make themselves more appealing to would be students in WA and to international students considering Australia as an option for their degrees and postgraduate studies. At the heart of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 is the recognition that, for our universities to be internationally competitive, workplace arrangements within these institutions must allow for greater choice for staff and for increased flexibility. The measures contained within this bill will provide for more freedom, flexibility and individual choice and will ultimately ensure the long-term sustainability of the higher static nation- education sector. There should be no doubt that, if our university system is to remain internationally competitive, the workplace environment that operates within these institutions must allow them to be in a position to attract, retain and appropriately reward the very best staff available to them. This will ensure that Australia's universities and higher education institutes continue to gain recognition as centres of excellence and as internationally acclaimed seats of learning and research into the future. Within Western Australia, universities are five certainly keen to pursue the overseas students' dollar and the benefits that accrue from that. An article entitled ‘United front to sell the west' that appeared in the Australian on 1 December 2004 highlighted the fact that overseas students pump over $1 billion a year into Western Australia's economy and support around 5,000 jobs. Make no mistake about it: competition to attract overseas students is hotting up and is becoming increasingly aggressive. The wellpublicised financial difficulties experienced by the independent company IDP that was set up by Australia's universities as a vehicle to attract overseas students were no accident or case of bad luck. As highlighted in an article entitled ‘Warnings existed over foreign competition' that appeared in the Australian on 9 February 2005, these difficulties reflected a failure by IDP and the universities to anticipate the speed with which the competition for international students would grow. The article went on to say that the salad days of international recruitment could not last and that the harbinger of tougher times was the ramped-up efforts of traditional higher education suppliers in the USA, Canada and Britain, as well as the development by these suppliers of strategic alliances with emerging key locations in China, the Middle East, Malaysia and Singapore. Given the very real boost to local economies that higher education establishments with their overseas student populations represent, it is essential that Australian universiment ties continue to be held in high regard within the international community. This bill will mean that universities will be able to attract and keep staff of a sufficient calibre to ensure such desirable outcomes. The Howard government provides around $8 billion a year in funding to the higher education sector. The government has committed more than $11 billion of additional support over the next 10 years through the Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future initiative as an expression of support for this sector of the Australian economy. This is a considerable investment of public money, and the government has a duty to ensure that this sum is well spent and well invested for the future and that, when it comes to higher education spending, Australia is getting real value for money. Despite any assertions to the contrary, the reforms outlined in the bill are not about driving down wages, eroding conditions of employment or taking away the rights of university employees. The member for Throsby mentioned issues of enforcement of agreements et cetera. The only issue is that ‘enforcement' is a key word for the unions and for their Labor colleagues with respect to closed shops, no ticket, no start policies, lack of flexibility, prescriptive working arrangements and absence of choice for workers in how they are employed. Such claims are, therefore, plainly absurd. This bill provides the framework for a system that focuses on greater freedom and flexibility. It gives employees the ability to choose the types of workplace agreements that suit them. Australian workplace agreements provide employers with greater flexibility than certified agreements-flexibility to provide bonuses and other incentives for good performance. It is that kind of flexibility and ability to offer an attractive employpackage that will help our universities to recruit and retain the high calibre of staff they need. Having high-calibre staff who drive excellence within the university and ultimately influence perceptions about the university amongst those wishing to do graduate and postgraduate courses is one of the keys to future proofing the higher education sector. Australia has been variously described as the lucky country and the knowledge country. Without workplace reform within the higher education system and other sectors of our economy, I am convinced that it will qualify to be neither of these things. It is my belief that universities are failing to recruit and retain the talented academic staff they require to continue to deliver a first-class learning environment and to undertake the research that often makes or breaks a university's reputation. In this respect, figures suggest that the salaries that are currently being offered to the highest calibre of staff are certainly less competitive than those being offered for similar positions overseas and, indeed, those being offered by the private sector. The two research reports into academic salaries-Salary relativities and the academic labour market and the Australian academic salaries time series project-which were released in May 2005, confirm that universities are increasingly struggling to fill positions both at the entry level of the salary range and, at the top end, at professor level. That is certainly very worrying and suggests that, unless the situation is tackled, the long term quality of Australian higher education may well suffer. Unless universities commit to becoming more competitive in the international labour market and to offering better career opportunities, the reputation of higher education in Australia is, in my view, very definitely under risk. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that our universities have a greater capacity to offer attractive employment packages to their staff and to provide workplace arrangements that best reflect the needs of their employees. The traditional tenet of academic tenure, where jobs are for life, is long gone. Universities need the best staff available to them. They face a stark choice between becoming either degree factories or world-class research and education institutions with a reputation amongst businesses and industry and within the community to match. In my own state of Western Australia, that realisation, highlighted in an article that appeared in the Australian on 22 June 2005, led to calls by the Vice-Chancellor of Edith Cowan University, Millicent Poole, for the creation of the nation's first mega-uni that would serve the needs of around 70,000 students. This legislation provides the framework for our universities to structure themselves in such a way that they can make certain of their academic relevance and attractiveness to the higher education market. Ultimately, higher education institutions that focus on churning out graduates and that have lost their focus on research and academic excellence are not, at least in spirit, if not letter of the law, universities. They are really colleges with little more than a factory approach to education. It was the English broadcaster and journalist John Tusa who famously said: Management that wants to change an institution must first show it loves that institution. I am not sure about love-perhaps I would hesitate to go that far-but the government certainly holds the public higher education sector in high regard, and that regard is well demonstrated by the coalition's willingness to continue to invest in the sector's future in return for beneficial changes in the workplace. It has been said that everyone's life opportunities are diminished by restrictions on the freedom to work. It has also been said in terms of industrial relations that to stand still is to go backwards. The coalition government's raft of workplace relations reform legislation, of which this bill forms a part, is about ensuring all sectors of our economy can move forward and remain vibrant. By doing so, those choosing a career path within that sector of the economy benefit from not only increased employment opportunities but also enhanced career paths. In essence, that as is the outcome that the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 seeks to deliver. The workplace relations changes proposed do not represent change for change's sake. Rather, the reforms being proposed by this bill will deliver some very desirable results. They will also have no impact on academic freedom and all the other associated activities so traditionally beloved of academia. Nor does this bill seek to make decisions for universities regarding the appointment of staff. Such an assertion is far from the truth and palpably wrong. Indeed, the measures in the will introduce much needed change to the workplace and will help ensure the future competitiveness of Australia's higher education sector. As such, this bill has my full support and I commend it to the House. NA",131

NA AMENDMENT (WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS) Second Reading Debate resumed.",135
179,Mr HAYES,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The dead hand of the government's industrial relations agenda has emerged once again in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. It is not unusual for us to be presented with bills that seek to establish systems through which taxpayers' money is distributed to various groups throughout the country and on which the government seeks to piggyback its uniquely Liberal industrial relations requirements. Now it is the turn of the higher education sector. But it is not enough for the Minister for Education, Science and Training just to attach certain industrial relations requirements for the universities sector, and it is not enough that, in order to receive Commonwealth funding, considerable changes to the higher education sector be made; the minister wants to go further and appoint himself as the judge, jury and executioner when it comes to administering university industrial relations. Of course, it is not the first time that this has been tried in the higher education sector. In 2003 the government made an attempt to pass legislation that would impose unreasonable industrial relations conditions on those working in Australian universities. After considerable debate-and negotiation, I brought might add, with the Senate at the time-the government was forced to remove the industrial relations proposals in order to get the rest of the package through. Unfortunately, we now have a different environment and certainly a different make-up in the Senate. We have a government drunk on its own power, with this minister willing to reintroduce the requirements that were not supported in 2003. The reintroduction of previously rejected BILL 2005 provisions is really becoming a disturbing trend with this government. It seems that the government never misses the chance to spread the tentacles of its industrial relations agenda into yet another group. When we have a bill appropriating funds or setting up schemes in which taxpayers' money will be spent, we always seem to have the obligatory industrial relations clause attached to it. I can only imagine what the cabinet meetings would be like when they discuss bills such as this. It seems to me that you would have the Prime Minister sitting there with his colleagues all contemplating the bills and what could be grafted onto them. What is conjured up in my mind is almost akin to that rather prominent fast food restaurant. The bills are coming in and you have the Prime Minister asking, ‘Do you want my IR with that?' These ministers have caught on pretty fast. They know that, unless they say yes, they will not be getting their bill approved and they will not be getting their money. In fairness to that very famous restaurant with golden arches, at least you can decline the fries; it does not seem that you can decline the IR when it is attached to appropriation bills. The attitude seems to be that, if you want to spend money, you had better work pretty hard to find ways to advance the Prime Minister's industrial relations agenda. Of course, in this bill the Minister for Education, Science and Training has trumped his ministerial colleagues. Introducing an industrial lations requirement under which organisations receiving funding would require offers of individual contracts to be made-that is not enough. Always striving to go that little bit further, maybe because of some real and genuine leadership qualities, the minister for education has ensured that the industrial relatainly tions requirement under this bill not just is consistent with but goes beyond the government approaches-at least in terms of the government's stated intentions for the Australian work force. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 specifies that every university employee must be offered an Australian workplace agreement by 31 August next year. That is every single employee. The minister in his second reading speech on this bill claimed that it was necessary to introduce these measures ‘if Australia was to remain internationally competitive in the provision of higher education'. He went on to say: The higher education sector is not immune from the pressure to adapt, reform and become even more productive. Universities need to be able to respond flexibly to the needs of their constituencies including potential and existing students, staff, employers, industry and local, regional and national communities. I find the suggestion that university staff are not flexible to be staggering, quite frankly. I am not quite sure of the minister's personal experience with university staff when he attended university, but from my experience I have always known them to go out of their way and certainly be flexible and do everything they can to assist students. I am very fortunate that very close to my electorate we have the Macarthur campus of the University of Western Sydney. I have known it to be a university of very dedicated people and staff that certainly has served the interests of sture- dents in the south-west of Sydney. Through their efforts, we have a first-class institution with faculties in the arts, business, law, teaching and nursing-and soon there will be a medical faculty. Being a local, we are very proud of our university. We are certainly very proud of their achievements and cerof the commitment displayed by all the staff of the university. In defending the provisions of this bill, once again we have a government relying on the argument that it is providing choice. The minister would have us believe that the implementation of this Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill is all about choice. He claims that university employees will have the choice of workplace agreements, will have the choice of being covered by a certified agreement and will have the choice of appointing the union to represent them in individual contract negotiations and that there will be no requirement on individual staff members to accept offers of individual contracts. It is the last choice that is often referred to by people I speak to as simply being no choice at all, because it is a choice of having a job or not having a job. You do not have to go much beyond the Boeing workers to find that out-or indeed the staff of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations-who similarly have that so-called choice. In reality it is simply not there. It seems that ‘choice' is often used by this government, but I have to say that it is a concept that is not readily adhered to. The most disturbing choice of all contained in the bill is the level of choice that this bill will afford the minister. Under this legislation, the minister will have the choice to determine whether or not a university has complied. This choice will determine funding, so it is a pretty important one. Control is the essence of the bill, and the minister has not missed his mark on that. The essence of the bill is to make sure that the minister can micromanage universities and their staff relationships. The minister has made no secret of his bid for power in this regard. It was reported in the Australian Financial Review on 12 September that the minister had written to the vice-chancellors with a warning about the future-yet another example of the sheer arrogance of the government in this regard. The minister has already written to the management of the universities, telling them how things are going to operate, when this bill is currently before the House and being debated. The bill has not yet even passed the House, and the minister is already busy lecturing those who will be implementing the changes on the finer points of how he is going to mark their report cards. The Financial Review reports that the minister has: ... told the university leaders that he will take a strict interpretation of the conditions imposed on more than $280 million in funding and that, ultimately, the decision rests with him as to whether a university has complied with the new rules. The choice implemented for the minister in the bill is akin to the thumbs up and thumbs down approach we might expect from Roman emperors dealing with decisions of life and death about gladiators. The article went on to say: Dr Nelson wrote that, for universities to qualify for the funding, he would need to be satisfied they had embarked on “fundamental changes to the workplace policies and practices”. But the minister does not stop there. Just so the vice-chancellors are absolutely sure what they are required to do to get the thumbs up from this minister, he makes it clear. He says: Approaches which are focused on minimising, diluting or circumventing genuine reform are unlikely to result in ... compliant workplace arrangements ... So everybody involved has a choice, so long as the choice they make pleases the government. Interestingly enough, according to the report in the Financial Review, the union is willing to work towards compliant agreements. But the same report indicates that universities are already using the tone of the minister's direction as the means for cutting staff entitlements. I wonder if this sort of behaviour is yet another sign of the future for all Australian workers. Not only is this the sort of behaviour that the staff of our most prestigious academic institutions are fearful of but it is the sort of behaviour that the vast majority of Australian workers are certainly scared of. The ACTU, for instance, recently reported that 62 per cent of workers believe that they will be worse off under individual contracts and 62 per cent of all respondents believe that individual contracts would do nothing more than give power to their employers. It is not about a balance; it is a fer of power. It seems that, on this demonstration, people's concerns would be justified. Despite the minister making strong arguments that the changes implemented upon the passage of the bill will promote flexibility and improvements in productivity and performance, it is more likely to tear them apart. It will certainly tear apart cooperative approaches to teaching and research that have developed over many years. Staff members who have shared information for the benefit of their students, who have collaborated on research in the past, will be thinking twice about it in the future. They will think twice about it now because colleagues with whom they have shared the information and collaborated on research are now-or will be-their competitors. The institution that they are employed by will be competing on the world stage when it comes to attracting research funding and international students, but within their own institutions there will be an absolute, but real, competition taking place between staff. Staff members within faculties will conceivably be competing for better rankings from their students, larger amounts of research funding, better attendance levels, higher average marks from their classes and any other matter to maximise their personal bonuses. I am sure that in response to this the minister would argue that this is a better outcome as it will be more productive on campus. In my opinion, staff are unlikely to become more productive. They are more likely to become more closeted in their work and divided within their faculties. It is not too far a stretch to imagine that, if incentives were written into staff agreements that are poorly structured, we could have a situation where it is very much a race to the bottom in terms of transacademic standards and the quality of university education within Australian institutions. While the individual contracts may meet the requirements of the minister to gain the next round of funding, this will not advance the tertiary education sector one bit, and it will not make our institutions more attractive to international students. Students, including international students, make their choice of institution based on the education that they will receive, not on how successful the institution is in implementing industrial relations reforms. Of course, lately, for many students their choice of institution has been considered through the prism of affordability rather than quality, because of this government's dereliction of duty when it comes to higher education. Labor opposes this bill, and it is opposed to this government's habit of attaching its industrial relations agenda to bills through which taxpayers' money is spent. The approach of attaching requirements that ordinarily would not bear any relationship to the government's industrial relations agenda is, quite frankly, a disgrace. The government is clearly worried that the community backlash against its industrial relations agenda is growing. The only way it can progress its agenda is by stealth. The government intends to weave its agenda into various bills so that, at the very least, those sectors of our economy that the government believes will object to the reforms will be the first to be hit with these adjustments. This bill sets a new benchmark on just how underhanded the government is willing to be in order to institute its industrial relations agenda. The bill is nothing short of micromanagement. I would have thought that members opposite who believe in individualism, the core principle of the Liberal Party, would have objected to a minister seeking to manage the employment relations of nearly 40 campuses throughout the country. This bill does nothing more than compromise the independence of Australian university campuses. It makes it even tougher for them to attract and retain the highest quality staff they require, should they wish to please their now all-powerful minister and implement inferior working conditions. Higher education in Australia, and university education in particular, continues to suffer at the hands of the Howard government. This bill is yet another example. Funding cuts since the election of this government in 1996 are estimated at $5 billion. The Higher Education Contributions Scheme has increased and, sadly, $100,000 degrees are increasingly becoming the reality. The minister believes that a university education is a privilege, and he must now be thinking the same thing about university employment. This attack on our university sector flies in the face of our universities' bids to expand their services into the growing education markets of South-East Asia. Our primary, secondary and tertiary education sectors need proper levels of support not only to bring opportunities to Australian students but also to remain internationally competitive. Geographically, Australia is ideally located to take advantage of our South-East Asian neighbours' desire to advance the productivity of their countries by improving the education of their populations. In order to maximise this advantage we need highquality teaching staff in our universities. While the minister may have conscientiously set about meeting the demands of his senior colleagues by introducing a bill which will more than match the government's industrial relations agenda, this bill, quite frankly, is just poor policy. This will not produce a mate of cooperation in our universities, it will not result in more productive academic staff and it certainly will not introduce a system of choice. This bill will grant the minister unchecked powers to change the working conditions of university staff at the stroke of a pen not just for the first or the second round of funding but at any time in the future.

180,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I was somewhat perplexed by the honourable member for Werriwa's speech, just concluded, when he spoke about the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 in some way taking away what he referred to as the ‘independence' of the universities. Everyone knows that the university sector in this country is not ‘independent'; it is heavily dependent on government funding. What seems to have escaped the member for Werriwa-who is about to escape from the chamber-is that the Australian government has a responsibility to make sure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely. Therefore, what the government has decided to do is to utilise legislation to encourage a higher level of productivity and a higher level of accountability from the tertiary education sector. There is an ever-growing sense in industry that Australian businesses must become even more efficient to compete successfully in an increasingly global market. Free trade agreements are becoming more and more common around the globe, and we are seeing ever-decreasing traditional barriers to free trade. Australia currently has agreements with a number of countries, and there are agreements throughout the world-in North America, Europe and Asia. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's publication Trade 2005 reiterates that Australia now has an agreement with the United States of cli- America and Thailand and is in the process of securing similar agreements with Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. Discussions have even been held on a possible agreement with China. In this climate of increasingly globalised trade, it is vital that all levels of society sure that they remain highly competitive. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 aims to ensure that our tertiary education facilities also maintain a competitive edge. I was surprised to hear that the Labor Party will oppose this legislation, which seeks to achieve positive outcomes and to give our tertiary education institutions world-class reputations. The bill aims to ensure that our universities become more productive, efficient, flexible and competitive. This will become possible through the introduction of new higher education workplace relations requirements. The Australian government funds this sector to the tune of more than $5 billion, and it is duty bound to ensure that this substantial amount of money is used with maximum positive effect. It seems that some in the university sector simply want to get the money with no strings attached. Every level of our society today is accountable, and I do not believe that the government should apologise for insisting that the universities do not simply look upon the government as a cash cow, prepared to fund any sort of employment behaviour on the part of the universities. The university sector has to appreciate that it is accountable and that it is the recipient of substantial amounts of taxpayer funds. This government will ensure that the university sector is accountable for those funds in the same way as other levels of society are required to be. The government will ensure that this money is used with the maximum possible effect. To ensure that they qualify for increased funding under the Commonwealth grants scheme-five per cent in 2006 and 7.5 per cent in later years as set out in section 33.15(1)(b) of the Higher Education Support Act 2003-higher education providers must enhave workplace relations arrangements in place that meet the higher education workplace relations requirements. The time frames for the 2006 funding increases include the following. Higher education institutions that have a staff agreement that expires before 30 September 2005 must have in place by that date a certified agreement and workplace policies that meet the requirements of the higher education workplace relations requirements. Those institutions that have an agreement with an expiry date on or after 1 October this year must have an agreement in place that meets the requirements of the higher education workplace relations requirements, except where compliance with these would directly conflict with the requirements under their agreement as at 29 April this year. These requirements will continue over subsequent years. Institutions must have certified agreements that meet the requirements in place by 31 August of the year prior to when the Commonwealth grants scheme increase comes into effect. Funding for private education institutions which have introduced individual agreements will be accessed on the content of their workplace policies and practices, with particular focus on those elements of the agreements that are common for all staff. These providers will be required to meet the requirements by 31 August each year to qualify for Commonwealth grants scheme increases each year. I want to draw the attention of the House to elements of a media release jointly issued by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on 29 April this year. The release says: The HEWRRs cover choice in agreement making, direct relationships with employees, workplace flexibility, workplace productivity and performsaid, ance, and freedom of association. It also says that the new HEWRRs will ‘assist universities in becoming more competitive nationally and internationally and enable them to attract, retain and reward the best people'. Dr Nelson said that it was time that universities provided their staff the same opportunities as those available to other workers, by offering them the choice of an Australian workplace agreement. The provision of tertiary education has become a boom industry for Australia. It is not hard to see why. We provide a high standard of education, an environment that is tolerant of other cultures-a reflection of Australia's multicultural heritage-and a safe location for overseas students to come and improve their educational qualifications. We have to bear this in mind in the light of the changing international situation and terrorist attacks around the world. Students from right around the globe can come to Australia with confidence that both their education needs as well as their quality of life during their study be satisfactory. With education becoming a targeted export for so many nations, it is important that the Australian product remains attractive on the international market. It is vital that the higher education sector does not wrongly convince itself that it is immune to those pressures that affect other industries. The car manufacturing industry is a case in point. With free trade agreements to become more prevalent around the world, all Australian industries must be prepared to maintain efficiencies and competitiveness. In the second reading speech, some of the details of this legislation were clearly pointed out. The minister is of the view-and I fully agree with him-that the new requirements will provide universities with choice. The requirements, as the minister do not prescribe particular outcomes. He said: Choice is about providing scope for individuals to negotiate pay and conditions that suit their particular needs and circumstances rather than being locked into the one-size-fits-all approach that has prevailed in the sector to date. This legislation is seeking to change the culture of employment in tertiary education institutions. We have all heard the story of the university professor who was queried on how many subjects he taught. His response was that he taught one subject, but not every year. I know that that extreme example no longer applies in Australia, but it does highlight how, in the view of changing world circumstances and increasing competition between Australian universities and educational institutions in other parts of the word, it is important that we not only provide a world-class education but also have worldclass employment opportunities. This bill is all about increasing workplace flexibility and choice. It will assist institutions to respond to will changing requirements and challenges. That will develop a diverse work force, and that is obviously a very positive step forward. It is no surprise that the tertiary education unions are not necessarily in favour of this legislation. As far as I am concerned, their attitude is completely irrelevant. What is important is that this government is determined to deliver a world-class outcome, world-class efficiency and freedom of choice. If some of the unions want to continue to live in the 1890s and have these outdated and old fashioned ideas which seek to force people to be, in many cases, compulsory members of their association, that is their problem. It is not acceptable in the Australia of 2005. In conclusion, the government is of the belief that the requirements set out in the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 will help boost the international attractiveness of our education institutions. I am of the belief that this legislation is a very positive tive. I am pleased to be able to commend it to the House of Representatives.",139
181,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to oppose the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005, because I do not think that at the heart of the bill the government's intentions about improving educational services exist. Indeed, it seems to me that the reason this bill has been proposed by the government and brought into this place to be debated-and, it hopes, enacted-is to impose the government's will, its view, on what parties to an industrial agreement may want to do at the workplace level. It is ironic that a government that says we have to remove third parties from workplace matters wants to legislate to impose a clause in enterprise agreements, even if it is not agreed to by the parties. What we have here is a government that, if it does not like what is happening, will intrude on parties who are genuinely negotiating outcomes at the workplace level. If you look across the industries in this country, you will find that, where there is low union density and an absence of collective negotiations, the government will want to further deregulate those industries in the way in which they operate. They believe the employer already has the whip handle and they are not so concerned about the way in which matters proceed, because they believe the employers will get their way on almost everything. But where you see a presence of collective arrangements, where you see an industry that historically has collectively bargained at the workplace level, and where employees and their representatives have some bargaining power, you will see, on every occasion, a government that wants to impose its will upon the employer and the employees or those people representing the institutions, as is the case here with the initiahigher education providers. By introducing this bill, this government belies its own commitments and its own views as to the way in which industrial relations should occur in this country. If it does not get its own way, if it does not think that the employer will be able to reach an agreement that reflects its policies, it will legislate to insert a clause into an industrial instrument, whether or not the parties negotiating that instrument agree. In this instance, the clause that the government wishes to impose on employers and employees in this industry is: Thebeing the higher education provider... may enter into AWAs with its employees. Those AWAs may either operate to the exclusion of this certified agreement or prevail over the terms of this certified agreement to the extent of any inconsistency, as specified in each AWA. Pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996, employers, employees and their organisations, or just employers and employees, are able to determine which instrument they would like to govern their conditions of employment at the workplace level. Howard's own bill, when enacted in 1996, provided choice. That is a mantra we hear often from the government-that they want to provide people with choice. There is choice. In the federal jurisdiction there is the capacity to negotiate a certified agreement between employers and employees, which is a section 170LK agreement, or to negotiate what is commonly called a union agreement-that is, an agreement between employer, employees and their unions; a section 170LJ agreement-and there is also the capacity for AWAs. The Labor Party do not support the way in which the government encourages the proliferation of AWAs. I have to say with respect to AWAs that we believe the failure by this government over nine years to show a critical mass of employees picking up AWAs is evidence of a lack of interest in and a lack support for that instrument. I believe that reason the percentage of the work force of Australia picking up AWAs has been so low - about three or four per cent-is that, in the end, whether or not employees are in unions or wish to be in unions, most employees do not wish to be in individual contracts. There are some-and I accept that there are some-who would feel that they have a reasonable bargaining power and could manage to negotiate arrangements which would be reasonable, but the majority of employees would feel more comfortable in awards or certified agreements. That has been illustrated by the fact that, despite all the efforts by the government to introduce bills such as this, effectively ing employers to impose AWAs, forcing Commonwealth employees generally to take up AWAs or encouraging managers to place themselves in AWAs so as to bump up the statistics, very few employees genuinely go to their employer and say, ‘I want to be in an AWA.' That is the reality. It is a very unpopular piece of public policy-one that has been there for nine years-and, as a result, it has not managed yet to reach four per cent of the entire work force, despite all the efforts by the government over four terms. As a result, the government say, ‘We think we've got a few ideas here. We can impose certain things upon parties. In this case, we can threaten universities and postsecondary institutions with regard to their funding if they do not include a certified clause that will force them to offer AWAs.' That imposition by the Commonwealth to force parties to insert a clause that they do not wish to have in their agreements is contrary to the Workplace Relations Act 1996. It shows that, where there is a density of union membership in any given industry, or an interest to collectively bargain, a culture of bargaining collectively, the government of wants to reregulate or over-regulate to imthe pose its will on the parties. That is what is happening here, and the worse of it is this: because there is no cogent argument that the government can put forward as to why employees should be subject to this behaviour, it is threatening education money. It is an extraordinary thing. Before standing up to talk on a bill that has ‘higher education legislation' in the title, I had hoped that, after discussion and a debate, I might well have been able to accept some of the government's views and reject others on matters to do with education. But this government is so ideologically blinded in its hatred of unions and its hatred of collective bargaining that it chooses to impose forcindustrial relations dimensions on matters that should really be focusing upon education. This education bill pays lip-service to improving services for students in this country. It is about trying to break down the capacity for employees to negotiate; and, in doing so, the government contradicts its own legislation of nine years. We heard today that an OECD report has effectively given the Howard government an F on education. If you want to use A, B, C, D, E and F, I am sure many would describe what is going on in our education institutions as a result of Commonwealth policiesMr Hockey-Your state mates run most of them.",142
182,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I am talking about postsecondary education, Minister. The OECD effectively gives the government an F because of the funding that has been cut from education over the last nine years. Since 1995 the proportion of Commonwealth expenditure on education in universities and TAFEs has fallen by eight per cent. That is in stark contrast to the OECD average of a 38 per cent increase. Instead of working out ways to smash collectivismthe right of ordinary Australian citizens to bargain collectively at their workplace-and to prevent employees from having a genuine capacity to bargain, with some powers, with their employer, and instead of imposing upon employers clauses that they have not agreed to, the government should consider how much money it is ripping out of the education system, to the detriment of our education institutions. We know we have a major skills shortage in this country. We know that workplaces have major problems in obtaining skilled employees. It is a complex issue and it certainly will take some time to solve-I am not suggesting it will be solved easily. There causal link between the extent to which a government is willing to support education institutions and the extent to which we have the skills required to become a productive economy. Productivity has been falling in relative terms. In the 1980s we were going through fundamental changes and New Zealand was going through fundamental changes of its own. The way in which New Zealand chose to go was to effectively break down an industrial relations system that was similar to ours and to impose individual contracts on the majority of its workers. In comparison, the Hawke-Keating governments entered into arrangements with employers and unions and, quite rightly, devolved the central wage fixing system into a system that was moving sensibly to allow parties to negotiate at the workplace level, but to do so collectively. I know it is not a complete comparison to take two countries and just compare the productivity that occurred in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, the federal government in Australia at that time was supporting the devolution of the central wage fixing system, allowing for and increasingly encouraging more decisions to be made by employers and employees at the workplace level, but doing so collectively; and that led to far greater productivity per annum, per capita, than did the experiment in New Zealand. The experiment in New Zealand not only failed to keep up with the productivity growth in Australia but also left some extraordinary social scars. There was no effort to protect vulnerable workers from being exploited. My fear is that this government either has no interest in the adverse effects of its industrial relations policies or does not care what might happen to people if they are placed in is a a position where they have no capacity to bargain. Whilst academic staff and other staff in institutions would be relatively more likely to have the wherewithal and the wit to negotiate matters than some other workers who may not have the same protections and indeed the same resources, this exercise by the government is just one further step along a path containing many more steps to reduce the capacity of employees to be protected. I think the eighties and nineties showed that there was great merit in devolving the system while, at the same time, providing safety nets and protections. If you were to compare us with New Zealand in that period, as I said, you would see clearly that there was less harm done to people as a result of quite fundamental structural change when compared with the drastic scorched earth policies that were embarked upon in New Zealand. If this is not just the government's enmity towards unions and if this is really about trying to improve productivity, I ask it to look at the bill dispassionately and ask itself whether this is more about whacking education unions over the head or about looking to improve productivity in our education institutions. I have not seen any evidence to date that there is a need to impose clauses upon the higher education providers in this country in the way in which this bill does. I am left one conclusion: the government, in the end, is seeking to diminish the capacity for this sector to negotiate, in a collaborative way, changes in the workplace that are required for a vibrant industry-as we need our education industry to be. There is no evidence that that is the focus and the interest of the government. I understand that there are always assertions made against the Labor Party because of its direct link and association with unions-it is upfront; it is transparent; no-one is denying those associations and nor would I ever deny those links or ever regret them. In this case, many of these employee organisations are not affiliated to the ALP. First and foremost, their interests will always be in representing their members, above and beyond caring about the Liberal Party or the Labor Party. It is becoming apparent that the government are blinded by their obsession with IR. As we know, when the Prime Minister outlined in May some of the ideas he has about fundamentally changing the landscape by changing the system that we have had for 100 years to an extreme antiworker system, we did not see any balance between ensuring productivity and protecting the work force, their entitlements and their rights. We saw wholesale removal of matters that have been agreed between the parties, in some cases for many a year. It is becoming increasingly apparent to all Australians that this government have become rather extreme in the way in which they apply their IR policies. Not only are they becoming extreme they are also clearly out of touch with concerns of workers at the workplace level. I know that the Minister for Human Services, who is at the table, would not meet too many workers unless they are serving him a drink or waiting on him in a with cafe or restaurant. The only other time the minister might see a few workers is when he dons some safety glasses and walks around for a photo shoot at a factory; that would be about it. The reality is that most workers now in this country are very concerned about the government's intentions. I have thought that Howard and this team have been relatively pragmatic, but on this occasion they cannot be, because they are blinded by an ideology that is extreme and has no regard for working people in this country. In the end, because of the fact that they have a majority in the Senate, they are not in a position to deny their more extreme friends. The HR Nicholls Society used to be laughed at in all quarters in the early nineties for their extreme policies. So far they are winning, because those extreme policies of HR Nicholls and other organisations have now become government policy. I am pretty sure of this: those extremes will actually be the end of this government. (Time expired)",143
183,Mr JOHNSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 and support it very warmly and strongly. After listening to the member for Gorton speak, I am more certain in my own mind-and I know my colleagues would support me in this-that the federal Labor opposition are unfit and continue to be unfit for office. Question time today again reflected their inability to come up with ideas and real questions that would challenge this government's stewardship of the nation. Clearly, the presentations that have been given previously by members on the other side quite strongly reflect that the opposition have never been more unfit for office than they are today. I want to very quickly touch on a point made by the member for Gorton. He talked about this government being out of touch with the Australian community. I might just remind him that fewer than one in five people are members of unions; in fact, 17 per cent of the Australian population are members of unions. So I do not know quite what he is going on about with this government not being aware of the trends in this country. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to encourage our higher education providers to adopt more flexible and responsive workplace relations practices so that they can maintain their competitiveness and reputation in the international education market. This will be achieved by including, within the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, guidelines that place a strict requirement for higher education providers to meet national governance protocols and the higher education workplace relations requirements. The incentives of an increase in the higher education provider's basic assistance funding grant under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme will be allocated if the providers comply with these important requirements. So the universities can see that there is in fact something very significant for them. They are going to receive a very important financial benefit for their institutions should they comply with the requirements. These requirements will provide higher education providers and their staff with clear choice and the scope to negotiate pay and conditions to suit individual needs and circumstances. Naturally, the requirements will need to be evidenced in the workplace agreement polices and practices of the particular higher education provider. In 2006, this is going to mean an increase of five per cent; for later years it will mean an increase of some 7.5 per cent. It goes without saying that the Minister for Education, Science and Training will need to be satisfied that the provider has met these requirements as of the date specified in the guidelines. I note that in the press there has been recent commentary that there has been some argy-bargy between some of the stakeholders about whether the guidelines would in fact be met and whether the government would be short-changed and the university shortchanged. That will not happen, I hope. I have full confidence in the minister for education and very warmly commend him for his stewardship of the portfolio. He is doing a tremendous job. Education in this country owes this government, and in particular the education minister, a big round of applause for management and leadership in this field. The purpose of the Howard government's general workplace reform program is to bring efficiency, flexibility and responsiveness to workplace practices across all industries in this country. What is wrong with that proposition? It is very elementary, very simple-standardisation, efficiency, flexibility and responsiveness. For the life of me, I do not know why federal Labor opposes such important initiatives and policies. One would think that something as vital as reforming and streamlining the workplace of the higher education sector should have bipartisan support, but I can inform the people of my electorate of Ryan that regrettably the federal Labor Party just cannot bring itself to support something which the rest of the country says is quite straightforward and in line with the greater trend for workplaces in this country. From the shop office to the office floor, things are happening in our workplace relations that are increasing productivity. It is high time that the federal Labor Party came on board and supported these kinds of initiatives. I want to refer to an article by Michael Chaney in the Australian on 24 May this year. Michael Chaney is a very distinguished, prominent and successful Australian business executive. He made some very pertinent remarks. They were very instructive indeed-instructive for workplaces in this country generally and for all Australians and also something which I think would enlighten the Labor Party should they care to read them. If they did, I think they would be far wiser in terms of representing to the people policies that are very relevant to this country. It is somewhat embarrassing, because it is quite clear that Michael Chaney is hitting the nail on the head and making some very relevant comments that the opposition should take note of. I want to quote Michael Chaney: Reforms started by the Hawke-Keating Labor government have moved Australian workplaces away from the highly regulated, centralised tures to focus on enterprise bargaining, and have allowed business and employees to better align their interests. These changes have enabled business to reward employees for performance and have strengthened accountability on all sides. This has positively changed workplace culturesthat is, broken down the them-and-us approachin ways not anticipated. This them-and-us mindset seems to still permeate the federal Labor Party. I wish they would get away from that adversarial kind of mindset. Let me continue to quote Michael Chaney, because what he says is very relevant and very instructive: We live in an intensely competitive and increasingly open global economy. The rest of the world is not standing still and, unless we innovate and find new ways to continually increase our productivity and workforce participation, we will go backwards as a nation. We will go backwards as a nation. I am pleased to see that there is a shadow minister at the table-the member for Watson. I think he likes to consider himself a thinking person. I encourage him to read this article. Indeed, I will be very happy to fax a copy to his office. He would learn a lot by reading from the article written by Michael Chaney in the Australian on 24 May 2005. Perhaps deep in his own heart he believes that the words of Michael Chaney have great merit. I am sure he does. In terms of universities, the words of Michael Chaney have absolute relevance. They have an absolute link to the productivity of workplaces in all our institutions of higher learning. It is very important that the government presses forward with its general reform initiatives. The policy paper Our Universities: Backing Australia's Future, released by the government after the higher education review of 2002, establishes important foundations for the tertiary sector to ensure viability and value for Australia's future. strucFor the next decade, the government will be investing some $11 billion in our university sector to help secure it for the future. That is a lot of money in anyone's book. It is a very important amount of money that is being spent on such universities as the University of Queensland right in the heart of my own Ryan electorate. Underlying these reforms are four very important principles: sustainability, quality, equity and diversity. Without a strong foundation of a sustainable education sector, the future of our higher education sector will easily be challenged and jeopardised. A quality system will help produce the best graduates, most able to contribute to our community and our nation. We also need an equitable system with an opportunity for higher education that can be grasped by the best and the brightest Australians no matter what their background, their financial position or their family's station in life. We need diversity as well so that our universities can be responsive to the changing global conditions. One thing that everybody in this country-and certainly every member of this parliament-should be fully aware of is that we live in a very changing world and we must adjust to the changes. Otherwise, quite clearly, we are going to be left behind our competitors. As Michael Chaney says, we must innovate, we must modernise and we must be aware of what is happening in the global economy. It is very important that we move forward and introduce reforms, policies and ideas. Otherwise we will be left behind, with the likes of Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan moving forward very strongly. All those nations are fully aware that the biggest challenge to leadership is not only to be aware of the changing world but also to be prepared to take action that better positions their industries and their economies. This is exactly what the Howard government is doing. This is exactly what the minister is doing with this bill. That is why this government has had the full confidence of the Australian people over successive elections. It has only been a year since the people of Australia re-elected the Howard government. I remind those opposite that the shareholders of this country, the people of Australia, very strongly for the Howard government only 12 months ago. So we do not want to hear any of this lecturing from the opposition about what this government is doing and how out of touch we are. Only 12 months ago there was a poll that returned this government very strongly to office, so let us get away from this mindset of telling the government how to be in touch with the people. We know very well how important that is on this side of the chamber. It is in this context that the fundamental aim of the government's reforms is to allow our universities to better capitalise on their strengths and ensure value in outcomes for students. The best way to achieve this is to allow the partial deregulation of the higher education system. This was certainly taken up wholeheartedly by universities when they were given the opportunity of flexible pricing for student contributions. I know that the University of Queensland, in the Ryan electorate, certainly took full advantage of the new fee structure to better position the university. Part of deregulation is also allowing for price flexibility when it comes to the very important topic of remuneration. Highperforming academics, researchers and other staff should be rewarded for their efforts. Conversely, lower performing academics, researchers and those in academic institutions that are quite clearly disinterested and disengaged from the aspirations of their students should be treated according to that behaviour. It is quite as straightforward as that, I would submit. What underpins this bill is a belief and a philosophy shared very strongly by the government and the members of the coalition that our society should operate on the basis of rewarding people for their hard work and rewarding people who take initiative, who voted have energy and who demonstrate commitment and professionalism. That is what is meant by and embraced by incentive and reward. Conversely, the opposition seems to stand for some kind of economic socialism where everybody is the same and every university just in the country is treated the same. That is absolute nonsense and no-one on this side of the chamber would say that every academic in this country is of the same quality. There are some who are better than others. We want to reward those who are better than others through individual agreements with their employers. That is what it is all about. Until the opposition can get hold of that idea, until it can get that idea into its mindset, it is going to be forever banished on the other side of this chamber. The Minister for Workforce Participation, who is at the table now, would be interested to know-and I will repeat this for the shadow minister's benefit, because he may not have heard me last time-that fewer than one in five Australians is a member of a union. Seventeen per cent of the Australian work force are members of unions in this country. What does that say about the Labor opposition's capacity to keep in touch with what is happening in the workplaces the length and breadth of this country? The Labor Party seem to me at least, and certainly to the people in my electorate of Ryan, to be subscribing to some sort of lowest common denominator when they approach this bill. That is not consistent with the values and the aspirations of the Australian people. Having a blanket policy towards a topic such as remuneration, I would submit, breeds complacency, poor performance and inequity. We are punishing those who work hard. We are punishing those in universities and institutions of higher learning who are dedicated, who are enthusiastic and who put in more-who do not just look at the clock and knock off as soon as they can. We need to reward those who are doing that extra little bit for the students, whom they should be teaching with all the skill that they have. These reforms are simply about offering the higher education sector choice. They are about informing and advising people in the university sector that they have options; they do not have to blindly go down the route that the Labor Party seems to call them to go down. I encourage all of them to be informed, not to just blindly listen to what the shadow minister and the opposition would throw down their necks. This choice is about individual scope to negotiate pay and conditions to suit their personal needs. This choice will also give universities and other higher education providers the scope to reward individuals and to develop and enhance individuals and give them more opportunities for promotion to serve their students and their respective organisations. The idea of choice in negotiating pay and conditions is not new. Australian workplace agreements have been around for many years, successfully providing employees and employers with greater flexibility to arrange conditions that include incentives and bonuses. I am pleased to speak on this bill and I am very pleased to support it. I want to comment very briefly about the University of Queensland, which as I mentioned is in my electorate of Ryan. It has come to my attention. I am very pleased to speak in the chamber and commend the University of Queensland Business School for its recent ranking in the top tier of business schools at universities in this country. I want to pay tribute to the professors and academics in that business school, who I think deserve the full credit and applause of all their students and of the Australian population at large. I am sure that those academics are putting in that extra mile-they are doing that extra piece of research or putting in that extra commitment to their students, and that is why the University of Queensland Business School has been ranked alongside the Melbourne Business School, the Australian Graduate School of Management and Monash University as industry leaders in the university sector. That is very pleasing to me as a graduate of the University of Queensland. I am very proud to be someone who has completed two degrees, an arts degree and a law degree, at the University of Queensland-as both my brother and my sister completed a medicine and a science degree. I am sure that all the students who graduated from the University of Queensland are very proud of their efforts. At the same time we should acknowledge that university training, university education and a university degree are not the be all and end all in this country in terms of future employment prospects and career opportunities. I want to conclude by commenting again on the opposition's failure to support this bill. It shows just how much the opposition is stuck with a mid-20th century mind-set and how out of touch it is with modern Australia. As I have said-I am happy to say it again and again; in fact, when I return to my electorate after this fortnight's sitting, I might even write to remind people in my electorate of this-17 per cent of the Australian work force are members of unions. Fewer than one in five Australians take it upon themselves to join unions. No doubt many union members would like to depart from their unions. In fact, they would probably like to cancel their membership. However, no doubt some Big Brother is watching over them saying, ‘You cannot cancel your union membership or you might lose your job.' However, they can rest assured that every member of the Howard government, every member on this side of the chamber, is very much concerned about their interests and their future. That is why this government is bringing to the parliament these initiatives and policies and this legislabridge tive framework-to ask for the parliament's support so that we can change the legislation that currently exists and introduce new legislation that will improve workplace relations and improve this country's productivity. While the rest of the country marches forward, determined to improve and reform itself, federal Labor is mired in old practices and old behaviour. As the Prime Minister is apt to remind members of his government, it is quite remarkable that the opposition is suffering from reform fatigue; it is absolutely amazing. You would think an opposition party would be very focused on coming up with new ideas and policies to connect with the people of the country who have given them the flick, yet this one seems to be mired in reform fatigue and reform paralysis. I am wholly committed to this bill and its purpose. One clear and obvious reason for my commitment is that there is an institution of higher learning in my electorate; the University of Queensland is in the federal electorate of Ryan. The University of Queensland is Queensland's premier institution of higher learning. It clearly occupies an important place in the life and activities of my Ryan electorate. But, more than that, its reputation for academic success has a major impact on the capacity and extent of the economy and on the social growth of Queensland. It is quite clear that the Labor Party now is simply not fit for government, because it shows no signs of appreciating the potential for universities to improve their productivity and the potential of their staff-their lecturers and researchers-to compete with world's best practice. In this country, it is not good enough for us to be of only world-class standing. We must be at the head of those who are world-class. We must compete with the very best. Our universities must compete with the likes of Harvard, Oxford and Camuniversities. Greater productivity in our universities, with staff on good packages that are reflective of their commitment to their students, will bring about those outcomes. I commend the bill very warmly to the parliament and I call on the opposition to join with the government, in an act of good spirit and in the interests of the future generations of this country, in supporting this bill.

184,Mr ANDREN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The contribution by the previous speaker, the member for Ryan, was basically, as I read it, ‘Get out of the way and let us govern'. We have seen what that means in recent days with the outrageous truncation of the Telstra debate; he calls that democracy. From what he has said, I presume that he believes in one-party government. I think the electorate's taste of that over the last few days sour over the next couple of years, at least relation to its Senate vote-and its rural vote too, I would suggest. I want to make a brief contribution to this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. It offers additional funding to our universities and other higher education institutions under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme that is conditional on the adoption of the government's higher education workplace requirements. Universities that comply with these requirements will receive increases in their basic grant of CGS funding of 2.5 per cent in 2005, five per cent in 2006 and 7½ per cent for 2007 and onwards. These requirements are, as stated by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in line with the government's broader workplace reform agenda. This agenda is far from clear, with the bills for the government's final push on workplace relations yet to be introduced into this place. I understand that the government has imposed a 30 November 2005 compliance deadline for our universities. However, debate on the requirements might have been better served if the detail of the government's broader workplace agenda was public knowledge. The mainstay of the higher education workplace requirements is the offering of Australian workplace agreements to university employees. I am not encouraged by speculation that the no disadvantage test for Australian workplace agreements is to be removed under the impending workplace changes. In his second reading speech on this bill, Minister Nelson stated: As with collective agreements, AWAs are subject to a no disadvantage test. Yet, as the minister knows, this may not be the case-and it is likely that it will not be the case in the future. If the minister's statement was meant to provide some sort of will guarantee of basic levels of pay and condiin tions to encourage the take-up of AWAs on our campuses then I would appreciate, in his summing up on this second reading debate or in the detail stage, some clarification from him on the matter of the no disadvantage test. Certainly, there is nothing in this bill or the Higher Education Support Act that maintains the no disadvantage test for AWAs in higher education institutions. The government insists that it is not forcing the issue of AWAs and that take-up is voluntary, yet in this higher education bill the government is putting pressure on universities by tying additional funding to the offering of AWAs. That is putting pressure on the employerand that pressure will undoubtedly pass on to bear down on the employee. The vice-chancellor of my own university, CSU, is totally satisfied with current arrangements and his ability to offer commonlaw contracts. Why, indeed, is there a need for the Employment Advocate? Current arrangements work fine. A properly negotiated AWA or common-law contract may be fine for highly educated academic employees, but universities are major employers of a wide range of skilled and unskilled employeesfrom cleaners to ground staff, caterers and technicians. Those in unskilled work are not as well equipped or resourced as those academic employees to defend their rights, conditions and remuneration on a one-to-one basis with any employer, let alone with organisations as large as Australia's universities, which are constrained by the subtle if not heavy threat of more of the AWA regime being introduced on the basis of funding to follow. Collective negotiation is how the workers who are not skilled enough to sell their wares ensure a fair deal for their labour. In making this process efficient and practical, representation of these employees by a third party-a peak body, a committee or a union-has been part and parcel of the agreement process. The government has recognised that strength in numbers is a legitimate approach to negotiation. Its Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 provides small business with the right to collectively bargain in their negotiations with suppliers or buyers when the business relationship is imbalanced due to the market power of the companies they do business with. Examples include smash repairers in their negotiations with the huge insurance companies-notwithstanding the problems the NRMA smash repair providers are suffering at the moment-and fruit and vegie growers in their dealings with the wholesale fresh produce markets. In his speech on the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer stated: ...the ACCC will have particular regard to the government's intention that the collective bargaining provisions not be used to pursue matters affecting employment relationships. That is an outright double standard. Why are collective bargaining and negotiated agreements encouraged in one situation where an economic power imbalance exists and yet discouraged in another? Surely the same principles apply. The higher education workplace requirements proposed in the bill contain four additional measures: direct relationships with employees, workplace flexibility, productivity and performance and freedom of association. From the government's perspective these measures are relatively benign, but I have concerns these requirements may also undermine employees' ability to secure a fair deal for themselves. The direct relationship measures determine that a university must provide for direct consultation with their employees and the involvement of third parties representing an employee's interest must only occur at the request of the affected employee. Once such a request is made, the negotiation process cannot be restricted to third-party representation only. This measure again may appear benign, but certainly employees who do not have a high level of awareness of their rights may find themselves agreeing to substandard conditions without the benefit of assistance from a representative body or organisation. I can think of several instances of technical support staff in the media department of Charles Sturt University who have experienced this because of financial constraints and the need for the university to prune back its operational processes. Indeed, this might happen if a university has a need to, if you like, top up its contractual arrangements with an academic staff member. This might happen for any reason. I notice in the higher education section of today's Australian a story about the increase in the number of foreign students here. We have topped the OECD for foreign students. The fact remains that, if we continue down the path we are on, we may find that situation reversed in the years ahead, particularly with things like the voluntary student unionism which the government is now foisting on the campuses, which will lead to voluntary student association cutbacks. I do not believe that we are going in any way to be able to provide the climate for a proper attractive academic option for those overseas students. We are now seeing Singapore and other South-East Asian countries building up the capacity of their universities to provide training, conditions and university standards far and away above the standards that we are going to be able to offer here. I know the minister talks about world's best practice and the best universities in the world. How do you measure the standard? If we force people who are working on the support side of universities into a process of taking whatever is on offer-and that will certainly be what is offered-then surely we will start to undermine the basis of the whole university workplace structure. Workplace flexibility is of great concern, particularly in relation to the minister's statement that this includes not placing limitations on the forms or mix of employment arrangements on campus. I believe those unable to strike a deal will be the ones who, as elsewhere in the workplace, are forced down in terms of their conditions and their pay. Students are already seriously disadvantaged by fly-in, fly-out and part-time academic staff and by their own need to work off campus. I see an inevitable progression towards casual employment on campus for academic staff as well-except for the very top echelon-without job security or benefits such as holiday and sick leave. I have already had students coming to me and talking about the fact that they are very disappointed that their contact with lecturers is relegated to the most minimal of opportunities. I am sure other members have had similar conversations. These students feel that the quality of their feedback and preparation is compromised, and I can only see that increasing when we have a situation where workplace agreements are on offer that increasingly require the universities to go for the cheapest options, particularly when dealing with support staff and those at the lower academic levels-lecturers and, indeed, tutors. I have few problems with measuring organisational productivity and performance, save that it may instil a managerial production line approach to higher education rather than encourage creative thinking and innovation. Universities are supposed to push the limits of human knowledge, and I wonder if this can be achieved if compliance with departmental guidelines and benchmarks is given priority over new ideas and often very long term research. The freedom of association requirement determines that a university must not encourage or discourage union membership and must not use CGS funds to pay union salaries or fund union facilities or activities. The only comment I will make about this area of the legislation is that, if the government's VSU bill passes in this and the other place, I wonder if our universities may be presented with a considerable dilemma when trying to provide essential services to students. I have received numerous letters with regard to this bill from employees of Charles Sturt University expressing their opposition to the requirements in the national governance protocols and their belief that tying these conditions to additional assistance is corralling universities into compliance. One letter says: If passed by the parliament, theserequirementswould represent the single greatest attack yet on the autonomy of our universities. Independent self-government is a defining characteristic of a university, and a formal part of the accreditation process. By seeking to have a federal minister directly dictate the form of agreements which should be offered to staff, and to attempt to micro-manage conditions of employment, the government demeans universities as autonomous public institutions. I believe this is a key point that is missing from the minister's assertion that the higher education workplace requirements are essential if we are to improve the calibre of our universities and create a world-class higher education sector in this country. The letter from the staff member went on: The government's focus on individual agreements (AWAs) and on such matters as abolishing the limits on casualisation of the workforce, ignore or in fact exacerbate the real problems which are limiting the quality and performance of our universities. For the last decade, the proposition of public money invested in our universities has fallen to well under the 50% mark. The failure of the government to index government grants to reflect real costs has resulted in excessive loads, increasing working hours, a highly casualised workforce and spiralling staff-to-student ratios. Is this heading to world's best practice or to the world-class higher education sector that the minister says he is aiming at? And, as I said, who measures what world class is? What are the standards-the number of business graduates or the number of philosophers? I do not know. Where is this measurement? Ms Hall interjecting",151
185,Mr ANDREN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"There are not too many philosophers around. There are plenty of graduates of law schools and business schools, I note-especially in this place. In the 2003 debate on the Higher Education Support Bill, I said: Under the Keating Labor government, the salary component of government funding was unhooked in 1995 from real price increases in the sector linked with safety net wage movements instead. This began the road to the increase in staff to student ratiosI should have said student to staff ratiosthe creeping casualisation of the university work force and the necessary commercialisation of universities to snare the elusive dollar. Under this government, public funding has plummeted from 60 per cent to 39 per cent since 1996. Only three OECD countries lag behind us in public spending on higher education. Public funding for higher education in this country accounts for just 0.6 per cent of GDP-that is down from 0.9 per cent in 1996-and the budget papers show it will fall to 0.5 per cent in 2004-05. If the minister were indeed serious about improving ‘the capacity of Australian institutions to be internationally competitive'whatever that means-the funding increases on offer in this bill would not be described as additional funding but as a retrospective topup of forgone investment. They certainly should not be conditional on acceptance of work- the government's workplace agenda. As it stands, I cannot accept this bill.",154
186,Ms HALL,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 is classic Howard government legislation, driven by the philosophical zealots on the other side of this parliament who are committed to their anti-union, anti-worker agenda. This is extreme legislation that highlights the Howard government's ideological preoccupation with controlling and converting every institution to fit its narrow vision of the world. This legislation will hold universities to ransom: either the universities meet the government's extreme industrial relations requirements or they miss out on desperately needed funds. Universities have suffered under the Howard government. You only need to talk to people from any one of our great universities and to understand just how much they have suffered and just how much this government has eroded their funding base and affected their ability to deliver quality education to the people of Australia. This legislation is an attack on the autonomy of the universities, and it is also an attempt to micromanage the day-today running of the universities. We know from various pieces of legislation that have passed through this House just how the government likes to enforce its agenda on every institution. It uses funding to manipulate and to change institutions and vital services that are provided within the community. This government has absolutely no respect whatsoever for any organisation and, unfortunately, universities have really suffered. Funding for universities should be about improving education, learning and research. It should be about providing the best learning environment for students. It should be about preparing our students for the work force. It should be about ensuring that we have a society based on knowledgeknowledge that will, therefore, improve our communities. It should be about ensuring that our great universities conduct the research that we need to move forward, and it should be about making Australia a competitive nation as it goes through this century. At the dawn of a new century we should be looking to the future and examining the skills that we need as a nation. We should be looking at our universities to deliver those skills and knowledge-to be the institutions for the development of thought for looking to the future. Unfortunately, under the Howard government, this has changed. Universities are not about seeking knowledge. This bill is not about preparing us for the future; it is about running the government's narrow agenda. This legislation is about implementing and including industrial relations changes and making them more important than what the universities are about. Universities are about learning and research. Instead, this is where the Howard government is taking us. This bill enacts the industrial relations policies of the government in relation to universities versities. It imposes some requirements consistent with the government's industrial relaBy tions approach to the work force generally. But the bill goes, in a number of undesirable ways, beyond those requirements. Bearing in mind what I just said about the importance of universities and about how they are the institutions where we develop knowledge and thought, looking to the future, you will see how the actions of this government have actually impacted on that. In 2003 the government attempted to pass legislation that would impose a number of unreasonable industrial relations conditions on the capacity of universities to access additional funding. The measures in this bill were a component of the package of legislative changes to higher education that the government was then attempting to win support for in the Senate. But in order to secure majority support for the bulk of its package, the government agreed to drop these industrial relations measures from its higher education legislation. Following the last election and the changes to the composition of the Senate, the government has once again introduced the industrial relations proposals that were not supported in the Senate in 2003. That says to me that this government is going to arrogantly force its extreme agenda on the people of Australia, it is going to override any opposition and it is going to use its numbers in the Senate to ram through each and every piece of legislation that it chooses to. The government is not going to allow proper consultation and debate on legislation. All it will be about is ensuring that it gets legislation through and it will ride roughshod over anyone that disagrees with it. That is what the universities are facing here-a government that will ride roughshod over them if they do not agree with its agenda. The government is seeking to force unito introduce these draconian industrial relations conditions to secure funding. putting these extreme industrial relations requirements in front of quality education and research, the government is, as I have previously stated, eroding the quality of our universities and the quality of the skills that we have as a nation-we are already very aware of the shortage of skills-and eroding Australia's position in relation to the rest of the world. The government has been responsible for cutting $5 billion from Australian universities since coming to power, and we have seen many changes in the university sector. We have seen the government refusing to index university grants, and there has been a greater reliance on student fees. In the region that I represent, which is the Hunter and the Central Coast, the government has treated Newcastle university appallingly. The government has refused to grant the university regional status. It is important to put on the record here in the House tonight that the Central Coast has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, number of students in Australia going on to tertiary education. Instead of making it easier, instead of increasing access to university education, this government is trying to intervene, in the most draconian manner, in the universities' agendas and their ability to deliver education. We have seen how the student to staff ratios have increased and we have seen increased casualisation of the work force. When I am talking about the quality of education, it is interesting to reflect on the queslative tion that the shadow minister asked the minister today in question time when the shadow minister referred to the OECD's report Education at a glance 2005. The shadow minister brought to the attention of the House that Australia is the only country in the OECD to actually reduce spending on university and vocational education as a proportion of GDP since 1995. We put that in the context of this piece of legislation and it makes it even more horrific. Here is a government seeking to influence the agenda of universities and link funding to adopting its industrial relations requirements. I have always believed that the funding of universities and education is about ensuring that we have fully qualified, skilled workers and also a population and work force that is knowledgeable and has a good understanding. The shadow minister went on to point out that public funding for tertiary education in comparable OECD countries had risen by 38 per cent since 1995 while public investment in Australia had fallen by eight per cent in that period. This government is looking to do over the universities if they do not sign up to the government's industrial relations requirements. From my perspective, it is definitely not good enough. Who suffers? Australian students and Australia as a nation. That is what this government always forget. They forget that it is not them against the universities and it is not them against the unions. This is really impacting on the way our nation operates. It is impacting on our skills base and it is impacting on our economy. These legislative changes move the focus from teaching and learning to implementing the government's industrial relations changes. The legislation is about forcing Commonwealth government workplace relations on higher education providers. The government are pursuing their anti-union agenda, which pervades all of the Howard government's legisagenda. In this instance it is impacting on the day-today operation of the universities and the quality of teaching and research. I would like to demonstrate how the Howard government is trying to hold universities to ransom by bludgeoning them into accepting these extreme, reactionary, industrial relations requirements to secure funding. This is a government that will stop at nothing to ensure that its agenda is adopted. It is a government that does not look to what benefits the country. It is a government that can only see one thing-that is, its agenda: its absolute hatred of unions-and it lets that pervade its thinking, which therefore has an impact on the outcomes for this country. This legislation has five conditions attached to it for securing funding ties. The first condition is choice of agreement. It provides that employees have genuine choice and flexibility in agreement making by being offered AWAs. Employees on AWAs earn two per cent less and work six per cent more hours than those on registered collective agreements. Women in particular employed on individual contracts earn 11 per cent less an hour compared with men employed on collective agreements. Women receive about 90 per cent of the hourly rate of men employed on collective agreements. The percentage reduces further under AWAs, where women earn only 80 per cent of the hourly pay rate of men. Casual and part-time employees on AWAs earn 15 per cent less and 25 per cent less respectively relative to their earnings under the terms of collective agreements. AWAs are bad news for employees, especially women, and women represent over 50 per cent of the staff at universities. AWAs are subject to a no-disadvantage test, and I must say that that has not worked too well. This government is not about better conditions for workers. It is not about better choice. It is really about poorer conditions and ensuring that workers get the lowest wages and the poorest conditions that they possibly can. The second condition is the direct relationship between employees and the higher education provider. Workplace agreements, policies and practices must provide for consultation with employees on workplace relations and human resource matters. It is a direct relationship between the employer and the employee. Third-party involvement is only at the request of the affected employee. Once again, this is the government's anti-union agenda. Underlying all this is the government's hatred of unions and the fact that they do not want to see unions in any workby universiplace in Australia. The third condition is workplace flexibility. The higher education workplace agreements, policies and practices are to facilitate and promote fair and flexible arrangements. That is what this government says, but you always look at what underlies these statements. The higher education provider must have working arrangements and conditions of employment which are tailored to the circumstances of the higher education provider. I think you get the best outcome in any workplace where you take into account all parties. Over the years, women have been granted maternity leave. In the higher education sector there is 26 weeks of paid maternity leave. If you compare that to the community norm, you will find that maternity leave is unpaid. We all know that ‘workplace flexibility' is code for casualisation and poorer conditions. There are two other conditions: productivity and performance, and freedom of association. Productivity and performance are really an agenda for easy termination. Freedom of association is the fifth condition outlined. The legislation prohibits using Commonwealth Grant Scheme funds to pay union staff salaries or fund union facilities such as offices, but-and this is where the double standards come in-it will support the facilities of non-union bargaining. So, if you are a union, there is no assistance; if you are not a union, no worries-that can be funded direct through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. These are double standards, and that really shows the government's true agenda. On this side of the House, we have a different agenda. The Labor Party position on industrial relations has six key features. We believe in a strong safety net of minimum award wages and conditions, a strong independent umpire to assure fair wages and conditions and to settle disputes, the rights employees to bargain collectively for decent wages and conditions, the rights of workers to reject individual contracts which cut pay and conditions and undermine collective bargaining and union representation, proper rights for Australian workers who are unfairly dismissed, and the right to join and be represented by a union. We do not believe that funding arrangements should be used to manipulate institutions that are as important to the Australian community as our universities are. The government stands condemned for introducing this legislation into this parliament. It stands condemned for trying to link higher education, learning and research to its industrial relations agenda. This legislation should be rejected by all members of this parliament.",154
187,Mr HATTON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Blaxland) (7.15 pm)The purpose of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 is nicely summarised as follows by Kim Jackson from the Parliamentary Library's social policy section: To enforce the Commonwealth government's workplace relations requirements for higher cation providers. You could put it no more neatly than that-to enforce those workplace requirements. This bill has nothing to do with higher education or quality of output. It has nothing to do with the concerns of students. It has nothing to do with how better to administer universities in Australia, unless the assumption upon which you predicate everything else in higher education is based on a workplace requirements factor that is a key part of the government's industrial relations agenda. Members of the government accept that; Labor rejects it in to to. The original workplace relations legislation, put together into one grand bill by the of then member for Flinders, Mr Reith, sought to cast a net of requirements across the whole of Australian society. When it could not get that through, the government broke the legislation into 12 different bills. The background to this is that in 2003 the government tried to force the legislation through the Senate. It could not do it, so it did a bit of a compromise and got part of it through. The government now has a legislative majority, or at least a putative legislative majority, in the Senate. From day to day we do not know how that will work out but what we do know is that, although the government expected to have Family First Senator Fielding in its pockets and to be able to rely upon his vote, he has demonstrated in the short time he has been here as a senator-and I commend him for this-that he is fundamentally concerned about the impact of government policies on Australian families. Senator Fielding asked for family impact statements on every major piece of legislation, and the Liberal Party gave him that guarantee prior to the last election. However, as he has only come into the Senate just now, I have to tell him that I have been in the joint edusince 1996 and I know about the legislative guarantees that were given then. The general patina that the then opposition, now the government, put on show was: ‘We'll do everything just as Labor's done it. We're relaxed and comfortable; nothing is really going to change. We'll just change the bloke who is Prime Minister and change the people on the front benches. We'll make these series of promises to you but we really will not disturb anything else, so don't worry yourselves about that.' The reality after the 1996 election was that the Prime Minister had made ‘core' and ‘non-core' promises. There were things that the government would stick by and there were things they would not stick by. That practice is now time honoured, election after election. What did we find after the last election, in October 2004, when the Family First senator arrived? He was promised family impact statements on major pieces of legislation, but this is not in evidence in respect of the Telstra bill. I tell you what: that senator would be able to see here that, in respect of this legislation, there will not be one forthcoming either. This Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005 is directed at the remaking of higher education in Australia, not from an educational point of view but from social engineering and industrial relations perspectives. There is conditionality on the funding provided by the government. This bill says: ‘If you want to get the extra money and the increases that are available, you have to provide specific undertakings that you will do what is required of you,' as laid down by two of the government's ministers: the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Education, Science and Training. The outline of the bill says: The Bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to provide for the inclusion in the Commonwealth Grant Scheme Guidelines, requirements to be known as the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements. This will mean that a Higher Education Provider's basic grant amount for a year is increased (5% if the year is 2006; 7.5% if the grant year is a later year) under section 33-15 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 if the Minister is satisfied that the provider has met the requirements of: - the National Governance Protocols; and - the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements by the respective dates set out in the Commonwealth Grant Scheme Guidelines. All very well and good, but what does that mean? It means that a number of specific provisions have to be agreed to. Those provisions are not about guaranteeing educational outcomes, and they are not about dealing with inequity in teaching other than to say, ‘If you are a better university teacher, you should be able to make more money.' The specific provisions of this bill are: (1) choice in agreement making; (2) direct relationships with employees-that is, get rid of the unions as a third party to any of the negotiations between employers and employees; (3) workplace flexibility; (4) productivity and performance; and (5) freedom of association. We are back to: how do you kick the Australian Education Union to death? How do you change the whole way that universities have been governed and administered, according to a cloth cut by this government? The key elements of this bill are social engineering in the higher education sector by the government and a demand for workplace agreements-something they have tried to put in place across the Commonwealth Public Service and across Australia, but there are only about 100,000 Australian workplace agreements in situ. These are, in part, in the mining area. Earlier today, the member for O'Connor argued that the great success of Australian workplace agreements was that you could end up with one bulldozer driver instead of two. You could give him $20,000 more and you would not have to worry about providing a shed for the other driver. That was an example of how Australian workplace agreements are terrific for productivity and for everyone across the board! The shadow minister indicated in her argument that, if you look at normal practice with Australian workplace agreements, the outcomes are not the ones indicated by the member for O'Connor in his single example, from which he then generalised outwards. As the member for Shortland mentioned, women particularly can expect outcomes of two per cent less in total remunerations-it can in fact be more. With regard to this, I want to quote from the shadow minister's speech-I was in the chair at the time of the speech and took copious notes, and the shadow minister has provided me with a copy. I want to quote directly from what the shadow minister said, because it shows the direct impact on Australian women, who are the majority of employees in places of higher education in Australia. She said: We know that employees on AWAs earn two per cent less and work six per cent more hours than those on registered collective agreements. It is interesting to note that a part of the visions that have to be signed up to in the name of choice and flexibility is a very ‘helpful' clause by government ministers to be put into AWAs offered to people in the higher education area. The recommended clause is: The [insert HEP name] may enter into AWAs with its employees. Those AWAs may either operate to the exclusion of this certified agreement or prevail over the terms of this certified agreement the extent of any inconsistency, as specified in each AWA. This is about clearing out agreed outcomes, whether they have been agreed through the Industrial Relations Commission or done on an enterprise bargaining basis in the system that operated in the later years of the Hawke government and during the whole period of the Keating government, when workplace bargaining delivered strong outcomes for those employees who undertook them directly. That system also created about one million more full-time jobs-not casual-in the Australian economy for people who otherwise would not have had them. I will quote the shadow minister on the direct impact on women in higher education. She said: What's more, women employed on individual contracts earn 11 per cent less an hour compared with men employed on collective agreements. Currently women receive around 90 per cent of the hourly pay of men employed on collective agreements. That percentage is further reduced under AWAs, where women earn only 80 per cent of the hourly pay of men. Casual and part-time employees on AWAs earn 15 per cent and 25 per cent less respectively, relative to their earnings under the terms of collective agreements. That is the core reason that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to this legislation before us today. It is about stripping away the rights and remuneration of women in particular in higher education in Australia. I do not think that that is right; it should not pro- happen. The government has not only pursued this with an ideological fervour; it has pursued this single-mindedly with a passion and fervour that one might say is virtually religious. Mr Brendan O'Connor-They are obsessed!",158
188,Mr HATTON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The member for Gorton might be correct when he says that they are to obsessed. When preparing for this, it occurred to me that they are so obsessed, believe in it so fervently and have such a great passion that the coalition government would have said: ‘We will put AWAs on every one of the twelve Apostles. Simon and Peter, you can sign up. Thaddeus, here's your AWA, old son. James the Less, you're signing up on your AWA, are you?' The Apostles were lucky that they were in the Holy Land and not in Australia in 2005, because this bill directly says that people who are currently either covered by an Industrial Relations Commission award or subject to certified agreements under an enterprise bargaining scheme have to be offered AWAs. These are to be offered by institutions that know absolutely that the government has taken away from them $5 billion worth of grants since 1996 and has whacked them-as the shadow education minister indicated-in the last couple of years with $838 million worth of funding. Those administrators know that the government is religiously wedded to Australian workplace agreements and that, if you are looking at a five per cent or a 7½ per cent increase, it will be conditional not just on the offer of Australian workplace agreements but on their enforcement where possible. To make it possible, look at all the other provisions that are conditions of that funding being insured. All those conditions are cut from exactly the same government cloth. They are directed towards unionists, or people who are represented by unionists, and involve their being split away and having to individually face the situation in their workplace. Individually in a relatively powerless situation, they are faced by AWAs. Debate interrupted. NA",160
189,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Fuel Prices",161
190,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to talk about the parlous state of the government's decision making and the failure by this government to consider any proposals to mitigate the adverse effects of petrol increases on the Australian community. It is too bad that milk is unable to fuel a car, because as of today petrol is now more expensive than milk. I went to a supermarket today and purchased a litre of milk and found that the price of a litre of petrol at most petrol stations is in excess of the price of a litre of milk across the country. It is quite extraordinary that we will have to try to convert cars to ensure that they can use milk as a fuel, because the price of petrol has gone so high. I know, as every other member in this place knows, the adverse effects of those increases upon ordinary householders. We know how important it is for families to budget for their petrol allocation-to ensure that they can get to work and drop their kids off to school or to sporting events. It is an essential part of daily life for most Australians. We on this side also know that there is no easy fix for the global increases, but we do know this: there are ways in which we can mitigate the adverse effects upon households of this country. We know that there are ways in which we can examine proposals to mitigate these effects and to alleviate the burden on ordinary Australian consumers of petrolthat is, ordinary Australian families doing it tough in many respects. I suggest that the government stop fighting amongst themselves in relation to Telstra and what they are doing with that. I suggest that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister stop jockeying to see who will be Prime Minister next year and, instead, focus upon something that is hurting every Australian household. Yesterday the shadow minister indicated a number of ways that Labor has proposed to ensure at least some capacity by government to mitigate these effects. Firstly, we have said that the ACCC should be investigating why there is such a huge gap between the increase of crude oil and a much greater increase of refined oil. Why is there such a disparity between the relative increase in crude oil as opposed to refined oil? No inquiry has been undertaken by this government or indeed by the statutory authority, the ACCC, and it should investigate why there seems to be such an increase. At the heart of that increase, the difference between the two increases of two forms of oil is petrol companies wanting to get more money than they should and less money for the consumer. That is the first thing that can happen. The second thing that could happen-and the shadow minister raised it yesterday in the MPI-is amending section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act has been rendered almost ineffective as a result. There has been a series of judicial decisions, although I do not have the time now to go through those in detail, that have effectively rendered section 46 unable to be used in a proper manner and unable to be used in the way in which it was intended when the provision was enacted by the Commonwealth of Australia. So we say amend section 46 to enable the government to look at ways in which the extraordinary hikes in petrol prices can in some way be alleviated and for the families who are feeling the effects to be helped bear the burden that is occurring to the household budget. What we see is a government distracted. It is in total control of both houses but it of control, and it is also out of touch. This government is increasingly out of touch with the ordinary concerns of householders. I think it is time now for the government to focus on the major issues, not just Telstrathat is a complete scandal and a complete mess-and to look at ways to mitigate the adverse effects upon households of the effect of petrol prices. There are a number of things that could be done. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom is looking at ways to mitigate those effects. Why isn't the Treasurer here today? Why isn'the in the House looking at those solutions? (Time expired) Driver Training",161
191,Mrs MAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I have spoken a number of times in this House about the need for a national driver training program particularly aimed at young drivers. This has not happened and in fact state governments and the federal government are still undertaking more trials and more statistics. We are still no closer to introducing a compulsory national driver training program for all new drivers in this country. Instead, we still see headlines such as the one recently telling of four young teenagers killed in a horrific car crash in Townsville, North Queensland. That is four more young lives that could have been saved. Just weeks before, on the Gold Coast, two teenagers from one of my local high schools lost their lives because of a lack of skills, and that is two more young lives that could have been saved. The knee-jerk reaction to both these accidents was predictable. The Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads has said that he will take to cabinet in the next few weeks proposed restrictions for young drivers. They will include night-time curfews, restrictions on engine size, restrictions on is out passenger numbers, compulsory first aid training-and the list goes on. But we have heard it all before. Every time young people are killed in road accidents elected representatives make the appropriate noises. They say that, yes, they will do something, but nothing happens. The problem ends up in the toohard basket yet again or we throw taxpayer dollars at another trial. I wonder just how many trials we need to tell us that we have a problem. Let us do something about the problem and put to use the information we have gained from trials in the past. The road toll in this country should not be accepted as inevitable. We all hear the statistics each year. Around 1,700 people die on our roads and more than 100,000 are seriously injured. Young Australian drivers aged 17 to 25 years have doubled the risk of drivers of all ages being involved in a fatal road accident. I wonder how many of us stop and count the cost of those statistics-the cost to government and community, the cost to family and loved ones and the long-term cost to the person who has survived but who has been left crippled for life. What of those costs? In dollar terms, road crashes cost the Australian economy around $15 billion per annum. Fatal crashes cost $2.92 billion. Serious injury crashes cost $17.15 billion. Minor injury crashes cost $2.47 billion. Property damage only crashes cost $2.44 billion. The human cost is immeasurable. Talk to a parent, brother, sister or grandparent about what it is like to lose a young loved one. It is time both state and federal governments did something about these statistics, and I do not mean more trials. I mean a national education program delivered through our schools to all young people in this country. It must be compulsory and it must be intensive, but it must not be just about how to drive to get your licence-anyone can do that. I am talking about a holistic approach to driver training that incorporates proven theoretical and practical training techniques, combined with an innovative delivery method which ensures students have a comprehensive knowledge in areas such as driving theory, practical driving skills, safe and effective driving technique, vehicle maintenance, first-aid, driving in adverse conditions, vehicle dynamics and the effects of attitude in practical driving. I am talking about a minimum of 120 hours of practical driving experience, and nationally recognised credentials. A national driver training course incorporating all the above and more could be delivered as a certificate II course through our high schools, technical training colleges and private training providers in either a lecture environment or via the internet. Driving a motor vehicle is possibly the most technically difficult activity the average person will ever undertake. Yet, despite its complexity, drivers generally take to the road in a totally unprepared state. Drivers are taught how to pass a test rather than how to drive. Young drivers only strive to attain the minimal competency level required to secure their licence. This means that drivers are then left to gather experience themselves and are not prepared for all the first-time events they will face on the road. This government is partnering with the New South Wales and Victorian governments in a trial education program for young drivers. This trial is not expected to commence until early 2006, with a full evaluation not likely until late 2008. That is more time lost on more trials, which means more young people dead on our roads between now and 2008. I have presented to my government a comprehensive, holistic driver training program that can be delivered through our schools at a national level now. I respectfully ask that serious consideration be given to that proposal. If we as a government are truly serious about stopping this dreadful carnage on our roads, let's do something now, not in three years time after yet another trial. A national program delivered as a core curriculum subject can be taught in high schools throughout this country next year, along with English, maths, science and IT studies. Driver training is just as important as those other subjects and in fact has components of all those subject areas. As a nation, let's stop the carnage on our roads. (Time expired) Fuel Prices",162
192,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"As a mother with a teenage learner driver, I certainly commend the member for MCPherson on the proposal she is putting forward. As a mother who puts the petrol in the tank of the car driven by my teenage son, I doubt that this will be much of a problem in the near future as so few people will be able to afford the petrol needed for their teenagers to learn to drive! My office has been very busy in the last few weeks. It is not that I am particularly unique-I suspect most members of this House have had a similar experience. All Australians, not least those in my electorate, are very worried about the price of petrol. I acknowledge that this is a very difficult issue. Its complexity is made more difficult by the many factors involved in the price of oil: the role of the refineries, petrol stations, international markets and price cycles and of course excise and GST. Each of us in this place has been approached by constituents, friends and family to ‘do something' about increased petrol prices. The impact of increased petrol prices is flowing or will soon flow on to the economic statistics. Already the retail sector is warning of slow sales; the tourism sector is reporting slow accommodation bookings and fall-offs in day-trip visitors. In Wollongong, with its fantastic beaches and a coastline unparalleled in the nation, I can see a difference between visitor bustles on weekends at Belmore Basin a few weeks ago and the slow drip of visitors now. On WIN TV News this week, as the member for Gilmore would know, the busy Terralong Street in Kiama was virtually empty. A survey released in the last 24 hours has revealed that petrol prices are now more of a worry to Australians than terrorism. The Prime Minister told a press conference last week that it would cost nearly $400 million to reduce the excise on petrol by 1c. Such a reduction would arguably have a minimal impact on petrol pump prices but would place a massive structural imbalance into the budget. The government can and should implement other options, and I would like to address alternative views in this respect. The government can and should implement Labor's plan, which would ease the price burden on motorists, but it stubbornly refuses to even consider it. It is obvious that price gouging is under way. Motorists do not need access to documents or emails to confirm price collusion and gouging by major oil companies; they just stand at the petrol pump and know what is going on. The government can and should strengthen the Trade Practices Act to prevent market power abuse and encourage competition; have the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission investigate petrol prices and every six months report on price movements; modernise the current 25-yearold regulatory regime; promote competition in the petrol sector and protect independent service station operators and franchisees; reduce reliance on imported oil and expand the Australian fuel industry; and provide a real future to the biofuels industry. These are real initiatives that can help reduce the petrol bills for motorists and help the fuel industry. As I said, everyone knows ‘something funny' is going on, to use the expression of the ACCC chairman a few days ago. I believe the ACCC is more than willing, given the appropriate powers and direction by the government, to investigate price gouging. Why won't the government give the ACCC the power it needs to ensure competition in the petrol sector and fair prices for Australian motorists? The longer that any government stays in office, the more complacent it becomes. The government is becoming more and more arrogant and complacent. I find it unbelievable that the government would not at least look for options to help Australian consumers. In today's newspapers we have stories of the ‘leader-in-waiting' report given to the coalition party room by the Treasurer yesterday. It is full of advice to his colleagues about the tough issues and about how the government must stick together. There is another piece revealing how a coalition senator told the party room that he wondered whether his colleagues understood the frustration of opposition and have fooled themselves into thinking they would be in government forever. I can tell my colleagues on the other side that opposition is no fun. I would certainly prefer to sit on the government side of the chamber as a member of a Labor government and implement the ideas and policies that Labor has. (Time expired) South Australia: Mental Health Services",163
193,Mr RICHARDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I spoke in the House on Monday night on mental health and said that I would be back to speak about it again; here I am. I spoke about a young lady who shared with those at the National Youth Roundtable her battle with mental illness and the crisis in the South Australian mental health system. There is a desperate breakdown in services in South Australia, with stories filling Adelaide's Advertiser every day about how the system is failing South Australians-from the woman who was sent home from hospital three times because there were no mental health facilities available, to the woman stabbed by a mental health patient at Flinders Hospital, to the magistrate who recently threw a case out of court because the accused was clearly suffering from an untreated mental illness. South Australia has the lowest per capita spend on mental health services across the nation. It is an absolute tragedy, because it is costing young South Australians their lives. Making the situation even worse was the decision earlier this year to close the Glenside facility, a hospital dedicated solely to mental health services. Mental illness is a subject which has been taboo for so many years and this has meant that many generations of Australians have suffered in silence. We are now in a situation where the subject is one of public debate; where Australians suffering mental illness are not taunted or marginalised but accepted into mainstream Australia. In this day and age, when the community has come so far in its recognition of mental illness, I simply cannot understand why the state Labor government cannot do the same. Mental illness is a silent killer which takes the lives of many Australians every year and, in the majority of cases, we are talking about illnesses which are treatable and deaths which are preventable. If only the state Labor government would recognise the problem and take steps to help these people who are crying out so desperately. I stand here today in the hope that it will raise some awareness of the issues and the huge underspend on mental health services in South Australia, let alone all across Australia. I stand here today in the hope that my colleagues on both sides of the Houseparticularly my colleague opposite, the member for Hindmarsh, who knows very well the deplorable situation that we have in South Australia-will do the right thing. Tell the state Labor government to do the right thing, member for Hindmarsh, and make a difference in the lives of South Australians, who deserve much better from their government. The Australians most likely to be affected by mental health disorders and most likely to commit suicide are young men. I have two sons and every day that I look at them. I thank God that they are not suffering so terribly from a mental illness and that my family are not burdened with their care because the state is failing to look after the mentally ill. I speak with so many constituents who are suffering as a result of this significant service shortfall-constituents who are forced to give up their jobs and look after their loved ones who are suffering at the hands of these crippling diseases. Their loved ones are the lucky ones, because they have family to pick up the slack where the state Labor government have failed. What happens to those who do not have family to look after them, to make sure they are receiving appropriate medical assistance and care and to make sure that they are safe? The sad reality is that many of them end up like the young man I spoke of earlier who is now facing serious criminal charges. These people simply have nowhere to turn and no-one to help them receive appropriate treatment. The time has come for the state Labor governments to stop avoiding this issue and to do something to genuinely help those vulnerable South Australians-all Australianswho are suffering at the hands of their inaction and incompetence. The sad reality is that, when this young lady from the round-table stood up and spoke of her mental health issues, the first thing I thought was that I hoped she was not from South Australia, because under this state Labor government the state funded services are extremely deficient. I congratulate David Holst and the Dignity for the Disabled party machine initiated in South Australia for the sole purpose of applying pressure to a state Labor government failing to provide the appropriate funding in all areas for families and individual sufferers of a mental disability. The time has come; enough is enough. I support and encourage Dignity for the Disabled and the work of the Mental Health Council of Australia. Fuel Prices",165
194,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on the growing pressure which is being placed on businesses, families, pensioners and all Australians by the increasing price of petrol. I too, like the many speakers before me today, have received a number of calls in my electorate office over the past few weeks. It is quite clear that people are struggling to make ends meet, given that petrol prices have climbed to around $1.40 per litre over the past three months. Business people I meet with regularly are telling me that their prices are going to have to go up so that they can keep up with their petrol costs. One person told me that he works for a company which sells caravans. He said that over the past few weeks no-one has walked through the door and he is worried he will lose his job. That is because towing a caravan is very taxing on fuel consumption. Another gentleman I spoke to at a business dinner last week said his construction business is already being affected. He has tendered and quoted for large scale contracts at a price which does not take into account the current costs of running construction equipment such as prime movers. He told me that he thought he may have to lay workers off to be able to work within the budgets that he had planned. But businesses are not the only ones being affected. Pensioners are staying at home more because they cannot afford to fill up. The social and economic consequences of the government's inaction on this issue are profound. The inflationary effects of petrol prices will dramatically change our economy. There is a real danger that, if we have inflation that is caused by the astronomical petrol price hike, the Reserve Bank may have no other option but to look at the possibility of increasing interest rates. That, we all know, would be a tragedy. The additional impost on the household budget will reduce people's mobility. For elderly Australians, who make up around 20 per cent of the population in the electorate of Hindmarsh, the resulting social isolation can lead to health issues such as depression and reduced physical activity. The government claims that it has no role to play in reducing petrol prices, but this is just an ideological position based on a belief that it should not interfere, even when people are hurting-and they are really hurting at the moment, with a petrol price of $1.40 per litre. There is absolutely no excuse for a government elected by Australians not to take action on an issue which is affecting so many people's lives. It is interesting to see that, as average consumers pay through the nose at the petrol bowsers, oil companies are recording increased profit margins. For the government to stand by and claim that there is nothing that it can do is ridiculous. If nothing else, it could investigate the options and find out how this issue could be managed. Under no circumstances is it the right thing to stand by as Australians suffer. Earlier today the Treasurer stood here and said the following: ... petrol prices are punishingly high. These high petrol prices are punishing consumers. High petrol prices are not good for business, high petrol prices are not good for the government, and high petrol prices are not good for the economy. If anybody is welcoming high petrol prices, let me suggest to them that it is not in the Australian consumer or in the interests of Australian business. Despite that acknowledgment, this government stands by and does nothing. Obviously, these price hikes are having the biggest effect on families on tight budgets. These people are the Australian battlers that this government claims to represent. It appears that they have been forgotten. There are almost 13,000 people in my electorate who are living in poverty. Sadly, I suspect that that number is about to grow as a result of rising petrol prices. South Australia has the highest percentage of people living in poverty of any mainland state or territory. Many people also travel considerable distances between home and work. Adelaide itself runs for almost 100 kilometres from the north to the south. Because of our sprawling city and dispersed population, people depend on their cars. Their car is a necessity. Australia consumes oil at three times the rate at which we find it. We import 60 per cent of our domestic oil. We need alternatives to petrol and we need the ACCC to get serious about price gouging. Instead of continuing to increase our reliance on imported oil, this government should work on growing an Australian liquid fuel market to help cut our import bill. We have vast reserves of natural gas which could be converted into liquid fuel. Australia also has to get serious about biofuels. Research and development in renewable energy is not nearly as advanced as we need it to be. The government could take immediate action to amend the Trade Practices Act to prevent the abuse of market power and other unfair practices which drive out competition. Regular monthly reports from the ACCC on petrol price movements would also be a good idea, and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 interests of the could do with updating. We know what the problem is. Now we are at a crisis point, and this government is doing nothing about it. Now is the time to take action, not when it is too late. If the government were not so out of touch, it would understand that there are things that can be done to help Australians cope with rising petrol prices, and it would not back away from its responsibility to do so. (Time expired) Beattie Government",166
195,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT,"I welcomed in my electorate of Bowman-in that so very vibrant local economy and delicate ecology-the visit of Premier Peter Beattie and his community cabinet last weekend. I would always welcome that kind of connection with the community were there not the great risk of community cabinets turning into a circus of fawning, toadying, sycophantic self-congratulation and back patting, which is exactly what transpired at the weekend. Eighteen months through Premier Beattie's term in office, it is probably a very good time for a half-term report card and, probably even more importantly, a bit of plain English in that report. As we know very well, Mr SPEAKER - and it is right here in the government finance statistics from the ABS-Queensland's coffers are growing much faster than those of every other state. In the year 2003-04, the Commonwealth grew by around 7.2 per cent in gross government revenues, New South Wales by four per cent and Victoria by five per cent. One would expect increases in social service expenditure to be in that order. In Queensland the growth was 25 per cent in a single year thanks to GST and burgeoning stamp duty returns. The question I put to you today is this: have we really got a premier with his priorities right? When we talk about roads, schools and hospitals, are we seeing an increase of 25 per cent, as is reflected in Peter Beattie's own net government revenue? In schools, we have seen a time line to remove asbestos from a number of schools in my electorate stretched out to 10 years when we know that other states are doing it in half the time. We have seen appalling conditions in our state schools-rotting boards, rusting beams and old leaking toilets in an appalling state. As the hospitals, in Queensland we are aware of secret waiting lists and very weak efforts to defend the fact that they do exist. And, most importantly of all, in my electorate, there are the roads that run to Brisbane and the 15year commitment to develop a two-lane road to Redland Bay and Victoria Point. Emergency services have been a constant struggle in my electorate. A fire station was offered and lost-returned to Brisbane when they could not settle on a location and an arrangement for a fire station in the southern half of our electorate, leaving us with response times of 15 to 18 minutes, far too long to save a family in distress with a house fire. And, lastly, there is the long and beleaguered wait on the lower bay islands for a police station. When that police station does finally come to Macleay Island, it will be way too late for many of those residents who needed proximal law and order long before today. What did we have from the community cabinet? We had old announcements about long overdue power infrastructure spending and Energex; we had regional export awards that are a combined Commonwealth-state responsibility anyway. We were majoring in the minors, with action to prevent crab pot theft. There was news about a new nursery arrangement for the overseas export of pines to Disneyland in Hong Kong. And, finally, it was announced that the plans for road extensions would be on view. These are slim pickings. It is not to diminish any of those important recipients, who include the Cooee Indigenous elders and the Capalaba intergenerational activity centre, who got some piloting money for a feasibility study. It is not to diminish those worthy groups, but just to say how far those outcomes are from the objectives of ordinary Redlanders. As Robert MCKain said, the reato son that most goals are not achieved is that we spend time doing second things first. I can hear it now from a song, a ballad, from a generation both you and I would recall, Mr SPEAKER - a ballad spreading across the Redlands with eerie familiarity. It is a growing voice that we are hearing right throughout my electorate-what we want is: ... a little less conversation, a little more action please All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me A little more bite and a little less bark A little lesssmart stateand a little more spark.
