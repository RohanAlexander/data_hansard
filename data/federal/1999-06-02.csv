In particular, part-time and casual of saving for a retirement income through included the wider benefits of death and disability offered by superannuation funds. The coverage dramatically.

However, is only credited on the first $1,200 of the employees to transfer their funds to another compound. Labor also recognised that some workers before retirement in limited circumstances, such of being unemployed or being retrenched. That access to not only account balances in SHAR people are down on their luck, Labor's early superannuation generally by applying to the applicant was required to prove that they proved that to the ISC, the applicant was then Wednesday, 2 June 1999 funds.

When access provision allowed limited access to Insurance.and Superannuation Commissioner. An were suffering from financial hardship. Having entitled to access some of their superannuation. REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITI'EE Wednesday, 2 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE It was also possible to access superannuation changed employers and also if a person was if a person was no longer going to be a burden their superannuation contributions. The government superannuation moneys with effect from 1 suffering from severe financial hardship must on a Commonwealth income support payment if trustees that they are suffering from financial threshold for receipt of monies was reduced access is no longer available to those aged under 55. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation a similar although slightly less onerous set solution to the government's policy, proposed weeks. While not being the ideal situation, at from financial hardship than the government's Commonwealth income support payment. The income support test was reduced to 26 weeks, threshold, and persons leaving Australia were affairs while still being able to access their provisions to the SHAR. While Labor is not opposing these provisions attention of the government that it should leave their superannuation funds in their account provide a decent retirement income. However, able to access small amounts of superannuation government has introduced provisions allowing grounds through the APRA. The access conditions difficulty do not meet those strict criteria. For example, those who cannot pay their superannuation but those who have a housing mortgage is about to be foreclosed. There are to pay their mortgages but cannot access their this policy encourages them to use available bank move to foreclose so that they can access little sense. Like many of my parliamentary claimed to be in financial difficulty but who able to apply for access to their superannuation like to review the activities of this legislation provisions are working. The second provision in the legislation relates 2 of the bill proposes to close a tax avoidance opposition. Section 273 of the ITAA currently to a superannuation entity set up for the benefit superannuation entity is generally taxed at income' component, which is usually taxed at 5885 accounts with less than $500 in them if they permanently leaving the country. In other words, to the Australian taxpayer, they could access changed the early release provisions of July 1998. The new provisions are: applicants meet an 'objective test' of 26 continuous weeks under 55, then prove to their superannuation hardship; if leaving an employer, the $500 to $200; and, if permanently leaving Australia, examined the regulations and recommended of criteria. Labor senators, seeking a practical that the objective test should be reduced to 12 least it was a better deal for people suffering original position of 39 weeks on a final result was that the original 39 weeks on the $500 threshold was reduced to a $200 allowed one year's grace period to sort our their superannuation. The bill provides the same in the bill, I wish to bring some issues tp the consider closely. People should be encouraged to to compound so it is there at retirement to those in severe financial difficulty should be to get through a difficult period. The access to superannuation on compassionate are strict and often people in financial rent are not able to get access to their mortgage may qualify for access if their cases where people will run up credit card debts super to pay off their credit card debt. Instead, funds to pay off their credit card debt but let the their superannuation. That policy makes very colleagues, I am aware of people who have have had to wait the full 26 weeks before being funds. I suggest that the government might and report to the parliament on how these to the closing of the tax loophole. Schedule loophole, and this is welcomed by the does not prevent the distribution of trust income of the trust beneficiary.

'(2) Has he received advice on the validity of Sir Robert Garran's statement that the Constitution could be altered but not the Act in' which the Constitution was incorporated.

Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourGrants able member's question is as follows: General Purpose Roads Total $3,312,290 $590,586 $3,902,876 1996-97 $3,406,245 $665,748 $4,071,993 1997-98 $3,724,564 $728,654 $4,453,218 $4,346,062 $674,956 $5,021,018 1996-97 $4,469,455 $718,412 $5,187,867 1997-98 $4,455,201 $736,585 $5,191,786 $2,575,891 $597,617 $3,173,508 1996-97 $2,650,075 $578,307 $3,228,382 1997-98 $2,485,356 $579,949 $3,065,305 $6,509,045 $724,171 $7,233,216 1996-97 $6,994,329 $704,501 $7,698,830 1997-98 $6,915,773 $665,207 $7,580,980 (4) Has he received advice indicating whether the Australia Acts 1986 prevent the UK Parliament from amending the preamble. (5) Has he received advice indicating whether the preamble can be amended by the Commonwealth at the request, or with the concurrence, of the parliaments of all States pursuant to placitum 51 (xxxviii) of the Constitution and section 15 of the Australia Acts 1986. (6) Has he received advice indicating that the approach referred to in part (S) was flawed; if so, on what grounds. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It has been the general practice of succeeding governments not to disclose whether specific legal advice has been provided to government for the purpose of developing government policy or making specific government decisions, nor to make available such legal advice. However, I can assure the Honourable Member that the Government has received appropriate legal advice in developing its proposals for constitutional changes to be put to the people later this year. The following comments may assist in clarifying the position. An Australian republic may be established without amending or repealing the existing preamble to the Constitution Act (UK). The Government's proposed constitutional amendments would not amend or repeal the preamble to the Constitution Act (UK). - ;However, the existing preamble to the Constitution Act (UK) may be amended. This could be achieved by a Commonwealth Act passed at the request of the Parliaments of all the States (under subsection 1 S(I) of the Australia Acts) or by a constitutional amendment under section 128 of the Constitution giving the Commonwealth Parliament legislative power to do so (as contemplated by subsection 1 5(3) of ie Australia Acts). Defence Reform Program: Officer Redeployment (Question No. 552) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 29 March 1999: Nationally Victoria (2) The use of voluntary transfer, and the ability to involuntarily transfer a member to the Inactive Army Reserve is a management tool available to personnel agencies, such as the Directorate of Officer Career Management-Army and the Army Personnel Agencies, to allow the total management of the personnel asset. In order to provide reasonable opportunities for promotion and command appointments, it may be necessary for personnel agencies to transfer members to the Inactive Army Reserve. This is not an indication of poor or unsatisfactoiy performance but a reflection of the need to provide opportunities for the continual development of officers. Members to be considered for transfer'to the Inactive Army Reserve are: (a) to have served a reasonable time in their current rank; (1) Further to the answer to question No. 393 (Hansard, 22 March 1999, page 3409), have additional full-time officer positions been allocated to the Army Reserve; if so, how many positions have been allocated (a) nationally and (b) in Victoria. (2) Have long standing officers in the Army Reserve received letters notifying them that they have been involuntarily transferred to the Inactive Reserve; if so, how many officers have been notified (a) nationally and (b) in Victoria. (3) Did the officers referred to in part (2) receive letters from the Defence Personnel Executive stating that their transfer was not a reflection of dissatisfaction with their service but necessary to meet the ongoing developmental requirements of the Army Reserve; if so, did the transfers actually result from the allocation of additional full-time officer positions to the Reserve. (4) What redundancy benefits were provided to the officers who were transferred to the Inactive Reserve. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Army Reserve is manned by personnel serving on a part-time basis. No full-time officer positions have been allocated to the Army Reserve. Following are the number of Army Reserve officer positions nationally and in Victoria: 1997 1998 1999 -3446 3409 3414 570 549 571 (b) unlikely to be promoted (this may be due to potential or the lack of positions); and (c) are restricting the promotion of junior officers. Since the beginning of FY 1998/99, Nationally 55 officers have been given letters of intention to transfer them to the Inactive Army Reserve. 40 officers accepted and transferred voluntarily. 13 officers objected and appealed, and their cases were reviewed in accordance with the policy. 6 officers have sl1bsequently been transferred involuntarily. 1 officer will be transferred involuntarily on 30 June 1999 and 6 officers will be transferred on 31 December 1999 if no suitable positions can be found for them by then. 2 officers have not yet replied to the initial letter. Included in this National total are 5 officers in Victoria who were identified for transfer to the Inactive Anny Reserve; 2 transferred voluntarily and 3 were transferred involuntarily. (3) Officers identified for transfer are forwarded a copy of the 'Consultation Notes-Transfer to the Inactive Anny Reserve' which infonns them of the reasons for their proposed transfer and that the action is not a reflection of dissatisfaction with their previous service. Also they are provided with this advice by their Commander/Commanding Officer/Officer Commanding. Once a member is identified for transfer from the Active Reserve, a proposal to transfer the officer to the Inactive Anny Reserve is then prepared, and acting on behalf of the Chief of Anny, the delegate signs and forwards a Notification of Intention to Transfer (NOIT) to the member's Commander, Commanding Officer or Officer Commanding. The Commander/Commanding Officer/Officer Commanding consults with the member and explains the proposal and the member's options. Consultation with the member is a significant factor throughout this process, ensuring that members understand their options and that they are infonned at each stage. The transfers do not result from the allocation of additional full time officer positions to the Anny Reserve, but instead are a way of ensuring younger Reserve officers have promotion opportunities. (4) There is no provision for officers of the Anny Reserve to receive redundancy benefits on their transfer to the Inactive Anny Reserve. Reservists are not full time employees. Those in the Inactive Anny Reserve can still be called on to do project work, for which they will be paid. Norfolk Island Administrator (Question No. 619) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1999: Further to the answer to question No. 112 (Hansard, 10 March 1999, page 3701) concerning the position of Administrator of Norfolk Island being an office of profit under the crown, have the Hon. Anthony John Messner's Commonwealth parliamentary superannuation entitlements been reduced because of his appointment as the Administrator of Norfolk Island; if so, by what sum; if not, why not. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Advice from the Department of Finance and Administration is that Mr Messner's parliamentary superannuation has been reduced by the maximum required by the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 because of his appointment as Administrator of Norfolk Island. Social Security Agreement: Greece·· (Question No. 620) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1999: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 315 (Hansard, 10 February 1999, page 2440) concerning a reciprocal social security agreement between Australia and Greece, is it a fact that the Government of Greece is not prepared to proceed with the Australian Government's proposal of April 1998 and wishes to negotiate further towards an agreement similar to those with other European countries. (2) Is it a fact that the Australian Government is insisting on an agreement with Greece which is different from those with other European countries, in particular imposing a 49-year period rather than a 25-year period; if so, why. (3) Is it a fact that the issue has been stalled for a number of years and is creating hardship for many persons. (4) Will the Australian Government discuss the issue at a ministerial level with the Government of Greece to achieve a resolution. Mr Truss-The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Government of Greece has not responded to the Australian Government's proposal of April 1998. Consequently, I do not know its current position on the matter. (2) Australia desires a reciprocal Agreement with Greece. The same fonnula, as used with other European countries, would be applied to people leaving Australia to live in Greece after an Agreement is implemented. The only difference is that the combination of Australian and Greek working life residence will be used to work out the Australian rate of pension for people who have already resettled in Greece. This is necessary due to the limited coverage of the Greece's social insurance scheme and because Australia wants to achieve the same level of reciprocity that has been achieved in Agreements with other European countries. (3) The issue has been stalled since 1995. My Government has made efforts to end the stalemate and avoid any difficulties created by delays. However, the matter is now with the Government of Greece. (4) The Australian Government would be prepared to discuss the issue at a ministerial level if necessary, once the position of the Government of Greece is known.",192
