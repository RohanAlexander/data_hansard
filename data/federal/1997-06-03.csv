1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA Savings Rebate",13
2,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister continue to assert that there is economic merit in the centrepiece of his budget, the 15 per cent savings rebate, when the government's most senior economic adviser, Treasury Secretary Ted Evans, conceded yesterday in Senate estimates hearings these two things: first, that the recent OECD report, arguing that tax incentives overall did not increase household savings, 'could well have been written by Treasury'; and, second, that the net impact of the savings rebate on Australian savings was likely to be negative, with the $2 billion cost to revenue likely to exceed any increase in saving by individuals?",13
3,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The savings rebate is a direct reward to thrifty Australians. As far as the government is concerned, rewarding thrifty Australians is a very desirable economic objective. It is a very desirable social objective. It is always desirable to provide people with incentives to save. It. is alwa-s desirable to reward thrifty behavlOur. It IS always desirable to encourage people into good saving habits. What I am proud about with this incentive is that it will encourage people to save, it reward the thrifty and, for the first time, it will represent a demonstration of faith by a government in Australia in the use of the taxation system to encourage thrifty conduct. Far from the government being in any way in doubt about the proposal, we think it is an excellent proposal. It has been very warmly received in the Australian community. Mr GARETH EV ANS- Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Is it not the case that under your scheme thrifty Australians can still get the rebate if they decrease their saving in anyone year? Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the supplementary question",13
4,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I am going to rule the supplementary question out of order. The supplementary question is out of order. Crime and Violence,13
5,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. At the time of the last election the coalition promised a national strategy to address violence and crime in our communities. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of actions being taken to address violence and crime in Australia?,13
6,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to inform the House that, on Thursday of this week, I will launch the national campaign against violence and crime in Australia. The launch of this $13 million, three-year campaign marks the fulfilment of another major government election commitment. I am very proud to say that this commitment will be honoured, as is the practice of this government, in full. We made a commitment in the last election campaign to undertake an active strategic role in association with the state governments of Australia, which have primary but not exclusive responsibility for matters relating to crime and violence, in addressing crime and violence in our communities. The campaign is the most comprehensive strategic national approach ever undertaken to not only fight crime and violence but also work on the genesis of criminal activity-the motivation will and social determining factors behind crime and violence. The first phase of the campaign will target crime prevention, fear of crime b the community, residential burglary, domestic violence prevention, early intervention, homeless youth, and preventing crime and violence at public events. This is being done in a number of ways and with cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. I want to particularly thank the Attorney General of South Australia, Trevor Griffin, for the very constructive role that he has played in the development of these strategies. Particular programs will be funded to target these sorts of problems. For example, to make sure that the best possible practices are being used in crime prevention, the campaign is funding the national anti-crime strategy to set world best practices in the ACT and in Victoria and to produce an effective model for crime prevention for use in each state and territory. In preventing violence and crime at public events, Queensland and New. South Wales will assist in testing and evaluatmg the best practices available, and then we can produce a model for use across the n.ation. Those programs will be carefully mOnItored to ensure that results are achieved in the wider community. For the first time we will have the means to undertake, test and monitor crime and violence programs and then quickly and effectively spread that program throughout the nation to address crime and violence at its sources. This is the first phase of the program. Over the next three years, different aspects of crime and violence will be targeted and specific programs in our communities will be expanded. I take the opportunity of informing the House that later in the year the government will be giving full force and effect to the commitments that it made in the area of domestic violence. I would not want the emphasis that will be placed on the campaign against violence and crime generally and the announcements I make on Thursday to be seen as in any way exhausting or, indeed, giving effect to the particular commitments we made in relation to domestic violence. A commitment to a national approach and a national responsibility in that area is very high on the list of priorities of the government. Domestic violence is utterly unacceptable to all sections of the Australian community. There is a role for the national government in cooperation with the states and in cooperation with voluntary organisations. Quite separately from the campaign on Thursday, we will be announcing a number of valuable initiatives in the area of domestic violence. Employment Placement Services",13
7,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in question time yesterday you undertook to analyse my question concerning Minister Vanstone. Prime Minister, have you raised the matter with the minister? Did that lead to her latest apology in Senate estimates hearings today? Is it not a fact, Prime Minister, that Senator Vanstone has misled the parliament on three occasions: on the Wright family, on the jobs target and now today on the right of Australians looking for work to a free employment service? Prime Minister, after three strikes, should not Senator Vanstone be out?",14
8,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,14
9,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right! Mr Lee-She has had more chances than Mark Taylor.,14
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She has had more than three strikes against you. I understand that Senator Vanstone has made some comments relating to this issue in the Senate estimates committee hearing this morning. I am advised that she had indicated there was a need to qualify some earlier statements concerning state legislation regarding charging for employment placement services. She did that at the commencement of the committee hearings, which is appropriate, well in advance of the Senate committee's consideration of the relevant part of the budget papers. I assume that the member for Batman will be examining carefully his own statements on the matter and informing the House of any qualification he would wish to make to these.",14
11,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjectingSavings Rebate,14
12,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, are you aware of comments that your new savings plan will-and I quote-'provide benefits to those that either do not need it or do not deserve it'? Are the many battling self-funded retirees who live in my electorate of Eden-Monaro the people to whom those comments are directed?",14
13,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. He reminds me of a significant difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition government-that is, the coalition government wants to reduce taxes on savings and the Labor Party does not. The Labor Party wants higher taxes on savings than this government is going to introduce as a result of its budget measure. The Labor Party should be going to every self-funded retiree in Australia and saying right up front, 'We believe you should be paying higher taxes on your saving.' That is their position. We had Senator Sherry, the person who really calls the shots on economic policy for the Labor Party, slinking around in the Senate estimates yesterday trying to do his best to undermine the savings rebate. They send the junior spokesman in here today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the person who had to get rid of the member for Werriwa because he was embarrassing him when the member for Werriwa was the Assistant Treasurer, to get up here and try to attack the savings rebate. On Sunday, he went on national television and said: I'm talking about the abandonment of the superannuation co-contribution, in favour of a little windfall tax break for those who don't need or deserve it. Every self-funded retiree in Australia today should know this: the Labor Party believes you do not deserve tax breaks on your savings. Every pensioner who saves should know this today: you do not need and you do not deserve a tax break. The BT statistical analysis, the research on this, said that, for those who were in the taxable income bracket of $5,400 to $10,000, 21 per cent of the benefit would go to them; for whose who were in the tax bracket between $10,000 and $20,000, 29.5 per cent of the benefit would go to them. So, 50 per cent of the benefit would go to people earning under $20,000, and the Labor Party says to them, wait for it, 'You don't need it and you don't deserve it.' Under $20,000, it would be 50 per cent of the benefit and the Labor Party says, 'You don't need it and you don't deserve it.' Who did the Labor Party think deserved tax breaks with the l-a-w tax cuts? Let me remind the House, if you had a $200,000 income, an l-a-w tax cut was going to give you $1,252 per annum. Those earning under $20,000, those the Labor Party thinks does not need or deserve tax breaks, under the l-a-w were going to get zero. Zero! Why? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has told us why. The Labor Party thought they did not need it or did not deserve it. At least you could say with the l-a-w tax cuts they practised what they preached. If you were under $20,000, you did not need or deserve anything and the Labor Party gave you nothing. Now they stand up here and pretend that they are interested in equity.",14
14,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, forget that! What about the co-contribution?",15
15,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Forget our l-a-w tax cuts, forget the tax cuts that were put into l-a-w by the Keating Labor party. Just remember this, if we'd only been in office for 14, 15 or 16 years, we would have got around to a cocontribution.' What was the co-contribution? The co-contribution was a tax increase. That is what it was. If you were on average weekly earnings, a three per cent compulsory contribution was a tax increase of $20 per week. The Labor Party plan was to take $20 per week out of your after tax income. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and you will have to speak to him because he does have a penchant for actually saying revealing things, when asked about the co-contribution at the National Press Club, said-and listen to this: As to the future of the co-contribution scheme under us, I can't possibly at this stage, even though our term of government is now only 18 months away again, anticipate what our position will be. He said that it depends on the revenue, that it depends on the election.",15
16,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, dear me! How unreasonable!",15
17,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Oh, dear me!' Listen to him.",15
18,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Come on; make your point.,15
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition!,15
20,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You'll be thanking God I have made this point in a moment, old son. Listen to this: It will also frankly depend on the saleability of the compulsory contributionread 'tax'from wage and salary earners. What we've all been noticing is an increasing degree of resistance to this, I think borne of a lot of uncertainty ... We've seen something of a falling away in support for the trade union movement for that part of the deal. Too right they were. Once it was explained to them that it was $20 out of their after tax income, you saw a huge falling away from the trade union movement. You saw an avalanche falling away from the trade union movement. A wonderful saving system this was! 'Give us $20 from your after tax income. We're from the government. We will give it back in the year 2045.' Then they produced these figures which were premised on somebody going into the work force in the year 2005 and being on average weekly earnings for 40 years thereafter, getting their money back in the year 2045. If you could not deliver l-a-w tax cuts before and after the 1993 election, who would have trusted you for 2045? That scheme was never introduced because it would never have worked. That scheme was never introduced because what it was was a tax rise. The scheme that was introduced was universal, was fair, was targeted, and they are the people who deserve it and need it, and the self-funded retirees are the people that are being supported by this government. NA",16
21,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! Before calling the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I advise members of the House that we have in the gallery this afternoon a delegation of Indonesian parliamentarians from the budget division, who are looking at the way we do things in Australia. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",16
22,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"We also have present a former distinguished member of this House, Mr Rod Atkinson, and I notice a visitor from the State of Victoria in Victor Perton. A very warm welcome to you all. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Savings Rebate",16
23,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are many questions that that reply generates, but let me ask the Treasurer just one. Can he name one full rate aged or service pensioner who will receive the savings tax rebate?",16
24,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, the pensioners who qualify for the rebate are people who have already had their tax liability reduced to zero. What is moreMr Gareth Evans-Name one!",16
25,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me make this point. Self-funded retirees who under the Labor Party were denied the rebate have been given it by this government.,16
26,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. In the course of the Treasurer's remarks in answer to the previous question, he talked about all the pensioners who were going to benefit from it. He used the expression 'pensioners'. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has now asked him to name one.",16
27,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has no point of order.,16
28,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, self-funded retirees who were denied the pensioner rebate under your government have been given it under ours.",16
29,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Come on; name one.,16
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition!,16
31,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-So let us nail the clever point. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Oh, but you are not giving tax cuts to people who do not pay tax.' Is that your clever point? Well, how do you give tax cuts to people who do not pay tax? What do you think we should do-give them a tax liability so we can refund them out of it? Do you think that is what we should do"" How many of them got tax cuts under the l-a-w? Government members-None!",16
32,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How many pensioners got a tax cut from the l-a-w'l Government members-None!,16
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,How many pensioners got a benefit from the co-contribution?,17
34,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members interjecting order. Mr Speaker, you have made rulings that members. I presume including ministers-should address their remarks through the chair. I do not believe the Treasurer",17
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat. The Treasurer was impeccable in the way in which he delivered his answer through the chair. However, I do remind all members in the House about my earlier comments about disorder in the House. Tax Reform",17
36,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I agree with you about the Treasurer's impeccable answer.",17
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Get on with the question.,17
38,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question seeks another impeccable answer from the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of recent investigations into the cash economy in Australia? What do these investigations reveal about: the size of the cash economy; measures required to deal with the cash economy; and how these measures would relate in any reform of Australia's tax system?,17
39,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and I thank him for his agreement with the Speaker about the Speaker's observations. In November 1996, the Commissioner of Taxation established a cash economy task force in light of perceptions in the community that non-compliance with taxation laws through the cash economy was escalating. Left unchallenged, these perceptions could undermine confidence in the integrity and the equity of the Australian taxation system. The report states that there is no official or reliable estimate of the size of the Australian cash economy or the revenue forgone. Academic studies estimate the cash economy at between 3.5 per cent and 13.4 per cent of GDP. Using 1995-96 figures as a base and an effective average tax rate of 23 per cent, these studies suggest the annual amount of income tax revenue forgone could be between $3.9 billion and $5.1 billion. The report identified a number of structural influences on attitudes towards the tax economy, including the lack of an audit trail, taxpayers complaining that there were few incentives for them to do the right thing by declaring cash payments, and a growing perception that the rewards to be gained from engaging in the cash economy outweighed the risks of getting caught. It is true that there is no tax system that is foolproof against tax avoidance and the cash economy; however, where the indirect tax base is broad tax is harder to avoid. Particularly with multi-stage, value added type taxes, it is harder to avoid completely. That is because if you drop out at the end of the process, tax has already been collected on the way through. What is more, there is an incentive to come back in at the end of the production process to receive rebates on those stages where there has already been a tax liability. A multi-stage, value added type arrangement on a broad base is certainly a measure which protects against the cash economy and which gives incentives to bring that into the tax net. When you see the level of the cash economy in Australia, it is unquestioned that no government could leave the level of that cash economy unchallenged. As the Australian Taxation Office indicated, to do so would be to undermine confidence in the integrity and equity of the Australian tax system. Let me assure the House that this government will put in place measures under current arrangements to encourage those transactions which are currently escaping the tax net to be picked up. We will carefully examine other options to ensure that our tax system is a system that makes the cash economy and avoidance of that nature much harder to engage in in the future. Taxation: Goods and Services Tax",17
40,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and follows on the answer just given by the Treasurer. Has the Prime Minister seen Tax Commissioner Carmody's statement, made on ABC radio this morning, making clear that a GST is not the answer to the problem of the cash or black economy? Does that confirm him in his 1995 commitment that 'a GST or anything resembling it is no longer coalition policy, nor will it be policy at any time in the future'? Does he still stand absolutely by that statement?",17
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has finally asked a question on this matter. It is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition should have asked a question about the consumption tax. As that very interesting tract on Australian politics the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, The end of certainty, by Paul Kelly revealed, when former Prime Minister, then Treasurer, Keating came out of the cabinet meeting before the preparation of the white paper for the tax summit, the only four people who supported him were then Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Susan Ryan, Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans. Since then, they have changed again and they will probably change back again. He is the chaliced professor of consistent inconsistency, this bloke.",18
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: my question was quite specifically about the Prime Minister's consistency on this, and it is a very simple question.",18
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister is using anecdotal evidence to support his answer.,18
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have put tax reform back on the agenda for public debate in Australia because we believe that to be in the interests of the strengthening and the development of the Australian economy. If you cared about the future of the Australian economy instead of trying to be a case study of inconsistency and a lack of political courage, you would join the debate. You may think you are scoring some transient political point with the questions you are asking, but the whole Australian community knows that we have an inadequate taxation system. If you were interested in the future of Australia, you would join the debate. I make no apology for the fact that reform of the Australian taxation system is back on the agenda of public debate in this country. I am proud of that and the coalition parties will engage it constructively. As usual, the Labor Party will engage it in a destructive, negative fashion. You are yesterday's men changing yesterday's taxation system. Economy: Housing",18
45,Mr TONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the current outlook for the Australian economy in the light of yesterday's positive building approval figures?,18
46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable in member for his question. There was a strong rise in total dwelling building approvals in April of 3.6 per cent compared with March. This reflected a large rise in approvals for private sector houses. Private sector housing approvals jumped 11 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, the largest monthly increase since July 1996. In trend terms, private building approvals have now increased for 16 consecutive months to be around 18.5 per cent above the trough of December 1995. This is consistent with the budget outlook of a recovery in dwelling investment over 1997. Whilst that was forecast to decline in 199697, it is forecast to rise in 1997-98. I make it clear that, as far as the government is concerned, we are not looking for a return to the boom-bust type of scenario which bedevilled the economy in the 1980s and 1990s but we are looking for a gradual pick-up in the housing sector, strengthening over the course of this year and, of course, being led by the reductions in home mortgage rates. The total monthly interest savingsMr Adams-Give us a bit of a prediction. Do you reckon it will go up?",18
47,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will tell you. This is not what I reckon; this is what it was. The total monthly interest payments on the average Australian mortgage since the coalition was elected have declined by $292.50. No doubt that will be welcomed by the people of Lyons, and they will be very glad that the coalition government was elected in March 1996. That is consistent with growth picking up over the course of the year. This has been put in place by responsible fiscal policy. It has been put in place by a government that was determined to address Australia's savings task and a government that was determined to show consistency in economic policy-unlike the opposition, which flips and flops from one position to another without any consistency or any credibility. Mr Gareth Evans-Weren't you listening to the last answer?",18
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was listening. I was listening to you, too. I was listening to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he said this on the tax debate: lfthe business community, the welfare community can get together to come up with some proposal that makes some kind of sense on all these fronts, that generally meets the concerns that people have traditionally had about the equity of any tax on consumption or expenditure, that also meets the needs of the larger economy, well, of course, we would have to have a look at any such proposal. That is what you said on 19 May 1997. Mr Gareth Evans-But they won't.",19
49,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you said one has not come forward so far. Mr Gareth Evans-Good. They won't.",19
50,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, stay tuned. The Leader of the Opposition came out that day and said, 'We don't want anybody engaging in debate in this country. We'd better squash the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.' And you squashed him very effectively. How would you feel if you were the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? Ninety-nine times out of 100 he has got it wrong, and the one time he gets it right he gets squashed by the leader. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: ... that also meets the needs of the larger economy, well, of course, we would have to have a look at any such proposal. And of course you would have to have a look at any such proposal. I call on the economically literate members of the Labor Party front bench-the member for Melbourne and the member for Werriwato stand up to the ACTU presidents, to stand up to the failed Keating ministers and to demand in the Labor PartyMr Hockey interjecting",19
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for North Sydney. The honourable member for North Sydney thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,19
52,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They should demand of the Labor Party that they have an open and honest debate on this issue and that they do not retreat. You have a Labor Party leadership which is in retreat on the economic front all over the place, back to the old rent and profit days. It is very important that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition follow his first initial reaction-the one time when he actually got it right-that he give full vent to that debate, that he listen to the arguments and that we have a decent, open argument in which the members of the Labor Party can participate. Economy: Business Competitiveness",19
53,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism aware that the Economist magazine recently rated the business environment of 58 countries and Australia, currently rated at 12th, is expected to decline to 16th in the period 1997 to the year 2001 ? Does the minister agree with this? If so, what will he do about it?",19
54,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did see the article concerned in the Economist and it raised some concern with me, because any Australian must be worried about any loss of competitiveness in this economy. It is because of that that the government has gone about the budgetary consolidation, gone about reform in the industrial relations area, gone about a review of the business programs within the industry department, gone about looking out for extra investments in Australia and gone about generally promoting Australia overseas in a way that the previous government never did to gain access to markets and increased exports to this country. That is not a bad record to start with. Union Blockade",19
55,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of this morning's blockade by the TWU of Sydney's central business district which prevented people getting to work? What does this action say about the attitude of some union officials?,19
56,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his question. I have seen these reports of a campaign being run by the TWU, which has been in part directed to the Reserve Bank in respect of the advice and the views that the Reserve Bank have expressed in respect of wages policy. The brief history of this is that the TWU had a claim in the commission just a few weeks ago which was soundly rejected by the commission. It was quite an important decision because, when you look at the operation of the old centralised industrial relations system, what too often happened is that a few big employers would do a deal with a few big unions, and they would then take the deal to the Industrial Relations Commission to have it endorsed and to foist it onto all the small business operators. It is particularly important in the transport industry, because in this particular deal for many of the smaller transport operators there were no productivity offsets or trade-offs. What it meant for regional Australia was simply another jack-up or hike-up in their costs. It was a very good decision for the Industrial Relations Commission, picking up the spirit of the new Workplace Relations Act to reject that decision and to say to the parties that, over and above the safety net, the system requires people to sit down and do deals which are relevant to particular enterprises. is no surprise that the TWU are very unhappy that their past practices have now been blocked by this decision of the commission. But it is also a fact that the beneficiaries of this are the Australian community across the hoard and, in particular, anybody associated ""vith the transport industry. I think the attitude of the TWU needs to be seen in light of the other big decision that we have had from the commission recently-that is, the decision on the safety net wage; the $10 living wage claim about which they recently brought down a decision. One of the important things about that decision is that commission gave a decision which was responsible in terms of the overaIl economic circumstances. What is particularly important about that, whether you are an employer or an employee, is that they handed down a decision which is consistent with getting inflation down. Quite frankly, that is in everybody's interests, as this country has long experienced inflation rates which have been too high. The people who suffer the most from that are not the people who are on high incomes who can afford the accountants to beat the problems of inflation; the people who suffer are the self-funded retirees, the pensioners, the low income workers and the people who would like to have a job but cannot get one because of the distorting effects of high inflation. The truth is that this reaction from the TWU is just a return to the past-a past which has given us relatively high inflation to our competitors and an economy which has not been performing at the better levels that it should. They want to revert to the past in terms of the policy that should be adoptednamely, a centralised system. Also, unfortunately, it is a return to the past of the sort of bullyboy tactics that we have seen from far too many unions in the past. The other point that needs to be made is that in this case-the TWU case-they actually had support from the ALP. My shadow opposite number was actually supporting the TWU in the TWU case and he was supporting It the ACTU's case in the living wage case, in which the commission-the independent umpire, which you claim to support-said, 'If we had given the ACTU claim which you supported, it would have led to higher inflation and lost job opportunities.' I think there is a clear national responsibility on both the government and the opposition to reject these bully tactics from the TWU. The government certainly condemns their tactics. When the shadow minister was asked about this, he essentially gave an equivocal response. I call on the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition to make it quite the clear that the federal Labor Party condemns these tactics of the TWU. Tariffs: Motor Vehicle Industry",20
57,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Further to your claim yesterday that Labor's car plan will not create jobs and exports, is the Prime Minister aware that the automotive industry has committed under Labor's plan to increase jobs by 10,000 and to treble exports? Why will you not stop the prevarication, Prime Minister, listen to your backbench, listen to Jeff Kennett and back that plan?",21
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very interested that the member for Hotham has raised the subject of tariffs again-this good old cheapjack opportunist from Hotham. In August 1991 this is what he had to say about car tariffs and jobs: The trade union movementthis is the member for Hotham, the man who asked me the question. .. saw protection, tariff walls, as somehow protecting jobs but all it did was to weaken the manufacturing capacity of the country ... Let me repeat that. In 1991 he said that high protection weakened the manufacturing capacity of Australia. Now he is saying the exact opposite. It is another example of saying one thing in government and a completely different thing in opposition-one thing for one audience and a completely different thing for another audience. It runs like a river through the policies of the Labor Party. Mr Crean-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The point of order relates to relevance. It refers to what the Prime Minister said yesterday, which has been clearly countered by the automotive industry. I am asking him to indicate why he is not prepared to support that, not go back to 1991. We are talking about 1997 and beyond.",21
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,21
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, we are not, we are talking about you. We are talking about your lack of consistency. If you do not want to talk about youMr Crean- Mr SPEAKER ",21
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If this is a frivolous point of orderMr Crean-It is not a frivolous point of order; it is a question of relevance. He has just indicated that he is responding about me, not about my question.",21
62,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,21
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-If the member for Hotham does not want me to talk about the member for Hotham, let me tum to the Leader of the Opposition. If he does not like 1991, let us fast forward to 1995-namely, 3 February 1995. I will quote what the Leader of the Opposition, the then minister for employment, I think, had to say about this. It is worth every member of the House listening to this as an example of their chronic inconsistency. He said: The gradual removal of the tariff walls ... have all contributed to Australia becoming a far more sophisticated economy. It has given us increased productivity. Listen to this; it gets even better. On 18 October 1995, he said: Labor could have turned its back on these challenges ... Isn't that brave? He continued: raised tariffs ... In doing so, Labor could have let Australians' living standards fall. That was the Leader of the Opposition as a minister in the Keating government. What you have done by your cheapjack opportunism on this issue is demonstrate how inconsistent you are. You have demonstrated again this chronic Labor disease. You say one thing in government for one audience and then you say ar-other thing in opposition for another audience. You say you are not going to privatise when you are in opposition; you privatise when you get into government. You say you are going to have a brave approach to industry protection in government; when you get into opposition, you run around making misleading promises to the workers of Australia. The workers of Australia know your form. The workers of Australia know you have got form. You have got very bad form. You let them down for 13 years and they are unlikely to be seduced by your chronic outbreak of inconsistency.",21
64,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the very important subject of trade. Is the minister aware of recent statements made by some in which they propose the use of non-tariff barriers in Australia's trade policy? Could the minister inform the House of what action the government is taking to encourage the reduction of non-tariff barriers in our region?,22
65,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I know he has a great deal of interest in the whole process of trade liberalisation. The government takes very seriously the challenge we have to try to drive down non-tariff barriers, not just tariff barriers, throughout our region. We do that at several levels-for instance, at the multilateral level through the World Trade Organisation, encouraging the ongoing review of the Uruguay Round. We are actively building support now for a new round of negotiations. Technical barriers to trade are being renegotiated this year and we will be renegotiating the subsidies agreement next year. We also work very hard to break down non-tariff barriers through APEC. Indeed, we do it at the subregional level as well. The AFT A-that is, the ASEAN Free Trade Area-and CER relationship is one that is directly addressing non-tariff barriers, as too is the creation of the new organisation, the Australia Indonesia Development Area, which will I think over time have a very good effect on bringing down non-tariff barriers. Of course, one of the fundamental issues is that in this country we cannot go out into the world and persuade others to reduce their non-tariff barriers if we ourselves are increassensible ing our non-tariff barriers. If we pursue that strategy, we will end up being blocked out of export markets. What I am singing is a tune that was familiar to people on the other side of the House. They chat amongst themselves because they think this all sounds very familiar. They might recall that just over a year ago they ran very much these same sorts of arguments, but on Saturday I was browsing through the Weekend Australian-you often Trade find interesting things and sometimes less than interesting things in that newspaperand, 10 and behold, I found a report of an interview with the Leader of the Opposition. This was an interview which was about, among other things, the Labor Party's trade policy. Was it the same trade policy you pursued in government? Was it the same trade policy we are pursuing? No, not at all. This is another example of the Labor Party abandoning old policies which were really new and modem policies and taking on, let us face it, even older policies. With regard to the Leader of the Opposition's interview with the Weekend Australian, the report states: He wants to look closely at greater use of non-tariff barriers ... with a view to supporting Austi·alian industry. Here we are as a country trying to get down non-tariff barriers around our region and around the world-assisted, I say ironically, by an opposition which is arguing for higher non-tariff barriers here in Australia. Who used to have policies like that? Arthur Calwell did. This is Arthur Calwell. Hawke and Keating were new Labor; you are old Labor. You are back there with Arthur Calwell. Frankly, all your policies will do is suck a retaliation from other countries, which will hurt our export industries and throw people out of jobs. But we all know why you are pursuing this so-called new industry trade policy. It is for exactly the same reason you are doing the same thing with tariffs: for votes. You spent 13 years in government pursuing an alternative policy, and so cheap are you that you have decided to abandon any semblance of policy in this country in a grubby scramble for votes. The only thing is, as the Prime Minister said, you have form in all of these areas and your real problem is that you are completely unbelievable. You have to go out and argue a case. It is not always popular to argue the case for reducing non-tariff barriers. It is not always easy to argue the case for keeping Australia engaged and building its engagement with the international community, but I would have thought that you, as a former minister in a government, would have had the decency to continue to do it in opposition, but you have not. You have sunk to levels that your own colleagues have now begun to criticise. We only need to be reminded now of the words of the member for Melbourne, who talked about you 'taking a trip down memory lane arm in arm with the member for Oxley'. In conclusion, let me quote the Australian Financial Review of 7 March, which described your approach as 'the contemptuous opportunism of the Labor Opposition' and states: Labor's new stance is an example of the destructive role an Opposition party can play in a populist lunge for votes ... World Trade Organisation",22
66,Mr SA WFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Acting Minister for Trade. I also refer to a report in the Australian Financial Review which states: Australia gave the US. an understanding, as part of the recent Howe leather deal, that it would not maintain any export facilitation measures like the export facilitation scheme after 2000. Can the minister give an assurance to this House that no such undertaking, understanding or informal agreement was given?",23
67,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am actually very happy to make it perfectly clear to the House that as a government there is not much point in our pursuing schemes in the years ahead which are going to be inconsistent with the World Trade Organisation rules. You over there have forgotten about the World Trade Organisation, haven't you, because the World Trade Organisation does not equal or fit consistently with your grubby vote-buying strategy. There is no point in putting in place policies which are just going to be taken to the WTO disputes settlement procedure in Geneva and knocked out. What is the point of doing that? The fact is you have lost all touch with international trade issues and with engagement with the region. and you are focusing entirely on your opinion polls. We will not be putting in place a scheme which is WTO inconsistent and, if you are arguing that we should, which seems to be the implication of your giggling over there, then it is perfectly clear that the Labor Party has simply lost touch with reality. Discrimination: League of Rights",23
68,Mr MCARTHUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Attorney-General. Given the Acting Attorney-General's responsibilities for the Racial Discrimination Act, has his attention been drawn to a widely circulated publication of the League of Rights offering support for the views of the member for Oxley, recommending that readers express their support for her views to MPs and providing an order form for audio material entitled 'The grand plan to Asianise Australia'? What is the government's reaction to this publication?",23
69,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question in relation to this publication. It has been brought to my attention. It is a publication entitled Intelligence survey of December. I noted with considerable concern that the League of Rights publication does quote extensively from a speech given in this House by the honourable member for Oxley. The publication does invite readers to offer their support for her personally and to send messages of support to their local members. Interestingly, they seem to assume that most members are men other than the member for Oxley. The publication goes on to invite readers to do their own research. It provides an order form for them to purchase a so-called research paper on tape. It is a tape by Mr Denis MCCormack entitled 'The grand plan to Asianise Australia'. It exhorts the readers 'to make use of this vital campaign tool while the opportunity lasts and bulk supplies of the tape are available on request from the address below'. It also solicits funds by way of a donation from those people who do send for the material. It is disturbing indeed to me that the League of Rights is providing a platform for the honourable member for Oxley. I am sure that members know that the views of this organisation are abhorrent and are certainly not supported by any right thinking people. The organisation promotes views which are racist, divisive and morally reprehensible. It is clear that all but the fringes of Australia's society would accept the views of that organisation. It is clear that the coalition rejects those views-and those views absolutely. I welcome the approving nods from members opposite. But I think it is incumbent on any politician or any political party who is publicly supported by the League of Rights to disassociate themselves from it and from its views. I challenge the honourable member to do that. Aboriginals: Stolen Children",23
70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. When parliaments, governors, judges and members of your own backbench are openly calling for you to make an apology to the stolen generation of Aboriginal children, when the acting leader of the National Party has said, 'I think the time will come,' when Chancellor Kohl apologised to Australia for the war atrocities of an earlier German generation and your Deputy Prime Minister called on the Emperor of Japan to do likewise, why won't you now assert leadership and apologise on behalf of the Australian nation for the stolen Aboriginal children in no less a way than your deputy has called on our regional trading partner to do?",24
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition has asked me this question before and perhaps he will continue to ask it. I have said before what my position is. My position remains that, along I am sure with all members of this House, I am profoundly sorry for past injustices of any section of the Australian community and in particular the indigenous community of Australia. I have stated my reasons and I stand by those reasons in relation to a formal national apology of the type that the Leader of the Opposition seeks, and that remains my position. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the depth of feeling that people have on this issue not restricted to one side of politics, is not restricted to one man or one woman or one particular group of people; but everybody has a different way of expressing their feelings on it. I do not, for the reasons that I stated yesterday, believe that a national apology in the terms sought by the Leader of the Opposition is appropriate. That remains my position. It also remains the position of the government. The position of the government will be that we will respond in a practical, effective and speedy fashion to the recommendations of the human rights commission. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of his great inconsistency on this issue. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when he was a member of the Keating government, he was-according to the former Attorney General of the Commonwealth, the former member for Dickson, Mr LAVARCH - the deputy chairman of the general policy committee that approved the submission to the High Court of Australia. You were the deputy chairman of a government committee that approved the submission that was lodged with the High Court of Australia in 1995. In that submission you argued and you traversed the very reasons, the very explanations, the very defences and the very propositions which you now choose to condemn me for advancing. You are again demonstrating your double standards and two-faced attitude on this issue. Chevron-Comaico Gas Pipeline",24
72,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, representing the Minister for Resources and Energy. Minister, what are the prospects for job creation in Queensland as a result of the proposed Chevron-Comalco gas pipeline development? Will this massive infrastructure project, building a direct gas link from Papua New Guinea to Gladstone, in my electorate of Hinkler, enjoy the support of the Commonwealth government?",24
73,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that all members will be interested in this and be glad to know that of course the Commonwealth government is very keen to see these sorts of exercises which offer so much to rural and regional Australians and allow for job opportunities in the regions to be given every chance of going ahead. The petroleum company Chevron has signed a collaborative work agreement with Comalco to examine the feasibility of a new $4 billion alumina refinery at Gladstone, in the member's electorate, in Queensland. This refinery would be a major downstream processing development t10wing from Chevron's proposal to build a pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Australia to supply gas to the industrial and domestic markets of Queensland. The pipeline would link Papua New Guinea's natural gas reserves to the burgeoning demand in North Queensland. The refinery would provide a major part the necessary base load demand required by Chevron if it is to proceed with the $2 billion pipeline that will bring gas from the north link with the national grid at Gladstone Townsville, creating a new era in industrial development in North Queensland. The jobs proposed alumina refinery at Gladstone would offer the very real prospect of thousands of jobs, would mean a major boost al, the state and the national economy and would mean t1ow-on effects to small businesGough ses in the region of Gladstone and in the electorate of Hinkler, with massive growth potential for a local service industry. The proposed pipeline with its supply of competitively priced gas along the northern coastline will provide a major impetus for the development of downstream processing projects in and around Townsville and the electorate of Herbert as well. I know that the memher for that scat is just as interested in this matter as the member for Hinkler. There is real potential for jobs and benefits, for example, through the connecting of two power stations to the gas linkages and also through the potential for the petrochemical industry. The govcrnment is very pleased to recognise the importance of the project and the people of Papua New Guinea, of course, will benefit as well with hundreds of millions dollars of construction, permanent jobs and $3 billion lift to the Papua New Guinea economy over the 30-year life of the project. It requires a high degree of cooperation and facilitation at all levels. It will be a major priority for the government and, in particular, for the project facilitation branch in my department. My colleague the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, announced the need for a full environment impact statement for Chevron's proposal, a cooperative process involving the Commonwealth, Queensland and Papua New Guinea governments. This news is most welcome. There has been another very useful development as well. At the close of the last sitting week, the Senate acted in the interests of the nation in implementing one of the government's long-awaited resources policy by of supporting government policy of ending export controls on all resource commodities, except uranium, removing such controls on to coal, mineral sands, liquid petroleum and, via pertinently, alumina. This represents the removal of a major hurdle to investment and in Australia, a major hurdle put there by Labor and never removed by Labor. No doubt it was something they were going to do in the to the region14th or 15th year. The export controls were put there by Whitlam way back in 1973. They were put there to give the government power to approve prices for resource commodities-a long forgotten objective-but left there by those opposite. It is useful to remind the House that, when travelling in Korea last year, my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick Parer, was told by the former chief purchasing officer for an iron and steel company there that, if Australia had not had those controls in place, 'We would be importing from Australia 70 or 80 per cent of our needs for our steel mills, rather than 50 per cent.' So if you want investment and jobs in rural and regional areas of Australia, it is the Liberal and the National parties that you come to, not to the Labor Party. Fair Trading",24
74,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed of to the Minister for Small Business and Cona sumer Affairs. I refer the minister to his answer in this place last Tuesday when he stated that the government would respond to the unanimous recommendations of the fair trading inquiry report within three months, a response repeated by the chairman of the inquiry, the honourable member for Bendigo, on The Small Business Show on Sunday, 1 June 1997. Can the minister inform the chairman of the inquiry and the House why then in the Weekend Australian on Saturday, 31 May 1997, he rejected calls for legislation to regulate the franchise sector in line with the inquiry's recommendations? Does this response within three days of the inquiry's report release indicate that the minister had no intention of listening to the concerns of small business and that that inquiry was, in fact, a waste of time?  Cunningham for his question. The interesting thing is that government policy is in regard to industry codes of conduct. I would like to remind the member exactly what the report recommended: finding a balance, if you look at the area of tenancy, uniform tenancy legislation, uniform retail tenancy code in regard to dispute resolution, security of tenure, lease assignment, disclosure and in regard to rents. Mr Martin-Franchises?  recommendation on franchising, the committee recommends that the franchising code of practice and other relevant codes should provide full disclosure of information. Mr Allan Morris-Under federal legislato tion.  3.1, the information relates to rental, outgoings, promotion, expenses, tenancy mix and redevelopment proposals to franchise, to sublet their premises from the franchisor. code should also provide for adequate representation of franchisees and association. My comments in the paper were not inconinformation. sistent with the report. We still industry code of conduct is the way to go. I mentioned in the House earlier in the week that we will respond within three months. might add that the commitment to hold this committee of inquiry was a government commitment at the time of the last election. Along with our other commitments, we have delivered. The committee met and reported. I set the committee up in May of last year. It reported 12 months later, unlike the Labor Party when they had a dash at this-and that is all it was, a dash at it-it took them two years, and 11 months to respond. It took one year for us and in three months we responded. We are about action, not about excuses like the other side.",25
75,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, is it not a fact that the recommendation was for a code, as you suggest, underpinned by legislation, and will you adopt those recommendations?",26
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is in order. I call the Minister.,26
77,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,'Underpinned by legislation' - did you get that?,26
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith does not need to proffer any advice.  government will consider all the aspects of this report and respond within three months. I have constantly said that I am in favour of industry codes of conduct. That is borne out by this report. The government will respond to the nature of making those codes of conduct work. Nursing Homes,26
79,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed the Minister for Family Services. Can the minister outline to the House why changes to Australia's nursing home sector are necessary now and not later? Ms Macklin-On a point of order, Mr Speaker. This question is out of order. The The bill is on the Notice Paper.",26
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is not designed to foreshadow debate; it is eliciting Minister, take heed of my combelieve that ments. Keep it very tight.",26
81,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed I will, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for Swan I for his very important question. The question goes right to the heart of what this government is seeking to do in a very important area of social policy in this country. The question also goes to the heart of what the opposition are all about-or should I say what they are not about. If the opposition and the shadow minister for do nothing but scare had their way on aged care, they would continue what they did for 13 years in government-that was absolutely nothing. They did absolutely nothing during their 13 years in government. We know about their commitment before the last election, because I have held up many times in this House the sum total of their policy on aged care. They did not even manage to fill one single page with their policy. That was their solution to aged care in this country-eight paragraphs. Their response to aged care was a failure. They cut funding on capital expenditure, whilst not allowing nursing homes to do what they had allowed hostels to do for 10 yearsthat is, to charge accommodation bonds. Furthermore, in the 1992-93 year, $45 million was available for nursing home capital purposes, but by 1995-96 the capital they had allocated to fix the nursing home problem was $10.7 million. That was a reduction in funding of 75 per cent. This is an opposition which, when in government, commissioned the Gregory report to find solutions to aged care. They knew what the problem was. They did nothing. They were a do-nothing government. They are a do-nothing opposition. Furthermore, for upgradingMs Macklin-Nothing to do with the bill!",26

86,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do not like it, do they? Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the rule against anticipation in standing order 144 which makes it clear that, while you are entitled to seek clarification and answer accordingly about some specific matter of a bill before the House, you are not entitled to anticipate discussion or debate. The minister is doing nothing but dealing with the substantive issues. Mr Speaker, I ask you to rule her out of order.",27
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank thew Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Mr Reith-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: the standing orders generally provide restrictions and conditions on the way in which questions are phrased. In respect of answers, the standing orders require that one principal criterion be met-that is, that the answer be relevant. This answer is relevant, and the minister is therefore in conformity with the rules.",27
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Highly relevant.,27
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am listening very carefully to the minister's response. While she is addressing the thrust of the question, she is not anticipating debate, but I do encourage her to wind up her answer.",27
90,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They hate to hear their very poor record from when they were in government. They hate to hear the truth. It is cutting them to the core. That is what it is doing-it is cutting them to the core. We have inherited a system that is falling down and is dilapidated. According to their own report-the report they commissioned when they were in government-we know that 40 per cent of residents share wards with four or more people in the room. We know that 11 per cent of facilities do not meet fire standards. We know that 15 per cent of facilities do not meet safety and health standards. Let me explain what this means to our most frail age. This means that too many buildings have serious structural deficiencies. This means hazards which jeopardise residents' safety and security. This means unsafe working conditions for staff. This means there are still too many old, institutional style buildings",27

95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am telling her she has. Resume your seat. Fair Trading,28
96,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer the minister to the case study of a small business outlined in the House of Representatives Industry, Science and Technology Committee report from the fair trading inquiry entitled Finding a balance. The case study was of Mr Neil Mitchell who purchased a Food Plus franchise in Melbourne from Polygon with his redundancy package. He subsequently found that the stated profit figures were grossly overinflated by 30 per cent and that he could barely break even. He had no alternative other than to sell his franchise business back to Polygon for a quarter of what he paid for it. Minister, what do you say to Mr Mitchell and others like him who have lost their life savings as a result of unsatisfactory franchising arrangements, given that you have already ruled out helping them with tough laws-such as specific franchising legislation, providing for compulsory registration of franchises and compliance with codes of practice-as unanimously recommended by the fair trading inquiry report at recommendation 3.3? Mr Martin Ferguson-Do you think it is a joke like your backbenchers, do you?",28
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Batman!  small business had to put up with from the union movement. What is not a joke is you guys rolling the unfair dismissal provisions that we put in place. That is not a joke. In regard to the question on franchising, for the entire period of the previous government, the Labor Party believed in an industry code of conduct. They set up the Franchising Code Council. They put some money towards it--in fact, they put $375,000 towards it in the last term of government. We in fact committed $648,000 in the first year of our government, with a commitment of another $152,000 next year. That is $800,000 over two years. Some taking funds away! I am interested that, finally, the Labor Party now seem to have changed their policy. That seems to be their policy now. They had a policy once; they now have a different policy. We gave a commitment to hold a committee of inquiry into this very important matter, covering a wide range: tenancy, franchising, the fuel area, and harsh and unconscionable conduct. It is a very wide-ranging report and the government will be responding to that report. We recognise that the small business sector is a very important sector of the Australian economy. We, unlike the opposition, will not sell out the small business sector. They have had 13 years of pain. Is this yet another example of the policy of the fourteenth year of the Labor Party? Green Corps",28
98,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. A number of young people in my electorate have an opportunity to benefit from the Commonwealth government's green corps initiative. What has been the success of green corps to date and how are young people benefiting through their involvement?",28
99,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for his question. I know how committed he is to achieving quality opportunities for young people in his electorate. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the initiative of, and the great support for the green corps from, the member for Warringah. It will be very good news to members of the House that next week another 36 green corps projects will be launched, providing a further 360 quality job and training opportunities for young people. There are already in existence around 60 projects involving some 600 young Australians. Every three months for the next two years the government will be announcing further quality projects within the green corps program.",28
100,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What you are doing with green corps is exactly the same as our scheme.,29
101,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This just shows the complete ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition. He likens green corps to the former government's LEAP program. It is clear that he has absolutely no idea about the nature of green corps, which is a quality training opportunity that is open to all young Australians, unemployed or not unemployed. It is for all young Australians who are committed to doing something in their lives to improve the Australian environment. Over the next three years there will be opportunities for some 3,500 young people to work on these quality environmental projects. The great difference between the programs is that the green corps program mobilises the idealism and the commitment of young Australians to do something for their environment as opposed to the Labor Party's desire to shuffle young people yet again through its short-term training schemes which lead nowhere. At the end of the green corps projects, all young participants are provided with $500, which will be a contribution to take them on to further education and training, building on the experience that they have learnt from during their participation in green corps. Mr Crean-What about a job?",29
102,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The two billion dollar man over there knows all about how to destroy the morale of young people. We all remember the jobs for young Australians conference in August 1995, which brought young people together. The main message coming out of that Gonference was: please do not continue to force us through the short-term training programs of the member for Hotham. What young people are looking for is quality training that mobilises their idealism. This is open to all young Australians prepared to make that commitment. It is very interesting to see what young people themselves have said about the green corps. Would any of your LEAP participants have said something like this, which I quote from the green corps newsletter: We feel we are making great progress with our work, which is very rewarding, and we are looking forward to other projects in which we will be involved over the coming months. Another young person said: And I think I speak for everyone when I say that we are all very excited and privileged to be part of Green Corps. Our projects have been challenging to say the least, but nothing feels better than kicking hack after a hard day's work. That is what young Australians are about. If you challenge young Australians they will respond. We are meeting the needs of young Australians. You are showing, by your attitude to green corps and by your attitude to the opportunities that long-term unemployed young people will get under the work for the dole system, that you are completely out of touch with the needs of young Australians today.",29

The Australian newspaper today includes an article which refers to threats against the preselection of Queensland Liberal members of the House of Representatives as part of the internal brawling in the lead-up to the election of the President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. The article clearly identifies pressure placed on members that would limit the free performance of their duties as members of parliament.",30
120,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIVILEGE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If this is a matter of privilege, as it purports to be, it should have been raised at the beginning of proceedings and not after question time. Mr Leo MCLeay-You used to do it all the time.",30

Mr BEViS-The article in question quotes three members of the House of Representatives and the President of the Liberal Party in Queensland.

That was the practice when the Leader of the House (Mr Reith)-as Manager of Opposition Business-did this and when the former member for Kooyong raised a very similar matter in 1991. When the current Leader of the House raised a not dissimilar issue in March 1995, he was given ample opportunity to outline the matter. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order understanding order 100: again, if the member disagrees with you, he must do it formally.",31

135,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"You have, for my benefit, adequately outlined the problem. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While the right honourable member for New England is right in terms of raising a question about the timing of such a matter, we would support your ruling, which was to allow the member to continue to put it. It is true, as the member was attempting to say, that when we were in opposition we did raise similar matters. It is clear to all members that this is a well-known political stunt, but it is not a question that the member is putting to you. He is entitled to place the circumstances of privilege before the House. I have no doubt what the final resolution of it will be, but believe he is entitled to put it.",31
136,Mr BEVIS,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the Leader of the House for his comments. The article refers to three members of the House of Representatives in these terms: Ms Kay Elson, MP for Forde, south of Brisbane, said a number of MPs had received ""disturbing"" threats. It then refers to Mr Graeme MCDougall, MP for the Brisbane seat of Griffith, and quotes him as saying that he had heard of threats being made, something which he said was intolerable. It quoted him further: ""I don't think it is necessary and I wish to hell it would stop,"" Finally, it quotes the member for Lilley, Elizabeth Grace, MP, saying she described it as: ""if you don't do this, this is what will happen-type of thing"". ""It can be a bit scary if someone came and put the heavies on you for something like that"". Mr Speaker, I refer you to page 702 of House of Representatives Practice in which the citation is made of the House of Commons consideration of this issue. I wish to conclude by reading the authority there from the House of Commons Committee of Privileges: It is a breach of privilege to take or threaten action which is not merely calculated to affect the Member's course of action in Parliament, but is of a kind against which it is absolutely necessary that Members should be protected if they are to discharge their duties as such independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward. I refer the issue to you and seek leave to table a copy of the article from today's Australian, which clearly demonstrates an attempt to inhibit the free performance of the duties of members of the House of Representatives. Leave granted.",31
137,Mr HOWARD,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, in recognition of the fact that you will examine the point raised by the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), when you are examining it I wonder if your research could include an examination of the fate of a similar matter of privilege I raised in June 1991 when the former member for Blaxland was challenging I do the former member for Wills for the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. I referred to the behaviour of Bill Ludwig, the head of the AWU in Queensland, who was threatening the preselections of a few Labor members who were threatening to desert Hawke and vote for Keating. You ought to have a look at what happened to that, and then you will have a very good idea of what you ought to do with this. At least the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) has the grace to smile. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I know the Prime Minister wants to raise the standards, but he is now reflecting on a vote of the House and should be ashamed of himself.",31

141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"A total of 160 copies were purchased on members' behalf. The stocks of the publication in question were exhausted far more quickly than we had anticipated-on the basis of one per member and a slight increase in that number for specific office holders, including the Prime Minister's office and the office of the Leader of the Opposition. We have taken the names of all of those members who have made representations to liS, and we have received today additional copies. I think the problem is in the process of being totally overcome. However, if there are some members who have not yet received their copy, then I think you will find a copy available in the Bills and Papers Office this afternoon. The publication is also going to be republished, as I understand it, and members will be aware of their entitlements under the AGPS card system that we all have.

143,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for d;-cussion, namely: The need for the government to develop a clear and rational policy in respect of small business. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",32
144,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cunningham) (3.34 p.m.)Last week in this place I raised with the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  respect of the approach being adopted by his government to small business. I did so because both he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) were espousing that they were the only true party to represent the interests of this section of the community. It is a sector that has been championed on many occasions. Indeed, the Prime Minister consistently-this is the only thing he is consistent on-in almost every answer to every question in this place refers in some way to small business. What the small business constituency wants is not platitudes. What the small business constituency wants is some real understanding of their needs and a reflection by the government of the day to meet those needs. I am sure you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as I think you were in the chair during the MPI debate at that stage, that last week the Yellow Pages Small Business Index was released. It indicated that the confidence of proprietors in small business has reached its lowest level since August of 1993 and that more than 80 per cent of small businesses see the economy in recession or at a standstill. It was interesting to see that, of that 80 per cent of people in small business who thought the economy was going nowhere, they still wanted to see this government respond to their needs. On the very night that that survey was released, the minister went on the 7.30 Report and talked of the issues confronting small business. The presenter, Kerry O'Brien, put to him a question about confidence levels amongst the small business community. He said: . . . according to the people who have done this survey and their own reading of it, confidence levels are at their lowest for ... four years. The minister responded, 'Well, Kerry, I'm very confident about small business.' He went on to say: ... I'm confident that by rnidto late year, this year, that we will see a substantial rebound in the confidence and sales levels for small business. In that interview with Kerry O'Brien, he further said: If you look at some of the other surveys, they are all very positive. This survey is measuring the past. Small business, by its very nature, must look to the opportunities of the future. Of course the presenter, Kerry O'Brien, interrupted and said: I'm sorry. This is measuring the expectations for small business for the next 12 months. That's looking to the future ... Quite clearly, this is exactly what needs to happen. We need to look to the future. The issues affecting small business have been documented and have also been distorted. On the Lateline program of Tuesday, 27 May-the same night that the small business survey came out-an interview was conducted between Paul Lyneham and a number of spokespeople on behalf of small business. The first of these was Mr Rob Bastian, whom the Prime Minister likes to quote regularly. Mr Bastian, when asked about the government's best efforts, said: I think that most small firms really still regard the Government as a bit of a burden still. Lyneham replied, 'But this government promises so much to them,' to which Mr Bastian said: Absolutely. The Government's position on that is that their largess has not yet trickled down. I hope they're right, but the figures that you're looking at there unequivocally say that the sector doesn't feel that that's the case at the moment. Further on, Mr Lyneham put to Dr Marsden, who had done the survey on behalf of the Yellow Pages Small Business Index: ... what are the big issues worrying small business? It was interesting to listen to the list that was given. Dr Marsden replied: Very simple, lack of work, lack of sales, cashflow, consumer confidence and competition from big business. It is quite interesting that those were the issues fronting small business, as outlined in the small business survey by Yellow Pages, because they lead so nicely into the report which was brought down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology late last month. It was entitled Finding a balance and dea t with fair trading in our country. It is interesting that, when you read-and it is not a pun because the chairman was Mr Reid, the honourable member for Bendigothe findings of that inquiry, you find some very interesting comments. In fact, they refute just what the minister was saying today and they also refute what the Prime Minister has been talking about in the past in respect of small business. Mr Reid, who chaired an inquiry which brought down a unanimous report, with one small section that the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) dissented on, was quoted in that unanimous report as follows: This report will come as a shock to many people who have not been following the Fair Trading inquiry closely over the past year. The alarming business conduct issues brought to light in the Fair Trading inquiry have prompted the Committee to make strong recommendations about the need for legislative action on the part of the Commonwealth to provide a viable trading environment for small business. Minister, that was the very point that we asked you about in question time today-that is, having some legislative base for small business so that they had some confidence in you. It was not what you were talking about but a legislative base. Again, I quote the chairman, the member for Bendigo, who said: In particular, the Committee is recommending that a Uniform Retail Tenancy Code be underpinned in the Trade Practices Act, that specific franchising legislation be enacted by the Commonwealth,and I thought that was the question asked todayand that part IV A of the Trade Practices Act be strengthened to outlaw unfair conduct. Small business is not afraid of strong competition, and it is not asking to be protected from a tough trading environment. Small business simply wants a chance to survive. The Committee's recommendations would give small business that opportunity. The Committee's recommendations are not about ""protecting"" small business; they are about setting some ground rules for what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in Australia. Evidence to the Fair Trading inquiry suggested that small business has been ""pushed around"" by powerful big businesses for too long and, in fact, many of the witnesses giving evidence to the inquiry had already ""gone to the wall"". The Committee believes that the strong action it is recommending in Finding a balance is the main hope for the sustained success of small business in Australia. This was a view supported by the member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro) in this place who said that small business tenants needed uniformity and security and 'stand-over tactics and codes of secrecy are not on'. Having the background of a very successful small business in Queensland, I think she would know what it is about. She is supporting what the committee had to say as well. At the time this report was released, many other people came out in support of it. I go no further than what people from the Motor Trades Association of Australia and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia said. For example, the MTAA executive director said: Reforming Australia's fair trading laws will bring more significant employment benefits for small business than the Howard Government's planned blanket exemption from unfair dismissal laws. He went on to say: But for the present, our concerns are not so much about taxation or industrial arrangements. The concern is how you can get structural change and adjustment in the market which is about fairness ... so we can grow employment. That was also reflected by Mr Stephen Greenwood from the Pharmacy Guild, who said: ... the Government's priority should be protecting fairness in the commercial dealings of small business. Exactly, Minister. That is everything that has been said in this report. There were some people who were opposed to it, there is no doubt about that. Those who were opposed to it were, first, Treasury. Surprise, surprise! They are against it. In their submission to the inquiry, they 'cautioned against'-that is a bit of code--changes to the Trade Practices Act prohibiting 'harsh and oppressive conduct'. The minister is against it. He has already said previously that he is opposed to it. There was somebody else who was against it too, or at least expressed a view. Mr Lee-Peter MCGauran?",33
145,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, not the Minister for Science and Technology but a Mr CadoganCowper, the ACT Liberal Vice-President, who quit the party in disgust. An article in the Canberra Times of 30 May stated: The Liberal Party's ACT vice-president resigned yesterday, saying he was totally disillusioned with the Government of Prime Minister John Howard. Mr Lee-What was his position?",35
146,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He was the Vice-President of the ACT branch. Why did he do that? Because, he said: ... Mr Howard had not honoured his commitment to ensure that smaller Australian companies could win a substantial share of Commonwealth computer business outsourced to the private sector. He went on to be quoted as saying: They've stopped listening. They don't have an industry policy. They are putting representatives of big business on committees to investigate small business. I've got to the position where I can no longer tell people the Liberal Party is the best option. We really don't know what we're doing. That was said by the former Vice-President of the Liberal Party in the ACT. So what was Minister Prosser's position? This report on fair trading was tabled on Monday, 26 May. The Yellow Pages Small Business Index came out on Tuesday, 27 May. In a question that was put to the minister as to what their response would be, the minister said on behalf of the government: ... we will respond in three months. That is the usual response because, under the standing orders, the government must respond in the House to committee reports in three months, and that was his response. On Wednesday, 28 May, the member for Bendigo, who was the chairman of the committee of inquiry, recorded the Small Business Show. He went on that program, and is quoted many times as saying: . . . I was quite encouraged by the Minister for Small Business, Geoff Prosser's response in the House yest-rday where he said that the Government would respond within three months. He said it twice on that Small Business program. He said that he was encouraged. What happened then? That Small Business program went to air on the Sunday-it is recorded on the Wednesday and goes to air on the Sunday. On Saturday in the Australian an article headed 'No to franchise law call', states:  rejected calls yesterday by a parliamentary inquiry for legislation to regulate the franchise sector. Mr Lee-Cut the committee off at the knees.",35
147,Mr MARTIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In other words, cut the committee off at the knees--cut his own people off at the knees-as a result of the fact that when you look through all of this, he is saying that you do not need any sort of legislative underpinning. But interestingly, his friend and colleague, who was the chairman of the committee, said just the opposite. In the Canberra Times on 31 May, Mr Reid is quoted as saying that the committee: ... looked at the voluntary codes in the franchising industrywhich is a position the minister supportsand there was a recognition that the voluntary code did not appear to have worked. The Canberra Times report further states: He said, ""if it had been one isolated state or area it would not have weighed so heavily"" but the requirement for legislation ""was the overall view of the committee and reflected the evidence."" It reflected the evidence, Minister. Here you are, the minister for small business, saying that you do not believe what this committee has done. You stand up here in question time and say, 'We set it up.' You say, 'I personally took an involvement in this. I set this committee of inquiry up so they could tell me what small business needs.' They have. They have come along and said, 'What we want is protection from the big end of town.' They have said that they want codes underpinned by legislation. They have said that they want franchisees protected by a legislative base. This afternoon the minister stood up in this place and tried to say that that was not what it was about at all, that that was not what the report actually brought down. My friend and colleague the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins- certainly showed that that was the case. At the end of the day there is no doubt that this government has got to adopt the inquiry's recommendation and it must do it soon. cCim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, introduced a private member's bill to deal with unfair trading and conduct in the retail area. It is a part of what this committee recommended and should be adopted. We, as usual, on this side of the parliament have done the work for the government. The bill is drafted. It is sitting on the table of this place. All it requires is for this minister to get a bit of guts behind him, to go to the cabinet room and to say to the Prime Minister, who supposedly is the champion of small business, 'Look, Prime Minister, the Labor Party has done it again. Here is a bill that is going to look after them, that is going to protect their interests. Why don't we put it in? We'll say it's ours, but really we know it is the Labor Party's. We will put it in here.' This will do exactly what the fair trading committee recommended. It is exactly what the small business constituency wants. Minister, we would probably even say that you did a good job. Maybe that is going a bit far. But we might say to you, Minister, that if you did what is required by the small business constituency, we would probably go out and say, 'He picked up our ideas. That's fine. He is not capable of coming up with a few himself, but at least he did the right thing.' We have done that. We on this side of the parliament have already released some small business policy principles. Two of those are completely relevant to this committee's inquiry: stamp out unfair trading and protect the small against the large. The Labor Party has thought about these issues. The minister will get up in here and use the same lines as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) uses and so on. But our bill was in the place in 1995 and did not proceed because the parliament was dissolved. We have reintroduced a private member's bill on two occasions in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, and it should be proceeded with. At the end of the day, we on this side of the House are not afraid to say that the recommendations contained in this unanimous report should be adopted and that legislative underpinning of codes should be put in place. Minister, you have got a chance today to stand up in this place and to tell the people of Australia and the small business constituency that you will do just that. (Time expired)  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (3.49 p.m.)-The matter of public importance proposed by the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) reads: The need for the government to develop a clear and rational policy in respect of small business. In the whole presentation of the member, we did not hear any debate about policy. We did not hear anything about the opposition's policy in this particular area. So I think it is important that we do focus on policy-policy for small business. Let us retlect on what happened for the last 13 years-not much. I am pleased that the shadow minister is starting to talk about policy, because I remind him about Labor's policy with regard to small business. After having none for 13 years and trying to discover small business, in the 15th year of Labor, as the newspaper headline in the Age on Monday, 24 February states, 'Labor Party reviews platform'. Did they have a small business policy in that? No, they did not. There was no mention of small business. Mr Martin-When was that?  you did not know anything about small business. Mr Martin-I"" d only had the job for eight weeks.  shadow minister is now saying that their policy on small business is finally coming, after 14 years. It is a case of 'One day we'll get it.' Now they are talking about policy and policy debate. The policy they now have is a tlimsy one-pager. That is their policy as opposed to the coalition's policy-a very comprehensive policy with regard to small business, a very important area. If we are going to analyse and debate small business policy-that is what the matter of public importance is about-at least we recognise the absolute importance of small business to the Australian economy. Let's look at policy. Labor policy on 18 September 1985 was to whack small business with a capital gains tax. They then thought, in the Beddall report, that perhaps they went a bit too far and that they might try to modify it. Did they do that? No, they did not. Our policy was to remove capital gains tax. That has been delivered. What is the Labor Party's policy? We do not know. Are they now going to tum around and reimpose capital gains tax on small business, or have they finally realised that the capital gains was a major disincentive to small business? Our capital gains tax provision was for complete rollover, $5 million every five years. More importantly, the capital gains tax provision that we have put in place is that a capital gains tax on retirement will allow small business to build up their business as a retirement nest egg. When they sell that small business each partner or each shareholder will be able to take $500,000 capital gains tax free. That is $1 million tax free on retirement. What is the Labor Party's stance on that? Are they going to block that? Are they going to put a policy back in place to say, 'We won't deliver on those things.' What is the Labor Party's policy on capital gains tax? Are the Labor Party going to recognise that the capital gains tax that they introduced on 18 September 1985 was a severe disincentive to small business? Let us look at interest rates. I noted with interest that the member for Cunningham mentioned the Yellow Pages survey in passing. One of the indexes of the Yellow Pages report is that of cash flow and interest rates. More importantly, what happened to interest rates? Interest rates under the Labor Party went through the roof. In December 1995, the prime rate was 20.5 per cent, plus penalty loading. Most small businesses were paying 24 and 25 per cent for their money. It sent thousands of them to the wall. What did the Labor Party do? They sat by and did nothing. What is the Labor Party's policy on interest rates now? Did they do anything to try to get the budget and the economy under control? No. They did nothing. They just kept spending. They kept spending-borrowing money to fund their deficits. What happened? It put upward pressure on interest rates and inflation blew out. Did they care about small business? Not on your life. Our policy is lower interest rates and lower inflation, and to get the budget under control. We are moving a $10.3 billion budget deficit-it will be a $12 billion turnaround-to a $1.6 billion budget surplus in our first term of government and next year we will repay $5 billion worth of Commonwealth debt on the way through. This is the first time in a decade tax the Commonwealth has not had to borrow to fund its budget deficit. What is the Labor Party's policy? We are debating policy. What is your policy on interest rates? To put them back up again? To run budget deficits? I hope not, because it is small businesses that pay the prIce. Let us look at the area of unfair dismissals and industrial relations reform. What is our policy? It is stated in our policy document and stated in the Bell report. Our policy is to remove the unfair dismissal provisions from small business-that burden which scared the living daylights out of small business, which prevented them from wanting to put people on. The stories of what had been happening to small business under the unfair dismissal laws are legendary. Our policy is to remove that burden. What is the Labor Party's policy in the area of unfair dismissal provisions? To put them back on, to put back the Brereton unfair dismissal legislation. They want to land small business with unfair dismissal provisions. We propose to remove the unfair dismissal provisions. What did Labor do? They said, 'We are going to whack it back to small business.' Where is your heart? After 13 years of pain, why on earth do you give small business what you are giving them? The shadow minister mentioned the Yellow Pages Small Business Index. One of the relevant measurements in the Yellow Pages Small Business Index is the thinking about federal government policies. The survey asked: do you believe their policies are supportive of small business or are working against small business? The percentage of people who felt the policies were working against small business, from May 1993 to February 1996 under a federal Labor government-the pain index of what Labor did to small business-was 60 per cent. It is right up under Labor; it is right down under us. There has been a vast improvement. It is interesting that the opposition is now keen to quote the Yellow Pages Small Business Index. One of their own, Ted Lindsay, described in November 1995Mr Martin-He's gone.  your colleagues went because they ignored the calls of small business. Ted Lindsay described the Yellow Pages index as 'fatally flawed' and 'politically biased'. Labor Party member Ted Lindsay said, 'We say on the record that this report has no integrity.' I wouldn't say that about those sorts of reports. I just point out that the pain index for small business under Labor was running at 60 per cent. There has been a vast improvement under the initiatives we have put forward, particularly for small business. I hope your colleague who follows me in the debate wants to debate the matter you put on the record; that is, small business policy-something we have got that you have not got. Let us look at the areas this government has already acted on. The provisional tax uplift factor under Labor was eight per cent. Under us it is six per cent. Savings to small business total $180 million. The initiatives we have put in place under our modem apprenticeship training recognise the importance of training, particularly to small business. We made a commitment to no new taxes and no tax increases. What did Labor do in the taxes area? Labor increased sales tax massively-from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and from 20 per cent to 22 per cent in the general rate. They whacked up sales tax. They whacked up fuel excise. All of those input costs to small business are a severe burden. I have already mentioned the important initiatives we have taken in regard to the budget deficit. My colleague wanted to debate-he did not in any sensible way-our initiatives in the whole area of fair trading. We have a policy, and we are working towards it. We are committed to the small business sector. Labor do not have a policy. They have finally decided to find small business, to discover small business after 13 years. Then they talk about their 14th yearwhat they would have done had they been elected for another term. The Liberal-National coalition is committed to reducing government imposts on small business. We have certainly done that with the Bell task force report and its 62 recommendations, with improving the incentives for small business to expand and employ, and with providing an economic environment which will enhance business growth, profits, employment--efforts to invest for our future. We have a plan for small business and we are working towards that. Importantly, in the area of capital gains tax, I mentioned that we have taken initiatives in those sorts of areas, and they are very positive initiatives. But I tum now to the point that the member for Cunningham raised. Our policy 'A new deal for small business', under the heading 'Fair trading' - at least it was in our policy-states: A number of small and medium businesses continue to express concern over commercial relationships, where a lack of disclosure or special business to business relationships leave them compromised and forced into unreasonable agreements. A Liberal/National Coalition government is committed to ensuring that the Trade Practices Act responds to the needs of the small business sector. Mr Martin-So you will adopt this recommendation.  the implementation of the House of Representatives inquiry. They have just reported in that particular area. We are implementing our policy in this area. The policy goes on to say that there is a need for a greater reliability on flexible industry specific codes of practice. The report talks about the codes of practice: A Coalition government will review existing selfregulatory Codes of Practice, to ensure that these Codes are conducive to the development of the relevant industry sector. Policy; action. Under Labor, no policy; no action for 13 years. Small business have paid dearly under the Labor Party. I can liken what has happened to the Labor Party to a particular action. One thing that stuck in my mind in regard to a statement of the Labor Party, particularly by one of their former leaders, was the J-curve. I guess their policies are a bit like the J-curve. Small business prospects are up here. They have been on the slide down during the whole 13 years of the Labor government. In 1993 we were on the bottom of the J-curve. One hopes that the Labor Party have finally found the importance of small business and they would hope for an upturn. The Labor Party has done what can only be described as a U-turn. Like most of their other policy areas, the policies that they had in government are not the policies that they have in opposition. Now it would seem that they have a different policy mix. It is very interesting that the Labor Party is now saying that there is a need for better policy in the franchising area particularly. One could ask what the Labor Party was doing during the whole period that they were in government. Mr Beddall-You stay and listen, and I will tell you.  franchising agreement bill 1986. There is the draft bill. There were two drafts; they proposed it. Did they implement it when they had the chance? No, they did not implement the bill. Mr Beddall interjecting",35

150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The member for Cunningham.  small business policy here. I am delighted that the opposition has finally found the importance of small business and the need for relevant policies for small business. Do not give us what you gave us in the past. Do not give us more taxes and charges. Do not give us more red tape. Do not give us higher interest rates. We are going to give them lower taxes and charges, less red tape, lower interest rates and a better and more predictable economy to operate in. This debate should be about small business policy. I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about our small business policy. I am waiting for a sensible debate on the opposition's small business policy. (Time expired)",39
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Cunningham enjoys an asset of considerable goodwill from the occupants of this chair. I would advise him not to trespass and overdraw his facility.,39
152,Mr BEDDALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is with great delight that I take part in this debate. I hope the Minister for Small Business  my contribution because I will answer all the questions that he put forward in his speech. This government's commitment to the small business sector now faces its largest test. The time for rhetoric is over. The time for the minister's arrogance is over. This minister, who is bereft of ideas, now has someone else's ideas that form a plan for action-a blueprint for the Australian small business sector. How the government responds to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Finding a balance: toward fair trading in Australia will be a watershed in policy development for Australian small business. The Howard government cannot not hide behind its rhetoric. The government cannot hide behind this minister. The committee went out and spoke to small businesses-real small businesses-right across Australia. The report contains small businesses wishes and their aspirations. It also helped them vent their frustration at being treated as second-class citizens by this government. How has this minister responded so far? What has he done to date? The signs are not good. On many of the crucial recommendations, the minister has already shown that he thinks he knows better-and that is why he is leaving the chamber, as usual-than those members of the committee who have spent nearly 12 months talking to small business. This minister cannot spend 12 minutes in the chamber. Let me remind this arrogant and out of touch minister that every single coalition member on the committee endorsed every recommendation of this report. It is not just small business that he is going to ignore but also members of his own party room. He does that at his own peril. On the recommendations concerning franchising, the minister has already rejected out of hand the key recommendation. The recommendation is for national franchising legislation. The minister is caught up in simplistic rhetoric about self-regulation. There is no doubt that the advice of federal Treasury would be for self-regulation. Many of the bureaucrats in the minister's own department would support this view-so would many franchisors, but not small business and certainly not franchisees. There are those who always believe that self-regulation is best, even though there is no evidence to support this point of view. Selfregulation is a bit like the flat earth society and economic rationalism. They are theories that have had their day. In evidence to the committee, officers of the federal Treasury supported the old line of self-regulation. When Treasury was asked to produce an example-just one example--of where selfregulation was working, they failed to identify even one. When pushed on the matter, they informed the committee that they would respond at a later date. Many months later we are still waiting for this shining example of how self-regulation is working. The previous report of the same committee into small business-often called, due to the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the Beddall report-recommended franchising legislation in 1990. The absent minister for small business asked why we did not do that. Let me answer his question, even though he is not here. When I became minister for small business in the Hawke government, I listened to many of the same people now advising this minister. I accepted the point that we should give self-regulation a trial go. I established the Franchising Code Council with representatives from franchisors, franchisees and service providers. It was under the chairmanship of Robert Fitzgerald, a distinguished Australian, who now heads up the Australian Council of Social Service. Clearly, the time for self-regulation has passed. It has failed and, in particular, it has failed small business. Under this minister all we have had on behalf of franchisees is the collapse of the Franchising Council. Franchisees are now without any form of protection, even under the voluntary franchising code. The council collapsed in December 1996 and here we are in June 1997 still waiting for ' Mr Inertia', the minister for small business, to take some action. We keep hearing rumours-and they are only rumours-that an announcement on franchising is imminent. However, I think we are in for more disappointment again. The rumours are that this minister is again looking for a quick fix. The rumours are that he is going to put the fox in charge of the chicken coop-that is, he is going to hand over administrative control of the franchising code to the Franchisors Association. The Franchisors Association is a good representative body, but it represents franchisors, certainly not franchisees. If these rumours prove to be correct, this minister would have let down his own backbench, his government and thousands of franchisees. Franchisees urgently need an independent arbitrator to protect them in the event of a dispute with their franchisors. Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of the committee, you heard evidence to this effect right throughout those hearings. The minister is often quoted as saying that the previous government took too long and failed to enact all the recommendations of the previous report into small business. I welcome this opportunity to respond to those allegations. This is based on the minister's theory that if you say something that is not true often enough, people will start to believe you. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every single recommendation of the previous report was acted upon. I was charged with the responsibility of presenting the whole of government approach to the parliament. We will see how this minister stacks up in less than three months time. The minister is fond of bragging about how his government has introduced capital gains tax rollover. This, of course, was a recommendation of the Beddall report, something the minister often quotes himself. But he often claims that we failed to respond to the recommendation as a government. This is demonstrably untrue. Let me set the record straight for honourable members, particularly those on the other side. The Hawke government responded to the recommendation on the capital gains tax rollover by the introduction of a 50 per cent exemption from taxation on the goodwill component on the sale of a small business. This was widely welcomed at the time by the small business community. But what these claims by the minister for small business clearly indicate is that he is without ideas of his own. The centrepoint of his small business achievement to date is the capital gains tax rollover. This is an idea which did not originate from him or any other member of the coalition. He knows where the idea came from, of course, but he will not give any credit for it. All we hear from this minister-and we heard it again for 15 minutes today-is simplistic rhetoric, things like 'Small business is the engine room of the economy', 'Get the government off the back of small business,' and 'Cut red tape'. All these things are true and they represent the feelings of small business. But the question what is this minister going to do for small business? The answer is nothing. This minister is going to be judged at the end of his term. At the end of the small business minister's term will people say, 'Thanks to Geoff Prosser, we are better off'? Of course, the answer to that question will be no. There are many issues that affect small business. The crucial issue is one of size. Small business is expected to compete with large business as if they are of equal economic weight. This, of course, is an absolute nonsense. The recommendations relating to changes to part IV A of the Trade Practices Act are extremely sensible recommendations. The most crucial thing for small business is how it interacts with big business. In many ways small business can be likened to the consumer. Under Australian law, however, consumers have more rights to protection from small business than small business has from protecting them from big business. In less than three months time, the minister for small business will respond to the fair trading inquiry. The one area where small business will judge this government more than any other is in relation to its response to the recommendations in this report, in particular, how it responds to the recommendations relating to unfair conduct. We hear a lot from this government about unfair dismissal. Let me put them on notice. They will be hearing a lot from this opposition about unfair conduct. The committee received overwhelming evidence that there was systematic unfair conduct undertaken by many large businesses in Australia against small business. The recommendations to change the Trade Practices Act are difficult to undertake and will take political courage. Many business organisations which have both large and small businesses as members will be found wanting in their support for any change. Mr MCMullan-Like the ACC!.",39
153,Mr BEDDALL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, like the ACC!. Let us make it clear that the minister for small business is here to protect small business. That is his job. He is the only voice that is: small business has in the government. Unfortunately, with this minister, it is a very quiet voice. The previous government changed the Trade Practices Act to enable the Trade Practices Commission, now the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to take representative action on behalf of small business. That the ACCC has not done so is a great disappointment to me and many members of the small business community. I say to the minister for small business that there is no greater test than how he acts on behalf of small business in relation to fair trading. It has been a long process for this House committee. Under two governments it has brought down recommendations in relation to unfair trading. The Hawke government, to its credit, tried to tackle these issues-without overwhelming success, and I am the first to admit that. What this report now does is get the blueprint to the next stage. It is a major test of the Howard government to see whether it can continue the reform process on behalf of small business.",41
154,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It amuses me no end that the Labor Party should bring a debate like this into the House this afternoon, given the record that it has in the small business area. I listened with interest to the selective quoting from the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and, of course, recently from the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), who was apologising to this House for the fact that they got it wrong and, given some time, they could have got it right and they did not quite get around to making the changes that were necessaryMr Beddall-I didn't say that at all.",42
155,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am just telling you what you did say. I was listening. The fact is that the member for Rankin made a great play of the fact that he was going to reply to statements made by the Minister for Small Busi then set forth on a speech that obviously someone had prepared for him. The fact is that small business was left in disarray by the previous Labor government. The group left on the other side is a result of the massacre that occurred in March 1996. There is no doubt that all those people who represent small business are on this two-thirds of the House. When we look at the members of the Labor Party that remain and we look past the union apparatchiks, we see that not very many are left. There is no doubt that a reaction is coming from the opposition as to why they lost the election and why they were decimated to such an extent. The minister has gone through some of these points, and I apologise if I repeat some of them, but my memory serves me very well about the extremely high interest rates that occurred during the period of the Labor government, particularly during the recession that we had to have. Interest rates went through the roof. In many instances, as the minister said, they got as high as 22, 23 and 25 per cent. Small business, like farming, is charged penalty interest rates because they are seen as a risk area. Many of those businesses are still suffering today. They tried to stay in business by restructuring their debt, pushing it out a little further, but they are still paying the penalty from those interest rates that we had to have during that period of Labor Party management of the economy. If we wanted to look very closely at it, it is very convenient now to forget the real reasons for the demise in the economy and the real reasons that there is such a struggle to get back to some base again. There is an old saying in the country that some of those opposite should listen to: one swallow does not make a summer. And 14 months certainly does not make a term of a government. There will be a turnaround in the economy and, if you look very closely, you will see it is starting to show already in the small business sector. During the election campaign the industrial relations area was hammered home to me by small businesses right across the board, especially in relation to the Brereton unfair dismissal laws. Opposition members have absolutely no idea how those laws absolutely terrorised small business. Given the legal system, it was cheaper for these people to just payout rather than fight the system. They would payout $3,000 or $4,000 that they did not have rather than go through a legal system that would cost them a lot more. It got to the stage where people would not employ, and I have to say that is still the case at present. Small business is still wary of two things: borrowing, because of the interest rates they were caught with during the 1980s; and employing people, because of the industrial relations laws that the Labor Party put in place. To this day that is having a very big effect on small business and confidence in small business. This government has certainly tried to do something about that. The member for Rankin can talk about there being some moves by this government. Fine; I cannot complain about that. If he thought of it or if his committee had some idea of it, why wasn't it implemented? The coalition promised they would do something about this, and they have done it. They have looked at the red tape area. As anyone who has been in politics for any time at all would know, reports that come through to governments are not always accepted universally. Obviously the previous government did not adopt all the recommendations of the reports given to it. The government will look very closely, I am sure, at the report that has been put through and at those areas that can help small business. because there is no doubt, as the government has often said, it is a very important part of our system. The member for Cunningham and the member for Rankin talked at length about unfair practices within business. I do not think there is anything new about that. I have been around small business for some time, and I recall very well the sweetheart deals-the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) referred to some of this today-that were done with big business and unions some years ago. I think that should be looked at very closely in the history of Australia-that is, some of the deals that were done between the now members of the Labor Party in this place when they were the heads of the ACTU and some of the big businesses in Australia. Don't kid yourselves that they were designed to help small business. They certainly were not. There will of course always be healthy competition between these two areas, and the previous government embraced competition policy. They set up the legislation that was necessary to try to manage that competition policy. If there are unfair practices, there are places that people can go to. The member for Rankin says he is disappointed with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Fine. That is the area that any complaint should go to. I would be the first to support any complaint along those lines. But it is very interesting how people are able to adjust when systems change. I often remember what happened some years ago now with the centralisation of the baking area in Australia. I recall that in my area in particular many bakeries closed down overr.ight because of the economies of scale and the transport systems that were available whereby central baking could be done and compete at a very competitive price. But what has happened? In the intervening years hot bread shops have popped up. Niches develop within the system. I am pretty sure that, given a chance, we will find this with the competition between small business and big business at present. Yes, in the interim there is a problem because small business sees that big business is getting an advantage, but a niche market always pops up. Those people with entrepreneurial skills in small business will be into those markets and make sure that they develop them. That is an area that obviously small business will be keen to explore, and they certainly will. Just let me explore another area which I think is important, particularly in the areas that the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) and I represent: the building industry, which is a very important part of the north coast area in particular. One of the big problems in that small business sector started in the apprenticeship system during the Whitlam era. The government of the day decided to pay full wages to apprentices. That was the start of the problems with the apprenticeship system in Australia, because they did not take into account the fact that business just could not carry that burden. Of course, following on from that we have certainly had some problems with the technology available and the fact that people have to go off on block release. But this government has done something about that for those small businesses. It has brought in the national apprenticeship scheme. It is looking at a training scheme. It is trying to overcome those problems and help small business, because these particular skilled labourers that have to be trained are obviously vital to that small business sector and the training is obviously vital to those young Australians. I am sure that is an important part of the whole system that this government is trying to address, a system which I believe the former government just ignored. It was in the toohard basket and they never really addressed that training system which is so vital in Australia to see that we have skilled labour. Mr Martin-That's not true. It's what Working Nation is all about.",42
156,Mr CA USLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Cunningham can protest, but at least I am bringing forward some debate on this subject. I am not just quoting from second-hand information that someone might have sprouted in the media. We are trying to get to some of the basics of the problems in this particular small business area. I think you will find that the economy itself is undoubtedly a problem in small business, but it is starting to tum the comer. Confidence will return. Confidence is an intangible thing. Confidence will return when the economy starts to improve and that willMs Macklin-We are waiting for it to return.",44
157,Mr CAUSLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have the member for Jagajaga interjecting--coming again from the unions, coming from that closed shop environment. She is one of those who used to protest and try to put penalties on small business, not take them off. I am sure you will have some scare tactics that you will take out there and cry about. But the fact is that small business is being protected by this government. (Time expired)",44

160,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following Finance minutes-Finance minutes on reports No. 33S-Accrual accounting-A cultural change; Finance minutes on report No. 341Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: Toward greater transparency and accountability; Finance minutes on report No. 342The administration of specific purpose payments: A focus on outcomes; Finance minutes on report No. 344-A continuing focus on accountability: Review of Auditor-General's reports 1993-94 and 1994-95, and Finance minutes on report No. 345-An advisory report on the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1996 and the Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996. I seek leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the minutes. Leave granted.",46
161,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"These Finance minutes represent the responses from various Commonwealth agencies to five recent reports from the JCPA. The first two Finance minutes relate to reports Nos 338 and 341, in which the committee made recommendations relating to the introduction of accrual reporting, accrual accounting and accrual budgeting in government agencies. Report 341 also recommended that the Commonwealth prepare whole of government financial reports and that legislation be enacted to establish a fiscal reporting framework binding on the Commonwealth. The Finance minutes reveal that these reports have had a great impact. Many of the issues examined by the JCPA were taken up by the National Commission of Audit, the recommendations of which supported the JCPA's conclusions. In response, the government has committed itself to implementing an integrated, accrual based financial management framework incorporating accrual accounting, accrual budgeting and accrual based whole of government reporting. The government has also agreed that there is a need for legislation to establish a fiscal reporting framework, binding on the Commonwealth departments, hence the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, which itself has been reviewed by the JCPA. The government's timetable for the implementation of the full accruals framework is broadly consistent with the JCPA's recommendations, and I welcome advice we have recently received from the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) that he intends to consult with parliament, through the JCPA, in relation to the development of the details of the framework. As the principal user of the financial and performance reports produced by the executive, it is appropriate that the parlialegislation. ment have considerable input into the development of the new accountability documentation required in the new accrual environment. The third Finance minute responds to the recommendations of JCPA report 342 into the administration of specific purpose payments, also known as SPPs. Most of the JCPA's recommendations highlight areas of better or best practice in SPP administration. They are important recommendations which should be considered by all agencies involved in SPP administration. I am pleased to note that the responses in this Finance minute are generally supportive of the JCPA's recommendations and most agencies have responded positively to most recommendations. The fourth Finance minute relates to JCPA report 344, which reviewed the reports of the Auditor-General for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 financial years. The JCPA has a statutory responsibility to review all of the reports of the Auditor-General. This is a particularly important function of the JCPA. This Finance minute contains positive responses to the committee's recommendations, with the exception of the final recommendation, which has been rejected by the Department of Defence. The recommendation calls on the department to ensure that major procurement contracts contain provisions which enable the Auditor-General to gain sufficient access to contractor records to allow the costs associated with quotes, claims and contract amendments to be verified. This issue has been a matter of dispute between the JCPA and the Department of Defence for some time now, having had its origins in the JCPA's review of an audit report on the new submarine project. It has arisen again in the JCPA's current review of the JORN project. Defence's experience with the JORN prime contractor-which happens to be the Telstra Corporation-has done nothing to instil confidence in me that Defence's current procurement requirements are adequate to protect the Commonwealth's interests. The final minute is a partial response to JCPA report 345, an advisory report on the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 and related The committee is waiting with keen interest for the government's response to the policy recommendations in this report and in the second report in the series, report 348, on the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996. I commend these Finance minutes to the House. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1997-98 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 June, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment. That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that the Budget: (1) does nothing for jobs-the nation's most overwhelming current economic and social problem; (2) squanders, by breaking the promise to introduce superannuation co-contributions, an historic opportunity to build a massive new private savings pool, and does so in a way that undercuts decent retirement incomes for lower and middle income earners; (3) continues the assault on families, the elderly and the needy; (4) contains many mindless and counter-productive cuts affecting the quality and decency of life in Australia, and harming our international reputation; (5) for all its cuts and destructive impact, meet the exaggerated expectations the Government had created as to the size of its deficit reduction achievements and projected future surpluses; and (6) has been characterised by even the Government's best friends as lacking in shape, direction and vision.""",46
162,Mr OCONNOR,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"As I stated when my speech was interrupted by the adjournment debate last night, I was very disappointed and disgusted that the government yesterday gagged the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and myself from debating the car industry and the Senate resolution which supports Labor's car plan. As I mentioned yesterday evening in debate, a high-powered delegation of community leaders from Geelong is in this House today, led by the Mayor of the City of Greater Geelong, Councillor Gerry Smith, to present the case of the Geelong community on the future of the car industry in the region. The city's submission basically endorses the central plank of Labor's car plan, which has been tabled in this House, that is, a proposal for a pause in tariff reductions at 15 per cent from the year 2000 to 2005. Once again, I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the floor of this House to meet with this delegation over the next couple of days so that he can hear first-hand the concerns of a region that depends very much on the car industry for its economic survival. It is clear from question time yesterday that the Prime Minister does not have that understanding, and he must meet with the delegation over the next couple of days to hear the point of view of the Geelong community on what is a very critical issue to them. It is clear that the second Howard budget does nothing to create regional jobs. But the cruelest hoax of all in this budget is the government's savings initiative which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) touted so much in question time today. An ordinary worker in Geelong with $5,000 worth of savings-and there would not be too many low income workers in Geelong with that level of savings-will pocket a miserly 72c a week from Mr Costello's budget. To get the top $450 rebate, the worker would have to have saved did not in the region of $60,000, and I can assure honourable members opposite that in my community of Geelong there would not be too many workers who would have that level of savings. That is not all there is to the Treasurer's arrogant decei t. Having promised Geelong workers that he would deliver on the $3.7 billion of tax cuts converted to superannuation contributions under Labor, he has broken that promise and, in the process, has drastically reduced Geelong workers' final superannuation payout. For example, a worker who is 35 years of age and earning about $695 per week would, under Labor's policy, retire at 65 on $280,000. However, without the matching personal contribution and co-contribution from the federal government, the final benefit to the worker will be in the order of $170,000. That is a loss to a worker in Geelong of $110,000. So much for the Treasurer's concern for the battlers of Corio. Working families in my electorate will also be badly affected by cuts to child care. Many working families in my electorate need their second income to survive in an economic sense and they really rely on quality child care at an affordable price. Last year the federal government cut $500 million off the child-care budget and this year its budget cuts will amount to $321,000. These increases from 1 April have seen some working families pay $20 to $40 more for their child care in Geelong, and there is worse to come. In the area of education, Deakin University and its students have been badly affected by the cuts, not only in the 1996 budget, but in this budget as well. Deakin University, with the abolition of a further 4,700 undergraduate 'I> places, through the higher education Commonwealth industry places scheme, will be badly affected by this particular budget. Further, there are vocational education cuts of $70 million, 21,000 fewer university placesof course, the overall university funding cuts in 1996 were $400 million-and there is another one per cent lopped off in this particular budget. I am very concerned about how this budget will affect pensioners and families. Many in Geelong will be badly hit by the Howard government's new drug tax. The government is destined to save $561 million over the next four years but, of course, that simply means that pensioners and families in Geelong will be paying more for their prescription fees. I note also that the government has made cuts to the immigration and multicultural affairs budget, especially the grant-in-aid budget where the cut of $1.4 million may well impact on the Geelong migrant community and the Migrant Resources Centre in my electorate. Of course, the government has reduced money for the anti-racism campaign. Application fees for new citizens in Geelong who have been signing up for Australian citizenship have gone up 50 per cent this year. (Time expired)",48
163,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"One thing you can guarantee in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98, in today's earlier debate on the matter of public importance and in last week's and yesterday's debate on this bill is that one characteristic will stick out-that is, the carp and the hypocrisy that all speakers on the other side consistently come up with. This is the 10th appropriation debate in which I have participated. My first speech in this place in 1988 was on that year's Appropriation Bill. All I can say to those opposite and, in particular, to the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) is that, if you take as a measure of response to a budget the number of complaints and inquiries coming into electorate offices, this particular budget has reaffirmed what thinking Australians would say abou,t it-that is, it is a very sound et. In fact in my electorate office in the first 10 days after the budget was announced, we had about a dozen complaints-cum-inquiries and, of those, about 25 per cent were on funding for the ABC. So irrespective of what we hear from the other side, a lot of what is said is pure rhetoric. What I want to do in the very short time available to me this afternoon is to cover some of the facts rather than some of the fiction. I do not think we need go any further to find some fiction than refer to the opposition's amendment to the motion moved by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). The opposition's amendment makes the point that this particular budget: (3) continues the assault on families, the elderly and the needy; (4) contains many mindless and counter-productive cutsAnd it goes on. All of this is just rhetorical rubbish. What we really need to do in this place-and more importantly out there in electorate land-is deal with the facts. As I have said before, I think this is a very sound budget. It is a 'steady as she goes' budget. It has some very major initiatives, irrespective of what the previous speaker, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), said about savings. There are some important initiatives in terms of savings; small business; the heritage fund; the Federation Fund, about which I will have a little more to say; rural and regional Australia, about which I want to say a reasonable amount; aged care; child care; disabilities; and health care. Going back to the inquiries to my office, prior to the budget clearly there was a politically motivated campaign in terms of child care. I am sure my electorate office was not the only one where that sort of campaign was mounted. It was pretty clear that it was politically motivated. It was hypothetical in its approach, and I am sure it was some sort of national lobby being generated. The interesting thing is that, when the budget was finally brought down and the detail of the child-care initiatives emerged, a lot of what was being said amounted to budg- almost nothing. People were coming to my electorate office particularly concerned about outside school hours care, but a lot of what they were saying was clearly ideologically driven rather than factually driven. The other lobby prior to the budget was a very responsible lobby, and that lobby was in terms of the disabled. In my area, we had a march by a number of people who were lobbying for increases in funds for the disabled, and I did receive a delegation into my office. As it turned out, there were very substantial initiatives in the budget in this area-whether it was in terms of the carers, the disabled themselves or residential assistance. I do not think anybody should be concerned about that sort of responsible appeal to elected representatives like myself. But when it comes to the lobbying about child care, which was clearly politically motivated, I think we need to draw the line. There has been carping from the other side-whether it be from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) in terms of job generation, whether it be from the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in terms of industry policy or, in particular, whether it be from the member for J agajaga (Ms Macklin)-the very aptly nicknamed 'shadow minister for scaring'-in terms of social security, the aged and family services. I think she has been given an appropriate nickname. She really needs to deal with the facts rather than the fiction. I hope the honourable member for Hunter, when he stands after I sit, will address some of these issues with a little less rhetoric and a bit more factual acceptance of what is in the budget. I have only a very short time tonight to speak. I understand that members on this side may only speak for something like 10 or 12 minutes and, in the spirit of giving a lot of my colleagues the opportunity to speak to the budget papers, I just want to make some very brief comments in two areas. The first area is the linchpin for the whole budget and it goes to pages 2 and 3 of the Treasurer's statement and the budget speech he gave on 13 May, in which he said: Tonight I can report we have made very significant progress. And tonight I announce measures to consolidate and extend that progress, measures which can secure our objective to put the Commonwealth budget into surplus in this our first term of Government. Our consolidated measures turned around a $10.3 billion Labor deficit in 1995-96 and they lay out a path to a Coalition surplus in 1998-99. He went on: The Government's active programme of privatisation-one third of the capital of Telstra-is not being done to balance the books. Aside from establishing the National Heritage Trust that money is going to retire debt. I think that is a point that needs to be brought home. He continued: That money will free future Australians from debt and the debt servicing costs that threatened to choke them. He went on: From the time we came to office to the year 200001 the Commonwealth's net debt to GDP ratio will almost have on current forecasts. And then importantly he went on to say: Mr Speaker, for the second time in a row, I announce that this will be done with no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax rate, no lift in the petrol excise. In fact, for the second Budget in a row, tonight I will announce tax reductions. If the member for Hunter wants to react to those, all well and good. We would welcome it. But they are facts, not mindless rhetoric. In terms of rural and regional Australia, which I represent, there are a wide range of issues relating to the National Heritage Trust. In my case, it involves the origins of the Murray-Darling system and landcare initiatives. Moving on to economic development, it involves road expenditure of about $800 million. I want to thank Minister Sharp in particular for money allocated to the Oakey bypass, which has just commenced-and I drove the first pile in that project only a few weeks ago-the Westbrook bypass, which is well advanced, and the initial study into the Toowoomba bypass which, although not funded, could amount to something like $250 million around the tum of the century. At least we have a feasibility under way. There is the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund and more money in terms of business for quarantine inspection services. With regard to work for the dole, in my electorate we have had two Green Corps projects already approved. As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) said earlier today, more are to be announced in the near future. I leave the member for Hunter in particular with a message: please, when you respond, address the issues and come up with facts rather than fiction.",49
164,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Hunter) (4.47 p.m.}--I rise to support the amendment put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), which serves so well to highlight the inadequacies of this budget. I do sympathise with the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). He is a decent fellow and a fellow for whom I have a great deal of respect. I sympathise that he and others on that side are struggling to fill their 20 minutes on this Appropriation Bill. They are struggling to find anything good to say about John Howard's second budget. I do sympathise because I would not like to be sitting on that side House attempting to defend the indefensible. There is some advantage in speaking on this bill almost one month after the Treasurer (Mr Costello) brought down his second budget. That fact was brought home to me this morning when I picked up the newspapers and read that the government's most senior economic adviser had conceded in Senate estimates yesterday that the centrepiece of the government's budget, the savings rebate, may not increase national savings at all. When asked whether the initiative's $2 billion cost could exceed any increase in savings by individuals, the Secretary to the Treasury answered, 'Yes, there is that risk.' Mr Evans also conceded the obvious; that is, that the full rebate will go to some who have not increased their savings at all. Indeed, more than likely it go to many who, over the course of that financial year period, will actually decrease their level of savings. Among those are the people on the Business Review Weekly richest 200 list. Let me assure you there will not be too many people in my electorate-and in the electorate of the member for Groom-who will benefit from John Howard's centrepiece or from this farce which is the savings rebate. But there will be plenty in my electorate and plenty in the electorates of National Party members and Liberals representing regional seats who will be disadvantaged by the government's rebate. That is because the rebate is to be funded by ripping off some $3.7 billion in superannuation co-contributions from ordinary working Australians. My advice to those on the other side is this: if you are looking for the savings rebate within the budget papers, you should look under 'savings initiatives', not because this is a savings initiative but because this initiative is a saving to the government's budget bottom line. This is the scheme that saves the government billions of dollars in terms of its decision to renege on that superannuation copayment. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) pointed out in his contribution to this debate, in the member for Bennelong, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), we have the of the Sheriff of Nottingham: a man taking $3.7 billion from working Australians and giving it to those capable of holding up to $60,000 in the bank and more. The Howard government's second budget can best be described as a fizzer. It does nothing for national savings, it does nothing for economic growth, it does nothing for business confidence and it does nothing for consumer confidence. It certainly fails to give the Australian community a reason for feeling relaxed and comfortable. But worse of all is the fact that it does nothing to address this country's most pressing economic and social problem: unemployment. Prior to last year's federal election, both the Prime Minister and the now Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, will the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), travelled the width and breadth of this nation, screaming blue murder about the rate of unemployment in this country. On the topic of youth unemployment, they were particularly vocal. I can still see the member for Goldstein on the 6 o'clock news every night bleating over and over again about the levels of youth unemployment in this nation. The fact is that there are now more unemployed young Australians in this country than there were when the member for Goldstein was on our television screens. That is an indisputable fact.",51
165,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,He is still on our television screens.,52
166,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"We do not see him on the television too often these days. I know he is a bit concerned that he was given the junior ministry, and I suppose he is licking his wounds in that respect, but we do not see him on the 6 o'clock news any longer-not in the way we did before the election-because unemployment in this country is trending up. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out in his response to the budget, in Labor's last year in office, 176,000 new jobs were created. That was our contribution. In John Howard's first year in office, employment grew by just 89,000. In Labor's last year, male full-time employment grew by 57,000. In the Prime Minister's first year, it fell by 12,600. In Labor's last year, long-term unemployment fell by 45,000. In the Prime Minister's first year, it rose by 44,000. That is the legacy of the Prime Minister's first year in office. No wonder we no longer see the member for Goldstein on our television screens every night. In his early months in office, when unemployment was growing strongly, the Prime Minister told us all we should wait until he had been in government for 12 months before casting judgment on his performance on the unemployment front. That 12 months is now well and truly up; we are still waiting and 800,000 unemployed Australians are still waiting. What hope can we now hold for an improvement in the nation's unemployment rate as a result of this budget? What can we - xpect this year, following this budget and after seeing the results of a $1.8 billion cut to the former Labor government's labour market programs in last year's budget? What can we expect this year, after seeing so many jobs slashed by this Prime Minister in the public sector? Even on the government's own optimistic forecasts, GDP growth over the next 12 months will not be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down in this country. So what is the Prime Minister's plan of attack on the unemployment front? As the member for Groom has just pointed out, he is going to set up a couple of slush funds-but, as none of them are funded over the next 12 months, they will have absolutely nil effect on unemployment in this country over the next 12 months-and he is going to spend $17 million on a work for the dole scheme. The member for Groom had the audacity to put forward that scheme as a solution to the unemployment problems in this country. I do not have a problem with the principles underpinning that scheme. There is nothing wrong with them. We had those programs under the former Labor government but, under those programs, we had certain protections for workers. We guaranteed them certain wage levels. More importantly, we gave them training, they were covered by compensation and they were guaranteed all the protections that ordinary Australian workers enjoy. Our schemes did involve some compulsion. The only difference was that we did not have the stupidity to put the populist title 'work for the dole' in brackets after the legislation. Never have I seen a more blatant attempt to score cheap votes than that attempt. It is absolutely disgraceful. In the 1997-98 budget, the Howard government will spend almost $1 billion less on unemployment schemes than the former Labor government planned to spend in the same financial year. They want to tell us that their answer to the problem of unemployment in this nation is their measly work for the dole scheme-$17 million! Even at the rate the former Labor government was spending money, there were not enough places to go around, so how many places are going to be available under the work for the dole scheme for unemployed Australians? It is a farce. In his 30-minute budget speech-his most important speech of the year-the Treasurer referred to unemployment-the most pressing social and economic problem facing this nation-on just four occasions. But it gets worse than that. On three of those occasions, he mentioned it in the context of the discredited work for the dole scheme. On the fourth occasion, it was to inform us that the government did not believe that unemployment would get any better than eight per cent over the coming year. That was the fourth occasion on which the Treasurer mentioned the word 'unemployed' or 'unemployment'. What a disappointment. Such is the commitment of this government to the unemployed in this country. There does exist a very simple way to bring unemployment down in this country: create economic growth and get it above four per cent. But this government, despite the fact that other OECD nations are enjoying strong economic growth, is bringing this economy to a halt. Let me tum to another issue we used to hear a great deal about when the member for Bennelong was in opposition. I tum to the so called gap between the rich and the poor, or the haves and the have-nots. It is an issue economics editor for the Sydney Morning Herald Ross Gittins found worthy of mention in an article of his in August 1996. He was commenting on the release of the Australian Statistician's study into the effects of government benefits and taxes on household incomes. Gittins pointed out that whether the gap between the haves and the have-nots narrows or gets greater depends basically on two things. The first is the distribution of private incomes. Obviously some households will enjoy greater private incomes than others. Some households will enjoy higher wages and salaries or other forms of income, such as returns on investment. That is fairly straightforward, of course. The other thing which significantly impacts upon the gap between the haves and the havenots is the government's budget. While the government has only a limited opportunity to influence the distribution of private incomes-it has less scope now that it has abdicated its role in wages policy-there certainly exists much scope for the government to influence the distribution of wealth in this country through the budgetary process. Some interesting results came out of the Statistician's report into this area. He took country's 6.6 million households and divided them into five groups based on gross income, that is, private income plus cash benefits from government. He then calculated each group's average private income and final incomefinal income being private income plus cash and non-cash benefits less tax. The first thing his exercise found was that the distribution of private income is highly unequal. That will come as a surprise to noone. The poorest 20 per cent of households had an average private income of just $13 per week, while the richest 20 per cent enjoyed $1,586 each week in private income. Thankfully, final income was much less unequal. The poorest 20 per cent received $233 per week, and the richest 20 per cent of families recei ved $1,231 per week. So we can see that the budget process has an effect. The government's budget can help to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. But the question is this: what part of the budget process has the greatest impact on achieving a narrowing of that gap? It is easy to jump to conclusions and suggest that it is the progressive taxation system which has the greatest impact. But that is not true. While the income taxation system is progressive, its benefits are countered by the various regressive taxes and charges which exist at the state level. We must conclude that it is the spending side of the budget which makes the greatest contribution toward redistributing wealth. Indeed, the Statistician has estimated that government cash benefits reduce that gap by some 25 per cent. The explanation for that is that most government cash benefits are means tested these days. I want to tum to the most important result of the Statistician's study, which is that noncash benefits reduce the inequality by some 20 per cent. That is almost as much as cash benefits. Why? It is because they are not means tested and non-cash benefits-which, according to the Statistician, are worth an average of $135 each week to all families right across the board-are worth much more to low income earners than to high income families; $135 means a lot more to a low the income family than to a high income family. In the case of low income earners, it represents 74 per cent of their income compared with just five per cent for the top 20 per cent of households. That brings me to my main point: what are non-cash benefits? They are health, housing, welfare and child-care infrastructure. They are all the things that the government once again has slashed in this budget. So where does that leave John Howard's battlers? I say it leaves them in very big trouble indeed. If anyone on the other side doubts the conclusions of what I have just said and seeks validity, they need only refer to a report commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service titled the Evaluation of the distributional impact of the 1996 budget on Australian households. That study confirms what I have been saying: the reduction in services, particularly in rural and regional Australia, increases the inequality in this country-in other words, it widens the gap between the rich and the poor. If ACOSS undertake another study, into the 1997-98 Howard budget, I am sure they will find that the result is even worse. Why? Because the savings rebate will have an even greater impact. We have the sheriff's cash grab of $3.7 billion from working Australians. Whom will that be going to? It will be going to those in this country who need it least. Again, this is a budget which adversely impacts on rural and regional Australia most. Once again I issue a plea to National Party members in this place to get in here and start sticking up for that natural constituency they purport to represent. They should come in here and defend their child-care centres, their CES and DSS offices and the aged and the unemployed in their communities. I commend the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the House.",52
167,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, this will be a great speech and",54
168,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,You are not under threat from anybody.,54
169,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Indeed, and I thank the Chief Government Whip for that assurance. I was in my office listening to opposition members participating in this debate. Coincidentally, I happened to be flipping through a book called The Doubleday Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form. The book actually opened at the definition of hypocrisy. Amongst the words used for hypocrisy are pretence, dissembling, affectation, sham, - uplicity, fakery, dissimulation, sanctimony, Imposture, counterfeit, feigning and insincerity. When I look at all those words, which have an equivalent meaning to hypocrisy, I am reminded of the contribution made not only by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) but in particular by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), who had the hide and the audacity to move an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No.1), currently before the chamber. One would have t-ought that the Deputy Leader of the OppositIOn was someone who was not part of the failed Keating government. He has the gall to suggest that this government wishes to do absolutely nothing with respect to jobs. The honourable member for Hunter spoke about unemployment, how important it is to solve that problem. This government aims to remedy the unemployment problem by creating real long-term jobs by growing the economy growing and getting it moving. The Labor Party gave Australia the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression-ll.2 per cent in December 1992. At no time since the Great Depression did the unemployment rate rise to 11 per cent and above until Labor came to power. Labor's recession that we 'had to have' destroyed 310,000 jobs. I am sick and tired of hearing those opposite chant about the virtues of the failed Working Nation program. Working Nation churned the unemployed but offered them no real hope. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs evaluation of Working Nation revealed that the share of labour market assistance going to long-term unemployed people actually fell. It also went on to say that there was an eight per cent reduction in job referrals for the long-term unemployed. The evaluation concluded: This leaves the Job Compact open to charges of 'recycling' clients from long term to short term unemployment, rather than substantially improving their labour market prospects. That sums it all up, yet we see that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to criticise this government for failing to solve Australia's unemployment problem. This government at least is moving forward. We have a plan; a program, in fact. We have a multifaceted approach. We aim to solve what is one of Australia's chronic social problems: the unemployment not only of young people but of other people in the community. Like my colleagues on both sides of the chamber, I was privileged to sit in the parliament when the Treasurer (Mr CosteIlo) delivered the 1997 budget. I have always been a great admirer of the Treasurer. When I listened to those pearls of wisdom cast forth during his speech, I was reminded that he is in fact one of the greatest Treasurers this nation has ever seen. For the second year in a row, our budget helps families, helps create real jobs and boosts small business by encouraging savings and repaying our debt. This, of course, is what we seek to do as a government. Last year, we all know that we inherited a budget deficit of $10.3 biIIion, which was built up on Beazley's bankcard. We all recall those falsities uttered during the election when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) told us that the budget was in surplus. We all know the situation on the Monday after the election when Treasury presented the incoming government with the real figures. These people opposite can talk about spending, they can talk about a lot of things, but the simple fact of the matter is that, after 13 years in office, in their last year they had a $10.3 billion deficit. Consequently, we had to rein in expenditure last year because as a nation we simply cannot spend money that we do not have. Australia has already seen significant benefits as a result of the financially responsible policies of the Howard government. The 1997-98 budget was all about continuing our program to get the economic fundamentals right so that we hand this nation on to our children and grandchildren III a sound economic condition. This budget provides choices and incentives without any increases in existing taxes or any new taxes. Labor left a legacy of deficit and debt. As a result of 13 years of Labor government, Labor left this country with debt in excess of $93 billion, and I think that is totally unacceptable. Australia was downgraded by the world's major credit agencies flU, ' a triple A rating not once but twice during th last six years. In the last five years, the former Labor government ran up $70 billion in debt, averaging $14 billion a year. This government has turned a $10.3 billion deficit into a surplus in 1998-99 of $1.6 biIIion. We are talking about large amounts of money. The people of Australia are looking for performance, and they are certainly getting performance from this Treasurer and from this government. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that, over the next 12 months, we will repay over $5,000 miIIion of debt. For the first time in nearly 10 years, this government will not run up any debt, it will not caIl on the savings of Australians and it will not be a borrower in the marketplace. We have done away with the concept of boom and bust that we have seen with the Labor Party as evidenced by the recessions it said we 'had to have'. Under this government, as a nation we will be paying our way. I will mention some of the benefits of our sound economic management. We have had a succession of interest rate reductions. The biggest endorsement of the budget and of the policies of this government has come in the form of these interest rate reductions. These are tangible benefits flowing through to all of those people who borrowed money from banks and other financial institutions. Since the budget in 1996, the responsible policies of this government have resulted in four interest rate reductions, which will save the average home buyer in the electorate of Fisher and elsewhere through the nation some $290 net per month. That is $290 in the pocket after tax. That clearly helps our local economy, the housing industry, small business, the home buyer and the home owner. This means more jobs and real jobs made from a growing economy. This government does have some real solutions. Because of the arrangement between the whips, it is not possible for me to deliver my full 20-minute speech in this place. In the remaining few minutes before my 10 minutes are up, I just want to touch on a few matters which I think indicate that this government certainly has everything right. We have employment initiatives, but our employment initiatives will ensure that people are assisted to get real long-term jobs. They are not employment initiatives which simply seek to hide people from the dole queue. Last year the Howard government created 130,000 new jobs and it is forecast to create an additional 200,000 jobs in this budget. The previous government spent $500 million on short-term training schemes that shifted young people through one scheme after another for six months and there was only a four per cent success rate, despite what those opposite have said. On the other hand, this government will put more resources forward for the 70 per cent of people who do not go to tertiary institutions, even though have 12,000 increased enrolments in universities and we have created 55,000 new TAPE places. This government is establishing a training system which is responsive to the needs of industry and business enterprises while operating within a national framework that ensures that national standards and portability of standards are maintained. We will also have extra advantages in the area of apprenticeships. Other speakers have mentioned the important savings initiative. For the first time in more than a decade the Commonwealth is going to tax savings less. Most importantly for my electorate of Fisher, the savings rebate gress: announced in the budget will assist self-funded retirees and other retirees on fixed incomes who rely on investments or superannuation just to survive. The to provide real help to families-up to $450 for each taxpayer-will be welcomed by everyone. We have created additional child-care places. There will be massive additional environmental expenditure. We have introduced the work for the dole scheme. The Green Corps is another of our initiatives. Austudy changes which we have made will benefit rural and regional families such as those in the electorate of Fisher. Our regional and rural Medicare offices will remain. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) on the retention of the Caloundra and Kingaroy Medicare offices. We fought for this and the minister delivered. There will also be assistance for primary industry. It is important to recognise that this budget has got the economic fundamentals right. We continue to have responsible long-term management. We aim to spur growth and investment and create real and lasting jobs. It is a family friendly budget. It helps retirees through taxation changes and it repays the legacy of debt that was imposed on this nation by our predecessors. I greatly admire what the government has done and I congratulate the Treasurer on yet another outstanding effort.",54
170,Ms MACKLIN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"It we is sobering to recall the commitments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the Australian people before the last election. In relation to those areas which I have a particular interest in, those commitments were most comprehensively expressed in his speech to the Australian Council of Social Service congress on 13 October 1995. This speech was entitled by what, in retrospect, seems to be a cruel irony: 'Fair Australia'. On that sunny spring day only 18 months ago, Mr Howard waxed lyrical about the future prospects of Australians under a coalition government. He said to the representatives of governments, community and welfare groups gathered at the conWe won't always agree on every detail of social policy, but we will always have this in common: a desire to provide greater security and fairness for tax cut on savings those in need. He went on to say: I give you this pledge: I want to do everything in my power to preserve the social fabric of this nation. He further stated: Let me also add for the record that, contrary to the claims of my Labor opponent, there is no secret plan to slash $10 billion from social welfare. So, 18 months later, how is the government measuring up to the Prime Minister's commitments? What of the $10 billion cut to social welfare which he denied before the election was part of the coalition's agenda? I will return later in this speech to a consideration of the impact of government policy on social cohesion, the maintenance of which Mr Howard claimed was one of his main objectives. Let us look first at this promise about not making $10 billion worth of cuts to social welfare. We have been counting, Prime Minister, and after two budgets and less than half a term in office, the cuts have already exceeded $10 billion. They come from aged care, child care, social security, health, public housing and disability services. Not all of these cuts have taken effect yet. Indeed, many of the more damaging cuts in the government's first budget were coming into operation just as the second budget was introduced, foreshadowing further cuts, often affecting the same groups and individuals. Nowhere is this more evident than in child care. In the first budget, the government cut $500 million from child care. In its most recent budget, it has foreshadowed another round of cuts of more than $300 million. The combined effect of these cuts is to increase the cost of child care to parents. Low income parents have been particularly badly hit, especially those who have children who attend community based centres, from which the first budget withdrew operational subsidies. In these centres-and in private centresweekly fees have started to rise by between $20 and $40 a child. From 1 July this year, these increases will be widespread. As a result, as we are now seeing from a rising number of stories in the newspaper, increasing numbers of parents--especially mothers-are being forced to leave the work force or to place their children in cheaper, unregulated, backyard care. Centres are also being forced to close as a consequence. We have been informed of the closure of eight centres in Victoria and six in South Australia, with many closures in other parts of the country pending. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I know that you have spoken on the subject of child care, and I have no doubt that you too will know about these closures. Parents with children at these centres are outraged by the government's actions and there is nothing in this budget that will improve the affordability or the quality of child care. In fact, instead of taking responsibility for the problems of increasing costs of child care to parents, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has added insult to injury by blaming the child-care operators for the increasing costs of child care that result directly from the withdrawal of government funding. Instead of fixing the problem and making child care more affordable, she has accused them of ripping off the system. This is no way to deal with an issue of fundamental importance to parents of the 600,000 children using formal child-care services in this country. The government does not seem to recognise that, without affordable child care, families cannot combine bringing up children with going out to work. It does seem to be the case that the coalition's child-care policy illustrates two fundamental aspects of its longer term agenda which certainly families around Australia are pointing out to me: firstly, they want to reduce government provision of services and, secondly, to force women out of the work force and back into the home. What a contrast this is to the sentiments the Prime Minister expressed at the ACOSS congress, where he said: More must also be done to meet one of the greatest challenges facing families today-and that is the juggling of work and child raising responsibilities. He said he would do more, not less. Then he said: We remain strongly committed to the maintenance of affordable child care for families who choose paid child care arrangements. He made no mention of $800 million of cuts. The Prime Minister should have told that to the mums for whom child-care costs have now become prohibitive, such as the mother of two-year-old Kane, who was reported in the Daily Telegraph this week. She quit her $31,800 job a year as an office manager just last week and applied for the sole parent pension. After government cuts, she was facing increases of $20 a week in child-care costs. She said: I couldn't come up with the extra $40 a fortnight. I've been forced from being a taxpayer to scabbing off the system. John Howard was careful to reassure his ACOSS audience of the coalition's commitment to maintenance of the welfare safety net. He said then: We will not be eroding the safety net that underpins our social security system. He went on to say: A fair and compassionate society has a basic responsibility to assist the genuinely needy and disadvantaged through the provision of a strong secure social welfare safety net. Although ACOSS participants and the wider community could not have known it-the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, did not tell anybody before the election-the coalition's definition of 'the genuinely needy and disadvantaged' was far more strictly circumscribed than its pre-election statements would suggest. It did not include, for example, families who need child-care services, pensioners who rely on their concession cards to get reduced priced pharmaceuticals, or older retrenched workers who cannot find another job and, as a result of this government's changes-these are generally men-must use their small superannuation savings to supplement their reduced social security payments. They are no longer allowed to go on unemployment benefits and keep looking for work. If they have got superannuation, they have to take that super and retire. All of these groups and others have been disadvantaged by budget cuts which totalled over $10 billion in the first two Howard budgets. What does this do for social cohesion and, to quote the Prime Minister 'a desire to provide greater security and fairness for those in need'? How can you create greater security and fairness for those in need when you take $10 billion from those in need in your first two budgets? The reality, of course, is quite different from statements the Prime Minister made before the election. Judged against his own objectives, he has failed abysmally in the areas of child care and social security. Let us look at a couple of other areas of social policy: first of all, public housing. The government has failed to obtain agreement with the states on changes to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. It has left many thousands of public housing tenants worried about the security of their tenure and the cost of their housing. The government has finally, as a result of realising that it just cannot get any signature to the changes it has proposed, signed an agreement which continues past arrangements for a further two years. But in the process, the government has and cut $200 million from Commonwealth funding to the states for public housing. As these funds are matched by the states, the overall funding reductions for public housing are likely to be almost double this over the next four years. These cuts come on top of a three per cent so-called efficiency dividend applied to Commonwealth grants to the states in last year's budget. In both budgets there have been cuts to rent assistance. If there is any group in our community facing poverty, it is people in private rental. But we have seen two cuts to private rent assistance in this government's first two budgets. In the first budget we saw the cut directed to single people in shared accommodation. In the recent budget we have seen the cuts directed to young people living at home in public housing contributing to their parents' rent. The combined effect of these changes is, of course, to undermine Australians' access to appropriate and affordable housing, something that I think once again contrasts with the Prime Minister's statements to ACOSS before the election, where he said 'all Australians should have access to affordable housing'. Church groups have been among the most concerned by the government's changes to public housing. The diocese of Sydney, for example, in a media release in support of public housing said: Within the Diocese of Sydney there are many communities which rely on public housing. Many of these are found in inner-city areas where private rental is exorbitant. Quite clearly there are those who, even with subsidies, will not have a roof over their heads if rentals revert to market rates. Others would have to pay upwards of 40 per cent of a limited income on rental-a recipe for strained family relationships, poor health and increased hardship. The recent budget made few changes to aged care, perhaps because the government realises the political fallout from its first budget changes. They totalled $500 million in cuts. Most of these are yet to come into effect because they depend on the passage of the Aged Care Bill. However, older people are starting to realise the impact of the coalition's proposed changes. They will make access to nursing home care dependent on the ability to pay rather than the need for care. They will introduce two tiers of accommodation and care in our hostels and nursing homes-one for those who can pay and another for those who cannot. These are not just my views. Let us have a look at those who are running the nursing homes and hostels. In a press release last week the Uniting Church said: Passage of this bill and the supporting subsidies seriously risks undermining the current standard of aged care in Australia. It is a short sighted attempt to redress the problems of the industry, made at the expense of the most vulnerable elderly Australians. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association said: Minister Moylan's changes to the aged care reforms will cement in place a two tiered system that will see financially disadvantaged people pushed even further into the margins of a society divided by an individual's capacity to pay. The proposed changes and their likely consequences are a stark reminder of the effect of the coalition's obsession with market forces and user pays in places which are not appropriate to the market. When it comes to security, families need to know that their elderly relatives can get into a nursing home when they need to and that it will not depend on how much money they have. There are other serious consequences of this government's cuts to older people. These include increased charges for home and community care, increased costs of pharmaceuticals, the abolition of the dental health program, stricter eligibility criteria for health care and concessional cards and, as I mentioned before, the requirement to count superannuation in income for those over the age of 55 who had previously been seeking johsearch allowance. Taken together, these make a mockery of the Prime Minister's commitment in October 1995 to 'reduce the uncertainty currently felt by many pensioners and self-funded retirees'. The 1997 budget increased support for carers through enhancements to the domiciliary nursing care benefit, extension of eligibility for the carer pension, and additional funding for carers support and information. As I have said before in this place, I welcome these initiatives which help to recognise the great contribution of carers to our community. However, I am dismayed to see that these measures have been funded through stricter eligibility of the child disability allowance; a payment to the parents of children with disabilities. Overall, spending on people with disabilities has decreased by $19 million; a fact overlooked in all the government hype about greater assistance to people with disabilities. I have not mentioned other cuts that are part of the $10 billion cuts to the social welfare safety net in health or labour market programs because others will do so. I want to conclude with some general observations about the factors influencing the coalition's social policies and the effects these policies will have on the society that we live in. It has been stated many times that the Prime Minister's view of our society is stuck somewhere in the 1950s-some sort of golden age where all children lived in two-parent families, all women stayed at home and looked after their children, their elderly, their disabled and worked as volunteers in their spare time. What we know in 1997 is that this is just not the case. Even the government I think recognises this. Yet its social policies are striving to create or recreate such a society, and they are doomed to fail. Opponents of the government's policies have tended to focus on their impact on the most vulnerable in our society. This is understandable, since these policies have had a disproportionate adverse impact upon these groups. Just ask the Aboriginal people of this country. Concentrating on very disadvantaged groups has tended to disguise an important truth-that is, the government's social policies when fully implemented will also have a profound and negative effect upon many lower and middle income Australians. Such an impact is already evident in analyses of the effect of the coalition's first budget. A study by the Institute of Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University concluded that the direct effect on households of the changes was a fall of $3.50 a week or $7 a week when social wage income was considered. The study went on to say that the changes will have the greatest impact on the poor and, as a package, are regressive. One and two income families on low to average salaries are among the groups who will lose out. The much vaunted family tax package has long ago been swallowed up in costs of pharmaceuticals, higher education and child care. The savings tax rebate, which is only going to be valuable to those with considerable savings, is going to offer no assistance to pensioners. The pensioners have made their views about this budget very clear in their New South Wales newspaper-' 1997 budget ignores pensioners'. They know that that rebate-which they will not even gethas well and truly been overtaken by increased charges for HACC, for pharmaceuticals and for the costs of entering hostels and nursing homes. Finally, and most disturbing, is the way in which the government's social policies have served to exacerbate divisions in our community between self-funded retirees and pensioners, between new migrants and people long established here, between the elderly competing for services in short supply, between adults and children with disabilities, between people in the work force and those outside it, and between Aborigines and everybody else. It is a far cry from the optimism of the ACOSS meeting, where the Prime Minister proclaimed, 'I want to do everything in my power to preserve the social fabric of this nation.' What we see after 18 months in office-what we can observe-is the social fabric unravelling before our eyes. It is time for the government to actually reassess its policies and pull back before the divisions opening up in our society overwhelm us all. The government should listen to what the electorate is saying. It is clear that job security is their primary concern, but families and individuals need to know that the social services that they rely on will be there when they need them-when they are sick, when they need child care or when they cannot afford to buy a house or rent. They need to know that those services will be there. (Time expired)",56
171,Mr RICHARD EVANS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I join this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) disappointed with the contributions of those opposite to this important financial plan for the 1997-98 fiscal period. I am afraid that the Labor Party, that held so much for the battlers of Australia, is no more. The Labor Party that stood for principle is no more. The Labor Party which wished for a great Australia based on wealth for all and a future with hope is no more. The Labor Party, so proudly standing for something, is no more-no more principles, no more policy, no more ideas, no more leadership, no more. Those Australians who once placed their future and their families' future on the Labor Party being in government are, in fact, no more. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask how I know such things. A short cursory look at the responses to this budget-the second Howard government budget delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) just three weeks ago-and a look at the opposition responses confirmed the death of the Labor Party as we once knew it in this place. What we have now is a Labor Party devoid of ideas, a party looking for inspiration for the future, a party so keen to talk about its failed 13 years in government, so actively rewarded by their constituency last year and a party that has no ideas at all. The trouble is that the Labor Party which is no more creates more trouble for the country than it did when it was in government. How, you ask. As the Howard government move to rectify their sloth and avarice in office, we need an opposition which are prepared to offer an alternative. What do we get? Nothing but a wish to return to the past and the roots that they jettisoned over the last 12 years. We now have the Left trying to be Right and the Right trying to be Left. The new messiahs are prophesying. One of my colleagues mentioned the other day that the new leadership messiahs of the Labor Party were not really messiahs; they were just naughty little boys. But I guess each Monday when the comrades opposite now read the Glenn Milne policy piece, they will always sing that fabulous song of the 1970s which the Labor Party wants to go back to: 'Always look on the bright side of life'. The Labor Party need to look on the bright side of life because they left us on the dark side of the moon after their period in office. What great achievement did the Labor Party leave us when they left office? What great new age achievement did the government leave us? What are we all grateful for to the former Labor government? Let us take a few moments to reflect on this great list of achievements. Let us think for a few moments about the list. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you are finding it difficult to create this list. Let me remind you that when the disgraced Labor Party were comprehensively thrown out of government last March-15 months ago--they left us with chronic unemployment. Speaker after speaker in this debate on the other side spoke of the unemployment position. Let me remind the House that it was Labor which, at the start of this decade, had an unemployment rate of 6.2 per cent. They took us to an unemployment rate of over 11 per cent. They gave us 26 per cent youth unemployment. The Labor Party took us from an average unemployment period of 33 weeks to 55 weeks. The Labor Party doubled the number of long-term unemployed. The failed Labor government have no credibility to speak on unemployment issues. When they failed to take the necessary reforms to ensure competitiveness in the workplace, they worsened job shedding. They stand before us and say, 'Do more about unemployment.' I am sure that we will, but they have voted against labour market reforms in this place, something that every employer in Australia says is vital to increase employment opportunities. They have also voted against tax reform, another reform which every employer in Australia says is essential for employment opportunities. Their leadership still says that they will not support further tax reform. This confirms that the messages from the Labor Party are no more than dull torches rather than a blazing arc of neon-that light on the hill that we used to hear about so many years ago. The Labor Party are tall on rhetoric yet very short on action. They had 13 years in which to get their act together, yet they failed miserably. The Labor Party left us with enormous foreign debt-an 800 per cent increase from when they took office. Labor gave us the worse current account in the OECD, worse than Mexico's. Labor gave us high interest rates. Labor reduced our living standards from a rank of 10th to 22nd in the world. Productivity under Labor was around 10 per cent lower than the OECD average. Labor broke promises and never delivered their legislative tax cuts. Labor reduced national savings. Under Labor, investment and growth fell. Labor's deficits in their 13 years total $55 billion. Labor tripled Commonwealth debt. Labor sold off assets to pay for their expenditure. Labor increased their tax take by 10 per cent in their last term in office. The Labor Party failed Australia. They failed the Australian battlers who cried for them back in 1975-those Australian battlers who do not read Phillip Adams or follow Bill Hunter's movie career. They have come to realise that the New Labor is nothing more than a charade. The do nothing, say nothing, Tim Shaws of Australian politics are, in fact, the Labor Party. But wait, here is more: the Labor Party say, 'We were going to fix it in our 14th year; we were going to fix unemployment.' But wait, there is more: 'We were ,,;oing to fix the debt. We were going to fix everything. We were going to fix it in our 14th year.' But unfortunately they did not get to their 14th year because the battlers do not believe the Labor Party any more. They do not believe their shallow promises, they do not believe Labor policies and they do not believe this New Labor that is going around-the New Labor that is prepared to do anything and say anything to return to power. Let us review some of Labor's pearls of wisdom during this appropriation debate. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, said, 'At the very least, the budget should be good economics.' That is absolutely right. Pray tell me, Mr Deputy Speaker, is reducing dead debt good economics? I am sure it is. Is reducing outlays good economics? Is rewarding savings good economics? Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will agree that it would be. Strike one, then, for the budget. The member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) says the budget does nothing. Wrong. It reduces debt. The member for Holt says the budget does nothing for savings. Wrong. It reduces tax on savings. Strike two for the budget. The member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) says that we have no plan. He says the Howard government has no plan-no plan to reduce debt? No plan to reduce outlays? No plan to reduce tax on savings? No plan to give confidence to the Australian community? No plan to give Australia the financial responsibility it so deserves? The member for Brisbane said in his speech financial responsibility is nothing to be proud of and, by implication, says he is happy with debt. He is on the front bench of the Labor Party, so the Labor Party, by implication, is happy for Australia to be in debt. By implication, he says he is happy to have high taxes. By implication, he agrees with taxing savings. By implication, his plan is for high taxes and high outlays. The member for Brisbane proudly boasts about the Labor Party having three surpluses in 13 years. They had 13 loan bills. We will be back in surplus within our first term, our first three years. The member says we have no plan. We have a plan all right, and that plan is to get this country out of debt and get us focused on renewing wealth and sharing it around within this country. The saddest speech was from the poor former Treasurer, the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who tried very hard to justify his period as Treasurer. Perhaps we could have believed him, as he was so passionate about what he was saying, except for a couple of points: Labor gave us the worse recession in 60 years, they gave us record small business interest rates, they gave us foreign debt which was out of control, they gave us the worse unemployment rate since the recession in the 1930s, they increased taxes when they promised not to do so, and they gave us the worse current account-worse than Mexico's. The list just goes on and on. As much as I like anyone who lives in my home town of Williamstown in Melbourne, I can tell the former Treasurer, who has only just moved there, I think, that we from Williamstown do not like debt either. Some Australians who should know, those Australians who do not have a political barrow to push, have commented on the budget. One of them, Mark Paterson from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: This is a good budget which will go a long way towards restoring growth and lowering unemployment. Its defining characteristic is stability. It maintains an even keel while improving sales and building confidence. It is clear the only ones who do not like this budget are in fact the new Labor Party and their fellow travellers-the new Labor Party who love debt, the new Labor Party who love high taxes, the new Labor Party who love taxing savings, the new Labor Party who love high government outlays-the new Labor Party with old ideas, though; the new Labor Party with the same old ideas. New Labor have yet to listen to the electorate. They have yet to listen to what the people, the Australian battlers, are sayingand they are saying a few things. They are saying, 'Reduce taxes, reduce your outlays and stop borrowing money. We are sick of it. Stop spending and start increasing the wealth of this country and sharing it around.' The new Labor Party have not listened to what those people said in March 1996, and the Labor Party will suffer the consequences electorally for a long time. Mr Deputy Speaker, my 10 minutes is up. I do not support the amendment from the new Labor Party as it does nothing, just as the Labor Party did nothing in the 13 years they were in power.",60
172,Mr MCMULLAN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Canberra) (5.49 p.m.)I rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) and, what is more, to support the outstanding speech made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in response to the budget. That speech actually highlighted one of the characteristics of politics in Australia in the last few weeks, in the last month perhaps. What distinguishes the circumstances of the parties in the parliament-in this House and in the Senate but, for the purpose of this point, particularly in this House-is that those of us in the Labor Party have a leader of whom we are all very proud and those on the opposite side have a leader of whom at least some of them are ashamed. And that is a particularly important distinction. Some of them are making that shame public in their views about the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the stolen children report. But I want today to focus on the distinction as it relates to this budget and in particular as the budget relates to employment, the economy, industrial relations, the macro consequences for the economy as a whole and the human consequences for some of the individuals affected by those outcomes. What do we see in the broader Australian economy at the moment, and what does it say about the context in which we receive this budget and about the outcome from the previous budget? There can be speculation about the outcome of this budget-whether it will achieve its objectives or not. I will make some comments about that in a moment, but we are all gazing into a foggy crystal ball. It is not clear. Nobody knows. But we do know something about this government's first budget: we know it was a failure-an absolute, terrible, catastrophic failure. And that will be proved tomorrow. The growth figures will come out tomorrow. Nobody knows exactly what they will say, but we know that they will say last year's budget objective for growth has not been achieved. We also know that the mid-year review revised forecast of a budget of growth outcomes for last year will not be achieve a. And why is that? Anyone who heard the previous speaker, the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), would be excused for not knowing that the reason is that this 12-month period that tomorrow's growth figures will measure is the first 12 months that have been entirely the responsibility of this government. Up until now, the annual growth figures have been higher because they have included the higher growth numbers under the previous government. But this will be the first 12 months measuring the exclusive responsibility of the Howard government, and they will be appalling growth numbers-probably somewhere between two and three per cent, far below the four per cent that everybody acknowledges we need to start to get unemployment down. If this budget, as brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), achieves the numbers to which it aspires-and I am pessimistic about that it will not achieve four per cent in any year this century. What that means is that we are essentially condemning those people who are unemployed by maintaining that level of unemployment for the remainder of this century-an appalling outcome. It means the continuing failure of this government on job creation and a falling, floundering economic performance. It is very bad for this country overall in terms of the tragic loss of potential, wasted productivity and wasted lives. But it has extra problems for some groups in particular. Because I want to speak on other matters, I cannot comment on all of those many groups. But you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, that it can have a particular impact in some regions, because your state is one that is particularly adversely affected. There are other regions particularly adversely affected, including of course the Newcastle region, so struck by the consequences of the failure of this government's industry policy and so left to its own devices without any assistance from this government. There are regional groups; there are all sorts of groups. I want to mention two groups because they were features of this government's election campaign when it said that it would do something substantial for them-and they are the long-term unemployed and unemployed youth. I do not know whether anybody remembers-maybe nobody bothers to talk about the things that were said in the election because they cannot tell which were core promises and which were non-core promises-but I thought doing something about the long-term unemployed and youth unemployment were probably seen as major promises of that government. Yet what do we see after 12 months, from March 1996 to March 1997? We see an increase in long-term unemployment by 14,000, and last month's figures indicate that it is getting worse; the percentage of the term unemployed going up; youth unemployment rising in absolute terms; and, most starkly of all, the percentage of full-time youth labour force unemployed rising from 27.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent. I never had a great deal of faith in that last figure as a measure. The absolute numbers have gone up. That is important; that clearly is measuring a problem. The percentage can be very misleading, but it is a figure that was trotted month after month by this government when they were in opposition. We find a stony silence from them now they are the government and those same figures are telling against them. It is an indictment of them that youth unemployment is rising. I do not want to put too much weight on the measurement of the percentage, because all sorts of factors come into that. I simply condemn the government for the hypocrisy they showed in opposition about that. But the absolute numbers of long term unemployed and the absolute numbers of youth unemployed are rising. I mention that important macro-economic background to raise some particular issues. What is the government's response? The only weapon the government has and uses to deal with this question is the interest rates weapon. It uses it for growth stimulus, because it eschews all the other mechanisms of fiscal management. Of course, basic economics tells us that reduced interest rates will eventually have some positive impact on economic growth. Certainly in any econometric model that is the outcome. It also says that it is untargeted. You cannot target it to your areas of primary concern and there are long and sometimes unpredictable lags. We also know that in the real world, as against the econometric models, there are other factors you have to take into account. In Australia in 1997 one of those factors is the resistance of consumer and investor response to reduced interest rates because of the falling levels of consumer confidence and business confidence. Therefore, interest rates are a very ineffective, slow-moving, untargeted mechanism to deal with the great problem of unemployment. It is a condemnation of the governlongment that it fails to use, and deliberately chooses not to use, the principal weapon of fiscal policy to respond to this serious problem. But, as shadow minister for industrial relations, I want to refer in particular to the consequences of the use of that interest rate policy for the wages of ordinary Australians who are out there trying to support a family on the basic wages they earn as employees. out The government came to office saying that it did not believe in centralised wage fixation. All around Australia people are laughing about that. They know that what it means is that the government did not think the Industrial Relations Commission, before which everybody could appear and put their case, should have a role in centralised wage fixation; it should be done by the Reserve Bank of Australia. We have a very centralised wage fixation system determined by a line in the sand drawn by the Reserve Bank. But no-one gets a chance to appear before it and put their point of view. No-one gets a chance to put their special concerns about why the decisions that are being made might be adverse to their interest. There is no capacity to respond to special problems or particular circumstances. There is no flexibility. It is a very blunt instrument-necessarily so. That is not a criticism of the Reserve Bank. There is no capacity to manage monetary policy in that sort of targeted way that other elements of policy can. So, firstly, it is blunt, unfair and no-one gets a chance to appear. Secondly, those who restrain their wages the most are those who get the least benefit from the falling interest rates. The evidence on the distribution of mortgages shows that, on average, only 11 per cent of the lowest 40 per cent of income households have mortgages. They are the people getting the least benefit from the interest rate cuts, yet the wage figures show they are the people showing the greatest restraint. The two-tier labour market that this industrial relations structure of this government is making inevitable-with increases for those with bargaining power rising more quickly than the increases for those on the award only system, and this system will make that worse-is being exacerbated by the fact that those people who show the greatest restraint get the least reward. I think it is possible also that this government is significantly underestimating the importance of executive salaries in the increased average weekly ordinary-time earnings numbers on which it and the Reserve Bank are basing their policies. That is an issue we will have to look at later. The other problem I have is that this interest rate policy simply cannot work. It is unsustainable because monetary policy has broader ramifications. Interest rates are not an autonomous variable that you can just use in response to concerns about wages policy. It has an impact on the currency, which can be a much bigger issue for inflation. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, before the House of Representatives Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee recently, said that the biggest factor in the recent reduction in inflation was the appreciation of the exchange rate. Yet, as our interest rates fall and the US interest rates go up, that will inevitably have an impact on the Australian currency. We are already starting to see some small drop in the currency since the last interest rates move. In some ways with the economy overall that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is not the issue I want to get into a debate about now, but its inflationary consequences are evident and serious, much more important than an 11 per cent wage increase for truck drivers. A change in the value of the currency is a much bigger factor for inflation than any of the wage claims before the Industrial Relations Commission-certainly much bigger than any decision the Industrial Relations Commission might have made to give a decent wage increase to those dependent on the award system, instead of the trifling, inadequate decision which it made-which was fortunately better than that which the government offered, but still inadequate. So we have an unsustainable strategy because the very instrument that we are trying to use as an economic stimulus can only eventually work in the opposite direction as it starts to have an impact on the relative value of our currency, and therefore on inflation, and the capacity therefore to continue to use that as a weapon for economic stimulus and wages policy at the same time cannot be sustained. Therefore, serious problems for our economy are in the offing in terms of the potential to stimulate increased economic growth. In the interim what we have is an unfair policy, unfairly impacting on wage and salary earners, an unworkable and ultimately unsuccessful policy directed unfairly to wage and salary earners, particularly lower wage and salary earners. I note it is directed towards wages, not towards incomes. Those whose incomes are otherwise derived are not required to express the same restraint. I regard that as an important issue and an important condemnation of the inadequacy of this budget. I want to talk about the unfair dismissals fiasco that has been added to the problems for workers from the wages policy . We had the government, at the last election, promising that they would not have a small business exemption. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 20 February 1996, an article quoting the then shadow minister for industrial relations-his name was Mr Reith-stated: The coalition has flatly ruled out any exemption for small business in its redrafted unfair dismissal laws despite a plea that the sector should not be subject to the same treatment as the big end of town. The author of the policy, the opposition's industrial  redrafted system would not contain any exemptions. Just in case anyone thought he was mi: understood, on 28 February he said: Our position is very clear. If you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal. And 1.3 million Australians believed him and found that he was not telling the truth. At the first opportunity they have broken that commitment and there are many other commitments made by the Prime Minister to the same effect. When the Senate said, 'We'd like to hold you to that promise,' they went further. They did not just breach it as much as they originally proposed. They went further and they threatened a double dissolution about it, failing to tell people that the exemption they are proposing is an exemption to their own law, that they have broken the promises they made but, more than this, that they are adversely affecting the lives of 1.3 million Australians-those who work for small business who will be affected by this, who are already feeling insecure, stressed and uncertain. It makes their lives worse, not better. It robs them of their rights, it robs them of their day in court. It is damaging our society and dividing our society. If you want to look at it economically, it increases insecurity in the workplace and is going to lead to falling consumer confidence and a reduced capacity and preparedness of Australian workers to commit themselves to mortgages and other long-term contracts that are important if the interest rate cuts are going to flow through the economy and lead to increased consumer confidence. At the very time that that is being proposed, these changes are reducing that confidence because they are making people's job insecurity worse. It may be part of the explanation why changes to unfair dismissal laws that took place on 1 January are having no impact on improved job numbers. There is no correlation at all. In fact, in Victoria, the state where they are operating most unfettered and there is no state unfair dismissal law to interfere, since the new unfair dismissal laws came in the rate of job growth has fallen. The last Bureau of Statistics figures said that the trend changed in January and started to fall, at the very time, if you believe the government's story, it should have been starting to increase. More importantly than the economic consequence and the failure economically, it is a human story. I want to quote one story that has been referred to me. It was a story that was settled out of court on confidential terms, so I cannot give all the details, but I can vouch for its authenticity. I cannot use all the words that are in the summary of this case. They would be distinctly unparliamentary. I will go as close as I can without breaching your tolerance, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Stephen Smith-Or mine.",63
173,Mr MCMULLAN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Or the sensitivity of my good colleague the member for Perth. The case summary states: The employee was a young female employed in her first job as a receptionist after two years unemployment. Obviously, she was in a very vulnerable situation. It continued: Her employer was a family company run by a husband and wife. After 6 weeks the husband referred to the employee as ... It is an offensive term that I cannot use in this chamber. It went on: She asked him not to refer to her in that way, but he did so from time to time but never in front of his wife. On one occasion the employee asked the husband if she could wear slacks to work. He replied that he didn't mind as long as she looked ""sexy"". The employee did not like this conduct but was reluctant to criticise her employer as this was her first job. After 11 monthsthat is, within the time limit which would mean she had no unfair dismissal rights under this government's proposed regulationthe employee asked the husband for a pay rise. The husband said no because of cash flow problems. He then touched her on the cheek and said ''I'll have to arrange some cash jobs for you"". The employee was totally humiliated by this experience. She came into work the next day but could not stand being around the husband ... and her doctor advised her not to return to work. There was action in the court for constructive unfair dismissal. I cannot go into the terms of the settlement. As I said, it was settled on confidential terms. The reason I mention that case is it is similar to the experience of parents all around Australia. Their children are young workers and new workers who are vulnerable not to every employer-many of them are fine Australians-but to some. The human cost of these changes is obvious. The economic benefit is not evident. Why would any government set out to make the lives of Australians worse when there is no economic benefit evident from those changes?",66
174,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"It is a pleasure to be able to support the second budget brought down by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Howard-Fischer government. The previous speaker, the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), alluded to a couple of elements of the budgetary process. One was interest rates, and I will come to that in a minute, and the other was promises and broken promises. The last major broken promise that the people of Australia will recall the Labor Party perpetrated on this nation was just prior to the election when they told the people of Australia that there was a $700 million surplus in the budget. When they were thrown out of office at the election in 1996 and the coalition was elected, we were confronted with a $lOYz billion deficit in real terms. The problem was that the Labor Party could not differentiate between headline figures and real figures. They included asset sales that were not achieved. They also did a lot of fudging of the figures at the margins. This government will tum that $1 OYz billion deficit into a $1.6 billion surplus in just three years. The people of Australia know that is a task that has to be undertaken. They know it is a task that is going to be tough on all sections of Australia, but they also know it is one that has to be undertaken. Addressing that problem is foremost in our minds-and certainly in the minds of everybody around Australia-if we want to build a nation that is worthwhile for our children to inherit in the future. That is basically what this budget is all about. It has added to the foundation that was laid in the budget of August 1996, and it has certainly produced the goods. Following the budget, we have had a further reduction in interest rates. The previous speaker spoke of interest rates and the role the Reserve Bank is playing in monetary policy. As he put it, the bank has drawn a line in the sand for the speed limit on wages, the speed limit on inflation and the agreement we have on them. If we achieve a stable labour market with stable salaries, stable inflation and stable interest rates-and we believe we will-we should get steady economic growth. We should get inflation at one per cent. Unions and other parties are calling for 11 per cent wage increases. They are the things that do have an effect on interest rates. The previous speaker pooh-poohed the interest rate regime that this government has vigorously pursued and which has recently seen interest rates on mortgages with some lenders drop to about 6.9 per cent. One of the earlier speakers tonight, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin)-who concentrated most of her address in the House on some of her portfolio responsibilities with regard to child care and aged care-also referred to some research that had been done that indicated that budget changes this government had introduced impacted in a negative way at the rate of $7 per week per family. Just for the information of the House, a family with a $100,000 mortgage-the average mortgage across Australia-will have benefited from those interest rate cuts to the tune of $290 a month. That is $290 tax-free, in the pocket. So the goal of this government is to ease the burden on everybody in Australia through that interest rate regime. It is exactly the opposite to the focus taken by the previous government and the previous Prime Minister-in particular, in his earlier career as the Treasurer. We all recall that, between March 1988 and November 1989, the cash rate was lifted by nearly eight percentage points. We had an MPI this evening about small businesses, and the opposition claim to be bleeding hearts at the moment about the circumstances of small business. But the policy that has done the most damage to small business is the interest rate regime the Labor Party ran when they were in government in the late 1980s. Let us not forget what former Treasurer Keating did, and I will quote from an article that was in the Sydney Morning Herald: Keating had returned from his summer holiday all fired up about the way in which Noosa was full of bulldozers. He wanted the Reserve to lift rates by 2 percentage points in one hit. The Reserve procrastinated but, under daily urging from Don Russell, lifted the rate by 1.75 percentage points. Between March 1988 and November 1989 the cash rate was lifted by nearly 8 percentage with Paul Keating cracking the whip. Rates were pushed too high for too long. Then, at the end of 1989, Don Russell ... heard the economy snapIndeed it did-it snapped. The Labor government of the late 1980s broke the economy. Remember the words of the then Treasurer (Mr Keating) about the recession we had to have? That is what did the most damage to small business and to the farming community in this country. Eight years later they still have not recovered and that is why the Howard-Fischer coalition government is hell-bent and totally focused on maintaining a low interest rate regime. The mechanisms we have put in place as far as the economy is concerned will maintain that low inflation and low interest regime in this country. It will provide benefits to everybody in this nation, particularly to the small business community. They ought not to forget that. They ought not to lose sight of the fact that that is exactly where it is targeted because it is that sector of the economy-we have heard from speakers on both sides of this House-which crows about the ability of small business to create employment. If every single small business in Australia employed one more person there would be no unemployment. This government is unashamedly focusing on the policy settings that are going to benefit small business the most with regard to the interest rate regime, the availability of finance at that low interest rate, low inflation, a stable wages regime and a fair industrial relations regime. The member for Canberra alluded in great detail to the industrial relations regime. During my travels around my electorate in the lead-up to the last election, if there was one issue alone that absolutely every small business person spoke about it was unfair dismissal. They said, 'If you don't get in there and do something about unfair dismissal we will just walk out of here. We are not going to employ any more people. Not only that, we will walk out of this business because the Labor government has killed us with interest rates and they are killing us with the unfair dismissal laws.' They were talking about the Laurie Brereton and Martin Ferguson concoctpoints, ed unfair dismissal regime. This government did do something about it. But after the first round of changes to the Industrial Relations Act last year, which were negotiated through the Senate, there were still concerns from the small business community. So there were more changes that accommodated small business. I do not dispute the facts that were raised by the member for Canberra that there are certain cases where people are unfairly dismissed. They should have their right of recourse and they do. But what is more important is the opportunity for those people to get a job in the first placethe opportunity to participate in the work force in Australia and to make a contribution as far as this nation is concerned. A few things have been said since the budget was introduced and there has been a great deal of criticism by the Labor Party of the government's tax rebate on savings. They have said that it does not benefit anybody and that you have to have $60,000. They ask how it is going to benefit pensioners. I do not know whether they have talked to the pensioners in their electorates but a lot of the pensioners in my electorate are part pensioners: they have a bit of money invested and they get a bit of income from savings. They will benefit from this regime. They might not have $60,000 invested and they might not get the full benefit of $450 a year. But it does not matter whether they get 15c in $1 or $15 in $100, they will still receive a benefit-a benefit they never had any hope of getting under Labor. Even if Labor had been serious and genuine about introducing the l-a-w tax cuts-which they were never going to introduce-the part pensioners and self-funded retirees were never going to get any benefit out of them. But under our regime and under this policy setting they will. Self-funded pensioners and retirees will get some benefit from our policy. We have heard criticism about the government's changes to things like the pharmaceutical scheme. It is the scaremongering that gets very annoying. We suffered it in the election. I have a reasonable amount of respect for the member for Jagajaga but she just cannot help herself-she is constantly scaremongering. Another example of their scaremongering took place during the election campaign in my electorate, where lots of pensioners received bogus Telstra bills. They were frightened half out of their wits. They said, 'I paid my telephone account. What am I getting another one for?' When we got to the bottom of it we found it was being done by the Labor Party and the unions to frighten people. That is all they have done; they have run a campaign of fear and loathing and scaremongering. It is the same story with all of these things. The government members are trying to get the message out to the people of Australia that we are concerned about those areas. The changes we are making are for the long-term good of this nation. They will not severely disadvantage anybody who cannot protect themselves. That is the fact of every single policy that this government has laid down since it got into power, particularly in the 1997-98 budget. I referred earlier to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I had a lot to do, in the early stages when we were in opposition, with pushing the then government to recognise the availability of generic drugs and to allow the substitution of generic drugs. After much pressure and a couple of years they did do that. I forget who was the minister for health at the time; it may have been the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) who was the minister and who recognised that need. We have gone a step further and said that if there is a generic replacement available it should be used because the taxpayers of Australia should be able to buy the best and the most efficient product. But we are still going to provide a product that is prescribed. Let people be aware that that is the case; the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has made that abundantly clear. I wish I had more time to go over the rest of the things in the budget but I would close by saying to the people of Australia: be wary of the scaremongering of the Labor Party. They lost the last election and they are still reeling from that. They are reeling from the fact that we have been able to reduce interest rates in the first 18 months of this government's term.",67
175,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"The author Gertrude Stein was once described as a past master at making nothing happen very slowly. If this budget is any guide, we may be witnessing the evolution of a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who is a new past master at making nothing happen very slowly. There is one question I would like the Prime Minister to answer: is unemployment, with all its attendant social ills, this nation's greatest problem and priority-above party politics and above the political point scoring of all of us? Is it more important than sectional interests? That is what I would like to hear from this Prime Minister. We need to get some common ground in this country and I think that is where we should start. So I would say to the Prime Minister if he is out there listening: is unemployment our highest priority? After a year in office I cannot see the signs that the Prime Minister does regard it as his highest priority. Last year's unemployment forecasts simply were not met. Unemployment went up rather than down. Yet, there has been no change in policy. We are expressly told that this budget continues the direction of the first budget. But why should it? The first budget did nothing to help reduce unemployment. In fact, it proved to be counter-productive. When I see BHP abandoning steel production in Newcastle, I also badly want to ask the Prime Minister this question about unemployment and to hear the Prime Minister's answer. The Australian people have supported BHP through thick and thin, and Labor's steel plan gave immense support to BHP. For them to now pull out from Newcastle borders on treason. What is the Prime Minister's reaction? Can anyone tell me? There has not been anything that one would class as a reaction. The Prime Minister is showing no leaderdivisive ship at all. He is letting it all happen around him. He simply has not grasped what leaderresponsibility ship is all about. For him, it is always the apology without any responsibility: 'I am sorry about BHP closing down in Newcastle, but there is nothing we can do about it. I sorry about the number of long-term unemattack ployed rising, but they will just have to for the economy to pick up, because there nothing we can do about it. I am sorry about feeding. the stolen children, but there is nothing we can do about it.' I am old enough to rememreceived ber the line in the film Love Story-'Love means never having to say you're sorry'. In 1997, being John Howard means always having to say you are sorry. It is no wonder that people are not relaxed and comfortable at all and that some of who supported the Liberal Party at the election are now giving the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and her party a second look. western This Prime Minister was elected on a fundathey mental fraud and deceit practised on the Australian people. He encouraged people were concerned about unemployment and job insecurity to think that he was going something about those things and that they could vote for him on that basis. But he never had any intention of doing anything about those things. This budget does nothing about jobs and nothing to replace the labour market programs that Labor painstakingly put in These place through Working Nation. This government cut 117,000 opportunities for young people. What did they put back? A laughable 10,000 work for the dole places. And they want a tick for it! The junior minister for employment, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), struts around here at question time-Dracula in charge of the blood bank, the emperor with no clothes except for that tie he wears each week-telling us that the government ought to be congratulated for work for the dole. For what? For a scheme that replaces 117,000 places with a mere 10,000? In the light of the Prime Minister's failure to tackle the unemployment problem, all we hear about in this country now is the shabby, politics of race-what an ugly country we are fast becoming. We all have some for this. The member for Oxley has a lot to answer for but, to be candid, she does not know a whole lot better. I am much more concerned about the Prime Minister's am lack of leadership, his failure to properly and rebut the member for Oxley and wait his failure to do anything about the unemis ployment and insecurity off which she is I want to report to the House a letter I in the last week or two from the business development manager at Solaris Power, which is a private electricity distribution company in Melbourne's northern suburbs. The letter, from Craig Ondarchie, says that the 'key to our long-term growth ... is those the attraction of new manufacturing and last commerce to our distribution regionMelbourne's Industrial heartland, the north suburbs.' He tells me that, to do that, work closely with the Victorian and federal economic development agencies and who they have been active in sourcing capital intensive and energy intensive industryto do naturally enough. He goes on to say: Mr Gordon Thomas, my General Manager, and I have just returned from a visit to Taiwan. In almost every discussion we had with Taiwanese business people, concerns were raised as to Australia's position on Asian investment and immigration. concerns were based on a perception that the people of Australia are strongly backing Ms Pauline Hanson and that she was potentially Australia's next Prime Minister and that Australia's policy would be to halt Asian immigration. He goes on to say: Despite offering more accurate descriptions of the Australian political environment, we were unable to overcome the Taiwanese perceptions. It is unfortunate but true, that the views of one individual can have a detrimental impact on the prospects for business expansion and economic development in Australia. I am writing to make you aware of this. I implore you and your parliamentary colleagues to act quickly to dissolve this view, particularly in Asia, and further to repair the damage that ""one lone figure"" in Parliament has caused. For Australia's sake. Those policies the Prime Minister is applying are precisely the policies which have been tried and rejected in Britain, America and France, all in the last six months. Just in the last couple of days, the French Left scored a stunning victory. One radio account I heard said, 'People wanted to hear about job creation and solutions to unemployment, not incessant rhetoric about the deficit and the need for cutbacks.' Does that sound familiar? In the United States, President Clinton was re-elected in November last year when voters rejected the policies which had been promoted by the Republican controlled congress and by the congressional leader Newt Gingrich in particular. In Britain just a matter of weeks ago, Labour won a massive victory over the Conservatives, who suffered their worse electoral outcome for over 50 years. Britain's measures of inequality are the worse in the Western world, equivalent with those of Russia and worse than many other nationsincluding undeveloped nations. There are more people in poverty in Britain than ever before, including more children in poverty than ever before. Those Thatcher legacies of growing inequality and poverty have been rejected very soundly by the British voters. What a dreadful example this government is setting in other areas, including ministerial standards. It is ironic that questions have been asked in the last couple of days about how the former senator Short came to be appointed to a position that he did not apply for until after the close of applications, because it is all something that has happened before. Back in 1993, soon after the change of government in Victoria, the Department of Business and Employment advertised for a 'general manager-employment' with a remuneration package of $103,607-$109,067. That was not a bad package then, and it is not a bad package now. Applications were to close by the close of business on 9 August 1993. Some months later-long after the close of applications-a handwritten note from the departmental secretary, George Brouwer, indicated that he had received a phone call inquiring whether an appointment had been made to this position and whether this person could still put in an application. She wrote to the department on 21 October, more than two months after the close of applications, indicating that she wished to apply for the position and saying, 'I am excited about the opportunities the position offers.' Given that she was managing a Footscray employment project with a package of around $45,000, no doubt she was excited by the $103,000 salary. We know that she got the job and that her one-year contract-as it was advertised to the outside world-was almost immediately extended to three years. There is, however, a serious question mark about the propriety of this appointment and the integrity of the process by which it was made.",69
176,Unknown,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,Sitting suspended from 6.31 p.m. to 8 p.m.,71
177,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"As I was saying to the House before the dinner break, what we do know now is that the successful applicant for this $100,000-plus job with the Victorian government, Ms Karen Synon, had been active in the Liberal Party in Melbourne's western suburbs, including  Costello, to address the Liberal Party NorthWest Metro Area Conference in May . We do know that she has now been appointed as a Liberal senator by a Victorian Liberal Party that is never shy about looking after one's own. How ironic it is that, as had happened with Senator Short's position, his replacement in the Senate, Senator Synon, was also appointed by a Liberal government to a $100,000-plus position she did not even apply for until after applications closed. It gives a whole new meaning to the concept of short-listing when we follow the fate of Senator Short and Senator Synon. It is little wonder that the Liberal Party works so hard to break down proper Public Service staffing and accountability processes and that it is so hard to make the Public Service more like the private sector. After all, those merit protection and accountability processes just get in the way of jobs for the boys and girls. While we are on the subject of ministerial standards, I want to call on the federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to explain just why it is that Liberal Party election donation records list a private sector health firm using his post office box. The Australian Electoral Commission returns list Ramsay Health Care (Victoria) Pty Ltd, a company which operates private hospitals, as donating $10,000 to the Liberal Party's federal secretariat. AEC records show that company as operating from Post Office Box 31, Box Hill. But Post Office Box 31 is a taxpayer funded service provided to the minister by the Department of Administrative Services. That is a service intended for use by the member in the discharge of his duties, certainly not for any private business. The minister must explain why a private sector company is listed as operating from this post office box. Quite clearly, such an arrangement is well outside the regulations governing the provision of that service. Why is it that the Liberal Party returns show that company as having made a donation from Dr Wooldridge's post office box address, which is for his electorate office mail? The Appropriation Bill provides us with an opportunity of asking whether current funding for the Australian Electoral Commission is adequate and whether the existing laws concerning election campaign donation disclosures are adequate. In addition, I think that an examination of the list of donors raises doubts as to whether the spirit of these disclosure laws is being observed. The Liberal Party continues to shield its biggest donors from proper scrutiny. A study of the Liberal Party's returns shows that two of its largest donors in 1995-96 were, first, the Free Enterprise Foundation, which donated $3 million to the party's federal secretariat, and, second, the Cormack Founclation, which contributed $1.5 million to the party's Victorian division. Disclosure laws have not made these donations transparent in any way. The Australian community knows absolutely nothing about the sources of these donations. Where political parties choose to mask donations behind trust funds or third parties, the legislation requiring disclosure fails to achieve its purpose. Under those circumstances, I believe there is a strong case for it to be reviewed. While Minister Wooldridge prepares a plausible explanation for the post office box donation, he might also like to note other anomalies. The same Electoral Commission return for the Liberal Party's federal secretariat indicates a donation from a company in the minister's electorate, H.J. Reece Pty Ltd, of Burwood, which donated $5,000. Yet there does not appear to be any separate disclosure submitted to the Australian Electoral Commission by this company. Furthermore, in its Australian Electoral Commission return, the Victorian division of the Liberal Party lists a series of company donors located in the Chisholm electorate which also do not appear to have made separate disclosures. They include the Direct Selling Association, in Notting Hill, which donated $4,000, and Taxi Australia, of Oakleigh, which contributed $2,000. The minister should also be made aware, if he is not already aware, that the following firm located in his electorate may also have failed to submit a return. Garry and Warren Smith, of Oakleigh, donated $1,500 to the 500 Club in Melbourne, an associated entity of the Liberal Party. While we are on the subject of car dealerships, it is also worth noting that the company New Oakleigh Motors, another Oakleigh based car dealership, did submit a company disclosure declaring a donation of $5,555. However, my office has not been able to locate a disclosure by the Liberal Party, or an associated entity, which actually records this donation. The minister may wish to insist that he is unable to shed any light on these anomalies, but that is not to say that his office has played no role in creating them. I understand that the minister's chief of staff, Mr Ken Smith, often introduces himself when talking to health groups and professionals with the declaration that he knows very little about the health industry. What does Mr Smith know about company donations to the Liberal Party in the Chisholm electorate? What does he know about the reported $250,000 that was spent by the minister in the last Chisholm campaign? What does he know about the sources of that funding? What does he know about Ramsay Health Care being listed at the minister's taxpayer funded post office box? What does he know about Liberal Party donors in Chisholm who may not have submitted the appropriate disclosure forms to the Electoral Commission? The issue of campaign donations and their reporting is a very serious issue. The apparent failure of the minister to explain anomalies suggests that the Australian Electoral Commission needs to become more vigilant in monitoring election donations and disclosures. In the 1997-98 budget, the commission has been allocated $113 million. But the example of one Liberal minister and donations linked to him suggests that the Electoral Commission does not have adequate resources to perform the tasks assigned to it. As such, I think there is a need to allocate additional funding a more thorough check of company returns can be undertaken. I also want to talk about the budget and its impact on the environment. The budget reveals clearly that the Liberal promise to use funds from the part-sale of Telstra for extra spending on the environment has gone the way of dozens of Liberal promises before it. Not only has the one billion trees program been abandoned; so too has funding for the save the bush program. Furthermore, agencies whose work is critical to the ongoing protection of our environment are to have their budgets slashed. The Australian Heritage Commission has been cut from $11.7 million to $10.7 million. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has been cut from $43.4 million to $35.9 million. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been cut from $12.8 million to $9.7 million. The Antarctic Division has been cut from $60.7 million to $60.3 million. The administration budget for the Department of the Environment is down from $148 million to $129 million. The situation is just as bad in the energy ministry, where Minister Parer has abolished the Energy Research and Development Corporation and slashed a further $11 million from the national energy efficiency program, which comes on top of a $3 million cut in last year's budget. This leaves Australia's dwindling credibility on greenhouse gas emission issues absolutely in tatters. The government's intentions are increasingly obvious. The environmental bonanza promised from the Telstra part-sale will never eventuate. The Telstra money will be replacing programs and projects which Labor had already put in place. It is a fraud on those voters who care deeply for the environment and believed the Liberal rhetoric that they had finally changed their colours on the environment. It is a fraud on all Australians who hope and expect that money from the part-sale of Telstra will be used on additional environmental protection. The one billion trees program, started under the federal Labor government in 1990, was a genuine community based effort to replenish so that some of the most degraded parts of the Australian environment. Greening Australia has been actively involved in this massive exercise, which has extended to local environmental projects such as Merri Creek and Moonee Ponds Creek in my own electorate. We have a government which promised that it would retain the one billion trees program but, with the election over, it now feels free to drop this obligation. Australians who thought this government had genuine environmental objectives have been conned. Furthermore, we find the budget bringing broken promises and more hardship for public tenants, people needing prescriptions and parents needing child care. We see a $50 million cut in the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, which will cause waiting lists to blowout, and the abolition of rental assistance for people in public housing, which will cost tenants $58 million in a full year. (Time expired)  is a reaffirmation that, as a government, we have put Australia's future first. Unlike Labor, we are prepared to do the hard yards in an attempt to set our economy on solid ground. We well realise that sustained economic sunshine is possible only with low interest rates, low inflation and low debt. We are seeking to build a nation that is bold in outlook with strength in our unity but also in our diversity. We need to change many legacies, not merely the appalling economic situation left to us by the previous government but also some of the hangovers from bygone days when different circumstances applied. The will of the Australian people is that we get on with the job-unlike our political opponents. They realise that there are new realities at play and that we as a nation must embrace them in order to survive and prosper. Australia's geographic location no longer means isolation. As faster transportation has reduced travelling times and communications have overcome national borders, the world is no longer out of our reach. While our traditional links with Great Britain and Europe remain strong, in the past quarter of a century we have realised the benefits of increased ties with our regional neighbours in Asia. Barriers of culture and language are being overcome by opportunity and diplomacy, but it remains paramount that our image overseas truly reflects the inclusiveness and fairness of our society. Last year, when commenting on the appalling and ignorant comments of a member of this House, I expressed concern that her views might be picked up in other parts of the world. From all reports, her comments have attracted attention in Asia and beyond. The real danger is that the musings of this member will be regarded as in any way significant and her half-baked opinions will be seen as representative of our national view. If the 20th century has been dubbed 'the American century', the smart money is on the 21 st century being dubbed the 'Asian century'. The Asian tiger is on the prowl and it is the perfect time to grab it by the tail. Within 25 years, it is estimated that Asia will account for over a third of the world's GDP. Japan, China, Korea and India will number among the world's top 10 economies, with other Asian nations, including Australia, among the top 20. Within 10 years, the combined GNP of East Asia will be in the vicinity of $9 trillion, just above those of North America and the European Union. As the Asian nations are important to us, so are we to them. We are already valued suppliers of technology and services, energy and raw materials as well as food. With trade barriers declining and cooperation at many different levels on the increase, there will be great opportunities for even more trade and investment and brighter outcomes for Australians, resulting in more jobs.",71

179,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I agree, but not under your government.  engagement with Asia, including Malaysia, has taken great leaps forward. The trip of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to China was an enormous success and you need only read such luminaries as Paul Kelly, who does not usually support the government, to see that our forays into foreign affairs in Asia have met with great success. By linking ourselves more closely with Asia, we are not doing so at the expense of our relationships with other world regions. On the contrary, by more closely identifying ourselves with our immediate region, we are opening up opportunities for improved and increased access to America through APEC. The Asia-Europe Meeting is also an important development. Asian nations have for some time been outward looking. Singapore declared itself a global city back in the 1970s. ASEM will strengthen the third leg in the economic power triangle and promote greater stability throughout the world. Taking a role in ASEM would further our ties with Europe. It is to be hoped that our efforts to join that forum will be successful, but we cannot truly become a part of Asia by merely showing our neighbours our location on a map. Since coming to office the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) have worked tirelessly to improve Australia's standing in our immediate geographical region. They have stressed that Asia is our top priority and that it will remain so in the long term. Thus far we have received backing for ASEM membership from, among others, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. Malaysia, however, perhaps still cautious from a run-in with our former Prime Minister, is still expressing some doubts and has vetoed our membership. Australia cannot afford to let misapprehensions linger. While our culture and heritage may still be predominantly western, our geography and our national interests demand that we commit ourselves to Asia. Along with trade, there is the omnipresent issue of defence. It goes without saying that trust between nations is a great step toward security. As increased trade will help stabilise the region further, so too will the continuing and growing exchange of students through university programs promote understanding and appreciation of different culture and custom. Backing our commitment to friendship and a shared peace are defence agreements with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, our more traditional links with the United States and New Zealand, and other less formal arrangements with other Asian nations. The environment, to which the coalition has demonstrated its commitment by funding the biggest natural heritage projects in Australian history, is another winner from increased area cooperation. International borders have traditionally spelt trouble for the environment as nations have placed their own financial concerns above the environmental needs of others. But the new levels of dialogue will result in greater awareness of and less damage to our ecosystems. The groundwork done by this government will provide unimaginable gains in the medium to longer haul. To truly capitalise on these opportunities, we must be able to put our money where our mouths are. We need a stable economy, not the rollercoaster we have only just managed to climb off. Membership of an elite forum is an honour that entails responsibilities. We will be able to fully meet those only if our house is in good financial order. We cannot be, or afford to be seen as, the weak link in a powerful chain. It would seem that where independence was seen as an end goal, it is now the case that global interdependence is in vogue. Australia is still a young country, beset with teething problems that some others successfully negotiated a long time ago. Yet we are a nation of unbounded potential and we are beginning to realise it. The way we have been and the way we have viewed ourselves has changed down through the years since white settlement, jerked in one direction or another by unifying or divisive events that have marked our history. The way we look at others has similarly changed. It was not so long ago that official government policy encouraged a homogenous society. Today we better reflect the world around us. Australia is the most successful immigrant nation on earth-and I know that the member for Calwell at least agrees with that. As we have embraced the waves of newcomers to our shores, our diversity has become a positive rather than a negative. As we continue to grow and diversify, so will we continue to change and mature as a nation. That is not to say that we must surrender any of our sovereign rights as a nation, but rather become an integral piece of a larger puzzle. Mutual understanding and cooperation between Australia and our regional neighbours is a necessity and quite possibly, in time, an inevitability. In any case, it is most definitely the formula for our future prosperity. Yet some whose attitudes are buried in the past, whose minds are filled with yesterday's ideas and whose passions are fired by simplistic nonsense that fails the basic test of logic are telling us we must insulate ourselves against change. They will take little comfort from the words of Ross FitzGerald, who opined in his recent book Is Australia an Asian country?: We have now moved beyond the point where we needed just to broaden our intellectual horizons also beyond the point where Asian skills and literacy were simply important. They are now essential. For mainstream Australia. In the modem world there are many questions and the answers may be more elusive than ever. But as Thomas Wolfe said, 'You can't go home again,' and the one solution that certainly will fail is any attempt to tum back the clock. The great reformers opposite do not for a moment believe that we can tum back. But their old habit of putting politics before people turned their lust into laziness as they tumbled from incumbency to irrelevancy. This government is determined to meet the challenges and demands of a changing world and determined that Australians are offered every opportunity to prosper. To do so will require stability, a solid foundation on which we can build. We are more interested on this side of the House in headline balances than we are in headlines, and this budget is a good indication of that. We cannot promise fair weather, but we will continue to rig a tight ship that will endure any storms and plot a course far from that treacherous route travelled by Labor. This budget is strong, it is fair, and it grants the Australian people a small dividend, with promise of greater spoils in the years to come as our policies take root. I thank the House.",74
180,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Scullin) (8.20 p.m.)Regrettably, like the first Howard budget, the second does nothing for the most pressing problem in the electorate of Scullin. For the second budget in a row the government has failed to address the issue of unemployment and is content to abrogate its responsibility in this area. Whether it be through the massive cuts to the Public Service or through the massive cuts to industry assistance or through the destruction of labour market programs, the government has shown that it is not interested in tackling this massive problem. Its own budget forecasts on unemployment and its refusal to set a target for the reduction of unemployment are sad indictments of its performance in this area. In the budget in August of last year, the and Treasurer (Mr Costello) predicted that unemployment would go to 8.25 per cent by the end of the financial year. Soon after, he was moved to amend that prediction to 8.5 per cent. But even that prediction, which is only about three or four months old, is out. At the end of the financial year, unemployment will reach about 8.7 per cent. In this budget, what is unemployment predicted to drop to? It is predicted to drop to eight per cent. Even if this figure of eight per cent is achieved, it is a totally unacceptable figure. To further complicate the situation, the proposed brave new world of privatised employment assistance has been delayed due to the incompetence of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) in policy administration. Even awaiting a flawed policy has resulted in a huge amount of uncertainty for those involved in or seeking to be involved in employment service provision and, more importantly, for the hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians. To add insult to injury, the minister then threatens to bypass the parliament and implement her regime by regulation. The sorry handling of this episode reflects the fact that dealing with unemployment is just not a priority for this government. This budget contains some hidden nasties which will have a significant impact on some constituents in my electorate. I speak of the abolition of the family resource centre program in this budget, a decision I believe to be short sighted and regressive. This mean-spirited decision was taken arbitrarily, without any consultation. It was taken when, as far as I am aware, all published evaluations of the FRC program have underscored the considerable benefits that these centres have brought to the communities that they service. For instance, a 1994 post-implementation review undertaken by an independent consultant, Purdon and Associate, found: .. , the FRC Program has been implemented successfully and is operating efficiently ... The decision reveals the total sham of this government's claim to budget honesty. Where in the budget and budget related papers does it say that family resource centres are to close? Well, the answer is nowhere-not a word. This decision is cloaked in secrecy. Under the innocuous heading 'Broadbanding of family services' one finds the following sentence: Savings will be achieved by refocusing some projects and programs from 1 January 1998. Believe it or not, this means the abolition of a $4.7 million program involving 11 family resource centres across Australia-a decision not highlighted. This is not budget honesty. It is a farrago of deception and incompetence. In part, the decision has implications that redefine the role of the federal government in the provision of services to families. One thing must be clear: under no circumstances can the transfer of some of the funds to direct family services at youth activity centres be considered a replacement for the work of the family resource centres. This is the excuse that is being given to those that have taken an interest in this subject since budget-I might say, people who only learnt of the decision a couple of days after the budget after great investigation. If a case can be made for the federal government to get into the provision of direct services to families, something that since the late 1980s has been done by the states exclusively, then it should be funded by a separate appropriation. What is the rationale for this leap into the dark of direct service provision? If you ask the association of services supporting Australia's families, they do not know. In fact, they have asked this incompetent minister: where is the policy development behind the decision? One would also like to ask: how will the new family support networks in youth activity support centres operate? How will they relate to family support services already funded by state and territory government? There are no answers because there is no policy rationale. This is a government flying blind, attempting to cloak a cut to services. Family resource centres were created by the former Labor government to address issues of social justice, including social justice on the fringes of major cities. Social justice might be an unfashionable concept in the Howard government, but the issues have not gone away. Since its inception in 1992, the Whittlesea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre, located in Thomastown in the electorate of Scullin, has played a crucial role in enhancing services to the public and families by supporting service providers and community groups. The key word is 'enhancing'. It has helped many groups to help themselves. I thought that was something this government thought highly of. Over the years, the family resource centre has assisted literally hundreds of local community groups with information, coordination, training and support. Through those groups it has helped thousands of people-within their families and as individuals. Last year, for example, the family resource centre provided desktop publishing assistance to 100 local community groups and agencies; updated and distributed in eight community languages a comprehensive community directory; and published a young people's services informathe tion card and distributed it to all people of secondary school age. This card was launched by a Liberal backbencher, representing the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who, at the very time of the launch of this important service for young people, was putting a red line through the whole program. What unbelievable hypocrisy! Last year, the local family resource centre interviewed and placed over 150 volunteersnot unemployed people dragooned by a punitive government, but actual volunteers. The FRC facilitated the provision of 12 major training sessions for local agencies on topics such as good employment practices, multicultural awareness, parent education, children's services, human resource management, competitive tendering and changes to family law. The beneficiaries of this training are community based agencies and groups who otherwise would not have had access to this type of training. In the Victorian context, that sort of training for community groups is becoming all the more important. Because of the actions of the federal government and the continuing actions over the past five years of the Kennett state government, community organisations are having to do more and more to assist within the communities that they represent. Whether it be schools or community services, much more emphasis is being placed on the ability of community agencies to manage things themselves. In an area like the City of Whittlesea, like other areas in the Plenty Valley growth corridor, the people involved in the committees of management of these agencies need assistance. They need a helping hand. What the family resource centres have done is maximise the effort of these community agencies. The family resource centre has assisted over 20 groups with submissions for government funding. The bottom line is that most of these things will not be done after the family resource centre has gone. Its loss will be keenly felt in an area of considerable disadvantage. The reality is that community based organisations and community groups do not have the financial scope to do for themselves the things that were possible through the family resource centre. The decision to abolish family resource centres has revealed a minister well out of her depth, an incompetent minister. In addition, it reveals something far more sinister about where the government is drawing policy ideas from. The family resource centres rate a mention in that ambivalent document-the report of the National Commission of Audit. They are mentioned as one of the programs in the Department of Health and Family Services which, it is claimed, duplicates state delivered services and therefore is something that the Commonwealth should not spend money on. When the report of the National Commission of Audit was released, it appeared to be buried very quickly. The government appeared not to rely on it much and made little mention of it. At the time, it was stated that there was to be no formal government response to the National Commission of Audit's report. There does not need to be a formal response because the government's response has been to implement the recommendations of the National Commission of Audit by stealth over the last two budgets. As it was with the government's whole policy on child care, the decision to defund the family resource centre comes right out of the National Commission of Audit's report. The real problem is that, in doing that, the added excuse or the alternative offered for the funds that are being removed from the family resource centre-that is, expanded direct service provision-flies in the face of other things that the National Commission of Audit has been indicating. In fact, the National Commission of Audit's report overlooks that what was promised in the area akin to family resource centres, especially in Victoria, never materialised. Whilst there was a promise to implement a program that would have supported community agencies, it never materialised. Not content with defunding important programs which provide practical support, the government then perpetrated a great hoax on the Australian public with its savings tax rebate. This scheme is a scheme in every sense of the word. It breaks the coalition's promise to deliver the government superannuation contribution. This is a promise which, despite all its protestations, was one which was fairly and squarely taken on board by the present government. It replaces the superannuation contribution with a pathetic substitute which will do nothing towards improving national savings. One only has to look at the front page article in the Sydney Morning Herald today which quotes the Secretary to the Treasury. When asked whether the $2 billion cost to the government could exceed any increase in saving by individuals, Mr Evans told the committee: Yes, there is that risk. The article goes on to state: He answered ""yes"" to questions that the rebate could be obtained in full by taxpayers who had not increased their savings, or had reduced their savings in any given financial year, and said it might trigger higher savings only by small numbers of taxpayers. The government should rely on the Treasury advice that it was getting about this scheme. I remind the House that, on the day after the budget was brought down, when the Treasurer was asked what the Treasury's advice was about whether the scheme would boost national savings, the Treasurer told this chamber: What the Treasury policy is doesn't matter to the Government. That is an indication that the Treasury advice was overlooked. As I have said, the government only had to look at the lack of success of policy initiatives similar to this tax savings scheme overseas. In a 1995 OECD report, when they reviewed the success or otherwise of tax exempt saving policies in its 24-member countries, the OECD found: . . . there is no clear evidence that the level of taxation, along with other factors of return, significantly affects the level of household saving. Despite this, the government has this scheme. Unless somebody has done search and would like to accuse me of some form of hypocrisy, I will come clean with chamber tonight. Back in 1991 in a private member's debate and earlier in an appropriought ation debate, I indicated that I supported investigation of a scheme modelled on the British Tessa scheme. The attraction to that scheme in policy terms at the time was that it was a new scheme that, in part, promised to be targeted to people with smaller savings. It had the attraction of encouraging people with small expired) amounts of savings to be part of a wider scheme. But it was also proposed before major reforms that were made to occupational superannuation in this country-before the major superannuation policy reforms that Labor governments made. It ought to be remembered that the superannuation reforms of the Labor governments had a dual purfrom pose-not only to ensure that in the workers of Australia could sufficiently cover their income support in retirement, but a device to boost the level of national savings. The thing that has characterised this debate is the cries that we hear from those people opposite that in some way the value of the things that were proposed to be done in superannuation were going to take too long. We heard the cry, 'Oh, yes, but the benefits are 20 or 30 years out.' I say to put that case that that is the point. Australia as a nation has to realise that the things that we have to do today to address not only an individual's ability to cover themselves in their retirement but also the ability of Australia as a nation to build a proper national savings pool are long-term policies. They are policies where we have to make hard decisions now and where we will probably only see the effect in a number of years. There is no short-term fix. An article in the New Statesman on 31 January 1997, an article critical of schemes like Tessa in Britain, was under the banner that affect the rate line: Despite tax inducements, Britons still aren't saving for their old age. put in place Here is the crunch: Soon they will have to be coerced, unless they can adequate refirst be re-educated. The thing that this article indicates that is the required-it is something that in this debate within Australia we ought to return to and to understand-is that there either has to be compUlsion or a change in the cultural thinking about superannuation and savings. Gimmicky schemes like the savings tax rebate will not do anything. They are a gimmick, there is no proof that they will increase the national savings pool and, in fact, they are not directed in the most equitable fashion. (Time",76
181,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS," Mr the Deputy Speaker, you and I both know the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) reasonably well through our committee work. He must the have agonised over giving that speech because he is a very decent man, from all my contact with him. I notice that he stayed away a lot of the familiar Labor lines, and I retirement respect him for that. The coalition's second budget is a plan for Australia that has four key aims: creating the conditions for real jobs growth, helping families save, encouraging small businesses to invest and expand, and ensuring Australia pays its way again. I described last year's August budget as the foundation stone for a better future for all Australians. This year's 13 May budget could be described as the first those who layer of building blocks. Within a three-year parliamentary term, the coalition intends to tum what was a $10.3 billion underlying Labor deficit into a $1.6 billion surplus. These figures have real meaning to the people of Dunkley. They mean lower interest rates, which means money back in the pockets of every resident who has a housing or car loan, anyone who has borrowed to invest, anyone who has a Visa card bill and all businesses that rely on finance to employ people in the production of goods and services. We as a nation can again proudly proclaim that we are paying our way. Already since the budget we have seen the Reserve Bank decrease the cost of money by another half a per cent. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) pointed out, this brings the total gain for a home owner with a $100,000 mortgage to $292 of after tax money a month since the coalition was elected 15 months ago. It is not often that people receive a bonus pay rise of $75 a week because of the government's good performance, but this is what has happened. The most important reaction to the budget is from people who create jobs, because increasing the number of job opportunities is the key and very positive payback for the citizens of Dunkley. A major focus over the next year will be to build upon the results of the coalition's first 12 months, which in Frankston and Mornington has seen 900 fewer people receiving income support through unemployment than was the case a year ago. Those who seek to oppose the work of the government and myself to grow job opportunities, to encourage small business and to encourage investment in the local area denigrate the numerous positive employment signs there are in the Dunkley community. What do those opposite offer? They are saying, 'Let's go back to the good old daysyou know, the ones we couldn't afford. The ones where the Bankcard was run dry, and then some.' That is their offer. They are the conditions that created the problem we have today, yet all we get from those opposite is, 'We need to go back to them.' What an extraordinary admission that they have no idea how to solve the problems that they have created. Instead, it is left to the coalition to deal with. I was delighted to see the Institute of Chartered Accountants, whose members advise many Dunkley businesses, say in their account of the budget: By not imposing any additional charges on business, by quarantining industry assistance and maintaining the 125 per cent research and development program, the Government has shown it is prepared to give business a chance to grow and create more jobs.",79
182,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,Don't mislead. You cut the program. Mr Sercombe-That's after they swept it out last budget.,80
183,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"They said that this is a government prepared to give business a chance to grow and create more jobs. I will say it slowly so those opposite can pick it up. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, whose members make major investment decisions, was similarly positive, with Mark Paterson saying: This is a very good Budget. Its most important characteristic is stability. No boats are rocked. No plans are unhinged. No plans are created. Sometime over the next two years it is highly probable that the government will be able to finance a major cut in taxes without creating any additional financial strains. It is a very good budget, laying the foundations for tax cuts. Mr Jenkins-Ooh!",80
184,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I am very encouraged by the positive response from the member for Scullin. AIIan Handberg of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures commented that the budget measures would lift smaII business and rightly suggested that smaII business certainly got a greater share of the spotlight and an abnormaIIy high level of focus. The Reserve Bank Governor, Ian Macfarlane, has already predicted that economic growth this coming financial year will be four per cent above the budget's forecast. I will be happy if this turns out to be the case because growth of this amount in a low inflation, low interest rate environment means more jobs and wealth for the people of Dunkley. Could I remind the House that the in coalition's achievements are in stark contrast way to go. to what happened under Labor. We are paying our way. We are not peddling irresponsible spending. We are not harking back to those nostalgic thoughts and wonderful policies that created the problem in the first place. We actually getting on with the job. Those ite tell us, 'But we would've spent more money on this and we would've spent more money on that.' In the last six years of office, those opposite racked up $75 billion in debt but created only 7,100 permanent jobs. It not take a genius to work out the price of each of those jobs, and over how think that is a proud achievement. Pity them. The headline grabbing centrepiece of the already budget is the savings initiative. Unlike what the member for Scullin said would happen under the l-a-w law tax cuts and then the office ... superannuation co-contribution-that movable feast that they never really got around to delivering, the one where, for the benefits they were talking about, the Labor Party's hand would have been in your wallet again get a piece of the action-we have introduced a savings initiative. Paddy MCGuinness notes in the Age: ... it ... represents the very first time an Ian government has financially recognised desirability of encouraging small individual and looks forward from the present necessity government savings by way of a fiscal surplus ... More encouraging news. The savings tax rebate of 15c in the dollar is attractive. The Labor Party is spreading the lie that people need to have $60,000 in the bank earning interest at a rate of five per cent to claim maximum $450 rebate. Wrong, those opposite-wrong! This is incorrect. Not only does the qualifying income from savings include interest income from dividends, rent, capital gains, private pensions and annuities as well as income from partnerships, businesses and trusts; it does include income from bank accounts. As well as this wide range of income, the rebate is also available for people's own contributions to superannuation schemesing contributions they would make as their deciBankers sion, not with your help by having your hand their wallets. I think that is a reasonable The thing that also contrasts this initiative with the Labor Party proposal is that people who actually need it most get a benefit, whereas under Labor the top end of the town, are those whom they keep saying they detest-I opposthink the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) said in a contribution one day that he thought they needed a good spanking-was rewarded most with their initiatives. What we have done is actually target it to everybody who is does making a contribution to national savings-a vivid contrast once again. As economist Ross there they someGittins points out: ... this additional dimension to the savings tax rebate will be a boon to the many people who make their own contributions either to their employer's super scheme or a scheme they've organised themselves through their bank or life Because low income earners on up to $31,000 a year are already eligible for a tax rebate of lOc in the dollar on superannuation contributions up to $1,000, they will get a 25 per cent to bonus for the first $1,000 of super. It is a wonderful initiative. Isn't that a contrast to what those opposite were offering? They were going to say, 'We'll give you a bit and you Australcan have it back some 40 years down the the track' - that is what would have happened savings under their model-'but we just have to let of you know that it'll be our hand in your wallet.' So when people go home and wonder why they cannot quite afford to make that extra little payment on their Visa card or why their kids cannot quite have what they are after, they can thank the Labor Party for the having their hand in their wallet once again. Research by Bankers Trust demonstrates that the savings rebate will clearly benefit low income earners. People earning less than $40,000 a year hold nearly $4 out of every $5 which the saving rebate covers.",80
185,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,Do you have a single original idea?,81
186,Mr BILSON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I appreciate that the member opposite who is at the desk is catchon to what a wonderful initiative this is. Trust suggests that :he two lowest income groups, earning up to $20,000, are clearly the greatest proportionate beneficiaries. This is great news for the people of Dunkley. I am waiting for an interjection. It is great news, isn't it? And we pause to take it in. It is fantastic news. The 15c in the dollar rebate will also benefit the people who retire and take either an annuity or a lump sum. Labor's hate for self-funded retirees again manifests itself in their opposition to this proposal. I might mention that the government's specific provision in the budget to fund pension increases by the new benchmark of 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings is another great contribution to stability, certainty and security for elderly Australians. Labor promised us that they had this funded but, when we look through the forward estimates, those same estimates they could not fund anyway, we find there was no provision for this. Isn't that a disgrace? What a terrible trick to play on the elderly members of my community. I am glad that we have rectified that-again, another oversight by the Labor Party. Creating the conditions for more jobs is the key government aim. A properly educated work force is essential. This is why I found the accent of the budget on providing $159 million to literacy and numeracy so refreshing. Australia's 10,000 schools will share $152 million to help primary school children to read and write adequately. The coalition's jobs pathway program will be expanded, with $20 million a year being provided. I note the good work of the Peninsula Institute of TAPE, which have already nearly met their target of 60 positions for school leavers from last year's smaller initial program. I certainly welcome the contribution from my former secondary college at Monterey and in Frankston North because they see that this is just the sort of program to help their community. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has secured the agreement of all states that children should be adequately literate and numerate by grade 3. If we can achieve this, the result will be an Australia that is more competitive against the rest of the world. This is the best way to ensure that the people in Dunkley continue to enjoy more opportunities. It is terrible that after 13 years of Labor governments almost one in three 14-year-olds in year 9 did not have adequate literacy and numeracy skills. Just disgraceful. Over the next four years government schools will receive $2.3 billion more in funding from the federal coalition government. Real funding per government school student will increase by 17 per cent. For nongovernment school students, the increase per head will be 14 per cent. This gives the lie to disgraceful claims by a Democrat senator that the government is neglecting government school students. Nothing is further from the truth. For tertiary students at Monash Peninsula, the introduction of a 25 per cent discount for up-front payment of higher education contributions will prove beneficial. Taxpayers are still paying up to three-quarters of the cost of a university education for each local student, but the government is keen to make it easier for students to pay off their interest-free loans. Monash Peninsula inform me that their enrolment figures met their targets for this year. On an equivalent full-time basis, they have 2,650 students studying at the always improving MCMahons Road campus this year. In education, one of their main faculties, I understand both the entrance scores and enrolments increased. In nursing and in computing, the story was the same. In business and the relatively small course of art and design they run with the Monash Caulfield campus, there was little change. So much for Labor's lies and scare tactics about students deserting university because of changes to the HECS system. As I alluded to above, many Dunkley residents are elderly. I am pleased that organisations like Alzheimers Australia have publicly welcomed the government's plan for people with dementia and for their carers. The increase in the domiciliary nursing care benefit and an extension to 63 days a year of respite care before allowances paid to carers are affected are both welcome. As Anne-Marie Mioche from the Carers Association of Australia said, the changes to the child disability allowance would help to ensure that this taxpayer funded benefit goes to the carers with the most disabled children, those who need it most. The domiciliary nursing benefit paid to the carers of people who need nursing home care will also be increased by $16.60 a fortnight. I have a particular interest in the area of caring for intellectually disabled young people as they go through their maturing years, and I believe we need to focus more attention on that area. This is a budget about people. It is about the right conditions to improve the lot of the home buyers, the car buyers, the aged, those with additional care needs, families with children and job generators such as Dunkley's small businesses. I think it is a terrific budget. I encourage those opposite to acquaint themselves with the very constructive measures that are in it. I thank the deputy whip for reminding me of our undertaking to those opposite and I will conclude my remarks at this point.",81
187,Mr SERCOMBE,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"As the member from the Frankston comic opera company, the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson), has just told us by analogy, the budget is a little like building blocks. I can tell him that the building blocks are already cracking. There is no mortar between the blocks and they are being put on the wrong foundations. So the analogy is not all that crash hot. I think the overwhelming concern of Australians nowadays is about security. It is about job security. It is about financial security. It is about security in times of sickness and old age. It is about personal security from violence to the person and from attack on property. It is about national security. It is not an Australian community that is relaxed and comfortable, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have it. It is a community that has real fears. It is a community where the apparent permanence of continuing high levels of unemployment contribute to high levels of insecurity. It is a community that has very deep-seated frustrations about a government that cannot see the sense of support and encouragement for Australian industry. We are dealing with a situation of slow economic growth that is forecast downwards to 31,4 per cent this financial year. Despite a healthy world economy estimated to be growing at about 5.5 per cent and despite housing recoveries, the fact is that Australia's economic growth rates are simply unacceptably low. It is worth noting, however, that not all Australians are experiencing low economic growth. The Business Review Weekly's rich list just recently published shows that the top 200 Australians in the last year experienced 10 per cent growth in their incomes, three times that of the growth rate of the economy as a whole. Even the Reserve Bank Governor recognises that the economy can sustain a four per cent growth rate without developing inflationary problems. That is the sort of growth rate regularly and consistently achieved by Labor governments. Without that growth, unemployment will simply stay unacceptably high into the next century. What does the government do in response to this? It mouths off about industrial relations. That is not very convincing from the point of view of the work force. It has got an absolutely fraudulent work for the dole scheme that is not going to create a single additional real job. We have the federation slush fund as a method of providing some government input into the economy. But that of course is not going to create any jobs until at least July 1998. So this is a government that is doing nothing about the most substantial concerns of Australians: jobs and job security. The government's performance on jobs is a bit like a rather corny movie I saw a while back called Flatliners. It is simply dead flat. This was a movie about some medical students who were succeeding in becoming flatliners in terms of the medical pattern on whatever the thing is that registers heartbeats. They were getting their heartbeats down to a flat line. Mr Andrew Thomson-An ECG.  mentary Secretary. It is an economy that, on the ECG of economics, is a flatliner. We are dealing with the situation where Treasury has rounded up its unemployment forecast to 8% per cent. Since the coalition has been in office, there are some 31,500, in absolute numbers, additional unemployed people and 44,000 additional long-term unemployed people. In my part of Melbourne, the outer west, there is 1 1.2 per cent unemployment. That is several points higher than the national and state averages. The figures in April showed a very small drop in the outer west of Melbourne, but that was more than offset by a drop in the participation rate. So some parts of the community suffer more than others. Last year the government axed a range of government programs, job schemes, skills programs and industry programs, including very important ones in the research and development area, and there were cuts to export market development grants. Now more of those sorts of cuts have come. We heard the member for Dunkley talking about quarantining. There is not much point quarantining dead animals, and many of the government's industry support programs are dead. We have got cuts to vocational educationsomething like $250 million in the last two years. Apprenticeships are down. We have seen the attacks on tertiary education, particularly its fairness and equity, when it is recognised that human capital is reaUy the core to a successful, modem, competitive Australian economy in the future. We have seen $280 million cut out of child care, thereby attacking the capacity of many families to really work in our economy. It is no wonder that people are insecure. It is not just the young who experience these issues. Increasingly and tragicaUy many people in their forties and fifties are facing the reality that, with the sort of abysmaUy low economic growth rates which this government is overseeing, there are no real prospects in many cases for them working into the future. We have a government that sits idly by, on the best interpretation; on the worse interpretaproportion tion, it is contributing further to the problem. There are 20,000 more jobs to go from Telstra and an additional 8,000 Defence jobs to go. We have a government that dithers on the car industry. We have a government that apparently cannot see that we do have the basis for a competitive, quality, export-oriented car industry in Australia, an industry that needs cooperative relations with government in order to continue to invest in Australia and provide a core for Australian manufacturing. As I indicated in a speech not that long ago, there are plenty of places for companies to invest. For example, earlier this year General Motors commenced construction of a $750 million plant for the production of Opel vehicles in Thailand. What is required is genuine commitment and support for important industries that underpin our manufacturing capacity. We have a government that simply dithers on that at present. We have an important debate to come up in the near future on the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, a $10 billion Australian industry which generates $1 billion in exports. Companies such as BradmiU in the western suburbs of Melbourne say, 'Important components of industry support schemes' - the import credit scheme-'have allowed us to commit millions of dollars to our position as an important Australian manufacturer.' The downgrading of the import credit scheme and its eventual abolition is affecting them right now. They are facing the end of their ability to continue at the same scale and to imagine further growth here. That is just one example of a government that is sitting idly by when crucial decisions about manufacturing jobs and man""ufacturing industry in this country are on the line. We hear ministers bleating in defence of this about the World Trade Organisation. In terms of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, recently the director of the textiles division of that organisation in Brussels, Mr Jan-Erik Sorenson, made the following comments: Full integration of textile and clothing into WTO rules may lawfully be postponed until the very end of the phaseout period (January 1 2005) for a large of the products which the ATCthe agreement on textiles af'd clothingcovers. It is very clear in press reports that a whole range of countries, including the United States, continue to heavily protect their industry by means that Australia does not: through non-tariff barriers such as quotas. It is quite clear that those countries, like Australia, do not intend to engage in unilateral disarmament in important areas of our manufacturing industry. It is no wonder that many Australians feel intense insecurity. Financial insecurity is a matter on many people's minds when they look at the government scrapping the superannuation contribution policy. It is a huge blow to many individuals in their longer term prospects in retirement, as well as a huge blow to real national savings. A young worker in his midthirties on average weekly earnings is going to be $110,000 worse off when he eventually retires as a result of the government scrapping the policy which the Labor Party had in place. We all agree with the fundamental importance of national savings. Something like $400 billion over the next few decades-the three per cent worker superannuation plan, plus the matching contributions-is going to be forgone for some mickey mouse scheme that the government has dreamed up, primarily to benefit people who are saving already. No wonder there is cynicism about and an increased sense of financial insecurity. When it comes to security in old age and sickness, if you are rich and healthy enough to defer the age pension, just maybe you will get a bit of help from the government. If you are rich enough, you can have the best medicine; if you are not, you get it on the cheap. We have a government that, in the last budget, cut $500 million from the pharmaceutical benefits list, another $700 million in this hit and a number of medicines coming off, notably medicines for stomach problems, muscle pains, diarrhoea and anti-fungal medicines. If you are rich enough, you can get into a nursing home without selling your house. Hospital waiting lists continue to get longer and facilities continue to deteriorate our aged and our ill. We huve the minister bleating about that being the responsibility of the states. We all know that there are plenty of policy initiatives that can be taken from the Commonwealth to address the fiscal shifting that states may be tempted to do. But this government simply wants to bleat; it does not want to address the problem. Personal security was referred to. It is self evident that if you are in a society with young people without hope, where there is intense pressure on families, that you are going to produce all sorts of social dysfunction which, in tum, produces crime and violence. That social dysfunction perhaps most starkly can be seen with the drugs problem that many commentators see is inundating Australian society. We had President Clinton in this very chamber towards the end of last year referring to the intense seriousness of this problem in societies like Australia and the need for extraordinarily strong and concerted action. Just the other day the chairman of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board said that the drugs trade was comparable in scale to the international oil trade. It is certainly a trade that underpins much crime. It is a trade that does not respond simply to law enforcement measures. Obviously, our society needs to attack drug use and the problems that it generates, including crime on a multifaceted basis. It is a health problem and there is a range of social issues. But it certainly demands a law enforcement response as well as part of that strategy. What does this budget achieve? It achieves a cut in the Australian Federal Police budget from $250 million to $238 million; a cut in the Australian Customs Service budget from $386 million to $367 million; a cut in the AUSTRAC budget-a small but increasingly vital law enforcement agency, vital because of the role it plays in tracking the money trail, particularly internationally, and Australia is a leading edge international player in that area-from $8.3 million to $7.8 million; and a cut in the Director of Public Prosecution's budget from $58 million to $53 million. In the spirit of generosity, I suppose I should acknowledge that there has been a for small increase in some sections of the budget of the National Crime Authority, but there are still substantial problems in that organisation that I as a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, along with government members, am aware of. Out of respect for the importance of the operations of that organisation, it is not appropriate to detail in a public situation some of the areas of operation that do not continue now because of resource problems. But if the minister at the table-the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp)-----cared to have a discussion with coalition members of that committee, he would find out very quickly that, taken together with the budget cuts to the Federal Police, the Customs Service and AUSTRAC, there have to be very serious doubts raised about how serious this government is in making a significant contribution to people's personal safety-the safety of people from violence, the safety of people from drugs and the safety of people's personal property. Given the priorities and the cutbacks it is overseeing in key budget areas, we have to doubt the government's seriousness. In the list of security issues that concerned people, I referred to national security. I guess nothing is more important in the longer term in that respect than the way in which we conduct our foreign policy and the image this country projects. What have we seen from this government? We have seen all the wrong messages being communicated. We have seen cutbacks to Radio Australia and its vital services in terms of communicating an image of Australia within our region. We have seen the Prime Minister's failure to lead on crucial issues relate to race, particularly Asian immigration. And we have seen the reinforcement of stereotypes that are extraordinarily unhelpful to Australia within our region. We have seen a government that has presided over 10 per cent cuts to overseas aid. We have seen a government that has axed the DIFF scheme. We have seen a government generating unnecessary tensions in its relations with China and then proceeding to undergo the prime ministerial kowtow, a most embarrassing spectacle. We have seen the abysmal failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in trying to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. We have seen the collapse of the Australian-European Union framework agreement negotiations. And the list goes on. In the area of defence, the government does not seem to understand the vital importance to this nation's security of a range of fundamental industries and the support those industries need, particularly industries such as heavy engineering and shipbuilding. I simply do not believe-and I do not think anyone in the industry believes-the government's position in relation to the future of ADI and the future of shareholdings in the Australian Submarine Corporation. There really has been a failure on the part of this government to have a vision and a depth of vision about this country's position in the world. That is most alarming for all Australians. I come back to my starting point. This is a government, to use the member for Dunkley's building blocks analogy, which is pretty badly flawed. If it tries to put the building up with these building blocks, it is going to fall down pretty quick. It is a government that does not fundamentally address the key security issues-the issues of job security, financial security, security in old age and sickness, security from personal assault and crime and national security. Those areas of concern, I believe, are the most fundamental things on the minds of Australians at the present time.",83
188,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to support the second budget of the HowardFischer government. I would like to comthat mence my speech by referring to a speech I gave in a grievance debate in March this year about self-funded retirees. Members who graciously listened to that speech will recollect that approximately one million people or about seven per cent of our population finance all or part of their retirement. As our population ages, it is now calculated that the number of Australians over 65 will increase from 12 per cent to 20 per cent by the year 2030. Unfortunately, I cannot give a more precise figure because no government has ever instructed the Australian Bureau of Statistics to record or analyse data on self-funded retirees. After years of neglect, it would be appropriate and very constructive if the Australian Bureau of Statistics considered the necessary steps to have information about self-funded retirees recorded. The creation of an accurate database would be the first step on the road to helping self-funded retirees. More importantly, however, self-funded retirees would like the government to consider allocating a minister to be responsible for the affairs of self-funded retirees. I make no apologies for reminding my colleagues that groups such as Aboriginals, pensioners and small business owners have ministers to oversee their affairs. These ministers actively make submissions to cabinet and go into battle for their stakeholders. Self-funded retirees are Australians. They are Australians who have budgeted, they are Australians who have saved and they are Australians who have planned for their retirement. Self-funded retirees are an asset to our country. They have invested their hard-won capital in Australia and assisted in the country's development, yet they have no minister to support them. Self-funded retirees need to be encouraged. It is unfortunate that there is a perception in the community and by some members in this place that, if you are not a pensioner, you have bucket loads of money. A classic example is the Labor Party's tawdry attempt to means test the government's new savings tax cut. If Labor had had their way, self-funded retirees would have missed out again. The federal government's new tax cut on savings is worth up to $450 a year for self-funded retirees. For years under Labor, there was no incentive to save. Labor actually penalised us for saving by taxing our interest. But the coalition's new tax cut on savings means that all of us, including self-funded retirees, will be eligible for a tax rebate to $3,000 of savings interest. Furthermore, self-funded retirees will be able to claim a rebate on personal superannuation contributions, which will be a real benefit if they are living on the returns from their savings. However, more needs to be done for this group, particularly in the area of health care. The government's private health insurance rebate is a step in the right direction. As I mentioned before, the self-funded retirees are a group of elderly Australians who should be rewarded for all they have done for this country. One of the reasons Australia is such a wonderful country is that there is an ethic that people are entitled to a fair go. We must now ask ourselves why a section of the population who have put aside investments to finance their retirement have not been getting a fair go. I would also like to focus the House's attention on another group of people whose work is unheralded and unsung: Australia'carers, who look after the sick, the disable and the elderly. Carers enable people to stay in their homes where they might otherwise have to live in a hospital, a hospice, a nursing home or another type of institution. In August 1996 the government committed itself to the specific recognition of the efforts, needs and role carers play in the community. As a government we have committed $36.7 million to implement the national respite for carers program. The support for carers is something that is very close to my heart and further recognition of their work is my personal highlight in the 1997-98 budget. I am proud to have been a member of the government introducing these reforms. The 1997-98 budget will fund carer resource centres and a regional network of carer respite centres to the tune of $7 million. Carer resource centres will offer carers advice, counselling and valuable information services such as education programs. A major budget initiative includes a $20 million per year increase in the rate of domiciliary nursing care benefit. As a result, the domiciliary nursing care benefit will increase by $16.60 to $74.90 a fortnight from July next year. This change will bring it into line with the on up child care disability allowance. The carers package also addresses a number of inadequacies in the current income support arrangements for carers. I am delighted that, for the first time, people caring for a disabled child under the age of 16 will be eligible for a carers payment. Also from next July carers will be allowed 63 days respite-up from 52-for their caring duties before their benefits are affected. A special program is being set up for carers of people afflicted with dementia. It recognises dementia as a progressive and long-term disease and that carers need special assessment, education and support. A $2.3 million program will be provided each year for the needs of the dementia sufferers and their carers. The government will also extend the newstart allowance activity test exemption for temporary carers beyond the current 13 weeks in special circumstances. This increases the scope for the unemployed to provide care without losing their payments. It can be seen that the government is showing genuine compassion and concern for carers. As a government we have recognised, in a practical and tangible way, carers' needs, carers' problems and the importance of ongoing support. It is with great pleasure that I commend the present budget to the House.",86
189,Mr WILTON,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Isaacs) (9.19 p.m.)Contrary to the claim of the member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace), I wish to draw to the House's attention tonight the fact that this has been a small-minded budget by a small-minded government. It is a government bereft of vision and bereft of ideas. It is a government which has failed again with this year's budget to provide both hope and security for Australia's battlers. Let me turn now to the budget in some detail. If Australian industry thought that the government may have taken the opportunity presented to it by this year's budget to make amends for the detrimental policies it has pursued over the last 12 months or so then they are sadly mistaken. Even in the light of the horrendous news of the BHP closures, the government refuses to see the error of its ways. Last year the federal government ripped $2.9 billion out of industry assistance programs. This year the budget contains nothing better for Australian industry than a slowdown in these cuts. There is no suggestion of a reversal of the cuts that were imposed last year. Instead we are presented with another massive projected decline in assistance to our manufacturing industry. It is a decline which Treasury officials justify as 'a move in government policy away from sector specific assistance'. Specifically, the Howard government's policies will result in a decline from $561 million to $146 million in assistance to manufacturing between 1997-98 and 2000-0 l. Furthermore, it will result in a decline over the same period by some $26 million in assistance to exporters. And, of course, R&D assistance will be half a billion dollars less than it was when Labor was in government. What little good there is in this budget for industry are some measures which had already been announced. These are measures which the government was forced by Labor to accept, albeit reluctantly, as we fought here and in the Senate to save what we could of our highly successful industry support programs, which the government was hell-bent on destroying. These include the partial extension of the ships bounty and some additional funding for R&D projects. Unfortunately, these measures pale into insignificance when compared to the $2.9 billion worth of cuts imposed last year and, indeed, the further cuts this year, which include a 40 per cent cut to assistance to the pharmaceutical industry and the abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme, worth some $67 million. This government boasted in the election campaign that it would create 200,000 new manufacturing jobs by the year 2000. The reality is that, with devastating cuts to programs that produced real benefits for industry and the Australian economy and with the hands off rational approach that allows BRP to fold some of its major operations-and dependent upon the government's response to the Productivity Commission's disastrous recommendations for the motor industry-this government will soon be looking at a massive loss of jobs in our manufacturing sector. Before I examine a little more closely the whole notion of the outlook for jobs under this budget, I would like to stress the importance of this issue by quoting Envoy Derek Linsell from the Salvation Army in Cranbourne in my electorate of Isaacs. His recent comments on the topic of unemployment appeared in the Cranbourne Independent newspaper. Envoy Linsell said that unemployment was immoral. He said: Being unemployed rips the heart and soul out of people. He said: The problem is that rather than two per cent or three per cent being considered an acceptable level of unemployment in the country, we seem to have settled on nine per cent. It's just not acceptable as a way of life. Unemployment is just tragic. Those of us on this side of the House would agree wholeheartedly with Derek Linsell's comments. We therefore despair at the government's lack of acknowledgment of the depth of our unemployment problem. When Labor left office we had an unemployment rate of around eight per cent which was trending down. In the past 15 months, since this government took office, the rate has been trending up. I wish to score no particular political point in saying that unemployment is too high, except to make the House aware of that trend. Another point I would like to make on this jobs question is that there is no hope for jobs in this year's budget. Predictions of growth are far too low. Education and training programs have been absolutely slashed, and there will be further cutbacks in public sector employment. If I could look at those aspects in somewhat more detail, the government's forecast of economic growth at 3.75 per cent is far too low to make inroads into unemployment. It is generally accepted that a level of at least four per cent is needed to have any impact on the jobless figures. This year's budget forecasts a drop in unemployment to only eight per cent over the course of 199798. This must be taken with more than a grain of salt when we consider that last year the government predicted 8.25 per cent unemployment, and yet it rose to 8.5 per cent15,000 fewer jobs than the government had forecast. Last year $1.8 billion was cut from vital labour market programs. In this year's budget we see a further cut of $30 million. Despite the attempts of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp)-I am pleased to see him in the House this evening-to portray the government as providing $265 million for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98, funds for vocational education and training have in fact been cut and not increased. A sum of $72 million will be cut from vocational education and training grants to the states, adding to the $183 million cut from last year's budget. At least another 16,500 public service jobs will be lost in 1997-98. Approximately three-quarters of those job losses will be outside Canberra. The follow-on effect of those public sector job losses will be an estimated 4,125 private sector jobs also disappearing. The defence efficiency review will see a further 8,000 jobs going. That will have devastating effects on regional Australia, as it is in those areas that defence bases are primarily located. The work for the dole scheme--even by the admission of many in the government itself-will do nothing to reduce Australia's high and rising unemployment rate, because it does not provide what our young unemployed most need-skills training. The new Federation Fund, the Liberal Party's slush fund, will not contribute in any way to job generation in 1997-98, because the funding will not commence until the 1998-99 financial year. This budget is further proof that the Derek Linsells of the world will need to keep sounding warnings long and loud of the devastating effect of unemployment before this government will take any heed. On the question of health, health care has continued to cop it in the neck in this budget. The coalition government has shown that, when it comes to health and related community services, it has, over the past two budgets, completely disavowed any concept of accepting the fundamental responsibility of providing a basic, quality and equitable health service to all Australian families. The Labor Party and the vast majority of Australian families see this as a basic tenet of government which will help see them through times of stress and vulnerability. Despite the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) during the last election campaign that there was no secret plan to slash $10 billion from social welfare, even the most basic accounts would show that this is almost exactly what the government has done. The Prime Minister also promised to preserve Medicare. The name has stayed the same and it still has some of its old features but, effectively, it has been whittled away to a very poor imitation of its former self. Doctors' payments for home visits, for example, have been reduced. Gone will be the days when you could get a doctor to call and see you at your home-no matter how sick you may be. There is nothing in the budget for a public hospital system which has been starved of funding by the cumulative effects of cuts from both Commonwealth and state governments in the last few years. The results are that hospital waiting lists get longer and facilities continue to deteriorate. Having slashed the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in last year's budget by some $500 million, the government has gone and cut its funding by another $700 million this year under the guise of the therapeutic group premiums arrangement. This is nothing less than a new drugs tax. It means that Australians will pay more for the latest, the safest and best medication for such conditions as high blood pressure, depression, cholesterol and ulcers. Under this new drugs tax, the government will provide a full subsidy only for the cheapest drug in each of the six groups of drugs. If patients require one or more of these expensive drugs, they will have to pay the difference. Does the government suggest we find out the financial cost of a given illness before we get sick? If your doctor prescribes one of the new drugs because it is more suited to your condition or it has fewer side effects, you could pay up to $20 a script more. None of this new drugs tax will be calculated for this safety net threshold. It will be getting so branch. that we will have to consult our financial advisers before we get medical advice. What we will be faced with is a two-tiered health system: one tier for those lucky individuals who can afford the newest, safest and most expensive drugs; the other for the poor unfortunates who will have to take their chances with cheaper, less effective and less safe medicines. For those who are battling to make ends meet, the choice is between what they need and what they can afford. Further to this, a number of medications will be removed from the PBS altogether. They include treatments for such common complaints as stomach problems, diarrhoea and muscle pain and anti-fungal medicines. Pensioners and other concession card holders who are currently paying $3.20 for these drugs will be forced to pay up to $9 from next year. Cranbourne, which is in my electorate of Isaacs, has little hope of getting its own Medicare office following the government's plan to close 43 such offices throughout Australia, highlighting yet another broken federal government promise. Plans were announced in this budget to close many Medicare offices, including those of Clayton and Keysborough, in Victoria, which will cause much inconvenience for many of my constituents and may even deter poorer people from seeking medical treatment. The budget obviously spells the death of the prospect of a Cranbourne Medicare office. When the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) visited Cranbourne before the last federal election, more than a year ago now, he promised that the coalition would open a Medicare office within 12 months of it being elected. Rather than honour this promise, the coalition has done everything it can to undermine the Medicare system. It is interested only in bottom lines. The closures will mean the loss of some 1,000 jobs throughout the country and the cutting of services to pensioners and families on tight budgets. Dr Wooldridge had even gone as far as to state that the former Brashs store in Cranbourne Park Shopping Centre would be an ideal site for the new Medicare I am sure that a large number of residents, particularly the elderly and the unemployed, who now have to travel to Dandenong and Frankston to lodge claims, will be most annoyed, particularly as they had been faithfully promised an office. Many of those people were among the some 1,400 who had signed a petition I collected in 1995 supporting a Medicare office in Cranbourne. Unfortunately, it was not enough to change the government's mind. Another matter equally close to the hearts of the residents of Cranbourne is child care, which has been hit hard in this year's budget with another $320 million being cut over the next four years. This follows the cuts to child care in last year's budget, in which nearly $500 million was removed. These cuts are now only just beginning to hit home, with child-care fees increasing between $20 and $40 per week. This year's budget contains cuts which will reduce the number of new child-care places and will limit assistance for non-work related care to 20 hours per week. The end result of this is that working parents will find it increasingly difficult to afford quality care as the cost goes up, putting it out of the reach of many ordinary working class Cranbourne families. In many households, one partner will end up working solely to pay for child care, so it will no longer be considered worthwhile to work. That will drive one partner out of the work force, impacting upon family income and creating greater hardship on the whole family. In most cases, it will be the mother who will have to quit work. That will suit the government very well as it fits into its 1950s view of how the family home should operate, as well as it being the only way of reducing unemployment. What this government has failed to understand is that families need more help, not more cuts. Access to decent and affordable child care is becoming a nightmare for the average family. As I mentioned earlier, the 1996 budget cuts to child care will come into play on 1 July, when those using community based centres will face additional fee increases of about $20 as a result of the ending of operational subsidies. An example of this is the only council sponsored child-care centre in Cranbourne. It is in jeopardy because of these cuts to local child-care services. The Cranbourne Sun newspaper of 13 May says: If the c-tbacks are introduced, parents may have to pay up to $20 a week extra at Cranbourne's Clarendon Street Child Care Centre, according to centre director Sonia Dawson. She said that parents had already discussed taking their children out of the centre and that the centre would have to raise fees or retrench staff if the federal government failed to provide its annual grant, which runs out on June 30. Mrs Dawson said: We're a non-profit organisation already. We have a number of families here who are already talking about maybe having to pull out of care or stop work because of increasing fees. A lot of our mothers are going to have to stay at home. Parents are really quite angry at the moment. If we lose numbers we are going to have to put off staff. Mrs Dawson said that full fees at the centre were about $600 a month, but this could rise by up to $80 monthly if the funding cuts come into effect. She said that many families could not afford an increase in fees and would pull their children out of care, placing the future of the centre in jeopardy. The experience of the Clarendon Street Child Care Centre would be shared by community based child-care centres throughout the country and by the hundreds of thousands of families who depend so heavily on them day in and day out. In conclusion, might I say that time prevents me from discussing at some length the appalling decision by the government to forsake the massive savings pool which would have developed under the present superannuation settings. The ultimately useless gimmick of the interest rebate is a rebate which, in mv view, only the wealthy will receive. I also would have liked to touch on at some length the area of aged care, which has become a sad farce under this government, but that speech can wait until tomorrow. If there is one clear message from this budget, it is that the battlers are going to have to battle even harder. They are going to have to dig deeper into their pockets. They are going to have to forgo more services that they have come to depend on. They are going to have to rely on less and less. They are going to have to rely more and more on their own intestinal fortitude, their own wits and their own street cunning to see them through. This is not a budget that this opposition supports, and the government stands condemned for many of the cuts that it has sought to introduce in it.",88
190,Mr MAREK,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I rise today to express my congratulations to my parliamentary colleagues on producing a budget that drives to strengthen this coalition government's commitment to all Australians. We are on track to replace the $10 billion deficit left to mainstream Australia by 13 years of Labor government rule. Before discussing the direct benefits of the budget in relation to the strategic plan I wrote for Capricornia back in March 1996, I find it most necessary to comment on the continual whingeing and whining of the Labor Party. Basically, it is enough to give you the pip. The words coming from the Labor Party are in relation to the so-called child-care cuts, welfare cuts, health cuts and aged cuts, and the list goes on and on. This talk is nothing more than political rhetoric and attempts to instil into the Australian community worry, anxiety and distress. As far as I am concerned, their actions are nothing more than a disgrace. The Labor Party is here for one reason only-to scare the people of this great nation. The misinformation being peddled by the Labor Party, or, more to the point, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), is nothing more than tripe and should be treated with the contempt it deserves. They obviously learnt nothing from the March 1996 election. I urge the people from her electorate to write and tell her where to get off so she might get some real work to do for a change. Last year when I spoke to the appropriation bill I mentioned some of the goals which I had set out to achieve for my electorate of Capri cornia. One of those goals was to extend the dam wall at Mount Morgan. I am pleased to say that, after much lobbying with my colleagues in the Queensland state government, I have achieved my goal and secured the necessary funds to extend the Mount Morgan dam wall. It is also appropriate to share some of the electorate's major successes. There is funding for the new child-care centre at Mount Morgan. Hang on a tick, I just heard the member for Jagajaga state that child care was going to be cut! I must say, it says a lot for her credibility on this issue. Talk about out of touch and out of thinking capacity! We will shortly see the opening of a new Department of Social Security office in Yeppoon. This is top stuff. I have worked tirelessly with my good friend and colleague, Vince Lester, the state member for Keppel, to make this happen. We previously had an office in Yeppoon but, owing to the cuts from the Labor government when they were in office, the previous Labor member closed it. Once again, that was an example of the poor representation of a community that deserves so much. For the disadvantaged areas in the west of my electorate, the operational funding for several child-care centres has been made available. They will receive this funding on the grounds that they meet the criteria. Once again, the member for Jagajaga has been pulling the cat's tail and squealing about issues that are nothing more than purely fictitious-as with the after school day care funding or latchkey kids. The member for Jagajaga could never comprehend the hurt and upset she has caused many people on this issue. Another win is the approval to receive SBS TV in early 1998 rather than in the year 2001, which was proposed under the Labor government. These are just some of the many achievements we can lay claim to in Capri cornia. On taking office in March 1996 I put together an infrastructure plan that would attempt to make Capricornia one of the most progressive and profitable electorates in the country, something the Labor Party just could not pull off. They simply left Rockhampton and Capricornia penniless and with no future direction in relation to employment, capital investment and infrastructure. I say to the people of Capricornia, 'I will not do that and I will not let you down.' We are the beef capital of Australia. In line with the need for infrastructure to bring export dollars to Capricomia, we now have an Austrade office so industry and primary producers can deal directly with overseas companies to sell their products. The Central Queensland University in Rockhampton has had continual grants to allow it to improve and expand. Therefore, it has been made an educational facility of national significance. Rockhampton is the gateway to one of the world's best defence training facilities in the world. The funding for accommodation at Shoalwater Bay in the last budget totalled $1.3 million and was in line with this year's grant of $2.1 million to build a mechanical firing range for most types of ammunition. This shoots us towards the next grant I need for the area-that is, money for the final extensions to the Rockhampton airport. This will give not only the military the ability to take off and land the fighter aircraft and heavier transport aircraft but also the region an economic boost with the ability to have international passenger and freight aircraft operate out of there as well. In the past 12 months, we have seen several exercises take place. The most recent and perhaps the most familiar to the House is the recent Tandem Thrust exercise-an amphibian exercise involving American and Australian forces. This saw some 20,000 defence personnel in Central Queensland and an injection of some $15 million to $20 million into the local economy. Singapore armed forces, under a memorandum of agreement with the government, undertake annual training exercises at Shoalwater Bay. In 1996 some 4,500 Singaporean troops took R&R in and around the electorate and injected an additional $20 million into the local economy. I envisage that my electorate will see similar benefits again when the exercise gets under way later this year. The success of the Shoalwater Bay training area and the financial gains it has brought to my electorate must be further enhanced. It is for this reason that I will work to see the development of the further extensions to the Rockhampton airport. At present, Rockhampton airport is listed as an alternative airport for international aircraft to other major centres, for example, Brisbane and Townsville. The only problem is that we are short of the full distance-3,200 metres-required for heavy loaded aircraft with a maximum take off and landing distance in accordance with the regulations. Upgrading of the airport to accommodate 747 aircraft will provide a major role in supporting and capturing the economic expansion in the region. I have made representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the honourable John Sharp, on this basis. The military exercises have been instrumental in testing the capacity of the existing Rockhampton airport and recent extensions have seen Singapore Airlines Airbus 310s and Qantas 767 aircraft take off and land in accordance with the regulations. We believe that opportunities exist to expand the business received from the Singapore defence forces and to secure new business from other countries, such as Canada and the United States. Opportunities also exist for expanding international freight businesses through the airport, particularly in high value agricultural and manufacturing commodities. An upgraded airport could service a substantial range of development in the wider Rockhampton region, including major project development in the Gladstone area and possible energy, mining and agricultural developments in the Surat BasinlDawson Valley area. Local tourism operators have advised that long travel international flights to another part of the country then further domestic air travel for international tourists visiting the area is a major impediment to the expansion of international tourism. I have had personal conversations with the President of Iwasaki Sangyo, owner of the Capricornia International Resort at Yeppoon, Mr Fukuzo Iwasaki, who argues that an upgraded airport would enable him to expand their charter operations and pressure the airlines to ensure that scheduled international flights stop over in Rockhampton. The Capricornia International Resort at Yeppoon has recently chartered flights from Japan to Rockhampton and we would like to see this continued. Business travel to the area would also benefit from expanded services. My electorate of Capricornia is also in a position to capitalise on the 2000 Olympics. Rockhampton and Central Queensland annually host many state and national titles and continue to develop Olympic standard facilities. How many regional centres can boast that they have an internationally approved hockey surface? Rockhampton's Kalka Shades field has a Poly tan wet surface, which will accommodate high level international competition. It is recognised as the most successful surface throughout world hockey circles. Full credit must go to Rockhampton Hockey for the work they have put into provide Central Queensland with such a facility. There are many other issues that I could talk about in relation to the 2000 Olympics and Capri cornia. Capricornia is, of course, very close to my heart. My employers expect a degree of result while I am in this parliament and they can expect that I will attempt to deliver. As far as the ALP is concerned, they have made many commitments in the past. They have not delivered. We will and we intend to do this. I finish with this: we have made a commitment to the Australian people and we will put in place more than the ALP has ever achieved. We have promised that we will have a $1.6 billion surplus. The difference between us and the Labor Party is the l-a-w law-we will deliver.",92
191,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I cannot let the opportunity go by to respond to one or two of the points made by the honourable member for Capricomia (Mr Marek). It never ceases to amaze me that every National Party member in the federal parliament since probably 1901 has believed that an international airport should be built in their electorate. If there is one thing that this country not need it is another international airport in Queensland. The costs associated with the airport at Rockhampton have been investigated on many, many occasions by people from both sides of this parliament when in and out of government and it has never stacked up in economic terms. I appreciate the comments that my colleague makes and his right to defend his own electorate in this place. You are absolutely correct in respect of wanting to say that. But in pure economic terms, there are costs associated with putting customs services in and a range of other matters-not to mention, of course, extending the runway to carry 747 aircraft and new generation aircraft that are coming. So I really think it is a little bit of a pie in the sky sort of view. As far as the Olympics are concerned, I also congratulate the honourable member for drawing the House's attention to the fact that there is a wet based hockey surface available for training purposes and for the Olympic Games and preparation for it, but I might also say to the honourable member that there are many similar regions around Australia with the same claims, and it is going to be quite a battle to secure some of those training facilities for international teams as they come here in the lead-up to the year 2000. Tonight in this debate I want to refer specifically to my own electorate of Cunningham and, more generally, to the Illawarra and to what has happened to our region as a result of the change in government last year. There are a number of matters which I think are quite pertinent. Whilst my colleague who preceded me wanted to talk about what the government had done for him, I can tell him that in a region like my own, regrettably, the unemployment rate is still about four or five percentage points above the national average. It is unacceptably high and is showing no signs of moving. I must say that I am delighted to see the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) in the House tonight. We would have expected that any government which purported to represent the interests of all Australians might have shown a little bit of does care and compassion for the IlIawarra, but that is certainly not the case. I will run through some of the issues that are facing my constituents in the Illawarra, and in Wollongong specifically. The first decision, taken last year, was that of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to shut down the office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Wollongong. That occurred in October 1996. People from something like 80 different nationalities choose to make Wollongong and the IIIawarra their home. The biggest throughput of constituent matters through my office relate to immigration. This department's presence has now gone because the government decided it needed to shut the office down. The reason advanced was cost cutting. I had to laugh. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was at a function put on by an Italian group in my electorate recently. He made no mention of the fact that his decision to do this had been taken last year or that he had actually cut the funding for the aged care worker with the particular group that had invited him along on the night. Fortunately, the lord mayor, who was asked to speak, made sure that the people there got to hear of that particular oversight in the minister's speech. I am sure they will appreciate that in the future. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who is at the table, would also be aware that cutbacks in funding for higher education in Australia more generally clearly have had an impact on the University of Wollongong. I know that the minister is aware that the University of Wollongong enjoys a substantial reputation, not only in this country but also certainly internationally. Dr Kemp-It has 50 per cent private income.",94
192,Mr MARTIN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"The minister has made reference to the fact that perhaps that institution's private income from international students is something which should in some way offset the government's funding cut. I do not necessarily believe that, because an institution like the University of Wollongong has been able to attract world-class academics to teach there, because it has also been very pro-active in attracting students from not only the Asia-Pacific region but also the Middle East, in line with government policies-both the previous government and the current government-that university therefore should have to suffer from public education funding cuts. Because those funds have been cut, the University of Wollongong has had to make some very hard decisions on some of the courses it is proposing to offer in subsequent years and the impact that is going to have on academics. In fact, estimates from the university suggest that something like 150 staff could be lost over coming years because of those funding cuts. I think that is regrettable because the sorts of courses which are offered by the University of Wollongong are quite outstanding. For example, we have a world reputation on telecommunications technology and we have world recognised leaders in the heads of those various departments. That has been instrumental in our endeavours to attract new industry to the Illawarra in the area of telecommunications infrastructure. Telstra itself has clearly identified that responsibility, as has the New South Wales government, which has declared that the University of Wollongong should be the centre of excellence for telecommunications in New South Wales. Again, that is a great compliment to our university and to the work that is being undertaken there and it is also a great reflection on the quality of staff that have been attracted. Anything that will impinge upon that is to be regretted. We also cannot help but reflect upon the decision last year in the budget, which has not been remedied in this budget, to cut the regional development fund. It is no coincidence that whenever the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) is asked a question or is called in this place we on this side simply say, 'No, just Transport.' Regrettably, that is all that is left of his portfolio. I am sure my very good friend and corridor colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Ronaldson), who has now joined us in the chamber, is aware of these criticisms, because I have certainly made them known to him. It is interesting that $150 million was cut last year and has not been in any way returned to regional development funding this year to help areas like the Illawarra. I again say to the parliamentary secretary that, with unemployment levels as unacceptably high as they are in the Illawarra, there is a real need for positive government assistance. As a result of the funding that was made available by the previous government under the REDO program, the Illawarra REDO, which I have the great pleasure and honour to chair, has just handed down a new regional development strategy for the Illawarra. It is a departure from regional development strategies of the past. It was completed by Coopers and Lybrand. It has proposed a series of business plans to encourage something like 20 different projects to the Illawarra. It has been done on the basis of interviews with community leaders and so on, and it has specifically identified and targeted 20-odd projects, 13 of which are priority projects, and has suggested a business plan for each of those. In that respect, it is a completely different way of dealing with regional development. I know that all of us in this place can recall various endeavours by people like Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox, when travelling Australia on behalf of the former government, to come up with virtually a wish-list of projects which they hoped the Commonwealth government might in some way be able to fund. Certainly, you could always get a wish-list of projectsmany of them have holy grail status in certain regions, and it is no different in the Illawarra-but at the end of the day that does not achieve an effective outcome, either in an economic or in a social sense. I think the business plan we have adopted as a REDO does provide some opportunity for us; nevertheless, it is disappointing that no funding has been included in this budget for regional development programs. I know that the parliamentary secretary responsible for this, who comes from a region himself and who has a very substantial profile within his own electorate as somebody who champions the cause of regions, must find it very disquieting that his government has not seen fit to put funding back into this particular area. I know that he must be feeling just what I am feeling: absolute and bitter disappointment with his government in this respect. The Commonwealth dental care program for battlers has been stopped cold. In my electorate, this has affected the Bulli Hospital, where a clinic has been established and where the waiting time has now been pushed out to several years. I find it extraordinary that a government which went to the people of this country saying that they want us all to feel comfortable and relaxed are now saying to the pensioners of my electorate, 'Well, you are going to feel comfortable and relaxed but your teeth aren't and certainly not for about two or three years more because that is the waiting time before you can have your teeth repaired.' I find it an absolute scandal that this should be the case. Much has been remarked on it in the Illawarra. Submissions have been made to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), but they have fallen on deaf ears. Again, there is no restoration of funding for this in the last budget. Public housing is another great cause of concern in a region like mine. The simple fact is that it is so difficult for those people who require public housing to have a degree of certainty surrounding their future housing needs when the government simply says to the New South Wales or to any other state government, 'I am sorry, we are going to cut out all the money for public housing. What we will do is in some way give some funding to individual people that meet certain criteria to have public housing.' I have not quite worked out how that will work yet. They have actually said that the way that will happen in the future will mean there will be no further funding for capital stock. If there is no further funding for capital stock, we will get into a situation where some unscrupulous landlords will end up charging the earth for people that are public housing tenants at the present moment. We could eventually see the slum-like conditions which have developed in many places in countries like the United States and so on. I do not think that is what Australia wants, and I certainly do not think it is what Australians deserve. It is such a regrettable philosophical position that the coalition government in this country has taken. It has continued to slash and bum all in the name-as my friend the member for Capricornia suggested-{)f trying to get a budget into surplus. He made some comment about that. I might remind him that in recent economic times, although there is much derision from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in recent question times about the former government, it was only a Labor government that was able to sustain at least three budget surpluses. We will be very interested to see whether or not this government is able to achieve one, let alone three. Flood mitigation works and funding have been cut by this government. Wollongong City Council's flood mitigation works have been placed on hold following the federal government's withdrawal of funding not only in the last budget but also in this budget. Again, in an area like the Illawarra-which many people know is a magnificent part of the coastline of Australia--enormous numbers of streams and rivers and so on flow down from the escarpment to the coast. This causes considerable problems in some areas, particuprecinct larly low lying areas of the Illawarra. always falls to the council to carry out flood mitigation works. I would have thought that in the protection of property and the protection of lives the Commonwealth government might have an interest in this and might funding available for flood mitigation works, but again it simply has not happened. I tum to some of the other big ticket items that were announced in this budget that affect the Illawarra. There are two in particudisappeared. lar which have caused an enormous amount of anger. The first is the decision by this government to shut down two Medicare offices in the Illawarra-one at Corrimal, preferable where my electorate office is located, and other in Warrawong, which is in the electorate electorate. of my friend and colleague the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). That leaves two Medicare offices for the entire Illawarra: one in central Wollongong and one at Shell Harbour Square Shopping Centre. Public transport being what it is, unemployment situation being what it is, this is placing an enormous burden on the residenied dents of Wollongong's northern suburbs and southern suburbs in accessing Medicare offices where they need to discuss issues with staff who have been trained the forms and on claiming the appropriate rebates and so on. To simply say that this is a position that may be fixed by the installathe tion of fax machines in some doctors' surment geries or pharmacies is an absolute abdication of responsibility in this very important area. The second major issue that emerged from the sell-off of Australia by this government was the decision to sell the Commonwealth office block in Wollongong. It is one of quite a number of properties which the government has decided to sell. It is one of 56 Commonwealth owned buildings around the nation that are going to be sold. We are all looking forward to the day when the 'For sale: John Howard Real Estate Agency' is put on the one in Wollongong. I can tell you that it will raise considerable anger within the local community, as it already has. This is a building which is part of the civic in the Illawarra. It is adjacent to the It Wollongong City Council chambers. There is no legitimate reason why this building should be sold. I say that because in the last two . budgets decisions taken by this coalition government have seen quite a number of make public servant positions made redundant or transferred out of the Illawarra. For example, DEETY A no longer has an area office. It has been downgraded to a regional office. Therefore, the need for additional accommodation will in other parts of Wollongong CBD has now They can quite easily be housed in the Commonwealth office block. I would have thought rent return from a building which the Commonwealth owns is far more than the sale of this building. It is the of considerable concern to the people in my There are the cuts to child care that we have heard much about both from last year's budget and from this year's budget. That there is the philosophy that suggests that women should be denied access to child care or the limited to 20 hours a week, that people who are trying to improve themselves should be an opportunity to put children in child care so they can go for appropriate trainingall of these are issues which people in my constituency have raised with me over the last to give advice on several weeks. A further issue is the ongoing saga about airport and the decision by this govern to resurrect a proposition for an airport to be constructed at Holsworthy. As I recall it, when the EIS on the 10 appropriate sites was produced back in 1984, Holsworthy was number eight out of 10. Mr Latham-Nine. r lr MARTIN-It was nine out of 10, my friend the member for Werriwa corrects me. Suddenly, there it is. From Fairy Meadow north, depending on the alignment chosen by this government, we will see an incredible amount of aircraft placed over the northern suburbs of Wollongong. Quite clearly, that is unacceptable. Finally, let me state my gravest concern for decisions that have not been taken by this government-that is, the concern about the future of the great Australian steel industry. The simple fact is that this is a government devoid of any ideas when it comes to industry policy. We have seen the result of that in Newcastle. I note that my colleague the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) is with us this evening during the course of this debate. The implications for Illawarra are just as stark. Two weeks before BHP announced their decision to shut down steel making in Newcastle, community leaders in Wollongong were told that between 1,200 and 2,000 jobs were also going to disappear at the BHP works. The fact that they have invested $3 billion in new technology, I suspect, is probably one of the major reasons why further hard decisions were not taken there. There is a need for this government to look at a steel industry plan, as we have been suggesting. We want to know that there is security of employment for people in the III awarra. It is an industry which is so importby ant to our area. It is an industry off which a number of other companies feed in terms of manufacturing and fabrication, and it is still the backbone of the Illawarra. I simply suggest to this government that they have to take a good, hard, long look at their industry policy and give security to people of the Illawarra in terms of its future. Rather than being comfortable and relaxed as a result of the two budgets that have come down in the last 15 months by this government, the people of the Illawarra are anything but.",95
193,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I rise to make some comments on the second Howard-Costello budget in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98. A bit like their first, this is a budget of mirror and rubber. First you see it and then you do not; it is all done with mirrors when you try to find out what is going on, and, of course, the figures are rubbery, as they were in the last budget. In my speech on the Appropriation Bill last year I pointed out that the growth figures in last year's budget were never going to be met. We all knew that. They were always shonky. They are shonky now. We can take little things like Telstra borrowing $3 billion and then giving it to the government. So you get a $3 billion cash gift. This is somehow good budgeting! We saw the transfer of $3.7 billion out of last year's forward estimates into a savings scheme that will actually reduce national savings. It is all mirrors. What is being put forward is something that the government, ourselves and the commentators all understand is not what is going to happen, and the words do not mean what they are supposed to mean. So savings are not savings and borrowings off Telstra are not borrowings at all. That money that comes from the government does not really affect it. We have a government run by slogans. Let us go through a few of those slogans. I am talking about slogans such as 'free market', the 'black armband brigade', 'comfortable and relaxed', and 'the battlers', of course. That is a one-word slogan. The fact is that you cannot govern by slogans, you cannot govern mantras and you cannot govern by mirrors and rubbery figures. I will give a few examples of that. Things actually change; the world moves on. When the black armband brigade slogan was working so well in the polls last year and was getting a good response in terms of the focus groups, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) got very attached to it. Then we were suddenly hit with a report last week, the likes of which none of us have ever imagined or contemplated. Sure, we have all heard stories and, sure, we have all heard complaints about children being taken away and families being broken up. But I defy anybody in this place to actually admit or state that they actually knew of the dimensions, the depth and the sheer enormity of what has taken place in this country over the last 200 years, particularly over the last 60 years, as that report puts forward. That report changes everything. You cannot go on saying that things are the same. What we said last week or the week before or last year does not get changed. The black armband brigade is not fashionable now. It is not appropriate. In fact, it is more than that it is downright insulting. That report is not about guilt; it is about responsibility, it is about nationhood and it is about we as human beings, not what we thought hundreds of years ago or 60 years ago, but what we think now. There was an article in the paper on Friday written by Tony Wright, I think, pointing out that there are probably thousands of men alive now who sexually abused young Aboriginal girls in the last 30 or 40 years. They are still alive, the girls are still alive and, in many cases, the official system knows about it, yet they have never been charged. At the same time we as a community are being adamant about paedophilia in all other forms. We are being adamant about the incidents that have occurred in religious orders and in state orphanages, but we are ignoring this one. Why aren't the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) referring the information in that report to the federal and state police forces to investigate those foster homes where those young girls and boys were sexually abused? Why aren't they? Is it because of the black armband brigade? Is it because they will feel guilty about it? What kind of mentality and morality are we talking about here? We were told in recent months about euthanasia and Christianity and how we should value the sanctity of human life. The same people are saying that they have no responsibility for this and it has nothing to do with them. The fact is that there are young Aboriginal girls alive now who were sexually abused, and it is being absolutely ignored. We have heard not one comment from the Prime Minister or the responsible minister. The sheer hypocrisy of that is breathtaking. And those mantras will come back to haunt them over and over again as the world moves on and they are seen for what they are. I wish to look at another of those mantrasthe free market. Last week a speech was given in Canberra by I think Mr Cameron which was reported on briefly. It pointed out that people in the community now have a concern about the lack of an industry policy. That became very clear when BRP made an announcement to terminate steel making in Newcastle, but the announcement was actually not about that; it was to reverse a decision to invest in new steel making. A decision made in June 1995 to invest half a billion dollars in new steel making was reversed on 29 April. And the government said, 'It's none of our business. It is because of market forces. It is a commercial decision. We are not responsible.' That they did not really care was the message that Australia got. The government said, 'It's nothing to do with us. Sure, we will come and mop up the mess. If you need some employment programs, we might help you with a few bucks here and there.' Senator Vanstone offered $2 million, but the BRP workers qualify for none of it. To qualify for any of that money, people have to be unemployed for nine months. What a joke. What a hoax. But the real message was that the government was impotent and uncaring and this was not part of their mantra because this was a commercial decision made by a commercial company on commercial grounds. BRP's commercial grounds on 29 April were a 15 per cent return on capital. Remember that? Mr Ronaldson-Are you saying that Amanda",98
194,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I will come back to that interjection. Last week BRP announced their changed investment guidelines. In future, their investment decisions will be based on a benchmark of the world's top 20 per cent of companies in the same field. The fact is that their steel division is in the world's top 20 per cent. The BRP steel division in Australia is one of the best earners in steel in the world. It is one of the few in the world making money. According to their new guidelines, a few weeks later they would not have made that decision. How do you judge commercial decisions? What do they mean? Where is the government amongst all this? Looking at bandaid packages after the fact to try to minimise their electoral impact. To hell with the social and economic impacts in terms of the real economy, the exports of this country and adding value to our resources. The government are simply aiming at trying to stem the political haemorrhaging for their one member in the region. I will come back to steel later but, as to interjection from the parliamentary secretary, yes, virtually all of those programs announced by Senator Vanstone are for those who are eligible, for those who are suitably qualified. For the 100 NIES places that were offeredMr Ronaldson-Were they a joke? Do you stand by your comment that they were a joke?",99
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,Mr Nehl)Order! The parliamentary secretary will not enter the debate.,100
196,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"Just learn a bit about what you are talking about for a change. You come to town and parade around, making promises that you know are false. Virtually all of those programs were for the long-term unemployed-not for the people who are currently working at BHP but who are going to lose their jobs. The programs that do that are linked to the industry. They are not broad ranging programs. Another slogan that was quite interesting was 'comfortable and relaxed'. That really does invoke a nice image: people work hard, they go home, they put up their feet and they relax, feeling secure and confident. People want to be confident that when they retire we will support and protect them in their old age. Firstly, in terms of working, job insecurity has never been worse than it is currently. And why? Because the government spent the last year talking the economy down. They spent the last year telling us all how bad it is. Go and talk to my constituents-they all think it is dreadful. Why? Because every day the Treasurer (Mr Costello) got up and told them so. For the first nine months of this government they got up every day and said, 'Things are dreadful. We're in a dreadful mess. What a dreadful situation which needs massive surgery,' and they cut the hell out of the economy for half a per cent of growth. In other words, they were going to kill the economy to cure it. I am sorry but the economy is actually dead right now. It has been dead for the last six or nine months. It was killed by the current government. So much for being confident about the future. Apart from the contraction of the work force, particularly the Public Service in the Canberra, which is appalling and unnecessary and will eventually cost us more than it saves, apart from the message about Telstra and its job losses, apart from the whole message about downsizing that the government has been on about-one of its mantras, againthose who are working are not comfortable and relaxed. They are nervous, scared and worried. In our parliamentary inquiry we saw the response from those in small business. I was part of that inquiry, and let me tell the House that those out there in small business are not comfortable and relaxed at all. If that report is not adopted in the key parts of the legislation underpinning the franchising code, the tenancy code and the changes to the Trade Practices Act, you guys will have a real problem because that is not just good but absolutely essential for those people. I have literally dozens and dozens of constituents who are facing bankruptcy right now because the economy has been flattened and they are defenceless at the same time. Of course, those who were looking to be 'comfortable and relaxed' when they retire knew our system and made their plans for retirement according to that, but in many cases they have been forced to take a retrenchment. Whether or not they have some assets or whatever, they knew about nursing homes and hostels and the system was understood. How do they feel now that nursing home access will cost $88,000, if they are lucky? It will be more like $120,000. The $26,000 entry fee was never on. Look at the figures and talk to anybody who knows the industry and you will find that was always a joke. We are talking about $100,000 more. We all know that, and we have known that since the last budget. The fact is that you cannot rip out of a budget half a billion dollars for residential aged care without making someone else pay for it. What about retired people, people facing retirement or families with a retired relative-in many cases uncles and aunties with no other family? What happens to residents in a nursing home which has been sold and are required to move? Many such cases have involved distant relatives and they have been required to pay entry fees into the next nursing home. They cannot do it. They have been moved from one nursing home which has been closed and they have to try to find a bed in another. As well as the impact on the nursing homes, the assault on the PBS system and the new, 'wonderful' technology that can now group therapeutic drugs into families for like conditions, we have this 'wonderful' new science where the federal bureaucracy can now tell doctors how to prescribe drugs-antidepressants, anti-hypertension, anti-ulcers. There are a range of conditions, but for any one condition a family of drugs can be chosen. So we are now telIing our aged, our chronically ill and people who desperately need medication daily-and in many cases in large amounts daily-that their doctor is required to prescribe the lowest drug in that family. If they do not, they pay the extra. Whether that drug suits their condition does not matter. The idea that somehow these conditions are simple to treat and that everybody with hig!l blood pressure has the same problem and can therefore take the same drug is codswallop. This is absolute bureaucratic, governmental interference at its very worse, and it wilI not work as well. Already we are being called by people anxious and concerned about how it is going to work, what drug will be available and how much extra it will cost them. We did not do that. This is a government that is somehow caught up in its own ideology and its own mantras. I want to come back to the issue of steel a moment because there are some things I want to put on the record which I think are going to be important in the years ahead. I have said in this House on more than one occasion that we, as a country, export 130 million tonnes of iron ore worth about $40 a tonne. That would equate to about 100 million tonnes of steel worth between $400 and $500 a tonne. So the fact is that the actual change in value is enormous, apart from the hundreds of thousands of jobs that are involved. If we are going to maintain a steel industry in this country, we need to invest in it. At the moment, virtually 80 per cent of the industry has decided not to invest any further. They have announced that they are going to run down the capital base in steel. What is therefore likely to happen is one of two things. Firstly, our industry will run down and eventually implode and collapse as imports get stronger and stronger. The second option is that we may develop a new industry on the west coast which will be foreign owned with foreign investment and transfer priced. So we would convert our iron ore into a higher value, but the total control of that would be by the foreign investors, not by Australia. So we would have a steel industry in Australia that was not Australian. That is one of the very serious choices and one of the very real possibilities that we are likely to see. In talking about those things in recent months we have been talking about the need for an industry policy. We have been talking about the need for a steel plan--call it a plan, call it a strategy, call it an approach, call it what you like. It does not matter what the word is, but the plan needs to be coherent and it needs to encourage the conversion of our raw materials of iron ore, gas and/or coal into metals of some form and sell them at a higher value. That plan needs to have incorporated in it probably things like competitive investment regimes so that we are a competitive country to invest in. It probably needs things in it that make sure we look at technology for our raw materials as a major national priority. It probably needs things in it like bilateral negotiations with other countries to make sure for that we can export to them at a higher value and not always at the bottom of the chain, as we are now in virtually most of our exports into Asia. It also probably needs in it the idea that BHP may need to get out of steel. If our biggest iron ore company is not interested in steel, then it should make way for someone who is. I do not doubt the possibility of Australia attracting investment in that kind of way. This second Howard budget is different from the first. The first, if you like, was triumphal in how much damage it was going to do to individuals and to the economy. It made, if you like, a virtue of the pain it could cause, knowing that the pain would not come until much later on. This budget is almost the opposite. It is totally deceitful, because it pretends to be doing something when it is doing very little-other than those very narrow, nasty targets, particularly on pharmaceuticals, and of course the savings rebate, which will end up reducing our nation's savings. We are seeing a government that is now consolidated into a process of government by mantras and by slogans. In fact those mantras are now turning into negatives and they are the opposite of what the country needs. Mr Speaker, I welcome you to the chair.",100
197,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,Thank you.,102
198,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,This country needs some vision. It needs some competence.,102
199,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,It's nice to be back!,102
200,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"I am speaking through you, Mr Speaker, unlike most of your ministers, who ignore you. The way you have been treated in recent days by your colleagues is appalling and sooner or later you are going to have to do something about that. The country needs vision. It needs confidence in that vision. It needs inclusion. Most of all, it needs a bit of depth. Slogans and mantras might be helpful at election time, but you do not run a country with them. What we have seen in this budget, as in these past 15 months, is ideology-make conclusions and then work out how they are going to work. The nursing home up-front fees were announced last August. We still do not know how they are going to work. Nine months later we are still trying to work out how the things announced in the last budget as conclusions are going to work. You do not govern by making a decision and then working out how it is going to be implemented or what it means. That is what this government has done and that is what it is doing in this budget. We still do not know what certain areas in this budget mean, as with things like Wik and others. But the one area that is the most nasty is the pharmaceutical area. This budget will go down in time as a turning point-from a government that could do no wrong last year, as it thought, to a government that can do no right, and both for the same reasons because it is a government that did not know what it was doing at all. This budget will be seen as a recognition of ignorance and impotence. This country needs neither. It needs enlightenment, confidence and capacity, which it is not getting from the government that we have. Debate (on motion by Mr Cadman) adjourned. NA NA Motion (by Mr Cadman)-by leaveagreed to: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1997-98 Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1997-98 Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1997-98 NA",102
201,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Earlier today, the honourable member for Brisbane raised, as a matter of privilege, a report that some Liberal Party members of the House had had their preselections threatened. I have examined a copy of the newspaper report on which the honourable member based his complaint. To attempt by improper means to influence a member in the performance of his or her duties as a member is a contempt-I refer to House of Representatives Practice at pages 701 and 702, and to section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. Complaints with some elements in common with the present matter have been raised in the past in 1983, 1986 and 1991. I endorse the views of my predecessors to the effect that, as a general rule, the House should not attempt to intervene in arrangements made within political parties. If, of course, a member were to seek the protection of the House in such a matter, then this would need to be considered. The report quoted from by the honourable member for Brisbane does not provide evidence in respect of any particular member, and no member has claimed to have been intimidated or subject to improper interference. In all the circumstances, I am not prepared to allow precedence to a motion on the matter. NA",102
202,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mabo Anniversary",103
203,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Five years ago today, on 3 June 1992, the High Court set right part of Australia's history. The Mabo decision recognised the first Australians' common law property rights. In so doing, the court undid what Justices Deane and Gaudron described as 'a national legacy of unutterable shame'. Aboriginal people were dispossessed of most of their traditional lands. Their Honours further observed: The acts and events by which that dispossession in legal theory was carried into practical effect constitute the darkest aspect of the history of this nation. The nation as a whole must remain diminished unless and until there is an acknowledgment of, and retreat from, those past injustices. The High Court ended our long silence. After Mabo-the new frontier where past met present-the Keating government enacted the Native Title Act as a way forward together. In law, the High Court ended a shameful historical chapter. The Native Title Act began the process of ending that shame in deed. Today, five years after Mabo, we are faced with another painful chapter in our history. Bringing them home, the report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, documents more than a century of policies intended to destroy the family and cultural life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It is indeed a history of dreadful, profound, unutterable shame. It is a shame matched only by the refusal of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to offer indigenous Australians a profound apology on behalf of the nation for those odious past policies. The nation stands at an historic junction. We can face the future united and strong or we can cower behind pathetic excuses. The stolen generations report gives us the tools to help indigenous people fulfil their potential in this nation. The report clearly shows the direct link between those policies and indigenous people's social and economic disadvantage today. Yet the Prime Minister refuses to make an apology on behalf of the nation. The mark of a truly great leader determined to bring good to the nation is generosity. The Prime Minister is silent. Yet there are voices that shatter the silence. Listen to what was said on page 228 of the report: I have come to realise that because of Dad being taken away, grief and all that's been carried down to us. We're not organised. We don't know where we're heading. Confidential evidence 403, Queensland: speaker's father was removed at the age of J8 months to The Bungalow, Northern Territory. Further on that page: I have six children. My kids have been through what I went through. They've been placed. The psychological effects that it had on me as a young child also affected me as a mother with my children. I've put my children in Bomaderry Children's Home when they were little. History repeating itself. Confidential evidence 444, New South Wales: woman removed at 4 years and suffering sexual abuse in one foster home and emotional abuse in the other. The Prime Minister tells us that we should not apologise because that was past generations, that current generations are not to blame. This report details systematic discrimination sanctioned by Commonwealth, state and territory governments. And what is this current government's response to the Wik High Court judgment? Further discrimination. The 10point response to the Wik plan is the current government's response. In the past, past generations took away the children. In the present, the Howard government proposes to take away the limited rights that the High Court has granted indigenous people in the Mabo and Wik decisions, the limited rights that this parliament gave them. So what we have is a current policy of current discrimination against the most disadvantaged race in this nation, the Aboriginal race. . Senator Minchin was on radio today, and he issued a press release yesterday, saying that this government was relying on the race power to take away current indigenous people's rights. That is an abuse of the race power. Mr Reith-That's what you did in the Native Title Act.",103
204,Mr MEL HAM,ADJOURNMENT,"It is not what we did in the Native Title Act. We utilised the special measures section of the Racial Discrimination Act, section 8(1), and the Racial Discrimination Act was based on the external affairs power. Get your law right!",104
205,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"I opened my Sunday paper this week and read an article which has left me flabbergasted. Having worked all year to ensure parents in need have adequate child-care assistance, I am amazed to find there are people who believe that the taxpayers should be paying nonworking parents to continue their hobbies. This week's Sunday Mail devoted a full page to child care with three stories-one headed, 'Needy versus the greedy', another headed, 'A case of triple trouble' and the third headed, 'Family can't pay rise'. First, let me focus on the 'Needy versus the greedy' article. This article quoted a childcare provider as saying that it was time parents took responsibility for their children. Other operators are quoted as saying that nonworking parents are using child-care centres as dumping grounds. I point out that these are the operators, not politicians or bean counters. These are people in the industry. Of course there is another side to the story. The director of a centre in Shailer Park was quoted as saying that the new limit would send women 'back to the home', and: I strongly believe there is an element in the Party which would love to see women back in the home, which in this day and age is a totally antiquated view. Call me old fashioned, but I have no problem with non-working women-or men-being at home with their children. Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that is what you called parenthood . The second article to which I refer tells the story of a mother with triplets, two of whom have disabilities, and a terminally ill husband. This is the sort of family that our government is trying to help. However, it was the third article that really knocked me for six. The article starts: Three year old Ashleigh and her big sister, Krystal, five, spend thirty hours a week behind the fences of the Woodridge Childcare Centre. This makes the centre sound like a bit of a gaol from the outset, which I am sure the operators would not be pleased about. However, the article goes on and it paints a very Child Care odd picture indeed. The mother of these children openly admits that she does not have the patience to spend every day with her daughters. She said that, at the centre, they learn; at home, they fight. The mother also admits that her children would rather be at the centre than at home with her. Of course this does not seem to be a concern for the mother, as she is busy with her hobbies. When the change in hours comes in, this mother will be forced, due to financial pressures, to give up some of her taxpayer funded hobbies. Let us take a quick look at her present situation. She is currently paying $67 a week out of a total child-care bill of $275. This means the taxpayer is paying her $208 a week to enjoy her hobbies at leisure, untroubled by the daily routine of raising her children. And you ask why I am amazed. But that is not all. This mother cannot understand why people would judge her and not those who pay a nanny. I can tell her why. It is because those paying a nanny are not asking the taxpayer to foot the bill. This is the sort of person the Liberal shadow minister for scare is defending over the 20-hour issue. When I was bringing up my family, I did not have taxpayer funded child care, nor perhaps would most of the mothers in this House. But that is not to say there is no place for child-care assistance. I am a firm believer that the government should help those in genuine need and support working parents with young children who have no other options. Recently, I met with a number of child-care providers in my electorate. It was a very productive meeting and I came away with a good appreciation of the needs of many parents, but the providers also benefited by gaining a greater understanding of the government's philosophies towards child care. I will be holding regular meetings with my providers in an attempt to keep them fully briefed on government policy and myself up to date with the problems of the industry. But is it little wonder that the taxpaying public is getting more than a little concerned with this issue when you have instances such as this that I have described tonight? Bringing Them Home",104
206,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I would like to share with this House extracts from the Bringing them home report relating to the effects on Aboriginal children who were taken away from their parents and placed in institutions. As I lead into these quotes, I do so with a sense of history, as one of the first such institutions for Aboriginal children was set up in Parramatta in 1819 and then moved to Blacktownwhence the name Blacktown came-in 1823. The land on which this school was established was granted to Colebee and Nurragingy, elders of the Darrug nation, by Governor Macquarie. The intent of this school, run by the Missionary Society under the direction of Samuel Marsden, was to teach Aboriginal children the European people's way of life. Now to the quotes. The first quote is from four Victorian sisters taken from their father and grandmother in the 1960s, and states: We had been brought up on the surrogate mother of the institution and that whole lifestyle, which not prepare us at all for any type of family life or life whereby in the future we would be surviving or fending for ourselves; and then the survival skills that we needed in order to survive in the mainstream community, because those survival skills are certainly not skills that you leam in a major institution. And the whole family value system was not there and then the practice that comes with that was not there and put in place. The next quote is from a New South Wales man taken to a babies home in Melbourne in 1971 at the age of 12 months: My feelings throughout life, of hurt, pain and neglection began as far back as I can remember. . . I was taken from my family ... along with my biological brother, he also was with me through everything, if it wasn't for him, I probably would not be alive today to be able to write about my past. The next quote is from a man fostered at two years of age in the 1950s who was then placed in a reformatory at 14: It did lead to a career in crime in which, to me, well, it wasn't crime that turned me on, even though I was successful at it. It was getting back at society. It was kicking 'em, y'know? It wasn't crime, it was the fact that, well, I'm going to pay back now for 20 odd years. Now, I served something like 5 years in the prisons, not because I wanted to be a criminal, but because I didn't know where I was, I didn't know who I belonged to. A Western Australian mother spoke of her two sons taken in the 1960s: They grew up to mix with other troubled children in Tardon and didn't know how to mix with us their mother and family, they only knew how to mix with other boys that they grew up with and these boys were boys stealing, so my sons went with them, they couldn't do without the crowd that they group up with. I couldn't tell them anything at this stage cause they felt that coloured people were nothing and that is when they went on the wrong road. One of my sons was put into gaol for four years and the other one died before he could reach the age of 21 years. It hasn't done my sons any good, the welfare making them wards of the state and taking them away from me, they would have been better off with me their mother. And this quote from a young father who began stealing when he and his siblings were placed with non-Koori children: I reckon all my troubles started when I was living in them homes. That's when I first started stealing because you wasn't allowed to have did anything and if I wanted something the only way I could get it is get it off someone else, me brother or sister to buy it, or just take it. We were sort of denied everything we wanted, just got what we was given and just be satisfied with that. I felt secondrate. I didn't feel like I got the love I was supposed to get; like a kid's supposed to get at that age, because they're more vulnerable at that age. They just follow people that seem to look more after them. That's why I got in with the wrong crowd, I suppose. They seemed to care more. Let us remember that these few quotes are taken from a fairly recent experience, one occurring only 26 years ago. These experiences would have happened during the lifetimes of most members of this parliament. Doctors: Suicide Rates",105
207,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week a report from New South Wales showed that the suicide rates amongst doctors are 50 per cent higher than for the rest of the population. The particular at-risk groups include junior hospital doctors, rural doctors and women doctors. On the weekend, the President of the AMA called on all state and territory health ministers to work on implementing strategies to address this issue and announced a $300,000 campaign to highlight it. The New South Wales report revealed that junior doctors are particularly vulnerable. Shouldering life or death responsibility as young as 23 and still suffused with the vestiges of the 'doctor as God' syndrome, many have nowhere to tum to and have little insight that they as healers can suffer from things like depression like everyone else. From my own experience I know that, at the end of a 30hour shift, you can sometimes feel as if you are dead on your feet. You can sometimes be operating almost like an automaton. Three years after graduating from medical school, a member of my class took his life after working for months at nights as a locum. Another doctor who was a neighbour of mine back in Adelaide took his life last year while working in New South Wales. From my own experience I would have to say that night shift work can be particularly debilitating: working nights while everyone else is asleep and having to sleep during the day. I have a great deal of admiration for nurses, who have to do a lot of shift work, and also for all the medical staff who work night shifts. I hope that the AMA's campaign does include the issue of shift work because changing from day to night shifts and back again can create a tremendous dislocation to the body clock. There are studies showing a number of ailments which are much more common in people who work shifts. That dislocation can lead not only to a physical isolation but also to an emotional isolation. It is not just the long hours that need to be addressed. Personally, I found the 30-hour shifts tiring. But actually changing from day to night shift and back again every fortnight is something that is incredibly depressing and physically and emotionally draining. It is a lot tougher even though you are working fewer hours. What we are dealing with can only be described as a tragic waste of talented and bright young Australian lives. I note that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report entitled Aspects of youth suicide, states: Until recent years, there has been little valid research on youth suicide, at an Australian or intemationallevel. While there is some divergence in the research literature as to whether suicide is mainly caused by mental illness or sociological factors, there is a growing subscription to the view that youth suicide is a deeply complex issue influenced by many factors, including mental health and wider sociological influences. The Committee recognises that any programmes or funding for youth suicide prevention must be underpinned by valid research demonstrating the causes of youth suicide, its prevalence amongst various groups and the best way of combating the problem. Paragraph 48 of the report reinforces the need for education campaigns to veer away from words and images such as 'suicide prevention' and instead to focus on depression awareness and problem-solving skills. Other requirements in addressing the issues outlined in the report include information access, family support, integrated research programs, national departmental coordination and a review of current youth suicide prevention strategies and funding policies. I support the AMA's initiative on junior doctors' working hours and encourage all state and territory health ministers to be aware of and to address this important issue. Immigration Aboriginal Reconciliation",106
208,Mr ANDREN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to put on the public record the reasons for my shifting position in this House during the week. It was certainly no personal snub to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), much as I find many of her policies obnoxious, divisive and extremely damaging to Australia's moral fibre and its economic future. I am concerned about the polarisation of most of the Independents around a common theme, plus their forming of parties-and the exception to this is the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I cannot see how any member can stand in this place, be the head of a party and claim to have any independent status. A party becomes subject to vested interests, whether they be unions, big business or pressure groups. I was glad to hear today that the member for Oxley dissociated herself publicly from the League of Rights. That is perhaps one positive move in this totally obnoxious movement. I am appalled at the tiptoeing of the government in particular and, to some degree, the opposition around the issue of the member for Oxley and her movement because that cut to immigration announced a week or so ago was an appalling reaction to the fear of losing part of the vote out there. I find it absolutely frightening to think that we lack so much leadership that such a reaction should be taken to a person who, at best, enjoys about seven per cent of the vote in this country. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), who I notice from his body language was very upset at being rolled in cabinet over the immigration issue, spoke in this House yesterday in answer to a question about the Bringing them home issue and the Kruger and Bray case. He justified this government's reaction by comparing it to the former government's. He quoted from the former government's 1995 report: It is clear that the definition of the term genocide and the Genocide Convention that, before genocide will be committed, one or other of the acts listed in the article must have been carried out with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group as such. I put to the House that what has occurred is documented not only in the Bringing them home report but also in Outcasts in White Australia by C.D. Rowley, the eminent anthropologist, published in 1970, and in his earlier work, The Destruction of Aboriginal Society. In that he said, in part: Governments with large 'full-blood' populations tried by means of segregation to limit further partAboriginal births. At the same time they came to formulate policies which involved the disappearance of part-Aborigines through miscegenation. Conveniently the 'full-bloods' seemed to be dying out; the part-Aborigines were to be placed in such situations that there would eventually be no traces of them. That, to my mind, is-according to my definition of what the minister read out yesterday-genocide. It is not too strong a term. An apology is due from this government, from this Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and from every government in this country. Is not the most worthwhile compensation an unqualified formal apology-with regard to the reconciling and moral, rather than the legal and financial, consequences of such a statement? Immigration Homeless Young People",107
209,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to comment on the comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), and say to him that he should have the experience to realise that any change in immigration program numbers does not happen in a week. The program is carefully worked out over many months, with the backbench immigration committee working with the minister to work out how we can find solutions in our plans for the years hence to the problems that were caused by the Labor government's overuse of increased numbers in immigration. Enough of that. Tonight I wish to inform the House about some welcome news for the homeless young people in my electorate of Makin. One of the most satisfying aspects of representing the people of Makin in this place is to be able to work towards achieving real and much needed assistance to those members of my local community who are in genuine need. The homeless young people of Makin will benefit from funding from the job placement, employment and training program announced by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone. Disadvantaged young people in Makin will now receive further assistance to help them overcome the barriers to finding a job and a better quality of life. The Salvation Army's Ingle Farm Community Services in Pooraka will receive this funding to assist 100 homeless young people in Makin. The project aims to engage disadvantaged youths in activities which will enable them to develop work skills and behaviours which will help them progress towards further education and training. One of the biggest disadvantages facing these young people is lack of motivation due to a sense of hopelessness which has developed after years of setbacks and of neglect by the previous Labor government. The object of this program is to restore their self-respect and their belief in the future. The program will involve adventure camping and various outdoor activities to provide a medium to help motivate young people and assist them in developing interpersonal skills through team activities. Young people will be linked to specific programs which address their vocational and personal needs. This may involve referral to drug-alcohol rehabilitation and support programs and work experience and training. The people of Makin recognise the valuable work done by the Salvation Army in our local community. I have informed the newly appointed National Secretary of the Salvation Army, Lieutenant Colonel Donald T. Woodland, of my appreciation for the work done by the Ingle Farm Salvation Army Community Services. They really are a community treasure. Young people deserve a fair go. That is what the Howard coalition government, the Salvation Army and many other community and business organisations aim to provide. Providing encouragement and incentive to young people and providing them with real opportunities, skills and, ultimately, real jobs is what the Howard government is all about. No greater proof is needed than the establishment of the work for the dole project, a project which has received overwhelming support from the battlers in Makin. It has received their support because, unlike those opposite, the people of Makin recognise that there is a need to provide unemployed young people with meaningful work experience that will lift their spirits and provide them with the confidence to take on new challenges in their search for real and rewarding jobs. It will take some time to fix the mess left by 13 years of Labor, for which, I remind the House, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) must recognise and accept his fair share of the blame. The real social and economic problems caused by high rates of unemployment will not be solved overnight. The Howard government has already implemented many reforms, such as scrapping Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws, which will lead to the creation of real job opportunities for those who seek work.

210,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"In the very brief time. I have left tonight, as a small businessman with 24 years experience in many differing fields of endeavours, I wish to briefly express my anger, frustration and disappointment at those opposite and those in the other place who oppose what is the government's most significant reform to industrial relations in this country which would have enabled all businesses with less than 15 employees to be exempt from the federal unfair dismissal provisions for new employees for a period of up to 12 months. The government has listened to the concerns of small business and recognised the particular difficulties that small businesses have in dealing with complex industrial relations requirements. The greatest hindrance to small businesses wanting to take on new employees has been their fear of being caught up in litigation if things do not work out for new employees. Those opposite cry crocodile tears for the unemployed, yet they oppose the one change that will give thousands of unemployed Australians the opportunity to join in the economic revival and prosperity that Australians will enjoy over the coming decade.

Disregarding emanating from the CSA staff in their dealings problems seem to be in the assessment levels of the CSS payments by contributing parents-the custodial parents through the scheme. Let me make one point very clear. In most custodial parents in the child support cases, reasonable level of contribution must be marriages. Most non-custodial parents accept maintenance. The problem is the methodology upon which Child Support Agency. Firstly, on the assessment is 18 per cent of gross wages for the first child, children. A major problem is in the use of net effect of this payment to the average non-custodial more in real dollar terms than The government can take a major initiative a percentage of the net wage or by allowing effect of this arbitrary and unfair method of leaving the work force and going onto the dole, off on the dole than having to pay exorbitant current system.

Possibly we, as a government, should look where the custodial parent is allowed to draw moneys contributed by non-custodial parents major items of expenditure on the child or expenses.

(2) Who placed each item identified in part (1) on the agenda and what was the outcome. (3) When and where will the next meeting of the Standing Committee be held. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Standing Committee of Attorneys General (SCAG) met in Melbourne on 14 March 1997. The Human Rights Paper placed before that meeting of SCAG referred to the following human rights issues: - Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; - ILO Convention 169, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989); - Reform of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Scheme Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996; - Optional protocol to the Torture Convention;- Fourth World Conference on Women; - Possible optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child; - Complaints under international communications procedures, and confidentiality regarding these complaints; - Reporting under international communication procedures;-Joint Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission/ Australian Law Reform Commission reference on children and the justice system; - National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families; - Disability standards; NA - Co-operative Arrangements with the States; - Decade of human rights education; - Review of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Other human rights agenda items for the March SCAG meetings were: - The response to the decision in Teoh (2) The Human Rights Paper is placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. The purpose of this Paper is to inform States and Territories about the activities of the Commonwealth in this area and discussion of these issues is ongoing. The paper was noted for the March SCAG meeting. The response to the Teoh decision was placed on the agenda by the Commonwealth. At the March SCAG meeting I outlined the Commonwealth Government's decision in this matter which had been announced in a Joint Statement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 25 February 1997. I wrote to State and Territory Attorneys-General on the same day informing them of the decision. (3) The next meeting of SCAG is scheduled to be held in Brisbane in July 1997. Department of Health and Family Services: Hire Car Companies (Question No. 1538) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 19 March 1997: (1) Which hire car companies have been used by the Minister's Department in the period since 30 April 1996. (2) What sums had been paid to the companies referred to in part (l) up until 28 February 1997.",167
257,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Inquiries within the Department indicate that Canberra Hire Cars Pty Ltd has been used by the Department for hire cars (chauffer driven and executive taxis) in the period 30 April 1996 to 28 February 1997. (2) The Department has paid $9 294.50 to Canberra Hire Cars for hire cars used in that period. Imports and Exports (Question No. 1594)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 March 1997: What quantities of (a) imports and (b) exports Were handled at each Australian port in (i) each year since 1990-91 and the period 1 July to 31 December 1996 and (ii) total, categorised as (A) twenty foot equivalents of containerised cargo, (B) bulk dry cargo, (C) liquid, (D) breaklbulk cargo and (E) general cargo. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department does not have breakups of vessels by twenty foot equivalent unit for international trade. I have supplied instead the statistics for quantity (tonnes) and value($A). The Department has estimated that an average of 14 tonnes (based on Port of Melbourne figures in WaterlineMarch 1997)is carried per teu. Ship categories are different to that requested by the honourable member. This is necessary because of the aggregations that have already been done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to the data supplied to the Department. This data categories the vessels somewhat differently to that requested. The tables try to match the vessel categories as closely as possible to those requested. Ro-ro have been included as a separate category, as these vessels carry both container and break-bulk cargo, as well as vehicles. Positions Classification for 1996 Department of Industrial Relations Staff: Electoral Division of Corio (Question No. 1603) Mr O'Connor asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 26 March 1997: (1) How many staff positions in the Minister's Department were located within the electoral division of Corio as at 1 March (a) 1996 and (b) 1997.

Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has no plans to close any of my Department's regional or suburban offices at this time. National Drug Summit (Question No. 1685) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Will he discuss with the Minister for Health and Family Services and the Attorney-General convening a National Drug Summit featuring State and Territory Health Ministers and Attorneys-General, police and judicial authorities, experts of drug and heroin dependency, and representatives from social welfare and religious bodies in order to discuss new approaches to obtaining a national solution to the heroin problem; if not, why not.",169
258,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I consider that it would be wasteful of resources and unnecessary to convene a national drug summit at this point in time, for two reasons. Firstly, an independent evaluation Drug Strategy has just been completed. The evaluation addressed the advisory and wider consultative mechanisms in place through the National Drug Strategy. The evaluation team, led by Professor Eric Single of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics in the University of Toronto and Professor Tim Rohl of the Australian Graduate School of Police Management in Charles Sturt University, received written submissions and held discussions with expert researchers, service providers, community groups and consumer organisations. The report of the evaluation will be discussed by the Australasian Police Ministers' Council and the Australian Health Minister's Conference at their respective meetings in July 1997. These meetings are expected to look at the future directions of the National Drug Strategy and particularly the incorporation of broader consultative mechanisms as recommended by the evaluators. If such a broad consultative approach can be achieved, a national drug summit will not be necessary. Secondly, the ""heroin problem"" is complex and could not be resolved by a single summit. We need to develop and maintain a multi-faceted, national, strategic approach, such as that being pursued through the Illicit Drugs Expert Working Group (a subcommittee of the National Drug Strategy Committee), in conjunction with ongoing public debate and consultation. This underlines the importance of a broad consultative mechanism within the framework of the National Drug Strategy. National Gun Laws (Question No. 1686) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Do the uniform national gun laws established in 1996 affect the sale, ownership and use of automatic pistols and hand-guns; if so how; if not, will he initiate talks with State and Territory leaders to establish tougher new laws covering the sale, ownership and use of automatic pistols and handguns similar to the laws brought in by the British Government following the Dunblane school massain the field cre; if not, why not.",171
259,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Handguns have been very tightly regulated in Australia since the 1920s. Their ease of concealment and potential for misuse in criminal activity or accidents has led to the general acceptance that they should be subject to the most stringent controls. Consequently all Australian jurisdictions have required handguns to be registered and owners to of the National be licensed. Tests for private access to handguns are so tight in every jurisdiction that, with very few exceptions, they can only be used for the provision of professional security services and competition target shooting. The Nationwide Agreement on Firearms, agreed by all Australian governments on 10 May 1996, places the toughest possible controls on the possession, use, sale, resale and transfer of all firearms, including handguns. Applicants for handgun licences must prove both a ""genuine reason"" for owning, possessing or using a handgun as well as a ""genuine need' for that particular firearm. Applicants must also obtain a permit to acquire a handgun, which is subject to a waiting period of at least 28 days to enable appropriate checks on the applicant by the licensing/registration authorities. The 1996 Agreement also agreed on minimum standards for the security and storage of handguns. These require that handguns be stored in a locked, steel safe with a thickness to ensure it is not easily penetrable, bolted to the structure of a building, and all ammunition must be stored in locked containers separate from any firearms. Sales of firearms, including by mail order, must be conducted only by or through licensed firearms dealers. Mail order sales of handguns must be in accordance with prescribed safety requirements. Most of the measures in the 1996 Agreement have been implemented by State and Territory governments. However, the Commonwealth Government has also taken steps to control the availability of certain handguns by amending the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to include as prohibited items any handguns that have a fully automatic firing capability or resemble a submachine gun, machine pistol or soft air handgun. The Government does not have current plans to re-examine these stringent controls on the possession, use and sale of handguns, but in line with all firearms issues, there will be careful continuing monitoring. People's Constitutional Convention (Question No. 1688) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Are members of the public permitted to approach the Government and apply for appointment to the People's Constitutional Convention to be held in December 1997. (2) How were members of the public made aware that they are permitted to apply for appointment to the People's Constitutional Convention. (3) Did he during (a) his second reading speech on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill or (b) public comments on the People's Constitutional Convention, make it clear that members of the public were invited to apply for appointment to the Convention; if so, (i) when and (ii) what was the exact phrasing of his invitation; if not, why not.

260,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The government will consider all nominations from members of the public for appointment to the Constitutional Convention. (2) No general invitation was issued. However, members of the public made enquiries of my office, Senator Minchin's office and my department about participating in the Convention, both before and after Convention details were announced. Those who wished to do so were encouraged to nominate for appointment. (3)-(5) A public invitation was not seen as a necessary step in assembling a suitably diverse group from which to select the appointed delegates. However, the Government did write to office holders including the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, all Premiers and Chief Ministers, the President of the Australian Local Government Association and the heads of the Australian Republican Movement and the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, inviting them to submit names for consideration. (6) The Government will announce the appointed delegates before nominations close for the election of delegates to the Convention. Depending on passage of the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997, this announcement is, estimated to be in late June. As far as reasonably practical, nominations received before the decision is finalised and announced will be taken into consideration. (7) Close to 700 individuals had been nominated as at 13 May 1997. (8) Those submitting nominations either on their own behalf or on behalf of others would not have had any expectation that their nomination would be made public. In due course, as explained in the answer to (6) above, the Government will announce the names of the appointed delegates. Meanwhile I do not consider it appropriate to release names of nominees. Radioactive Materials (Question No. 1702) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) What safeguards does the Government have in place to monitor the storage of uranium mine tailings and the transport of radioactive material. (2) What is the annual cost to the Government of the monitoring activities. (3) What is the annual cost to the Government of maintaining the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Lucas Heights reactor. (4) Is scientific research being conducted at the Lucas Heights reactor, if so, what. (5) What will be the cost of decommissioning the Lucas Heights reactor and what plans does the Government have for the disposal of the radioactive buildings. (6) What will be the cost of building a new reactor at Jervis Bay. (7) How many cyclotrons are there in Australia and what medical isotopes do they produce. (8) What medical isotopes are produced at Lucas Heights and what medical isotopes are imported into Australia. (9) Where in inland Australia is the Government proposing to place a nuclear waste dump and how will nuclear waste be transported to that site. Mr MCGauran-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Nuclear Codes of Practice were central to the 1977 Commonwealth Government decision to mine and export uranium. Under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978 (Nuclear Codes Act), three national codes of practice have been published based on intemational standards: (i) Code of Practice on the Management of Radioactive Wastes from the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1982) ('Waste Management Code'); (ii) Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1987) (,Radiation Protection Code'); and (iii) Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances (1990) ('Transport Code'). The Codes provide for radiation safety in the mining and milling of radioactive ores and the transport of radioactive material. They have been developed on a federal consultative basis, with implementation of Code requirements remaining the responsibility of individual Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments under the Nuclear Codes Act. Administration of the Codes is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Family Services. The Radioactive Waste Management Code requires development of a waste management program for operations involving the mining and milling of radioactive ores including uranium. The program must be approved by the competent authority. It also requires establishment of a monitoring program, to the satisfaction of the appropriate authority, prior to commencement of construction or development work at the mine or mill. The Transport Code sets out strict conditions for the protection of both the public and workers from the effects of radiation during the transport of radioactive materials. Transport of radioactive materials and licensing of radioisotopes is generally handled by Statefferritory Health departments in accordance with Statefferritory regulations which incorporate Code requirements. The safety of major shipments of Commonwealth radioactive material is regulated on a case by case basis by the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL), with the Nuclear Safety Bureau (NSB) providing advice. As of 1 July 1997 the NSB and ARL will be designated joint Competent Authorities for the purposes of regulating transport of Commonwealth-owned radioactive material. Monitoring the storage of uranium tailings and regulation of the safe transport of uranium is principally the responsibility of State and Territory Governments. However, due to the Commonwealth's involvement in uranium mining in the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth has a more direct role in these activities through the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS). The OSS was established to co-ordinate and supervise measures for the protection and restoration of the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region (ARR) from the effects of uranium mining. These activities include monitoring the adequacy of tailings storage and the transport of uranium within the ARR. From a physical security perspective, the Commonwealth has responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 for transport of fresh and irradiated nuclear fuel and uranium ore concentrates (yellowcake). Under this Act, a system of Permits has been established which requires permit holders to comply with prescriptions laid down by the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO). The requiremcnts of ASO include the physical protection (security) levels to be applied to all movements of 'nuclear material' i.e. uranium, thorium and plutonium. Details are laid down in the permits issued to relevant possessors of nuclear material e.g. ANSTO and the two operators of Australia's uranium mines. (2) Where the Commonwealth has an interest in the above activities for example, from a physical security perspective, in relation to uranium mining in the ARR, and where radioactive material is Commonwealth owned, a number of Commonwealth agencies are involved as indicated above. Since these activities are only a facet of the many activities undertaken by involved agencies it is not possible to attribute an annual cost. In addition, in relation to these activities, costs for certain services are recovered from companies in which case there is no net cost to the Commonwealth Government. (3) The 1996-97 Parliamentary appropriation for ANSTO was $63.65 million which includes funding for maintaining the Lucas Heights Research Reactor. (4) Yes, research is conducted at the Lucas Heights reactor as well as at the other research facilities on the Lucas Heights site. Research is undertaken by ANSTO scientists, visiting international scientists, university staff and PhD students. The nuclear science and technology research conducted by these parties covers a number of areas including the environment, minerals processing, materials, nuclear safety, physics, biomedicine and health. Further details on the research undertaken by ANSTO can be found in the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Annual Report, 1995-96. Research topics being conducted, using ANSTO facilities, by university staff and students can be found in the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering (AINSE) Annual Report 1995. Both these documents are available to the public. (5) The Government has not made a decision on the method of decommissioning for the Lucas Heights reactor. However, the 1993 Research Reactor Review (RRR) addressed this issue and broadly agreed with the approach to decommissioning proposed by ANSTO, which was to put the reactor under care and maintenance for 30 years and after this period of time make a decision Medical Isotope Lucas Heights 99Mof9""'Tc YES 131 1 YES 64Cu YES 90y YES 51Cr YES I92Ir YES 19RAu YES 24Na YES whether to encapsulate the reactor, dismantle it, or extend the care and maintenance period. The estimated cost in the RRR for encapsulation after 30 years care and maintenance was $48.2 million and the estimated cost for dismantling after 30 years was $70.2 million. The above costs were based upon the availability of a national facility to accept the radioactive waste generated from decommissioning. The Government is currently conducting a study to locate a national repository site for low-level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive waste. Radioactive decommissioning wastes which are suitable for near-surface disposal, will be disposed of at a national repository. Long-lived intermediate level (Category S) decommissioning wastes, that are not suitable for near-surface disposal, could be stored at a national store pending deep disposal. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy advises that the small quantity of Category S waste produced by Australia would not, at present, justify construction of a deep disposal facility. Possible co-location of a Category S store with a national near-surface repository is being considered by the Commonwealth/State Consultative Committee on Radioactive Waste Management. (6) There is no proposal for the construction of a research reactor at Jervis Bay and no cost estimates have been made. (7) There are two cyclotrons in Australia that are used for the production of medical isotopes. These are the National Medical Cyclotron (NMC), situated at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney and operated by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, and a smaller cyclotron at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne. The medical isotopes produced by these cyclotrons have been listed in the table provided below in reply to Question 8. (8) The following table lists the isotopes produced in Australia and those imported into Australia. Produced at Produced at Imported into Produced at National Medical Austin Hosp. Australia Cyclotron Cyclotron YES YES YES Medical Isotope Lucas Heights R2Br YES 20lTl 67Ga 1231 IRF 150 13N (9) A site fOl a national repository for low level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive waste has not yet been identified. A public report which will identify a preferred region from the eight regions identified in the 1994 Phase 2 report is expected to be issued later this year Radioactive waste will be transported to a national repository in accordance with strict Produced at Produced at Imported into Produced at National Medical Austin Hosp. Australia 't, Cyclotron Cyclotron YES . YES.;:: NA YES NA NA NA requirements set out in the national Code of Practice on the Safe Transport of Radioactive Waste 1990 and relevant Statefferritory requirements. The mode of transport will depend on where the repository is located and from where in Australia the radioactive waste is to be transported, as well as the quantity to be transported.",172
