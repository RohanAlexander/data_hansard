3,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES," I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Thursday 16 September 1993 of Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal, poet, writer, educator Aboriginal activist, and places preciation of her long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to her family and community in their bereavement. Oodgeroo was born Kathleen Jean Mary Ruska on North Stradbroke Island in 1920. Her parents belonged to the Noonuccal tribe. According to her biographer, she spent a happy childhood with her family on the island but at the age of 13, and at the completion of her primary schooling, she was sent to the mainland as a live-in domestic worker for 2s 6d a week. The outbreak of war enabled her to leave domestic service. She joined the Australian Women's Army Service and worked as a switchboard operator. In 1942 she married Bruce Walker, a descendant of the Logan and Albert River tribes. It was as Kath Walker that she first came to the attention of many Australians. She changed her name by deed poll in 1988-the same year in which she returned her MBE in protest at the bicentennial celebrations, which she felt celebrated a history of systematic discrimination by white people against Aboriginal Australians. 'Two hundred years of humiliation and brutality' was the way she expressed it. She had put essentially the same message in a different way in the powerful poem, We Are Going, in her first volume of poetry of the same name published in 1964. She said: They sit and are confused, they cannot say their thoughts. We are as strangers here now, but the white tribe are the strangers. We belong here, we are of the old ways ... and we are going. Oodgeroo will be remembered both as a fighter for social justice for her people and as a leading Australian writer whose poetry and prose provided new insights into their country for all Australians. During the 1960s she served both as secretary to the Queensland Aboriginal Advancement League and as secretary to the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. She was a key figure in the 1967 referendum campaign. She was one of the first writers to draw our and attention to the importance of land rights. She on record its ap- wrote in 1968: Land is what the Aborigine needs more than anything else, and it is time Australians woke up to the fact that Australia is the sole English-speaking country to refuse land rights to her indigenous people. In this and in other ways she was, as Lois O'Donoghue, the chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, said, 'a SOlJrce of inspiration'. She said of Oodgeroo: She felt deeply the anguish of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the destruction of their languages and culture, the destruction of their sacred places and the ,loss of their land. She went on to say: Always she searched for ways to bring Aboriginal people back into contact with their spiritual past. Mr Speaker, I have already quoted from Oodgeroo's first book of poetry, which became a best seller. Her second book, The Dawn is at Hand, won the Jessie Litchfield literary prize in 1967. She was also a recipient of a fellowship of the Australian Writers Award, the Mary Gilmore medal, and an international acting award. In 1985 she was named Aborigine of the Year, indicating, as if it were needed, the respect and esteem in which she was held by her own people. Throughout her life she assumed the role of educator, believing that a better understanding of' her people would help bring about a more equitable Australia and a more just and lasting reconciliation between Aboriginal and other Australians. Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal will long be remembered. She richly deserved the respect and recognition she received from people in all walks of life. As Pat Dodson, the chair of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation, said, she was a: ... constant reminder to the wider community of the pride and spirituality of indigenous Australians. Australia will always be indebted to her for the depth of appreciation of this land that she sought to make available for all to share'. On behalf of the government, I extend our sincere sympathy to Oodgeroo's family and community in their bereavement.",11
4,Dr HEWSON,CONDOLENCES,"I second the motion. Australia lost one. of its great and passionate voices with the death of Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal, custodian of the land of Minjerriba, or Kath Walker, as she was known for many years. When people speak of Oodgeroo, they speak of her poetry, and the anger and despair that she brought to her stories of the many tragedies of her people. They also speak of the beauty in her poetry as she gave us the pleasure of her 'dreaming'. Yet Oodgeroo was much more than just a great poet. She was an artist and a teacher who brought Aboriginal culture to thousands of school children who visited her over many decades on Stnidbroke Island. Oodgeroo believed, quite rightly, that the education of our children is crucial to building a better understanding between Aboriginal and nonAqoriginal Australians. Oodgeroo's life was marked by many remarkable achievements. She was the first Aboriginal author to be published. Work such as Stradbroke Dreamtime, The Dawn is at Hand, Father Sky and Mother Earth, and We Are Going have stood, and will continue to stand, the test of time. Her stories not only brought us all a bit closer to an understanding of the Aboriginal people and their culture, history and beliefs but they have also contributed to the awakening of a wider community, a community that had. for too long been ignorant of the vast culture of our indigenous people. She was a tireless fighter for the rights of Aboriginal people- Indeed, she fought all her life, not only for the rights of Aboriginal people and the environment, but just as passionately against racism, prejudice and ignorance. Much of the credit for the success of the 1967 referendum on Aboriginal voting rights has rightly gone to Oodgeroo. The story goes that in the years leading up to 1967 and to the referendum, in a meeting with Prime Minister Menzies, Kath Walker, as she was then known, asked for and was - offered a glass of sherry by Prime Minister Menzies. On receiving the glass, Kath Walker told the Prime  that I warn you that under the laws of Queensland you would be in the position of either getting two weeks in gaol or a fine of Â£50 for giving me this'. . Needless to say, she left an indelible impression on Menzies, as she did on so many who had the privilege of meeting and talking with her. In her own way, Oodgeroo began the process of reconciliation long before it was recognised in this parliament, and for that she should have the respect and admiration of all of us here. Today we pass on our condolences to the family of Oodgeroo, but in doing so we pay tribute to a life that has enriched our nation. We owe it to Oodgeroo, her family and the wider community to ensure that we continue the process of reconciliation that she so tirelessly and passionately strove for. Mr Speaker, I would like to finish with a brief poem called My Love by Oodgeroo, which is an effective statement of her life: Possess me? No I cannot give The love that others know, For I am wedded to a cause: The rest I must forgo. You claim me as your very own, My body, soul and mind; My love is my own people first, And after that mankind. The social part, the personal I have renounced of old; Mine is a dedicated life, No man's to have and hold. Old white intolerance hems me round, Insult and scorn assail; I must be free, I must be strong To fight and not to fail. For there are ancient wrongs to right, Men's malice to endure; A long road and a lonely road, But oh, the goal is sure.",12
5,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"On behalf of the National Party of Australia, I rise to support this condolence motion which acknowledges the death of Oodgeroo, whom many Australians will know as Kath Walker. Since her passing I have read with interest the various articles in the media about her in which she has been described as a 'national treasure', a 'battler' and a 'trailblazer'. I also read of memorial service and burial of Oodgeroo on Stradbroke Island whilst humpback whales swam slowly out to sea through Moreton Bay. I am sure it must have been a very moving service for all involved, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who was present that day. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have said, her political involvement goes back many decades and includes the watershed 1967 referendum regarding Australians of Aboriginal heritage. This referendum was passed by a record majority of some 93 per cent-a great victory for Oodgeroo's cause for full-scale recognition of all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, and also bringing them for the first time into the census count on a full and proper basis. Oodgeroo set out in a positive way through education to elevate Australians of Aboriginal heritage and to communicate their particular problems to those she saw as her people's oppressors. I have no doubt that she disagreed with me and many others on all sides of politics on some issues, but she pushed on with her determination and dedicated views about her people. She was, above all else, a keeper of the spirit. From Stradbroke Island, to Mungo, to Carnarvon Gorge and right across Australia her work and her poetry certainly maintained the morale and spirit of so many people in a way which is properly recognised here today. Oodgeroo was a great Australian and a great representative of her people. On behalf of the National Party, I extend my sympathy to her family and to all those who have been deeply touched by her wisdom and her writings.",13
6,Mr TICKNER,CONDOLENCES,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs)-I first met Oodgeroo of the Noonuccal tribe soon after I became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1990, and I had the pleasure of meeting her and working with her on many occasions after then. There is much that could be said about this outstanding Australian, but I would like to focus my remarks on that aspe-t of her life and creed which consumed the Oodgeroo for much of her life-reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. Oodgeroo was a staunch ally of the reconciliation process. She was driven by sheer dedication to the process, involving, as it does, commitment to. social justice, a program to educate the wider community about indigenous issues and consultation on a formal document of reconciliation, by whatever name, as one of the possible outcomes of the process. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is right to highlight that, while the process officially began in 1990 with the unanimous support of the parliament, Oodgeroo recognised the process much earlier as the only true path towards a united Australia. At her funeral last week her surviving son, Denis, said that if reconciliation was achieved between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians his mother would truly rest in peace. He said that the main message was reconciliation, healing and peace and the only way we are going to get that is through mutual respect for his culture and all other cultures. Oodgeroo's numerous poetry books contained liberal smatterings of her philosophy and her personal commitment to reconciliation. Perhaps one of the best known, and one of the earliest published examples of this, is the poem Son of Mine from her first book We Are Going published in 1964. Whilst I am under no illusions that my delivery will do justice to the poem, I hope honourable members will bear with me as I read from it: My son, your troubled eyes search mine, Puzzled and hurt by colour line, Your black skin, soft as velvet shine, What can I tell you, son of mine? I could tell you of the heartbreak, hatred blind, I could tell you of the crimes that shame mankind, Of brutal wrong and deeds maligned, Of rape and murder, son of mine, But I'll tell you instead of brave and fine, When lives of black and white entwine, And men in brotherhood combine, This would I tell, son of mine. In 1988, in protest against the bicentennial celebrations, she changed her name from Kath Walker and renounced what some regarded as her highest honour: the MBE that she was awarded in the 1970 Queen's Birthday honours. It was not a popular decision at the time in some quarters when patriotism was at fever pitch. However, popularity was not Oodgeroo's trophy; it was the knowledge that she had remained true to herself and to Aboriginal people. Despite all that she endured, Oodgeroo did feel that Australia had a future worth nurturing. I do not propose to dwell on the many accolades which were heaped on her during her literary and political life except to say that, had she received none of them, she would still have been seen as a hero to many Australians and particularly to Aboriginal people. She sought to help others free themselves from the shackles of ignorance that have plagued relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.Â· She knew that with knowledge came understanding. A gentle and peaceful person, she sought to teach rather than confront. Oodgeroo's greatest hope was that children would lead Australia to a brighter and more harmonious future. From the time she returned to her home of Moongalba on North Stradbroke Island in the early 1970s, she taught thousands of children, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, about Aboriginal life and culture. Many years ago she expressed the opinion that Aboriginal studies sh(mld be compulsory for all students. She said that non-Aboriginal students wanted to learn about Aboriginal issues and culture but were being frustrated by lack of teaching staff and relevant courses. It was her hope that Aboriginal studies would be introduced into all levels of the education system in her lifetime. It was a hope that was at least partly fulfilled due to her own work. She was also committed to seeing that, most importantly, teilchers learnt as part of their regular training to teach Aboriginal history and culture effectively, and advanced that objective through her own involvement in a very important recent initiative of the University of New South Wales. Over the past few years Aboriginal studies have made it into classrooms as never before. However, Oodgeroo was aware that much more remains to be done and constantly urged Commonwealth, state and territory governments to do even more to advance the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. Through her contributions to this country, I believe Oodgeroo did so very much to advance the process of reconciliation and her loss will be mourned by the nation.",13
7,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to say a few words in support of this condolence motion on the death of Oodgeroo Noonuccal. Many words have been used to describe hertenacious, passionate, loyal, talented, controversial and stubborn. They give some insight into her, but are really inadequate to describe the life and the impact of a woman who has been a battler, an activist, an author, a poet, an artist, an actor and an educator. Her passion for her people ranged from nurturing her extended family, to promoting the culture of her people through her own literary works and art, and educating both black and white young people about Aboriginal history and culture. Her passion, however, led her to become a committed activist on behalf of her people, and many a politician from all sides of politics felt the wrath of Oodgeroo. The term 'trailblazer' is indeedÂ· an apt description of her. As a young black woman reared on Stradbroke Island and one of six children, where her formal education had ended by the age of 13, it is remarkable that this woman became the first Aboriginal author to be published; to produce works of prose and poetry; to be honoured by several universities, including being made a Doctor of Literature of Macquarie University-this being one of four honorary doctorates; to travel internationally as an official envoy to numerous conferences; to lecture overseas and win a Fulbright scholarship; to be a poet in residence at Bloomsburg State College, Pennsylvania; and to receive an international acting award for her part in Shadow Sister, a film about her life. Perhaps the bestowing on her by her own tribal elders of a long necklace of white shells, a sacred object of great honour, set her apart, because this honour was not normally bestowed on women. She was, first and foremost, both ambassador and activist for her people. Changing her name from Kath Walker to her Aboriginal name Oodgeroo Noonuccal was a public recognition of her roots. Just as she constantly sought a greater understanding of her own history and culture, she encouraged others to do likewise and have pride in their history. Above all, she loved teaching Aboriginal lore to young children, both black and white, and channelled her energies and hope into achieving aÂ· greater level of understanding through them. In her own words: But all you can do is give the young the benefit of your experience. I'm not going to dictate to them what they should be doing. That's their responsibility, not mine. I just want to be able to look myself fair in the eye and say, win lose or draw I've done my best. The physical presence of Oodgeroo will be missed but she survives through the rich legacy of her work. She forced Australia to confront its Aboriginal past and carved a place for her people in Australia's future. I extend my sympathy to her family.",14
8,Mr NUGENT,CONDOLENCES,"I would like to add to my colleagues' words of condolence following the death of a great Australian. Oodgeroo, of the tribe Noonuccal, custodian of the land Minjerriba-otherwise known for much of her life as Kath Walker-as we have heard was born on Stradbroke Island. She was a member of a large family and led a very rich and varied life. Having left school at a very early age, she went into domestic service, for 2s 6d a week. Subsequently, she served in the army. Later in life, at the age of 37, she returned to education. That became a passion in her life, as time went by. Her first book, We Are Going, was published in 1964. It was her second book, The Dawn is at Hand, which won her the 1967 Jessie Litchfield literary prize. In 1970 she was awarded the MBE, which was handed back at the time of the bicentenary celebrations. She was active in a number of other ways. In 1976 she was a delegate and senior adviser at the First World Black Festival of Arts in Nigeria. In 1978 she won a Fulbright scholarship and she was appointed a member of the Aboriginal Arts Board of Australia in 1983. I am told that she was even once a member of the state women's cricket team. Even in her 70s, in 1992, she was out and about getting doctorates from Monash University and the Queensland University of Technology. Her activities were not confined to this country. InternationaIIy, her poems were included in an anthology published in the Soviet Union. She was listed in the Black Hall of Fame in Washington and she spent a term as poet in residence at Bloomsburg State College in Pennsylvania. She was Australia's delegate to the World Council of Churches consultation on racism and she was a member of an Australian delegation which toured China in 1985. Amongst this seemingly endless list of ' achievements, perhaps the entry in Who 50 Who best underlines her love of nature and the land of her dreaming because her recreations are listed simply as 'fishing'. Her achievements are seen as outstanding, not merely because Oodgeroo was Aboriginal. She was an outstanding human being by any yardstick. However, to my mind, it was Oodgeroo's AboriginaIity which fired her existence, her spirit and her strength. It was her Aboriginality which clearly infonned her writing, her political activism, and her compassion and desire to see her people take their place as equals in this great Australian nation. She grew up in an Australia which practised, specifically through law, a fonn of apartheid where marriage between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people often was subject to ministerial authorisation, where award wages were different depending on one's race, and where a protector could take over wages and put them in a so-called trust account, where a protector could take over the property of an Aboriginal person with or without the person's consent, and where legislation often specifically discriminated against an Aboriginal .person in tenns of benefits and awards allowed under legislation. This basically meant that, if you were Aboriginal and lived in an institution, on a reserve or in many working areas, someone else had control of your wages, your pension, your property-in other words, your life. This was the world which Oodgeroo fought so tirelessly to change, and it was for these reasons that she saw the 1967 constitutional referendum as being so vital in lifting the position of her people. She played a key role in persuading the Commonwealth government to hold that referendum which extended the Commonwealth's power to have a greater capacity to fonnulate programs specifically designed to address disadvantage for Aboriginal people-in other words, positive discrimination. In spite of some recent criticism of how some of those programs might have been in tenns of their effectiveness, I think little doubt that many gains have been made by the Aboriginal people and the Aboriginal community in the last 25 years. Oodgeroo's family can be proud of her contribution towards that advancement of her people. She used every minute of her time, every ounce of her strength and every facet of her talents to make Australia a better place. As the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) said, it has been reported that her dying wish was for reconciliation between all Australians. Her son, Denis Walker, said, 'Reconcile, and Oodgeroo will truly rest in peace'. I would hope that all Australians would want to identify with that wish, and I join the previous speakers in offering my condolences to Oodgeroo's family, friends and to her people.",15
9,Mr SCIACCA,CONDOLENCES,"Bowman-;-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) - It is with a mixture of sadness and pride that I rise today to pay tribute to Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal. I do so as her member in this House for the last six years and on behalf of the thousands of people in my electorate who have been touched by her in some way over the years. Oodgeroo-or Kath Walker, as many people remember her-was a great Australian. But, I guess like all great Australians, she had her detractors as well as those who revered her. The tall poppy syndrome, of course, is one of the more immature aspects of our Australian culture-an unwillingness to be proud of our great achievers. But Oodgeroo has given us a memory, a memory of someone who. is willing to fight for her beliefs, to accept the knocks with the plaudits, to do everything in her power to make the world a better place to live in for everyone. I do not pretend to have been the closest of friends with Oodgeroo, but I have watched her with interest over the years and met her on numerous occasions. I have always been impressed by her personal demeanour and the way in which she operated. There was one thing we definitely did have in common and that was a shared love for North Stradbroke Island, where there are still some of the most beautiful and unspoilt stretches of beaches there is this country has to offer. We first came into close contact over a decade ago, before I became a member of this House. I was approached by Kath to help set up the North Stradbroke Island housing cooperative. I did so in my capacity as a solicitor at the time. Oodgeroo was responsible for a number of community enterprises on Stradbroke Island. Besides the very successful housing co-op, there was a health centre, a preschool group and an extension of the Redlands Community College. But her centre at Moongalba was her greatest love. Kath always wanted to create a unique centre for educating children, university students and teachers of all races in the ways of the riginal culture. Since 1972 there have been over 8,000 visitors to Moongalba, including academics from the USA, Japan, Germany, the USSR, Pacific islands, Sweden and other smaller countries. There have been many awards for Oodgeroo over the years-as has already been stated-both literary and academic. She held honorary doctorates from Macquarie, Griffith and Monash universities and, more recently, from the Queensland University of Technology. Her poetry and belief in the power of politics through the arts are well known and documented. Kath travelled extensively overseas after she came tei world prominence in the political arena due to the part she played as the Queensland campaign director for the 1967 referendum to change the Australian constitution so as to allow Aborigines to be counted as Australian citizens. Thanks to people such as Oodgeroo, Australia has moved ahead somewhat since those days. Oodgeroo had many friends in my electorate, in Queensland and, J guess, in Australia generaliy. Joan Hendriks, the teacher coordinator of the School of Aboriginal and Torres Strait IslanderÂ· Education at Kangaroo Point TAFE college in Brisbane remembers her most by three words that she used to say all the time: 'Don't hate-educate'. Estelle Bertossi and Rose Borey, women of Aboriginal descent who live on Stradbroke Island, have been associated with Kath since 1945 when, as teenagers, they worked in Brisbane, were taken under her wing and lived with her. They remember her tireless dedication, the endless hours of work and the civil rights speeches when civil rights for Aborigines were non-existent in most communities. They remember the sorrow, the laughter, the pride and the inexhaustible energy of this lone Aboriginal woman as she fought against the injustices perpetrated under the Aborigines Protection Act where children were removed from their families and Aborigines banished to other missions at the drop of a hat. They also remember Kath as a sportswoman in her own right and the many hours she spent teaching children to swim at the local swimAbo- ming pool. They remember the laughter and the stories. Stan MCBride, an Aborigine now based at Zillmere, reminds me that Kath was very active in the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders-FCAATSI, as. it was called. To get to meetings in Canberra they ran raffles to pay for the bus and train tickets, but were always supported by donations from various organisations, including waterSide workers and other similar unions and organisations. Stan tells me that most of the issues Kath fought for in those early days are now in place following the 1967 referendum. She has helped shape Australian history. No greater tribute can one achieve. Bruce Borey, another of Oodgeroo's friends, reminds me of her gift as a writer and teacher. He tells me that in all the years that he knew Oodgeroo she was trying to teach us to look past our prejudices and to accept our differences. She never worked for financial gain nor selfish motives. She genuinely wanted to make this country a better place for all Australians. I remember that, only a few weeks ago at the last public function where I met Oodgeroo, she was running around chasing a dog with a stick. I did not know at that time that she was sick, and obviously she was very sick. Another friend of Kath's tells me of the very last meeting Kath attended before she went into hospital. Several eager admirers, when introduced to Kath for the first time, gushed at her and declared what a wonderful thing it was to meet the great Oodgeroo. With a smirk on her face and a twink1e in her eye, Kath's response was, 'Well, you've met me now; so what?'. Oodgeroo was never one much for show. She was more concerned about the issues, about how people were going to lead their lives, about how their decisions were going to impinge on others, and vice versa. In conclusion, I want to use the words of yet another good friend of Oodgeroo, Phil Edser, from the Minjerriba Study Accommodation Centre based at Dunwich on North Stradbroke Island. He said: This physical world has been immeasurably enriched by the very existence of this proud woman of great substance. The lingering memory I hold of her is that of a tremendously courageous and spirited woman. At a time in our social history, when it was commonplace for women to remain with their children in the cloistered environment the home, it must have taken exceptional courage and spirit to stand up and champion the cause of the Australian Aboriginal people. What Kath lacked in her physical size she more than compensated for through her brave heart and aura of presence. We shall miss her. I offer my condolences to Denis Walker and Oodgeroo's family, and to all those who loved and respected her. May the people of Australia never forget the work that she has done and the gift she has left us with writing;",16
10,Mr HOLDING,CONDOLENCES,"It is with some sadness but with a sense of responsociety sibility that I rise to pay my tribute to Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal. dominant white culture into which Kath. Walker was born, the measure of her achievethings ment not simply as an Aboriginal but as an Aboriginal woman is enormous if we look at the pressures she faced, the nature of society in which she lived and the role that she was prepared to play in that society. There are few women in any society who of could achieve what she has achieved. I do know that even at this stage this parliament fully aware of the leadership role that riginal women have taken on their shoulders and are now playing on behalf of their people. KathWalker was a prime example I am bound to say, as an ex-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, that I doubt whether there was any Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to whom she did not give a hard time from time to time, but it was always done with a wry smile. She put her arguments forthrightly frankly and could not abide condescension, hypocrisy or cant. I will not speak about Kath Walker's literary achievements because they speak themselves. They do not need any praise from me, nor indeed I think from any member of this House. But I do want to say that all life she fought unremittingly things. Firstly, she fought to get a dominant white culture to realise the extent and the depth of Aboriginal culture and the contribution that it could make to the development of our society if only the Aboriginal people were given a go. . Secondly, Kath Walker was a woman of of great compassion, not only in her attitude to her own people for whom she was a fearless and continuing advocate, but also particularly for young people, both black and white. At the time she died she was still active on the great issues confronting Australia. I suppose the two groups in Australia that have always had the hard end of society are the last people to get off the boat and our indigenous people. For 200 years Aboriginal her people have pleaded to become part of a broader Australian society, despite all the things that have occurred to them. This has only to reach out and it can be part of a great 60,000-year tradition in its Given the relationship to this land. The real spirit of Kath Walker was in the that she stood for and the arguments she put. These are still being put-they are being put within some small distance of this the parliament. Apart from this condolence motion, this parliament will face its moment of truth when we come to deal with the issues Mabo and reconciliation. The spirit of Kath not Walker is abroad within the Aboriginal is community, and it is also abroad within this Abosociety. The measure of how we empathise and respond to her life will shortly be measured by the way in which this parliament of that. deals with these great issues. I pay my sincere condolences to Kath's son, Denis. I have no doubt at all that the inspiration of his mother will enable him to lead and playa similar and important role on behalf of the indigenous people of this land. I believe, and when we finally determine how we will resolve the processes of reconciliation and Mabo, . .the spirit of Kath Walker will be sitting in judgment. That is when she will for decide whether we have passed a condolence motion that is really responding to a great life, a great spokeswoman for the Aboriginal her people and a great spokeswoman for the to do several whole of Australia.",18
11,Mr KATTER,CONDOLENCES,"Having known Kath Walker for some considerable period of time on a personal basis, I would like to add to what has already been said, extensive as those comments have been. Kath was born in a period when it was good for people to be shy about their Aboriginal descent because if they were not they could be packed off to reservations, as they were then called. In the second period, it was smart to be an 'Uncle Tom' so that one could be looked after and trotted out at all important ceremonies. As Kath grew up, she did not fit into that category. Then we entered a period when it was the thing to be filled with shrieking, hate-filled aggression. Kath did not fit into that category. A previous speaker, Kath's member of parliament, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca)who I suppose, like me, knew her-said that she was a quiet person. When it became very fashionable to get a lot of money and very nice jobs, Kath did not come forward during that period either. It seems that whatever it was popular to be, Kath most certainly was not-whether she was out of step or had a will to fight, I do not know. Finally, and I think it is one of the sad comments that I have to make today, even though Kath hated what was happening and had a very clear vision of what might bewhich she never lost sight of-she did not let her beliefs overflow into vindictive hatreds on a racial or personal basis. Her member of parliament said that previously, and I endorse his sentiments very strongly. Here was a person who could come to you without hate filling her soul. I found her a very popular person. Kath mixed with many people on Stradbroke Island. Even though there were some very angry fights, Kath took the position that sandmining on the island should stop. This decision was very unpopular since about 90 per cent of her people on the island had jobs associated with the sandmining interests. But she believed in and was going to press ahead with that view regardless of what anyone else said. People when they met her could not help liking Kath. Without hate in her soul, she stated her position. However outrageous it might have been at times, people could not help liking her for having that trait. She put a very legitimate request to me for some land which was being occupied by squatters. It was not an outrageous ambit claim or demand; it was a legitimate request. A sad part of Aboriginal affairs in Australia is that, to my knowledge, that request still has not been agreed to. Instructions were written out-I left the ministry soon afterwards-but have never been carried out despite all of - he changes that have occurred. It is sad to think thatKath, who had love in her heart and a vision for her country-for her special people but also I think for the bigger Australian nation-should have left the scene with still one of the things dearest and closest to her heart un accomplished. I think that, amongst many other things, there is another message to be carried there today. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA Budget 1993-94",18
12,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I refer the Treasurer to his decision to abandon the unconstitutional omnibus tax bill and replace it with eight separate bills. Why does the Treasurer persist with a strategy of introducing bills of doubtful constitutionality when even he concedes that at least one of the eight bills could still be unconstitutional? Why does not the Treasurer simply bury the uncertainty by introducing separate bills for - ach tax change?,19
13,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must say the honourable member for Mayo sounds better with a cold. The honourable member for Mayo has been about making mischief in this area for some considerable time. What he should know is that no bevy of QCs,. no array of senators in some committee, no Senate itself, can determine the constitutionality or otherwise of any particular measure which is put to the parliament. Indeed, the very firm advice that we have had and that we continue to receive from the senior sources of legal advice available to the Commonwealth is that the original bill was and remains constitutionally valid. , Opposition members interjecting",19
14,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am only telling the opposition what I am told from the legal sources of advice. If we were to respond to some of these questions which have been raised by the various legal counsel who have come to the committeeMr Downer-Have you heard what the Prime Minister is saying about you?,20
15,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether the honourable member is interested in the answer, but he might shut up if he is. The point is that the eight bills that have been proposed and will be introduced into the House tonight have been constructed in a way suggested by the Chief General Counsel, who has said that this is a way in which one could respond. These bills were provided to the opposition on Friday as a courtesy so that they could, hopefully, receive speedy passage through this House and, hopefully, through the Senate as well. Yet when the honourable member for Mayo was asked about this matter on Sunday, he said that, whilst he had not received any advice about the constitutional validity of these eight bills, he expected to receive some and he expected to be told that some of these bills would be unconstitutional. When he was asked which of these two bills might be unconstitutional, instead of saying, 'I don't know', which was obviously the right answer, he went on to say: Well, they're 2 indirect tax bills. One of them, use the government's own words, is a test bill which relates - o taxes, for example, on things credit unions and the like. The so-called test bill does not relate to credit unions at all and certainly does not relate to anything to do with indirect tax as the honourable member for Mayo suggested. He then went on to say: The other bill involves the changes to taxation arrangements for friendly societies and some of sales tax measures. In fact, the other one to which the honourable member seems to be referring does not include anything to do with friendly societies or anything to do with sales tax measures, either. It seems to me that the last person in the world, and certainly the last person in this House, who should be offering any advice .or opinions on these matters is the honourable member for Mayo. I say to the honourable member for Mayo, because a few QCs say that there may be some constitutional questions about these things, that the only way in which the matter can be clarified is by the High Court. The only way this matter can get to the High Court is if the parliament passes a bill which includes the issue of rates increases as well as other subjects of taxation. It is for this reason that we are simply offering an opportunity for those who believe there is an issue-and the government does not believe there is an issue-to have this bill put before the High Court and determined by it in a way which was notMr Downer-Why don't you settle it by splitting the bill? Mr DAWKINS"""":'"" The honourable member asks: how can this. matter be settled? This matter could be settled if those opposite did the decent and proper thing and simply voted for these bills. These bills are not unusual. What those opposite should do is simply get on with it and pass these bills as they should. Olympic Games",20
16,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In light of the tremendous success of the Australian people in winning the bid for the year 2000 Olympics, can the to Prime Minister tell the House what approach the Commonwealth government will be taking like to do all it can with the New South Wales government to ensure the games are the best ever staged.",20

18,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Honourable memthe bers on my left will cease interjecting. The Prime Minister has risen to respond to an issue which I would have thought was of some significance.,20
20,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The decision of the International Olympic Committee was a marvellous result for which great credit must go to the bid committee and to those who by financial and other means supported it. Special congratulationsÂ· should, of course, go to the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, the New South Wales government, the chief executive ofÂ· the bid committee, Mr Rod MCGeoch, and the President of the Australian Olympic Committee, John Coates. Just as importantly, congratulations should go to the people of Sydney, to the hundreds of individuals who offered their time, devotion and resources to the mammoth task of winning this important international decision from this very large international body. The story of the bid was really a story of hundreds of workers: from the school children in the presentation film to the Foreign Affairs officers around the world who put in countless hours; from people likeÂ· Bob Elphinston, who was the manager of the bid office, to Neil Flett and David Mason and the men and women who put together the excellent presentation for the bid. I think that presentation had a material influence on the result. We should also remember the bids of Melbourne and Brisbane, both of which were necessary to make this bid a success. They were both good bids. They were rejected by the roc in their time, but they were the building blocks upon which the Sydney bid was built. Without them, with a majority of simply one vote, I am quite certain it would not have been possible for Sydney to win. But above all, the victory was a victory for the people of Australia and for Australians in their love of sport. Mr Reith-It certainly wasn't a vote for your flag changing plans or for your republic.",20
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Flinders!,21
22,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is having his 11th year in opposition; he should enjoy it. It was a victory that depended on our good name in sport, and on our record in supporting principles of fair play and racial equality in sport. Mr Reith-Which you have set out to suUy as quickly as possible.",21
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Flinders.,21
24,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The next seven years will be a test for all of us, all governments and communities, to build on these things. Mr Downer-You are dividing the nation.",21
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Mayo.,21
26,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the House that the Commonwealth Government will be working cooperatively with the government of New South Wales to ensure a successful games. The bid was. a great joint effort between all levels of government and sectors of the community and this government will continue to work cooperatively with the New South Wales government in the many things that will need to be done between now and the year 2000 to make the bid and its awarding a success as a games proper. I think it is important to use the Olympics as a spur to a greater general effort for the country at large. This decision was applauded widely overseas because it went to a free and fair society. I think the nation we have become, the values we hold, were very much in the upper mind of the International Olympic Committee. To defeat a bid as strong as that of China, which has such a large proportion of the world's population,and to defeat it when I am quite sure the Chinese were quite confident of its success, was not only a significant thing to have been done, but it was done largely around not just the values of sport but the freedom and sense of democracy which Australians have and which have been recognised not only around the world but most particularly by the International Olympic Committee. So the showcase which the Olympics provide for us can be more than a showcase for our ability to organise a great event. It can be a showcase for our social and economic values and achievements. Our multicultural society, which played an important part in the presentation of Australia for this award, is also an important thing for us to show the success of our tolerance in developing, as we have, a successful multicultural society in Australia. So these social and economic values, which are important to us, will be important to demonstrate to the rest of the world in the showcase opportunity which the Olympic Games will offer. It is also important that we fulfil our contract and our responsibilities as we reach the year 2000 with evidence that racial discrimination and prejudice are behind us. While it is important, there will be an emphasis on the way in which we relate to our indigenous Australians, which was part of the condolence motion a moment ago, and why the Mabo legislation, a key part of that reconciliation process, will be important in the run up to the Olympics and the year 2000. It is also important that we attempt in this period to overcome the largest blight we have, that is, unemployment-which is still affecting not just our country but also the developed world-to see in which ways we can deal with unemployment so that we have justifiable pride by the year 2000 in being able to say that it is down. Mr Speaker, in the two weeks that I have been away I have been convinced of how well Australia has done in recent years relative to the rest of the world.Â· In economic terms we have more than held our own. In social terms we are well ahead of all but a few. For all our problems, when one returns to Australia, one returns to a good, peaceful and efficient society. Everyone who steps off a plane after being through the Northern Hemisphere, or most anywhere else in the world, understands that to be completely true.",21
27,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. At the beginning of the Prime Minister's answer, because of the subject matter of the question, you called on the opposition, in the name of bipartisanship, not to interject. The Prime Minister is now clearly going beyond answering a question on the Olympic games. He is raving on about his own government. Mr Speaker, you should tell the Prime Minister, having completed his answer, to sit down and not prevail on our bipartisan attitude to something that all Australians love and revere.",22
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,22
29,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Bennelong is objecting to the fact that I said that this is a good, peaceI ful and efficient society.",22
30,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You were raving about your government.,22
31,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. I said that in economic terms we have more than held our ownwhich is true-and that in social policy we are well ahead of all but a few. I know that the opposition always wants to deprecate the country-deprecate and blackguard the place-but the fact is that we can say in all truth that this is a peaceful, good and efficient country, regardless of the opposition's twisted view of the world. In one sense, the Olympic decision confirms our achievement as a progressive social democracy because very much in the minds of the members of the International Olympic Committee were these values, and they are values which we on this side of the House particularly hold to be true while ever we have the capacity to keep them true. It also gives us incentive to do even better. I would have thought that members of the opposition. would join with the government in the opportunity to see that between now and the year 2000 the values which we hold dear, those which have become synonymous with Australia and Australians, those which were important in this decision, are values which are not only held uppermost over this period but are values on which we can build. This was an important international decision-an important international endorsement of Australia, its values, of the country we have become. All Australians should celebrate it, including honourable members of the federal opposition, because I am quite sure that their counterparts in New South Wales feel as we do: that this is a great opportunity for Australia, a great endorsement for Australia, and that with that endorsement comes an opportunity by the year 2000 to build even further on the great democratic and social values which this country has. Budget 1993-94",22
32,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his reported comment: am prepared to be the bunny for Keating on the budget. Does the Treasurer believe that he alone is responsible for the government's catastrophic budget, or does he believe that he has had to pick up the pieces of the Prime Minister's conceived strategy?",22
33,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I notice that the honourable member for Mayo is now flanked by two prompts-one a failed Treasurer and one a failed shadow Treasurer. One could just imagine what sort of advice he is getting. The former failed Treasurer gave us double digit inflation and double digit unemployment, while the failed shadow Treasurer gave us another election victory. Since the Prime Minister became Prime Minister and I became Treasurer, we have seen a period in Australia when it has had the fastest rate of growth of any industrialised country and the lowest rate of inflation in the profession. entire world. This budget is making sure that we continue with that record: fast growth with low inflation and low interest rates-the kind of outlook that will provide the kind of certainty and security, not only for our own companies but also for the increasing number of overseas companies who want to do business in this country. The Prime Minister and I are a great team and will continue to be so. Legal Services: Exports",23
34,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. What is the government's attitude on the role of the legalprofesprogram, sion in broadening Australia's export base and the closer integration of the economy with the Asia-Pacific region?",23
35,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last week honourable members might have seen reports in the financial press about the opening up of the Japanese legal services market. This market alone is expected to be worth something like $A5 billion, and is only one of a range of marketsÂ· available to Australia in the Asia Pacific region. As that region continues to grow very rapidly, and given the fine state of legal expertise in our legal institutions in Australia, we are well placed to secure an improving and increasing level of legal exports. The legal profession has t to address some matters in order to secure Australia's opportunities in the export of legal services. The first and most pressing of those is the question of the nature of the legal profession: iIlnamely, are we to have a truly national legal profession rather than a combination-as we have at the moment-of state based professions and, in some instances, two professions in each state and territory? A range of reforms has been undertaken dealing with uniform admission rules, as well as having standard sets for continuing legal education. The Law Council of Australia, amongst other bodies, has been very much involved. However, we need to ensure th-t our legal profession meets the challenge raised by the export markets of Asia and the Pacific. It is not solely a question for the legal The government has taken the lead through the formation of two very important committees designed to work with the private profession to expand our export opportunities. The first of these is the International Legal Services Advisory Committee, ILSAC, under the very able leadership of Sir Laurence Street. This committee has operated for the past three years and has been well regarded for its success in establishing Australian legal contacts throughout our region. The second, the Australian Indo-China legal cooperation is a direct initiative of the government. This program was funded in.the recent budget to the tune of $300,000 and is aimed at the countries of Indo-China with which Australia does have a close relationship, namely, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. These two bodies are working with the private sector and with private law schools and do offer Australia a very real opportunity to tap into an enormous export market. Australia should seize the opportunity. I am confident that at the 28th legal convention in Hobart this week the profession will come to grips with the issue of getting a truly national profession operating, and that, from that confident base, Australia will be able to achieve the export earnings that are available to this country in legal services. Budget 1993-94",23
36,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Why has he been telling his colleagues that it was the Prime Minister who set the mainÂ· budget parameters and that he was left to clean up the mess?,24
37,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been telling nobody any such thing. As I have said before, this is a budget which is entirely appropriate to our circumstances, both current and future. If anyone has gone through a metamorphosis, it is the Leader of the Opposition himself, because he used to believe in low deficits. He now believes in higher and higher deficits. He no longer believes, as he once did, that there should be financial certainty, that one should recognise that at a time when Australia is an international economy which has an internationally traded currency it is highly inappropriate for the Opposition",24
38,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you resign?,24
39,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Criticism is fine. The Leader of the Opposition knows that his irresponsibility is wrong, but he is continuing to be irresponsible in order to raise a few cheap cheers from his backbench. Just because the Leader of the Opposition is under pressure, it does not mean that he should threaten the security of this economy or the future of this country. It is about time he realised what his responsibilities were-that there is an overridlng requirement for him to actually discharge some of the heavy responsibilities he has as the Leader of the Opposition and pass this budget, as he should. Regional Australia",24
40,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development aware of the Industry Commission's draft report on impediments to regional industry adjustment? In particular, is the minister aware of the report's recommendations dealing with wages and social security policy? Can the minister outline to the House the initiatives which the government has taken to enhance the well-being of regional Australia?",24
41,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Industry Commission inquiry into structural adjustment in regional Australia is, at this point, only a draft report. It is a bit like the curate's egg: it is good in parts. The parts I would take issue with as, I think, being somewhat ill-informed in terms of real life problems in regional Australia, go to the issues of award wage arrangements and, in particular, the areas touching upon social security issues. Earlier the Prime Minister spoke about values. Thank goodness we have a parliament and a government that adds the value to these types of reports, because this report is not underpinned by any realistic understanding of what drives industry in Australia more generally or in regional Australia in particular. As Peter Roberts correctly observed in the Australian Financial Review some days ago, there is much more to the success or otherwise of Australian industry than wage rates. In that context, Australia compares very competitively to other parts of the OECD. A much more important issue, not only for regional Australia but also for Australia as a whole, is how we go about ensuring that industry is competitive. I believe we can do that through wage outcomes underpinned by an award system, which is the government's commitment, provided we continue to work towards more flexible workplace arrangements. Certainly that is precisely what is happening. That is guiding many of those companies that are now doing so well, either competing in our own domestic markets or, increasingly, not only competing with, but also beating, the best in the world. The Industry Commission report is just a report. It has some intelligent and sensible draft recommendations. I think some of the recommendations are guided by a philosophy that is alien to this side of the House and certainly will not guide our responses to those issues. In some measure I suspect that is a reflection of the political views of one of the authors, and he is entitled to put them. One of the architects of this report was indeed an adviser to a former Liberal Prime Minister.Â· I encourage all members of the community to take an interest in the draft report when it is issued. It covers 'a wide range of issues. There is plenty of opportunity for people on behalf of themselves or their organisations to . put in a view. When that process has been completed, the government will consider it in the context of regional development issues, along with a whole range of other information. Treasurer",24
42,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is it a fact that the Treasurer raised with the Prime Minister the possibility of his resigning as Treasurer the budget? Is it also a fact that he again raised the possibility with the Prime Minister shortly after the budget?,25
43,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, to both. Higher Education Contribution Scheme",25
44,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training explain to the House the rationale behind the government's decision to require some students to contribute more for their higher education through changes to the higher education contribution scheme as announced in the budget? Is the minister aware of criticisms of these proposals? What are the government's intentions in regard to these criticisms?",25
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of the circumstances to which the honourable member draws attention, most specifically to a recent statement by the honourable member for Sturt. I am not sure what position he represents in the Liberal Party. He has announced on behalf of the Liberal Party that it intends to oppose the outlays measures in the budget which are associated with savings on HECS. This is contrary to suggestions by the Leader of the Opposition, during his response to the budget, that only those elements of the budget which he identified would be attacked. If this also happens to be part of the process, that will mean-given the list of complaintsanother $12 million to $100 million that he wants to deal with in the area of outlays. I guess that one of these days we will hear something definitive from the Leader of the Opposition on what stand he does take on cutting outlays. Whenever he is presented with the matter, he or one of his spokesmen puts yet another proposition, which suggests that he cannot make a tough decision on anything. As we have been challenged and criticised, let me go into the reasons why the government is pursuing this course. Quite simply, the government by the decisions we have taken will provide more opportunities for young people to get into university down the line. This year the government is putting $4.6 billion into higher education. That is about before twice the OECD average in terms of the contri-ution to higher education in a national budget. Our contribution is about 41h per cent, which contrasts interestingly with Japan's 1.1 per cent of its budget provisions. We have some 580,000 students in universities. Since 1988, we have increased places by 25 per cent-some 95,000 places. That is an extraordinary achievement by any measure. We are dealing with autonomous bodies when we deal with universities, and there is a process of negotiation on how the resources are placed. Recently, those resources have gone overwhelmingly into creating opportunities for people who already hold degrees or who are see19ng to extend their postgraduate studies. So 90 per cent of government funded expansion since 1988 has been taken up by students who have already been or are in the system. Opportunities for those new to higher education, particularly school leavers, have fallen over this time by about 8.1 per cent. We now have more than double the number of people than before who are leaving school and going into university, but that is less than we anticipated, even though the numbers in university are much ahead of what we anticipated. It is not commonly understood, although it ought to be, that people who fail to achieve their study at university in the normally laid down time inhibit other people from getting a university place. It is a zero sum game as far as people who are qualified to enter universities are concerned. A student who fails to complete his or her course and who is permitted by the university to stay at the university is a person who occupies a place which might otherwise have been provided for a school leaver. The government is undertaking a number of measures to alter the possibility for school leavers. One of the ways in which we will do that is that in our profiling processes with the universities we will assert a need on their to provide greater opportunity for young .school Ie avers coming into the system.",25
46,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,26
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister might resume his seat for a moment. The honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Maranoa and the Treasurer might cease sending signals in the chamber about which I am not quite sure. I am sure that it is distracting the minister who is endeavouring to answer the question. I call the minister. Mr Dawkins-I apologise, Mr Speaker. I was provoked.",26
48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I understand it, they were comparing academic records in which the Treasurer comes off more than favourably. Nevertheless, I agree that this is not the appropriate place for that discussion to take place. The second way in which we are attempting to persuade universities to open up additional"" places for school leavers is by providing them with greater flexibility in their tuition charging arrangements for post-graduate"" students, particularly those entering into course work. A third way in which we are doing it-and I would have thought this would have been imminently approved by the Liberal Party-is by building a small market element into it by making the cost of staying on beyond the time that one would normally expect a person to complete a course the subject of a minor increase in charges. I would have thought that that would have been more than adequately supported by a party which is still committed to introducing a voucher system with up-front fees charged to everybody across the board. The honourable ""member for Sturt needs to recognise the platform that he was elected on when he stands up here and talks about equity. He is still committed to a proposition that all students should pay up-front fees for their courses as well as their HECS. That ought not be forgotten. When we introduce a small element of market pressure to encourage students to complete their degrees in the minimal possible time, it raises yet another undisciplined shriek from the opposition that we have to cut outlays. But when we put up a proposition for a cut in outlays, the Leader part of the Opposition, or some of his spokesmen, runs a hundred miles back from it. Treasurer",26
49,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the embattled Treasurer.,26
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think the question is directed to the Treasurer.,26
51,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask the Treasurer: in the final stages of formulating the 1993 budget, did he threaten at any stage not to deli ver the budget?",26
52,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thanks very much for the life raft. No, of course never, you silly man. Investment",26
53,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Special Mihlster of State. Can the minister advise the House of the recent initiatives to encourage additional investment in Australia? What advantage does Australia have over other countries in the region as a target for investment or as a location for the establishment of new industries or corporate headquarters?,26
54,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Throsby"" for his question. I am pleased to report that today the government launched a major campaign designed to attract investment and Asian regional headquarters of major global companies to Australia. The nerve centre of the operations of a multinational corporation is often its"" regional headquarters. It provides a wide range of services, from marketing and data processing to market development and regional strategy. Mr Reith-You art:(not going to give them a waiver.",26
55,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Flinders is an expert on regional headquarters! He is an expert on more things than Bronwyn Bishop! I do not know why the Leader of the Opposition even bothers to be a leader of the opposition. Regional headquarters are often the hub of a company's operations in a region. As a result, regional operations have a significant effect on the company's strategic decisions in the region with respect to future growth and investment. The direct benefits to Australia of attracting regional headquarters are substantial. They create employment and business for local suppliers and generate investment in research and development facilities and export revenues. However, it is the indirect benefits to Australia that are potentially the most pervasive. These benefits generally result from interact-on of Australian industry with the key multinational corporations operating in the region, and include technology transfer, importation of world best practice and competitive cultures, the generation of downstream investment and the strategic benefit of lifting the international profile of Australian industry. Further, there is the possibility of strategic alliances and access to high growth markets. Australia's comparative advantage in the market for regional headquarters stems from low establishment and operation costs. I refer to salaries, office costs, services, a competitive telecommunications sector, a comprehensive range of business services, political stability and an excellent lifestyle. To drive these points home, I have this morning launched the government's new regional headquarters campaign. The purpose of the campaign is to increase the profile of Australia as a regional headquarters location. In the first instance, the campaign will be targeted towards multinational corporations based in North America. European companies will be targeted in the second phase of the campaign. The centrepiece of the campaign is a brochure entitled, Australia: your business location in Asia. The brochure is based on a consultancy report by Business International and highlights the advantages of locating a regional headquarters in Australia. For the information of the opposition, they include the lowest overall cost structure with a quality that is unmatched in the regionfrom getting the right people with the right skills into first-class central business district offices to a competitive communications infrastructure. Australia has the lowest overall cost structure with a quality that is unmatched in the Asian region. . We also have expertise in the changing style of business, with specialist skills in a range of fields. We heard the Attorney General speak about just one of them recently. In addition, Australia is skilled at working across Western and Asian business cultures and has substantial and growing ties .with the rest of the Asian region. Finally, we cannot be beaten when it comes to quality of lifestyle, educational and health facilities and the freedom of a true democracy. These Australian advantages - which are often missed, obviously, by members of the opposition and others-are often overlooked by the international business community. This marketing campaign is directly aimed at correcting that situation. Treasurer",26
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Treasurer whether he agrees with remarks made last week by his Western Australian colleague Senator Jim MCKiernan, Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, who said: The poor guy's under pressure ... the splitting of the Bills reveals that his tactics have been wrong and he, as Treasurer, must accept responsibility for that, not the Senate Committee, riot the Cabinet, but he as Treasurer.",27
57,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The chainnan of the committee said nothing like that. I am not sure what Senator MCKiernan had to say. Senator MCKiernan and I - of course he comes from the left wing like the honourable member for Higgins used to, remember?-have not always seen eye to eye over the years, but I certainly do not agree with what he had to say last week. Farmers: Assistance",27
58,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Would the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy please outline the steps being taken to maximise the support available to Australia's farmers, particularly those suffering from prolonged drought?",27
59,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. Of course, as chairman of the caucus committee on primary industries and energy, he has visited, with me, a number of these drought-affected areas. The fact of the matter is that the government has confronted this issue on two broad fronts. One is getting the policy right to ensure that we are making the farm sector, with assistance from effective government support programs, more self-reliant, more anticipatory of the problems facing it and that we are equipping it with the skills to respond. The other is to ensure that, in the process of doing this, there is an adequacy of funding and programs to assist farmers because we do not expect them to do it on their own. So far as the drought is concerned, it should be recalled that since the declaration of the severity of the drought in Queensland and New South Wales the Commonwealth has expended $16 million in relation to Queensland alone. The other day I made an announcement of an additional $3.1 million because the funding in that regard had run out. Of course, - New South Wales has $8 million. But the fact of the matter is that there is, with all programs, including this, no bottomless pit. Against that background,-the government's attention has also been drawn to improving the administrative efficiency under which these schemes are developed and implemented. We are now about ensuring that the funds which the Commonwealth has made available get to those who need them. It was against that background that in Alice Springs in July of this year, in consultation with the states, we were able to claw back from state reserves $123 million to fund improved delivery to the rural sector under the rural adjustment scheme. This was supplemented by $70 million in the budget to ensure that the funding under the RAS will more than double for the next four years, which was not the case before the budget. So we have concentrated not only on policy and adequacy of funding but also on the efficiency with which it is administered and delivered. Against the background of being able to claw back that money by agreement, we are now reviewing the guidelines under which the administration and standards for application apply. In this context, I can advise the House that Mr John Groves, who was previously the chief executive officer of the Rural Adjustment & Finance Corporation of Western Australia, has been asked to head a team to advise the government on how we can get more consistency from the states and better delivery of those funds. I might point out that, in relation to the funds complaints under the rural adjustment scheme, since the 1988 RAS came into existence the Commonwealth has funded $495 million, with only $16 million coming to it from the states. I believe this is a national problem which requires a contribution from all levels of government. In that regard, there is not only a commitment from our side that we will make sure that there are adequate funds available, but also we will ensure that the states play their role to maximise the assistance that is available. Under the exceptional circumstances provisions of RAS, the ones that can result in up to 100 per cent interest subsidies for farmers as in distress-100 per cent, I repeat, because there is no other. group in the community that gets that type of assistance; but we recognise it because of the current plight of the rural sector-there is a requirement for the states to match dollar for dollar each dollar that we put into the exceptional circumstances provisions. I want to make sure that that intent is delivered as it was agreed between the Commonwealth and the states. So I have added to the terms of reference of Mr Groves the provision that we look at how we can access the maximum from the states to ensure that the major provision is delivered. My commitment is to ensure that the combined Commonwealth and state contributions maximise assistance to farmers in distress and I make the commitment again here in the House today. In conclusion, the recent decision taken by the Commonwealth in relation. to additional funds in Queensland has been welcomed by the farm lobby in Queensland. It ought to. It has taken an active part in contributing, along with us, to its development and I will continue to work with it to deliver real assistance to farmers in need.",27
60,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"l'4r Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",28
61,Mr DOWNER,TREASURER," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Mayo moving forthwith that this House censures the Treasurer for causing widespread instability and uncertainty by: (1) introducing legislation into the parliament which was clearly unconstitutional",29
62,Mr KEATING,TREASURER,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is the party opposing the bills in the Senate. This is their instability.",29
63,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,There is no point of order.,29
64,Mr DOWNER,TREASURER,"The motion would read: ... that this House censures the Treasurer for causing widespread instability and uncertainty (1) introducing legislation into the parliament which was clearly unconstitutional; (2) redrafting the legislation in a form which is still likely to be unconstitutional; (3) refusing to make changes to the budget which would ensure its smooth passage through the parliament; and (4) behaving in an erratic and incoherent way, including threatening to resign and attacking personally members of his own party. Leave not granted. INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION NA",29
65,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE,"Honourable members will be aware that the 90th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference was held at Parliament House in the week before last. Almost 1,000 participants from 100 countries travelled to Canberra for the conference, which has been described as an outstanding success by all those who took part. The inaugural session of the conference took place on 13 September, the day Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation signed their historic agreement in Washington. On the following day, in a reflection of the spirit of cooperation engendered by the conference, a resolution was adopted expressing wholehearted support for the accords which had been signed and urging continued efforts for a full, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Orders Resolutions were also adopted, without need for a vote, in relation to: external displacement as a consequence of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other wars and civil wars; respect for international humanitarian law and support for humanitarian action in armed conflicts; and the health and well-being of the elderly. Decisions were also taken in regard to a delegation of parliamentarians to visit the former Yugoslavia, IPU observation of EI Salvador elections, an IPU mission to Cyprus and support to democracy in Haiti. The conference was preceded on Sunday 12 September by the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians. The meeting was chaired by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs by: Sullivan), who might wish to make a statement separate to this in relation to its agenda and outcomes. Similarly, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), the leader of the Australian delegation to the conference, may report separately on the delegation's perspective on the conference proceedings. I might just add at this point that it was through the efforts of the honourable member for Watson when he was Speaker that the conference was secured for Australia. In addition to the formal work of the conference, many valuable and lasting bonds were formed through the social functions and person-to-person contact made possible by the conference. Economic benefits also flowed as a direct result of the conference. The Canberra Visitor and Convention Bureau estimated that the conference visitors spent $5.2 million during their stay and gave the local Canberra economy a considerable boost. Within Parliament House, comparative September figures indicate that overseas delegates spent $30,000, or 2.7 times the previous year's amount, in the Parliament Shop during the main six days of the conference. I do not think Aussie did too badly, either. I would like to thank honourable members for the hospitality they extended to our visitors during the week of the conference; particularly those who made their offices available for the use of IPU staff from Geneva. Conference participants were all greatly impressed by Parliament House and its facilities and expressed their gratitude to the Australian parliament for making them available to the conference. They were even more fulsome in their praise for the excellent organisation of the conference which was often described as the best that had been experienced at IPU level. The conference coordinator, Anne Hazelton, deserves congratulations for her role in organising the conference. She and the staff of the secretariat have worked tirelessly over many months to ensure that the conference would run as smoothly as it did. Conference delegates were also greatly impressed by the thoughtfulness and hospitality extended throughout the week by the many parliamentary staff who volunteered to work on the conference. Many delegates commented on the friendliness of those who assisted them so generously in so many ways. On behalf of the parliament, I extend our special appreciation to the staff of this institution for a magnificent job. The impression that delegates will take back to their respective countries will reflect their experiences here. They will return with a heightened awareness of the beauty of the country, the friendliness of the people and the diversity of skills on offer. I have no doubt that in the long term these impressions will enhance Australia's relations with many nations and bring with them substantial economic and social benefits. I would also like to extend a special vote of thanks to the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker), many ministers and shadow ministers, the members of the Australian parliamentary delegation and other members of parliament from both the House of Representatives and the Senate who unselfishly made their time available to meet with delegates from the nearly 100 countries who came to our parliament and for not only making them feel welcome, but for talking to them in very positive terms about Australia. On behalf of all those involved, I say that the conference can be measured as nothing short of successful. Again, I thank all those who gave of their time so freely.",29
66,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CONFERENCE,"On behalf of the Australian delegation to the IPU Conference and the Australian parliament, I would like .to say how successful the conference was. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to pass on to all the staff of the parliamentary departments the good wishes of the House for the excellent job that they did in preparing and conducting this conference. I have been to a few IPU conferences over the years. As a member of the IPU executive, I have seen the way in which a number of countries have prepared for the conference. I think it can be fairly said that delegates went away from the conference here in Canberra with a very warm view that this was one of the best IPU conferences in recent years. As you have said, Mr Speaker, I think a great deal of the credit goes to Anne Hazelton, who coordinated the conference. I know that, when we. went to the conference in Sweden last year, Anne went as the delegation secretary and thought that she would not be able to put on a conference in the way that the Swedes did. But I am sure that the view of delegates to this conference was that it was as good as, if not better than, theÂ· conference in Stockholm. The parliamentary staff, Anne Hazelton in particular and the people who worked closely with Anne in running this coriference, deserve the congratulations of the House. I also thank the members of the Australian delegation. In particular, I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who was the deputy leader of the delegation, and other members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate who participated in the conference. The conference passed a number of important resolutions. There was a significant discussion on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a long way away from our part of the world,. but it is really, as members of this parliament have said in recent resolutions, one of the great human rights sores - n the face of the earth at present. To see people who are from countries that are near Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also to enter into dialogue with people from Serbia and Montenegro, who in the views of many are the ones who are causing the problem, was useful for all of us. So I congratulate the parliamentary departments, their staff, and you and your staff, Mr Speaker, for all the work that people put in make this an exceptionally well-run conference. I think it showcased the things that Australia has to offer, and sent back to Europe, Africa, Asia and other comers of the world people with a very strong idea that, in Australia, we have a very vibrant democracy, we have a country that is worthwhile listening to and a country that is certainly worthwhile seeing. Our people here added the gloss to that, so thank you very much, Mr Speaker.",30
67,Mrs SULLIVAN,CONFERENCE," Mr Speaker, I would like to join the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) in congratulating you on the conference here in Canberra. As you indicated, it was the honourable member for Watson who, as Speaker, had extended the invitation to the InterParliamentary Union to hold this 90th conference in Canberra, and I imagine you were thrown in the deep end having become Speaker only a few months before such a major event and without having any similar previous experience. On a personal level, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your chairing of the plenary sessions. A number of delegates from other countries commented to me how much you appeared to be enjoying yourself and also on how well you did carry out your task. Many delegates stated to me, as I am sure they did to all members of the Australian delegation, that it was the best organised IPU conference they had ever attended. It is very hard when one is participating in a conference hosted by one's own country to draw that sort of judgment, but so many who had had extensive experience of other IPU conferences said it that in the end I was pleased to accept that compliment on your behalf, Mr Speaker. Anne Hazelton is, of course, to be congratulated on her excellent organising. Ms Hazelton went to an IPU conference for the first time in Sweden, 12 months ago. She went to the conference in India in April this year under extremely difficult circumstances. We had a very small delegation. I had to pull out from that delegation only a couple of days beforehand; I think Senator Colston was the only parliamentarian who went. He became to very ill very early in that conference. Ms Hazelton also became extremely ill whilst in India, and was off work very ill for quite some time after returning to Australia. So her own prior experience of IPU conferences was rather mixed. However, she worked-as she always does-with great charm and ability. Her organisation, as I have said, was excellent I want to pay a very special tribute to the staff of Parliament House who were pressed intoÂ· very special service over the days of the conference. If honourable menbers had come to the parliament or even the airport in that period, they would have been greeted by familiar faces in unfamiliar garb. Staff were wearing rather large grey hats-which were a cross between a stetson and an Akubraand either a very bright scarf or a tie in blue and gold. A few diffident Australian males tucked the tie into their coat pocket and let a little of it show to identify them, preferring not to wear in the place one would expect what is really a very attractive tie. Over those days, we all had a certain amount of contact with these staff, who did everything possible to smooth the way for delegates. They were allotted to delegates as escorts, and were everywhere to help and guide them. Speaking personally, I could have burst with pride; they did an absolutely magnificent job and I cannot speak highly enough of them. I ought to report that the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians meeting-which Mr Speaker mentioned-on the Sunday preceding the conference was attended by approximately 100 delegates, both men and women. This meeting is held the day before the official opening so that the women parliamentarians could get together to do some pre-study of items on the agenda. We then come up with suggestions of matters to be included in draft motions to be put to the conference at the end of the week with respect to the subjects being debated so as to make sure that those aspects that are of particular concern to women-to women and children, need I say-are included for consideration. It also ensures that women are on the drafting committees and playing their proper role in the conference. As I have said, male MPs are very welcome to come to this meeting, and a number of them do. Also, of course, there are a number of advisers. I want to pay my own personal tribute to Robyn MCClelland, an employee of the House of Representatives, who worked very closely with me in the four weeks preceding the conference organising the women's meeting. She worked very hard and very efficiently indeed. I also want to thank those outsiders who participated in Sunday's opening ceremony-namely, a women's choir from Canberra called Cyrenes which sang a number of original songs of particular interest and also Matilda House, who is an elder of the Aboriginal tribe whose land this was and in fact still is. Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to read into the parliamentary record the poem that she read that day. I encountered this poem quite by chance only a couple of weeks before the opening ceremony. Through Anne Hazelton's very hard work, we were able to identify Matilda and have this poem included in the ceremony. I want to read it into the record because it has a particular to this House, and I want everybody in this House to know of the facts that it conveys. It conveys simply this: there was a time when this hill-which we call Capital Hill-was called Kurrajongby the local Aboriginal tribe, and it was a sacred site for the women. It was to this hill that the Aboriginal women came to sing their songs. A Canberra woman, Dorothy Cameron, who knew of this and who knew Senator Jo Vallentine, wrote this poem as a tribute to the women of Capital Hillpast, present and probably future-to mark the occasion of Senator Vallentine's resignation from the Senate. Senator Vallentine read it into the Senate Hansard at the time; I would like now to see this poem take its proper place in the House of Representatives Hansard. It is called The Singing Hill, and reads: The men in dark suits With endless disputes Sit in the marble temple, In the shining edifice Built upon the hill. They are the elders Of the present-day tribe, Quite unaware that aeons ago The Hill was sacred And magic was there. For once it was the Singing Hill. The hill which sang the Earth Song At the meeting of the ley-lines And the crossing of the song-lines In the centre of the Hills of the Circling. The Song of the Earth was the women's song. They were the tribal elders then Who knew of the Mysteries, Who drew down the moon And nurtured the Earth and its singing. Unknown to the dark suits to women, Shouting within, The women are returning To the Centre of the circling, Reclaiming their own. Circling the fountain in the shining edifice, Circling the pyramid of the thrusting dome, They return to their own And the chanting is beginning, The humming has begun. With the passing of the seasons Music from the Singing Hill Will transcend the voices Of the dark suits Shouting their abuse. significance New tribal elders, The re-emerging Daughters, Will awaken Gaia And the shouting will be stilled. The healing of the planet will begin. Gaia's woman-energy Will link the endless Cosmos With the light of inner knowledge And a reverence for the Earth. And the daughters of a different Dreaming Will recover the mystery, Rediscover the harmony, Of the Centre of the Circling Around the Singing Hill. Mr Speaker, it was an honour to bring that poem and that knowledge-which I do not believe was very well known at all prior to this time-to the opening of the IPU conference, and it is an honour to bring it to the House of Representatives today.

71,Mr ROCHER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY," Mr Deputy Speaker, this package-the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and six cognate bills-gives effect to the measures announced in the government's 'Strengthening Super Security' statement of 21 October last year The bills replace legislation which was first introduced last year but which lapsed with the proroguing of the last parliament. In addition, the government released a number of amendments on 15 September of this year which make two major additions to the legislation and a number of minor technical PARK changes; The bills introduce far-reaching changes to the regulation and prudential supervision of superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts in Australia. Measures contained in the bills reflect the government's objective of ensuring that Australians increasingly provide for their own retirement, and also reflect a conviction on the part of the government that superannuation is the preferred savings vehicle by which such provision is to be made. The bills largely repeal Labor's Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987, which until now has been the principal piece of legislation regulating the operation of superannuation funds in Australia. The Occupational Superannuation Standards Act sought to regulate superannuation funds indirectly by granting tax concessions only to funds that complied with certain minimum standards specified in that act. The new Superannuation Industry (Supervi1993 sion) Bill, or SIS legislation, will seek instead to directly regulate and control the activities of the superannuation funds through the use of the corporations and pensions powers in the constitution. I might add that some doubts have been expressed about the constitutional basis for this legislation, particularly in the absence of a referral of powers from the states. These doubts are not especially serious, however, and should not threaten this legislation to the same extent as the constitutional problems that have surrounded the government's ill-fated and misnamed Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. The legislation rep,resents a major change to the legal basis for the regulation and prudential supervision of superannuation funds in this country. To date, superannuation funds have relied largely on trust law and common law precedents to guide them in their opercommission. ations. There have been relatively few tory requirements, despite the mass of annuation legislation of recent years which has largely been concerned with defining tax treatment of superannuation savings. Most of the considerable uncertainty that has plagued superannuation in recent years has emanated from these often changing statutory requirements and taxation measures. The legislation largely overturns the existing legal basis for superannuation fund operations and replaces it with the type of black letter law that now characterises the new corporaof tions law that has been introduced with mixed success. The new black letter law will be administered by a better resourced and more powerful Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC, rather than the Australian Securities Commission, which currently supervises superannuation entities. The new legislation will apply to superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, ADFs, and pooled superannuarules tion trusts, PSTs, from 1 July 1994, the starting date having been extended from that contained in the original legislation superannuation funds and trustees more time to come to grips with the changes that must be made to their operations. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill gives new powers to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to enforce a host of new measures dealing with the obligations and prudential requirements to be placed on superanrtuation funds and their trustees. The ISC will be given sweeping powers in carryas ing out this role, including the right of entry, access to documents, the execution of search warrants, and the conduct of interviews. The bill will enable the ISC to approve, suspend and remove trustees, and to set the standards for the trustees and investment managers of superannuation funds. will promulgate regulations prescribing, in detail, appropriate standards with which superannuation funds will be forcedÂ· to ply. The compliance status of superannuation funds will be confirmed by notices issued by the ISC, and to this end trustees will be required to lodge annual returns with the The ISC will be able to issue statustop orders against any superannuation supervehicle's advertisements or promotional material, and will be able to order investment the managers not to dispose of certain assets. The fiduciary duties of trustees will be codified in covenants, including a range of new duties. such as the requirement for superannuation fund f\1anagers to formulate an investment strategy, and these covenants will become part of the trust deeds. A range of other duties will be imposed on trustees and investment managers which will not form part the trust deed, however. Restrictions are imposed on the acquisition of certain assets, as well as the amount of in-house assets that may be held by superannuation funds. There are also prohibitions on lending and borrowing by superannuation funds, and provisions prohibiting insider trading. The bill . requires equal employer and fund member representation in the administration of employer sponsored superannuation entities. The governing the maintenance of superannuation fund accounts are set out, along with the obligations of actuaries and auditors into allow relation to these accounts. Auditors will beÂ· required to report breaches to the ISC. The ISC will also be empowered to prohibit an auditor from conducting audits of superannuation funds where the auditor's activities are found by the ISC to be unsatisfactory; A range of severe penalties is provided for in the case of false, misleading or fraudulent conduct by trustees or fund managers in the conduct of a superannuation entity, well as for failure to comply with the prudential and other standards provided for in the legislation. Superannuation entities that have suffered losses because of fraudulent conduct may be entitled to financial assistance as a result of this legislation, and a new levy on superannuation funds is provided to fiThe ISC nance such assistance. The Occupational Superannuation Standards Amendment Bill repeals the provisions of the comOccupational Superannuation Standards Act that concerns prudential compliance standards to the extent that these are. now provided for in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill. The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill establishes a new superannuation complaints tribunal. This body will seek to resolve complaints by fund members or the beneficiaries of funds about the decisions made by trustees where thQse decisions may be unfair, unreasonable or beyond power. The tribunal will first attempt to conciliate the complaints, before taking measures to review the trustee's decision. In this regard, the tribunal proceedings will not be bound by the rules of procedure. and evidence and, as an administrative body, the tribunal will have no enforcement powers. So questions of law will have to be referred to the Federal Court. The tribunal is bound to affirm the trustee's decision unless it is satisfied that the decision was clearly unfair or unreasonable,' although the legislation provides no criteria as to what might be unfair or unreasonable in this context. The Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill provides for the imposition of a levy on superannuation funds and ADFs to pay for financial assistance to superannuation funds that may suffer losses as a result of theft or fraudulent conduct. The Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill also provides for the imposition of a levy on superannuation funds and ADFs with a view to recouping the costs of the ISC maintaining a register of certain rolled-over benefits for members who have left employment or who are no longer in communication with their funds. The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill makes changes to the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991 that arise from the repeal of relevant sections of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act under this package of seven bills. The bills have the support of the coalition and should serve the government's purpose of improving the security of accumulated superannuation benefits for fund members. Such measures are appropriate and should have been anticipated, given the huge growth in superannuation fund assets that has taken place in recent years and that will continue to occur into the foreseeable future under the superannuation guarantee levy. The opposition has some concerns and reservations about certain aspects of the legislation, and we will be raising these in due course. However, these concerns can be addressed within the overall framework of the government's legislation. It should be noted that this legislation will be introduced at considerable cost to the superannuation funds and, by extension, to the retirement benefits of all affected Australians. There will be notable costs associated with the changeover to the new system of prudential supervision and regulation. There will also be a number of ongoing costs which will have to be met as a result of this legislation, and which will make superannuation a relatively expensive savings vehicle. The legislation is timely, given Labor's determination to entrench superannuation as its preferred savings vehicle for all Australians. But when one says 'preferred savings vehicle', one is really talking about the preferences of the Labor Party, rather than the preferences of individual Australians, since the government has set about making provision for superannuation compulsory for all Australians. Superannuation is no longer a matter of choice and, with the vast flow of money into superannuation funds, it is appropriate that the government should take measures to ensure that superannuation savings are appropriately regulated and protected. The government's stated intention is that all Australians will increasingly provide for their own retirements, and so reduce what would otherwise be a massive increase in social security payments as an increasing proportion of our population reaches retirement age in the years ahead. Whether the government's superannuation policies will actually achieve this goal is a matter of debate, given the large number of questions about superannuation policies that have yet to be resolved. At least with this legislation the government has finally answered the question of how it proposes to regulate the vast increase in superannuation fund assets that is currently taking place. This question had gone begging up until late last year when the government handed down the statement to which I referred earlier. The principal challenge facing the government in drawing up this legislation has been to provide an appropriate level of protection to the retirement savings of Australians without imposing undue costs on the superannuation funds-costs which must ultimately be met out of the potential retirement benefits of members. Only time will tell whether the government has struck an appropriate balance in this regard. It should be noted that superanthem. nuation is already a high cost savings vehicle that is already heavily regulated, albeit indirectly, by the Commonwealth government. The high costs of prudential supervision and compliance already serve to depress the returns on superannuation funds, and eat into the retirement savings of funds' members. This legislation will add considerably to those costs, although with the offsetting benefit that fund members will enjoy greater protection of their retirement savings. It is interesting, however, to compare the costs associated with the regulation and supervision of superannuation as required by these bills, and the complete absence of such costs in relation to the main savings vehicle for most Australians at the present time, which is the family home. The family home is easily the largest single investment most Australians will ever make and yet it is almost totally unregulated-and rightly so. Before one can sell $1,000 worth of shares or purchase $1,000 worth of units in a superannuation fund, a whole host of prospectus and other regulatory requirements must be met. Yet one can buy and sell a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars with no such impediments. Despite a near total absence of regulation, the family home represents a very secure investment, so it is not surprising that it remains and will remain the preferred savings vehicle for most Australians. Of course, the family home has the advantage that no-one can walk off with it whereas superannuation funds could be misappropriated by a dishonest or incompetent fund manager. The comparison is still a salutary warning for those who would turn superannuation into the main savings vehicle for all Australians. Superannuation has some stiff competition as a savings investment vehicle and so will continue to rely heavily on a mixture of tax incentives and compulsion, through the superannuation guarantee levy, to be competitive with other investments. No doubt many of these increased costs will be of a one-off nature as trustees and fund managers adjust to the new requirements now to be imposed on But many of these costs will be ongoing and the costs of this additional regulatory burden are such that this superannuation industry supervisory-or SIS-legislation is already known in superannuation circles as the solicitor's income support legislation. As an example of the price to be paid, one need look only at the costs involved in electing whether the fund will have a corporate trustee or will fall within the pensions power of the constitution. The cost of purchasing a shelf company and establishing a corporate trustee witj1 a standard set of articles is currently in the vicinity of $1,000. Any special requirements cause these costs to rise proportionately. With as many as 50,000 funds in Australia lacking an appropriate corporate trustee at present, we are looking at as much as $50 million in legal fees to meet those most basic requirements of just one aspect of this legislation. The costs of the legislation will have a particularly strong impact on the many smaller superannuation funds which are currently run at low cost and which often deliver superior returns to their members. The enhanced prudential regulatory requirements in this legislation will mean that many of these funds will lose the advantages that their small size can confer on members. Many existing funds may find it difficult, if not impossible, to meet these new requirements. This legislation is really geared to the larger industry and pooled funds. The government should give some more thought to taking a more discriminating approach to some of the prudential and regulatory requirements that it is seeking to impose, to take account of the needs of smaller funds. This legislation will impose some particularly onerous duties on trustees and introduces some very severe penalties for failure to discharge these duties. This may create problems for many existing trustees who perform this task on a voluntary and nonremunerated basis as a service to fund members. The considerable increase in responsibilities of trustees and the much greater exposure to penalties under this legislation will cause many trustees to give up their existing roles in the absence of any compensating benefits. Their role will be taken over by professional trustee companies, whose services can be procured only at considerable expense, relative to those of voluntary trustees. The professional trustee companies stand to be the principal beneficiaries of this tion. Even then, the proposed provisions are such that responsibility for meeting the requirements of the legislation will be widespread, and the use of a professional trustee company will not absolve former trustees, employers and employees, from ensuring that these responsibilities are fully met. The Australian Government Actuary has maintained that these responsibilities are fully transferred to the trustee company on conversion of a fund to public offer status. A general problem with this legislation, however, is that there are few, if any, relevant precedents governing the operation of this legislation, so few guarantees of such a general nature can be given about how it will actually operate. In any event, trustees will strongly obliged to err on the side of caution in most of their activities. The change to black letter law will mean that, to meet the new requirements, trustees will have to disclose as much information as possible about the operations of super funds. This may well result in funds producing enormous amounts of information, at great cost, that is never examined by fund members and probably will never be examined by others. The effect of these increased costs on the retirement payouts to fund beneficiaries is a source of very real concern. The levels of employer contributions currently provided for under the SGL, and the levels of employee contributions at the present time, are such that few stand to be selfsufficient in retirement without substantial additional contributions made over many years. This is particularly true of low-paid workers, and women, who are almost completely overlooked by Labor's approach to superannuation. This legislation will increase the amount that will need to be contributed in order to provide for an adequate standard of living in retirement. The task of balancing the needs for competitive returns and adequate prudential and regulatory controls will clearly be an ongoing one, and we simply must not assume that the balance is right with this legislation. It is nevertheless timely, given the growing lack of confidence that Australians have in the securilegisla- ty of their superannuation savings. As the total amount of mon.ey in superannuation funds has grown, Australians have become less and less confident about the security of those savings and the ability of those savings to provide for their retirement. This concern is to be expected, given the increasing proportion of people's income and savings being directed into superannuation by government edict, and the considerable amount of confusion that has surrounded Labor's superannuation policies, which is at the heart of much of this lack of confidence. A recent survey conducted by BIS Shrapnel on behalf of MLC Life found that only 26 per cent of Australians were confident about their be superannuation arrangements, compared with 32 per cent only one year before. Those most lacking in confidence were those who were reliant solely on employer contributions to superannuation as mandated under the government's superannuation guarantee levy. The survey also revealed that a major concern of those lacking confidence in superannuation was the government's frequent changes to superannuation policy. It is to be hoped that this legislation will help restore some confidence in superannuation savings, which is the very least people should be able to expect from a government determined to make superannuation the principal form of universal provision for retirement. This legislation should serve to enhance confidence in the performance of fund managers and trustees in discharging their responsibilities to fund members. It cannot, however, create confidence by the frequent changes in government policy on superannuation, particularly taxation of funds and contributions, that we have had to endure over the past 10 years. There is still a lot of explaining to be done before Australians will be able to feel secure about having their retirement needs met by existing or new superannuation arrangements. The coalition, along with a number of superannuation industry commentators, has a number of reservations about some of the detail in this legislation. There is a widespread concern about the operation of clause 62 of the bill which prevents superannuation funds acquiring assets from members. It is acknowledged that this provision is designed to prevent a variety of abuses that can be perpetrated. In so doing, however, it proscribes a number of legitimate arrangements on the part of self-employed people who may legitimately want to place some of their business assets in their super funds. A more discriminating approach needs to be taken on this issue than has been envisaged so far. The coalition also has concerns about the role given by this legislation to trade unions in employee representation. The coalition is a strong supporter of employee representation in the operation of superannuation funds. However, we do not support automatic trade union representation at the expense of other possible employee representation, particularly in the case of industry funds. It might be appropriate, at this time, to move the amendment which I understand has been circulated in my name. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, House calls on the government to ensure that member representatives on the boards of trustees of employer-sponsored funds must be elected by direct ballot of fund members"". The superannuation guarantee levy legislation and these bills serve in some cases to usurp true industry employee representation and replace it with trade union representation, which in many cases may put the interests of the trade unions ahead of those of fund members generally. The coalition will seek to address these concerns in more detail in the Senate and through the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, chaired by my colleague Senator Watson. How does the government propose to address the many outstanding issues surrounding its superannuation policies? Labor needs to explain how superannuation policies-the SGL in particular-will provide an adequate retirement income for participating Australians, given the projected contribution rates that have been provided for to date. The government needs to address the issues of non-compliance with the SGL-what will happen with superannuation for the selfemployed and will it mandate employee contributions, and at what rate. The government needs to decide exactly what it wants to do about access to superannuation benefits for the purposes of purchasing a home. It needs to explain how its superannuation policies fit into an overall national savings strategy that would serve to remedy some of our fundamental economic problems. This legislation goes only some of the way to addressing the many concerns that Australians have about superannuation. Accordingly, the coalition urges the government to get on with the task of clarifying the outstanding issues so Australians can feel confident with their retirement income arrangements. The confusion and uncertainty surrounding superannuation policy at present were summed up in a joke that was recently told to an Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia lunch in Melbourne. The gag went, 'What is the difference between Australia's retirement incomes policy and Jurassic Park?'. The answer is, 'One is a vast and the threatening world, caught in the throes of time and change, where species come and go, often lost in space and time, where evolution rolls relentlessly on, the future daunting and unclear. The other is a movie'.",34
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,Mr Andrew)The honourable member earlier moved an amendment. Is the amendment seconded? Mr Thckey-I second the amendment.,39
73,Mr LES SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,I will not start with a joke to respond to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I thank him for his contribution. Mr O'Keefe-You might as well. A lot of what he said was pretty funny.,40
74,Mr LES SCOTT,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I will come to that later because some of it obviously relates to his amendment-and shows that he is not all that concerned about employee representatives being on the boards of superannuation funds. I believe that it is important for employees to have a very strong voice in the protection of their retirement incomes. That is what the government's proposal is going towards; improving people's superannuation funds and ensuring that they are protected. Seven superannuation bills are being debated cognalely in the House today. In my view, they will result in increased prudential protecintroduced tion being provided for the superannuation industry. That is extremely important. Taken together, they represent a substantial strengthsibility ening of the security of superannuation savings and the protection of the rights of superannuation fund members. Over many decades, superannuation will have a huge savings pool. The recent report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on safeguarding superannuation' highlights the growth that we anticipate in the superannuation industry over the next few years, ly to the year 2000. The report indicates that there will be in excess of $600 billion in superannuation funds; so it is certainly very important that we have the right mechanism in place to ensure that those superannuation funds are protected. This government has done more than any other to increase the work force's access to superannuation. It is important for the work force to be able to have secure retirement prospects. Prior to 1983, superannuation was largely the preserve of management, public sector workers and some white collar workers in the private sector. Great numbers of our work force did not have access to superannuation, particularly women. Through initiatives, including dividend imputation, incentives have been given for superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies. Through award based superannuation and the superannuation guarantee charge, average Australians have been given the foundation for great independence when they enter retirement. In these ways the federal government has dramatically increased access to superannuation, with the percentage of Australians covered by some type of superannuation rising by 32 per cent over the past decade. When honourable members opposite last held office at a federal level, only 39 per cent of workers had superannuation, with the rate being 50 per cent for male workers and 24 per cent for female employees. By last year the percentage of the work force covered by superannuation had risen to 72, with 80.6 per cent of male workers and 58.5 per cent of female workers in a superannuation scheme. The superannuation guarantee charge, last year, is designed to guarantee all workers an adequate retirement income in the future, encouraging the sharing of responfor providing for retirement between employers and employees and providing assistance for disadvantaged groups within the market who traditionally would not have access to superannuation. The federal government's hard work in the area of superaniluation has ensured that a whole new generation of ordinary Australians is being given the foundation for greater independence when certain- they enter retirement. However, ensuring access to superannuation is only half the issue. The government also has to ensure that superannuation funds, in which workers have invested their hard-earned money, will invest their funds wisely. The package of legislation substantially increases the security of superannuation savings and the rights of fund members. The bills bring into effect the new prudential supervision arrangements for superannuation contained in the Strengthening super security statement released by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in October last year. These new arrangements will promote increased protection of superannuation savings and result in a more productive superannuation industry. The increased security of funds will result in increased confidence.in superannuation as a form of savings. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill 1993 strengthens the supervisory arrangements by giving the Insurance and Superannuation Commission direct enforcement of powers. These will enable the commission to enforce the prudential requirements and obligations placed on funds and trustees by the federal government. The bills make trustees and the investment managers subject to sanctions for the proper performance of their responsibilities as well as containing other measures designed to increase their accountability to members. The basic duties of trustees are also clearly defined by the legislation while making it clear that trustees have primary responsibility for the operation of the funds. The previous comments by the honourable member for Curtin in relation to. trustees sometimes make me wonder whether he really is conscious of the great importance of trustees. He suggested they were doing these things on a non-honorary basis. I think it is very important that trustees and investment managers are professional people in their own way and take the positions very seriously. When one is dealing with people's retirement funds and the savings of many workers, it is important that those trustees and the investment managers are really on the job and have a very strong understanding and commitment to the protection of those funds. So the trustees and the investment managers are obligated under the bill to manage funds responsibly and they must be suitable to act as fund trustees. It is extremely important. If funds suffer a loss as a result of a fraud or a theft, they will receive financial assistance from the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The bills also establish mechanisms for dealing with problems that arise with employer sponsored funds when employees move on to another job leaving unclaimed benefits in the funds. Several constituents of mine have raised with me the problems which arise when employer sponsored funds do not have adequate worker representation on the board of trustees. This too is an important area-that employees have the rights to participate and to have a say in how the funds are managed by having work participation in those areas. This bill goes some way to addressing this problem by providing equal member and employer representation on large funds. That is a good thing for the protection of members' funds. It make me wonder why the honourable member for Curtin has moved his amendment when he says that the boards of trustees of employer sponsored funds must be elected by direct ballot of fund members. They certainly would be elected in their own way and certainly the trade union movement has a keen interest in the rights of their members in protecting their funds. The trade union movement has been very responsible in its attitude towards superannuation over many years and it has a very clear commitment to ensuring that. its members have security in retirement. That is what superannuation is all about-security in retirement. In ""ddition to these measures, the bill contains provisions for disclosure obligations in relation to auditors and actuaries of funds, and rules relating to invitations and offers to subscribe for interests in and disclosure by public offer superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill 1993, along with the Occupational Superannuation Standards Amendment Bill 1993, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993, the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill 1993, the Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill 1993, the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1993 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill 1993, improves the framework put in place by this government for the provision of the superannuation industry. It is a major issue, a major industry and it will continue to be a major industry in years to come, as I have already indicated. This is an important step. This government has an obligation to ensure the security of members' funds, after having done so much to. encourage workers to take out membership in superannuation funds. Whilst there have been many changes to superannuation over many years, those changes have been necessary. They have been necessary to ensure that superannuation funds are brought up to scratch in the future and where the whole of the work force can share and participate in the running and the benefits that superannuation provides. Whilst I would be the first to acknowledge that the changes that we have had over recent years have certainly caused some confusion-change does that-change is inevitable when we need to ensure that the superannuation funds are operating to protect the best interests of their members. That is the important part and that is the important part of this legislation here before us today. . In addition to the measures that this government has taken to encourage increased use in superannuation, it has been keen for the increase of savings in many other areas as well. This government has not forgotten those. It is often suggested that superannuation is the only thing that we have been concentrating on. We are well aware of the need for people to continue saving in many areas. The honourable member for Curtin talked about how a lot of people put the bulk of their savings into their own home. That is a great Australian tradition and thefeople in Australia have always wanted to own their own home and it is a goal that they can still achieve, and rightly so. But it is important that whilst people have their own home in their working lives they manage to maintain those homes. It is also very important that when they come to retire they have sufficient income in retirement to be able to maintain those homes and their lives with the dignity they expect. . There is no doubt that over time we cannot maintain the levels of pension payments that we have maintained now. This government has a very good record in increasing the aged pensions to above 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings-that has been a big boost. But as our population ages-and everybody realises that, the statistics are clearly there-it would be very difficult for any government to maintain those sorts of pensions in the longer term. But where people can provide superannuation for their own retirement, I suggest to the House that those people have the opportunity to provide much greater income in their retirement. It is important to maintain a high income in retirement so that people can live with the dignity which they expect. There are certainly a lot of issues in the area of national savings when it comes to housing, ordinary savings, banks, superannuation, and a number of areas that I will not canvass here today. Australia, being such a vast country with a relatively small population, has long suffered a problem of a low savings base. This in turn has resulted in inadequate capital being available to the private sector for investment purposes. Superannuation no doubt will provide an area for investment in the future, provided superannuation is invested wisely in the best interests of the members. That is an important thing that we must look at as well. Last year the federal government commissioned Dr Vince FitzGerald to investigate alternative policies to encourage increased national savings. The FitzGerald report, released on 29 June, contained a number of proposals. A letter sent by DÂ·r FitzGerald to the Treasurer on 5 July contained more specific policy proposals. In response to this report the 1993-94 budget sets out a thorough strategy designed to increase national savings. This strategy builds on the advances made under this government in increasing savings for retirement in the form of superannuation. The FitzGerald report contained a number of proposals for the superannuation system. Specifically, Dr FitzGerald raised a number of pertinent points in relation to the superannuation guarantee charge introduced by the government last year. The government has recognised that there are a number of problems with the superannuation guarantee charge and the Treasurer has made the resolution of these difficulties one of his top priorities. On 17 August, the Treasury released a statement, 'National Savings and Superannuation', which details the action taken by government to implement the recommendation of Dr FitzGerald's report. In relation to superannuation policy, Dr FitzGerald proposed the government release a final policy statement on superannuation retirement income policy by the middle of 1994. He proposed that the policy include a reduction in the lump sum threshold to around $50,000 and, to ensure that lump sums are counted as for the age pension income and assets test, that a proportion of benefits over that threshold be taken in the form of income streams and to treat such streams for Department of Social Security tax purposes. Dr FitzGerald further recommended the raising of the pensionable age fot women to 65 over a 10to 15-year period, with access for long-term unemployed people from age 60. In response to these recommendations; the Treasurer announced in the national savings and superannuation statement that the government would not be reducing the taxation threshold for lump sum superannuation from its present level of $77,796 as there was little benefit in reducing the threshold, which would also be retrospective in its impact. The government is at present undertaking a process of consultation on the superannuation matters raised by Dr FitzGerald and preparing a detailed response to its proposals for release in early 1994. Also, in response to Dr FitzGerald's recommendations in relation to retirement incomes policy, the government has announced the raising of the age pension age for women from 60 to 65 over a 20-year period, which of course was announced in the budget. Dr FitzGerald also proposed that the government review its decision to allow diversion of compulsory superannuation savings into housing, saying that if the proposal were to proceed it should be subject to tight age or other restrictions, such as first home, and should perhaps be linked to the introduction of employee contributions and/or improvements in a regime for voluntary individual superannuation contributions. While the government is aware of Dr FitzGerald's concerns on this issue, it remains committed to the introduction Of this measure. The government is, however, conscious of the need to target the funds released in this way to assist those most in'need while also ensuring that the integrity of our retirement incomes policy is maintained. It is clear from the government's approach over the past decades and its response to the recommendations of the FitzGerald report on national savings that it is determined to increase the access of the Australian work force to superannuation as well as encouraging our overallÂ· national savings effort. In order to achieve these twin objectives. the government has accepted the international evidence that a successful superannuation system cannot be built on purely voluntary contributions. Under a voluntary system, only people on higher incomes would be able to accumulate enough superannuation to provide adequately for th-ir retirement. Unfortunately, those opposite have never allowed themselves to learn this lesson. . The coalition's current retirement incomes policy ignores the three basic issues in superannuation policy. The first of these issues is that Australia faces an increasingly ageing population. If we as a society continue to rely solely on the age pension, future governments will either have to reduce the benefits received by pensioners or increase the taxation imposed on future generations. It is the responsibility of government to take steps in order to ensure that our citizens will have access to adequate income levels in retirement, and perhaps we should have done this many years ago. In essence, coalition policy ignores this by leaving it up to the market forces. The second basic policy choice is between a compulsory superannuation scheme and one based on voluntary contributions. The third issue is a choice of the use of tax concessions versus rebates to encourage people to save for its being the buyer's retirement. While the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) made a great deal of his party's dumping of the regressive and unfair goods and services tax, he has said that the rest of the opposition's policies remain. I am pleased the honourable member for Curtin mentioned that the opposition would be supporting these bills here today, but its own policy still has not been changed. The superannuation policy of those opposite would have resulted in the standards prior to 1983 being reintroduced with superannuation once again becoming the preserve of the rich and public sector workers who are the ones who generally receive superannuation. In essence, the opposition's superannuation policy at the last election combined voluntary contributions with a 2- per cent tax rebate with a higher tax on super fund earnings and an increased tax rate on lump sums received by 55to 59-year olds. Relying onÂ· tax concessions to encourage people to provide for their own retirement, as proposed by the opposition, has not .worked in the past in Australia or anywhere else in the world, and it is a lesson we should all learn. This government has retained the concessional tax rebate of 15 per cent on superannuation fund earnings, which is effectively seven to eight per cent after imputation credits. Those opposite, according to their policy, want to tax them at 20 percent, which would substantially reduce the final value of superannuation savings- This would lower the relative attractiveness of superannuation as a fonn of savings and, coupled with making superannuation voluntary, would effectively destroy the present broadly based superannuation system which this government has worked so very hard to achieve over the last decade. I hope that in their review of policy over the next three years, and the fact that they are accepting the bills before the House today, honourable members opposite realise the stupidity of their present retirement income policy and bring their superannuation policies into the 21st century.. In summary, this package of legislation actually builds on this government's present proud record of refonn to superannuation over the past decade. I believe that these bills before us today-I will not mention them all again because there are seven of them-will ensure that Australians will have a good, solid superannuation industry in the future where it will be a safe place for workers to invest their money for their retirement and that in the future all Australians will be able to live on a much broader income in retirement than they have now. I think that these bills will be able to achieve that. (TIme expired)",40
75,Mr TUCKEY,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"O'Connor) (4.44 p.m.)Whilst I do not question the sincerity of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) in talking about giving people funds, dignity and money to assist them in their retirement, he is ignoring the facts of this particular scheme to date. Although the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and six cognate superannuation bills deal with supervisory and credential measures associated with the entire superannuation industry, which I will refer to shortly, the simple fact is that one of the great disasters of the Keating government's administration has been the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge. As the honourable member for Oxley should well know, the government is not delivering accumulated funds for the people he would like to help, notwithstanding that I agree he would like to help them. The honourable member for Oxley should stay and listen to this in the interest of his constituents. If he were to go back to his electorate and ask some of his constituents, particularly those in part-time and itinerant work, to ask their guaranteed compulsory super fund to provide them with a net value of th-ir superannuation contributions, they would in most cases find that it is something like 50 per cent of employer contributionsnot 50 per cent of employer contributions plus interest but 50 per cent of employer contributions. The scheme is not working. It is having very debilitating effects. The scheme does nothing for those who do not have a job. They get no guarantee whatsoever. They do not even get 50 per cent of nothing. More importantly,it adds to their numbers. I refer in this regard to the survey done by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It is quite authoritative and has not been contested by anybody. The survey points out that some 60,000 jobs have been lost since the introduction of this scheme that are attributable to the scheme. In the first instance, we find a large number of people whose retirement prospects have deteriorated significantly because they do not have a job any more. The government was warned about this at the time and chose to ignore it because the instructions had come from on high; Bill Kelty wanted it. I remind the House that when this thing was first mooted questions were put to Treasury officials in Senate estimates committees as to its likely impact on government revenue, et cetera. The simple answer was, 'We don't know. We've done no research. We haven't been asked'. This is a deal cooked up between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty. It did not come through the proper processes of government, and we wonder why it is a mess today. It is now being admitted that it is worse than that. An article in the Australian Financial Review on 3 August 1993 stated: The ATO manager responsible for the SGCthat is, the superannuation guarantee chargeMr Michael Monaghan, said last night that the issue of small contributions was ""one that is obviously pretty prominent"". He went on to say: I am aware of contributions being eaten up by administrative charges. That's obvious and you can't hide from that. A senior government tax employee said that the system is not working, yet we have had the honourable member for Oxley coming in here saying what wonderful things it will do for people when they retire. There will be nothing there. I have itinerant workers in my electorate refusing to give details to their employers as to where the money might have been sent. They have had a look at the net value of the asset they are supposed to be contributing. They see it being eaten up by government taxes, fund managers' charges and, on certain occasions, by union fees, and they are simply not prepared to see the money thrown away. They would prefer that the employer kept it. Of course, the employer cannot keep it either; he or she simply has to find a way of sending it off to the tax man. Everybody is a loser. It is the most ridiculous system that has ever occurred. The ACCI survey has told us that about 16.2 per cent of employers with fewer than 20 employees have not yet put any money in. That is not because they want to oppose the law; it is because they do not have the money. Other than by dismissing another worker, they cannot afford this payment. Many of them have turned to dismissals when they have come to make those payments, as the statistics have proven. The simple, silly fact is that shortly we are likely to have the tax commissioner serving summonses on these people to pay, at which point they will close their businesses. The remaining workers who at least are getting a wage, if not a superannuation payment, will also be unemployed. . When the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) responds he might give some guarantees as to what will be done about the people who have not paid. The tax commissioner has obligations imposed upon him by this parliament; he is bound to pursue these people. It is the practice for the tax office to serve summonses and demands on people, or at times it tries to garnishee money from firms' customers. This happens quite frequently these days. It completely destroys confidence in these very fragile businesses, so they fall over and then everyone is out of a job-the boss, his family and everybody else. That is the future we will get from this silly scheme. Why were we told we needed this scheme? We were told we had to re-establish nati()nal savings. We can look at some evidence as to how that has succeeded. Money has been flowing in-$1.7 billion from small businesses alone in the private sector. What has happened to national savings? After roughly a year of this money flowing into the coffers, plus what went in before under union superannuation, in March we recorded our eighth consecutive quarter of negative growth in private savings in Australia. Savings have been going down every month. A survey conducted by the ANZ Bank, headed 'National savings fall in March quarter', stated: National savings fell by 1 per cent of GDP ... That is a mere billion dollars. While people were forcibly made.to put a billion c;lollars into superannuation which they. could not afford, we find that savings fell by a billion dollars anyway. So the system does not seem to be very successful in that regard. The ANZ report covered the March quarter 1993. It went on to say: Private sector saving rose to 3.5 per cent of GDP ($3.5 billion) while public sector dissaving stabilised in trend tenns at 4.4 per cent of GDP ($4.5 billion), following fourteen consecutive quarters of decline. In that sense it was positive. The situation is that it has not contributed to national savings in an overall sense because the government, amongst others, is in there borrowing money as though that practice was about to go out of fashion. What is the government's only solution to this problem? Members of the government come into this place, after going to an election telling everybody they have the One Nation solution, saying that economic growth will give us all the money we need-big tax cuts, increased public savings-reduce our borrowings, which were about $14.5 billion in the lead-up to the election, and that we will do it all on growth. But what have they done? What is their solution? They want to tax businessÂ· even further. There are 140,000 businesses which cannot pay the superannuation guarantee charge, many of which would consist of truck drivers or regional firms. The government is running around with a fraudulent task force. Its members are going around saying to people, 'Tell us what is needed to improve regional industry'. But the government which sent them out there, and which is paying them good money, has just put another 5c a litre tax on fuel-the very lifeblood of regional development, the very lifeblood of Australia, considering the distances between our resources. It is a simple fact that all our great national resources do not grow in the centre of Sydney or the centre of Melbourne. The government's solution to get out of the problem is to take more from the private sector. It, suggests that, firstly, those people can survive in business and, secondly, that they can go on saving money. That says that two plus two equals six. I see that the one time school teacher on the government side is writing something down. Perhaps he will try to prove that two plus two does equal six, but it does not with me. That point has to be made.  point of order. I think courtesies should apply in the chamber. The honourable member for Charlton should be addressed correctly.",44
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Mr Andrew)I think that it was an innocent enough remark from the honourable member for O'Connor but, should the honourable member for O'Connor, out of deference to the chair, choose to refer to the member as the honourable member for Charlton, that would be in keeping with the standing orders.",46
77,Mr TUCKEY,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I referred to nobody in particular. I am pleased to see that those opposite know whom I am talking about. There are three members on the government side. It is a bit of a record for the government at this time of the day to have three members in the parliament.",46
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor might come back to the bill.,46
79,Mr TUCKEY,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I was just explaining that the union official knew whom I was talking about. I have forgotten the electorate he comes from, which is some evidence of how little he does around this place. I thought he was going to say that I was a bit off the subject of the bill, and I was going to say that I am still replying to the honourable member for Oxley who was painting this glorious picture about where all these superannuation measures under the superannuation guarantee charge-which has very little to do with this legislation in its major purpose-came from. He spent nearly all his time telling us what a wonderful job the government was doing in this regard. In rebutting the statements of the honourable member for Oxley, I make two points: firstly, this measure has done very little for workers and, secondly, it is doing even less for national savings. There are some other substantial issues to be addressed in that regard, one of which is the fact that in this process we have started to see the incentives for people investing in private superannuation being whittled down. We now know that people on incomes of up to $30,000 who earn any part of that income subject to the superannuation guarantee charge-if only 10 per cent of their income attracts the superannuation guarantee payment-wiIllose all of their previous tax deductions bar the $100 rebate. This is causing grave hardship for many schoolteachers, policemen and others who chose to superannuate themselves through private schemes and, in doing so, chose to take the up-front benefit-they really tried to do something about savings-of the reduced PAYE available to them under the old arrangements and put it into superannuation. They did not spend it in the pub; they added it to give themselves the sort of benefit the honourable member for Oxley spoke about. Suddenly they get a letter in the mail saying, 'No more of this. You will pay full tax. Your PAYE has been ratcheted up to where it was. If you try to bail out of your superannuation, you will lose the lot'. That is a great help families in tough times, but it is all part of this system. . Knowing full well of my interest in horseracing, Mr Deputy Speaker, it will be of interest to you to know that we now have the tax man running around the place trying to rein jockeys into this scheme. It will be quite interesting, because jockeys seldom earn $450 from one employer through one race club in a month. If they do not, they should not have to pay it, but the tax office is trying to heavy the race clubs into doing something about it. I might say-I hope the message gets outthat the same will apply to many jockeys who see themselves as independent contractors. They have made their own superannuation arrangements. Some of those who are better paid and have higher incomes could lose all their tax deductions for a lousy couple of bucks which will flow in every now and again under this scheme. One might wonder what the tax man is up to. I think he is more inclined to get rid of the tax deductions better-off jockeys than see a general distribution of superannuation in this area. It is extending its tentacles. As I said, the parliament has instructed the commissioner, and he sees himself as having a job to do. There are some other very important aspects to be dealt with in this legislation and its effect on small business, which is my particular responsibility. I haveÂ· already pleaded for them in terms of their right to go on employing a few people and their right to conduct their businesses without all these additional tax burdens such as this charge now being imposed upon them. I make special reference to clause 62(1) of the bill. It makes sense if a bureaucrat does not know how a small business operates. In essence, the clause prevents funds purchasing assets that are the property of a member. That is done for good reason. There is historic evidence that such assets have been overvalued in funds and fraud has been perpetrated. The clause overlooks the fact that one of the better types of funds for a small business is its own. Frequently, there are no employees involved other than the members of the family. They should be able to get some of for the benefits of superannuation and the tax deductibility that remains. From personal experience, I know that very few small businessmen are able to take advantage of the tax deductibility available for superannuation investment in cash simply because they have never got the cash. They lack the cash flow to invest in this and get the sorts of deductions that are available to others. If they could set up a proper superannuation scheme and buy some of their own assets, which could be good bricks and mortar, then they have got the opportunity to do something. But, as has been pointed out to me by certain business groups, if in doing that members had government bonds, mortgage loans at, say, 60 per cent of sworn value and things like that-good assets-why cannot there be a provision that allows them to be brought into the fund? Why has the member got to sell them to someone else, pay all the taxes associated with that and go through all the inconveniof the ence and then use the money to buy something else simply because it is bought on behalf of the fund? Some of the matters that have been advanced as to why the situation should be different are government bonds; interest bearing deposits with banks and building societies-they are not lousy investments just because they happen to belong to a member of the fund; advances by first mortgage, as I have just pointed out, at 66.66 per cent of valu-tion; shares and other securities listed on the stock exchange; life assurance policies, et cetera. Why cannot they be brought forward into a fund on behalf of small business in particular? Another relevant clause is clause 117, which says that the custodian of the fund must have $5 million in assets or a guarantee to that level. Why is that? What is so special about $5 million? Why is this only a scheme for big fellows? We get lectured here every day about small business. It should be put on the record. I think big businesses in recent times have shed about a quarter of a million jobs and in the same period small businesses have picked up half of those people. They will always be the job generator because of their lack of capital. Where a big business sees expansion through capital investment, bigger machines and those sorts of efficiencies, small business goes out and hires people. It is a time payment, if you like. I do not want that to be taken in the wrong sense. It has not got the money in hand; it cannot borrow it, so it hires people to do the jobs. Thank goodness for that. But we should be encouraging small businesses. Why can they not have their own superannuation fund because their assets are only $1 million? Those are the sorts of things that need to be addressed in this legislation. I hope that by the time the legislation gets the Senate and, as I understand, the Senate committee we might see some of these things corrected. It is ridiculous that small business has such a raw deal out of this proposal. It has a raw deal out of this superannuation guarantee charge and in other areas. The people who get the roughest deal out of superannuation are those who do not have a job and those who have been forced into unemployment by the superannuation guarantee charge. It has always astounded me that only superannuation is considered an appropriate retirement investment for people. I think that is quite silly. When we look at the situation, particularly from a small business point of view, what do we see superannuation managed funds investing in? They invest in the share market. I think at times they have been guilty of ramping it. They invest in the currency market. That is a big help-making dollars and manipulating foreign currencies. They eventually invest in supermarkets and tall office buildings-and that does not help their policyholders much either in recent times as that particular market has been overinflated. We are taking that money away from savings accounts in banks, which have traditionally lent money to the farmers and small business people as well as all those people whom we think need to be helped to create jobs in our society. I do not see why people cannot invest for a little while in their own houses. It is a very necessary part of retirement.Why can they not buy a second unit of accommodation, putting their money into a tax free investment, and rent it to someone? It will always be worth more than the money in a super fund because it will always keep up with inflation. Why does the government not open its mind a bit? (Time expired)",46
80,Mr ROBERT BROWN,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and six cognate bills that are being dealt with at the present time represent a fairly logical extension to a number of changes and innovations which have been built into the superannuation arrangements in Australia by this government. The most innovato tive period in the history of the Commonwealth in superannuation and superannuation provisions has been the period since 1983 when the present government came into office. In light of very comprehensive, sometimes very complex and generally very effective changes that have been introduced into the superannuation scheme, it is appropriate that at this stage of an industry which has grown so rapidly and so significantly and will increasingly be an important part of the total Australian arrangement, particularly retirement incomes, we consider prudential protections for superannuation funds. I did not hear all of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), but one of his observations was that we have to re-establish national savings. The necessity for Australia to do that was certainly referred to in the recent FitzGerald report, for a whole complex of reasons. But I am surprised that a comment of that sort would have been made in connection with this set of bills relating to this industry. One of the most important things that superannuation and superannuation contributions do is to build national savings. I will say more about that shortly. I think the honourable member for O'Connor also misrepresented the nature of the . award based superannuation. He suggested that, particularly for smaller businesses, this represented some type of burden. In fact, the three per cent productivity trade-off for employer contributions to superannuation arrangements for their employees in the fir-t place represented a willingness-a declared willingness on the part of the ACTU at that time-on the part of employees to make a contribution not out of the profits of businesOrder! ses or the revenue of employers but out of wages which otherwise would have found their way into their own pockets. It was recognised that it was a three per - ent producruling tivity gain which employees were entitled They did not receive that three per cent. was the three per cent which went into the superannuation funds in order to kick off now is developing in a very substantial way, and will between now and the end of the century develop even more substantially, to ensuring that employees would have an opportunity to contribute towards their own retirement incomes. It is interesting that, despite all of those again. reservations and concerns expressed by the honourable member for O'Connor, the amendpieces ment to the motion. for the second reading that was moved by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) simply says: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading ... Anyone listening to the contribution by the honourable member for O'Connor would be with justified in coming to the conclusion that those opposite want to see all of those seven contributors. bills tossed out. But they do not decline to give this bill a secon<- reading. That means they are going to vote for it; they will divide on it. The amendment to the motion continues: . . . the House calls on the Government to ensure that member representatives on the boards trustees of employer-sponsored funds must be elected by direct ballot of fund members. What a major change to seven bills dealing with prudential supervision and controls over superannuation funds! That does not accord with the contribution made by the honourable member for O'Connor-or, in the light of references which the honourable member for O'Connor made about me, by that publican from the opposition side. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that, in the light of your previous ruling, you would find no offence in such a comment.",48
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,Mr Andrew)The chair merely observes that the the debate is not enhanced by the observation.,49
82,Mr ROBERT BROWN,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I agree with you entirely. I endorsed your decision and your on that occasion, Mr Deputy Speaker, to. as I always do. The most important bill of That these seven is the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill 1993. In his second reading what speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) drew attention to all of the essential elements. Of course, those elements have also been contained witKin the explanatory memorandum and within the provisions of the legislation itself. I do not propose to go over those particular elements I also draw attention to three of the other of legislation in this collection of seven bills. The Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill 1993 will provide for the imposition of a levy on certain superannuation funds and approved deposit funds for the purpose of recouping the cost of maintenance by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission of a register of certain rolled-over benefits in respect of members who have left employment or who are no longer in contact their fund. That is a means of protecting the accumulating benefits of superannuation The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993 provides a mechanism not through which members of superannuation funds can enforce their rights by way of statutory disputes resolution arrangements. There will be a statutorilyÂ· appointed tribunal of which will make determinations in respect of complaints; I think people who are familiar with the superannuation industry and many of these developing arrangements will appreciate the importance of that provision. The Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill 1993 provides for the imposition of a levy on superannuation funds and approved deposit funds for the purpose funding financial assistance to any such funds that suffer loss as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft. Of course, making provisions to ensure that people do not lose their money as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft essential element of any type of arrangement which involves people's rights; particl.llarly when those arrangements have been encourcontribution aged by government. There is obviously a responsibility on theÂ· part of governments ensure that those prudential provisions are place and that people who are contributing their 9wn funds towards arrangements such as superannuation will have their interests adequately protected. I think it will become increasingly apparent why it has been necessary for governments to undertake the development of superannuation funds. I am not one of those people who suggest that the ageing of the Australian population will in the future place such an unbearable burden on the remainder of the population who are in employment that any kind of attack should be made on retirement benefits. There does tend to be an approach of that kind. There are currently in Australia 1.9 million people aged 65 years and over. That represents 11 per cent of the population. By the year 2011, there will be about 4.1 million people aged 65 and over, representing 17 per cent of the projected population at that time. In the year 2031, this figure will rise to .5.2 million people or just over 20 per cent of the projected population. From 11 per cent of the population today, over the next 35 years or so, it is expected that the number of people aged 65 and over will increase to just over 20 per cent of the expected population. It is obvious that there is a need to provide more adequately for retirement incomes to provide people in the years of their retirement with a greater level of security than they would otherwise enjoy. What I want to make sure of, and what 1 hope future governments will make sure of, isÂ· that the compulsory contribution superannuation funds are not used as a means for government to reduce its . responsibility towards people in retirement. Me Deputy Speaker, I remember that you in of particular were aWare, at the time that these provisions were being developed, that one of the reasons given for compulsory superannuation was to encourage supplementation of people's old age pension entitlement. We is an need then to make sure that the old age pension entitlement remains at least at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, so that the to superannuation funds which people are making now, during the period that to they are earning income, should be used more in directly to provide a supplement to the pension that they would otherwise be entitled to. If we do that, those people will have greater dignity, security and purchasing power in their retirement. Therefore, in a material sense at least, they will be more adequately able to enjoy their retirement, as they should. Today, for every one person receiving an age or a service pension, there are approximately six people in the work force who are paying taxes and producing the revenue needed to meet the costs of the social security system. In 30 years time, it is estimated that for every one person on a pension, there will only be three people in the work force. So the number of people in the work force available to support, in a sense, that one person on a pension will decline over the next 30 years from six to three. Age pension outlays during that time will increase from the current level of about 2.5 per cent of GDP to a little over five per cent. So that will double as well if the single pension entitlement is maintained at or about 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. I believe that it should be maintained, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that you support this contention, as does the honourable member for  powerful, strong and continuing advocate for the retirement security of Australians through superannuation arrangements. There have been on .occasions some members of the opposition",49
83,Mr ROBERT BROWN,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"It would not take long to name them. Some members of the opposition have been prepared to adopt a more general approach to the right of people to superannuation entitlements. I remind everyone that, as far as the opposition is concerned, the situation which prevailed before we came into government in 1983and took the opportunity to build greater security, equity, protection and retirement incomes into the system-had, of course, been the result of measures which had been taken or had often failed to be taken by the coalition when it was in government. Prior to that award based superannuation to which I made reference, less than 40 per cent of employees in Australia had access to any superannuation at all. With conservative coalition parties in government, there is no doubt that that 40 per cent would have represented the highest income earners in the Australian work force. Low income earners were rejected and neglected by former conservative coalition governments. Not only was it the highest income earners who had access to superannuation; twice as many males as females had access. It was not only an example of income discrimination, but also an example of gender discrimination. It took a Labor government, through all of the changes that have been introduced since 1983, to bring greater equity into the system and toÂ· rip out, wherever possible, those examples of discrimination. Less than 40 per cent of people in the work force in 1983 had access to superannuation; now 80 per cent of full-time workers have some cover as a result of these changes that have been introduced. I said earlier that this government has been undoubtedly the most innovative governm-nt ever in the development of superannuation. I know that there have been criticisms as a result of the number of changes to superannuation. People have said, 'Why don't you let it settle down?' I would endorse that type of approach, but a whole range of changes has been introduced into a system which is of fundamental importance to Australians-either people in retirement or people looking forward to their retirement. Changes have been introduced into the way in which retirement incomes and superannuation funds are being applied. As the system itself becomes more sophisticated and more complex, as the details are more clearly identified and dealt with, I do not think it is very surprising that, there will be changes:-and probably fairly frequent changes, as there have been since 1983. I believe that we have reached the stage now where a lot of .those problems have been ironed out, and the whole area should start to settle down. But there is a need for governments to upgrade, modify, extend and refine policies in the light of all of those changes that have taken place. There are a number of important elements in superannuation reform to be considered. The first is coverage: who will be covered; to what extent; how will the contributions be made; how should theybe held; how will the earnings on those funds be taxed between the time that the contribution is made and the time that the retirement benefit is secured. But just as important-and in many respects even more important-is the question of prudential controls. We have to make sure that in comprehensive arrangements of this kind we minimise loss by protecting the rights of members against possible fraud, theft or, in some cases, incompetence. Some elements of this legislation repeal those prudential provisions that were made in earlier legislation. Because this has been more refined, it is much more effective. We will deal with those questions in a much more successful way. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was established in June 1991, and it did some great work. The honourable member for Chifley mentioned something that I was going to refer to, and that is the credit which is due to the first chairman of that committee-Senator Nick Sherry-who is now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. That committee did some very valuable work. Some of the reports that it issued were of great importance to the development of legislation. This government has taken advantage of those reports and of many of the findings that those reports contain. Credit goes to Nick Sherry for what he and the committee did over that period. Because he is now a parliamentary secretary, he has resigned from that position with the committee. I think Senator John Watson, from the opposition, has now taken that over. I am familiar with Senator Watson's concerns about superannuation. He has a very creditable background on this matter as well, so I hope that he is able to prev:ail upon his colleagues-both in the Senate and in hereto take a more generalist approach to this matter and to make sure that, when they are giving consideration to superannuation and to the type of changes that could be introduced, they will show more concern for those two sections of the community that they had previously neglected in a discriminatory way-and I refer to low income earners and to women. These are important items of legislation. Despite - he rhetoricÂ· from the opposition, I am pleased that it has decided not to oppose the second reading. (Time expired)",51
84,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY," I enter this debate on superannuation with certain mixed feelings. While I have no doubt that the major problem Australia faces at the moment is a need for national savings, I hesitate to suggest that the collection national savings can be completed by the superannuation system-both the employer guarantee levy system and the self-funded . system. I recently worked on the House Representatives Standing Committee on ing, Finance and Public Administration. One of the witnesses before the committee sugtheir gested that 10 years down the track we would be looking at the superannuation funds indus11 try in exactly the same way that we were looking at the major banking institutions at that time. I believe that that will be the and these seven bills certainly provide a framework. I am afraid that the execution of the duties of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission under these regulations will be very similar to the execution of duties by a lot other institutions and commissions. The Australian Securities Commission, for in the stance, hesitates to make an inquiry on a matter that involves less than $500,000. Anything below that is not significant enough for it to spend its resources on. As a result of that, there has been persecution by that commission in certain areas. I believe that the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, which will be charged with prudential supervision, will end up exactly the same. I do not know how many superannuation funds there are in Australia. I am led to believe that there are thousands. To suggest that we can fund a bureaucracy big enough to be efficient in the discharge of its duties is nonsensical. I am taking the general ambit claim, as the honour-ble member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) invited me to do, and that is to look at it generally. I think we have to start on that premise. We have to look at what things have happened around us in the past within this parliament, at the bodies that we have set up, and at the physical impossibility for them to handle it. One might even suggest that the Reserve Bank, which has a smaller area of responsibility, finds. difficulty in providing the prudential supervision of the banks that it is charged with providing. That position pales into insignificance against what we are doing with this legislation. As I said, I have no complaint-and neither of does the Qpposition-with the argument that national savings are imperative. That need is highlighted in Australia at the moment for two reasons. Firstly, there is a higher reliance of on social security by way of the age and Bankveterans pension when those who have reached that stage have not been able to fund retirement. I think the honourable member for Charlton mentioned that the figure was per cent of the population. That is a huge amount to start with. We are starting behind the eight ball. Secondly, Australia places an case, emphasis on the accumulation of foreign capital because we lack the national savings necessary for our own investment purposes. I think that is absolutely' tragic. A lot of people ask why we should have foreign investment. The reason we need of foreign investment is that we have to keep the engine ticking over., Australians do not have capacity to invest. In my own electorate, two very small meat works went up for sale. The price wanted was $70 million. The graziers tried right across Australia to raise the funds for the meat works, but they were unable to do so. Eventually, the graziers fell captive to a 70 per cent investment of foreign capital-namely, capital from Japanese investors. We were able to raise only 30 per cent. So there is no complaining about the need for national savings. At this point I might add that the manner which we accrue national savings is hampered in many ways at the' moment, mostly by government intervention, and particularly through taxation: We hear people say that we have the lowest tax regime in the OECD, et cetera, et cetera-they can use any comparison they like-but people in the street know that they cannot afford to put money aside as savings because of other commitments. Taxation is just one of them. The government's latest idea of penalising pensioners for shares held for investment purposes is absolutely crazy because it goes against the thrust of what we are trying to do for people through this superannuation bill, and that is to allow them to provide for themselves. Nowhere within these bills is there provision for an alternative savings mechanism to the superannuation scheme. The whole concept of instituting employer funded schemes for employees at the expense and risk of further investment by the private sector and self-funded arrangements is absolutely pathetic. By way of example, company directors and local government councillors are now being asked-they are not asking-to pay a superannuation levy on company and council funds, no matter how small the amount is. Once that is done it denies the right to self-funded superannuation. Why does the government encourage participation in a scheme only to close it down in this particular way? While the National Party, unlike the rest the opposition, welcomes the changes that the proposed legislation would bring, we should also be looking at the inherent problems of the superannuation industry. The honourable member for Charlton might well decry the 11year-old scheme, where only five per cent of the lump sum superannuation amount was taxed, because of abuses that occurred, but when one looks at the 27 or 30 changes to the method of taxation of those funds, the limits imposed on lump sums, and the way in which the government is now legislating in this area, I do not think that these bills will go any way towards increasing the level of national savings. And that has to be the crunch point. We should be providing incentives for in national savings. In a way, it is a national disaster that we should be seeking that end through one instrument alone. At the moment, the government, with its preoccupation with superannuation, does not recognise that people are expected to make a contribution for those not in wbrk. On raw statistics, 11 per cent of Australians are presently out of work. If we add to that figure the number of people underemployed and who would like to get into a better job, we reach a figure of 20 per cent. So we supposedly have a national savings scheme, but 20 per cent of the population is not being asked to contribute to it. A 12 per cent contribution is necess[\ry for this scheme to become an effective replacement for the social security scheme. I understand that the government aims for a nine per cent employer contribution and then, perhaps, a three per cent employee contribution, but the system fails on that basis alone. We cannot expect a national savings scheme to be funded by the businesses and workplaces of Australia. I have made a list of some of the problems that businesses face today with taxation charges and government regulation. Average businesses today face a superannuation guarantee levy of five per cent; there is payroll tax, which is payable at various levels; there is a fringe benefits tax on the employment of certain of their employees; they pay a health and safety tax; if they do not use their own funds for training, they pay a training levy; of there is workers compensation; and there is four weeks annual leave with a 17.5 per cent loading. What does this mean to the business world? I know of a private company which, five years ago, was a thriving company that employed 150 people. Every time a new tax was imposed, every time there was a reduction in hours, and every time there was a reduction in productivity, it took people off the payroll and did not replace them. Today, that business is involved in the same type of activity at the same level but with only 100 workers. That means 50 people have been put out to pasture. Unless we remove some of these taxes instead of adding to them",52
85,Mr CADMAN,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,You would not know what it is like in western Sydney.,54
86,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"This is just in Mackay. If we went to western Sydney-or, better still, if we went to Victoria, we would see that the collapse of its economy is attributable to both state and federal parliaments imposing taxes and regulations. We cannot get away from that fact. That is what is happening out in the real world. This legislation reminds me of a cat chasing its tail, because, while superannuation is a business cost, there is no productivity increase attached to the cost. The government can point to the ACTU and its various accords, but nothing connected with superannuation has added the least bit to productivity-and th/lt is what business people need if they are going to carry the cost of superannuation. While the cost of providing employee superannuation has been loaded onto business, business people themselves are unable to get the type of cover they want because they cannot afford it or because the government has not made it attractive enough. There is no productivity increase. In actual fact, there is less employment under this scheme, not more employment. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) mentioned home savings in his speech. Buying a home is a form of national savings. However, while five per cent of people's salary is contributed to the superannuation guarantee levy, when they want the money for home buying or home building it is not available to them; they are denied the opportunity to invest in the housing industry. Because of the economic flow-on effects of buying a house, it is the housing industry that has the greatest capacity to lead the sort of recovery that this country needs. Some honourable members have complained that 10 years ago only five per cent of a lump sum superannuation payment was taxed. Today, however, taxes are imposed in advance, again during the term of contribution, and then again at the end on the lump sum. This has been a marvellous gravy train for the government. With that sort of taxing pressure, the superannuation funds cannot provide the level of cover that is required. The example has already been given of people in casual or itinerant employment who move from workplace to workplace. They used to have three per cent, and will now have five per cent, taken off their wages and directed to a superannuation fund where there is no ghost of a chance of that money appreciating in value. Instead, because of the charges and the tax imposed on the contributions, there is every chance that it will amount to nothing in 10 years time. I have looked at the records of one of the major insurance companies in Queensland, Suncorp, and seen the sorts of payouts received by employees. For itinerant workers, it is a losing concern. In 10 years, the money would either be soaked up by the superannuation funds or, if there is something left for a person's retirement, it will be dissipated in additional tax against the superannuation fund. While my party endorses these new bills because they rationalise a lot of the problems of the old bills, it is being done at the expense of the people who do not have an opportunity to save through superannuation because they are not encouraged to do so. While it might be okay for employees to have the boss paying into their fund, we need to have those funds employed for Australian interests. Nowhere in these bills do I see provision for a scheme where, say, the health workers of Australia divert funds in order to provide new hospitals, nursing homes or something like that. It is not in their charter. Yet I would suggest that funds would be better used in that way rather than in all the paper shuffling that is going on around the place-worse still, sending the money offshore and investing it at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent in overseas scrips. That is not national savings; that is not the best possible use those funds. Unless a person has a 12 per cent contribution, at the end of the day the government will still be in a position of having 11 per cent presently not covered and the 15 per cent who will not be covered in 20 years time. The government has been presented with an opportunity to break the nexus. I might not understand superannuation very well but I do understand that the Fightback policy provided the answer by giving incenwas tives to people to contribute to superannuato tion, by putting a cap on employer schemes, and allowing those funds to be used, particusupported larly in the area of housing, in a manner that would be beneficial to Australia. The opposition policy provided for less on the way through and no lump sum at the end. It allowed for annuities and pensions the end of the day, which would have been --At taxed in the normal way. We would taken control completely out of the hands of the superannuation funds and allowed people to do it themselves. We would have allowed people to invest and use those funds, with government support, to provide for their superannuation. The plan we were providing, together with the superannuation industry, would have been okay. The best thing was that the superannuation industry would have been taken out of the control of unions. I remember with some alarm the first these schemes-the BUS, or building unions then superannuation, scheme-that was proposed. If ever there was a shifty sort of arrangement, that was it. It was union controlled, union dominated, and the hard fist that the building industry unions then had was being used to force the issue.",54
87,Mr CADMAN,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,Norm Gallagher.,55
88,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Unfortunately, the building industry gave in, and that is what to this catalyst that we have at the moment. I grieve for the old system. I would like devote a little time to the big insurance companies who will be paying the levy this supervision, and who will be supervised. Every day I receive complaints about the manner in which the superannuation funds are providing management, the huge amounts of of commission being paid, and the management fees that diminish the value of the savings. The insurance companies looked at the employers' schemes with delight because it to help the was a captive market. I have had reason to question an insurance company very closely about the premature discharge of a policy where a chap was seeking a replacement heart. A person looking for a replacement heart at the age of 40 or 45 would provide pretty good evidence that he in dire circumstances and was not likely work again. In spite of the trustees of that fund saying over and over again that they the employee's right to take out those funds prematurely, that person has to live on sickness benefits. He cannot afford to tax pay his car repayments or his house redemption on sickness benefits; whereas if that at amount was made available to him, he could. the moment, there is a lot of short-sightedhave ness in the insurance industry. These companies must have tighter control of their agents. For example, Brisbane agents of a company have had some difficulty in fulfilling their agency agreement. The insurown ance company did nothing when faced with blatant abuse by the agent. The company stood aside and said that the issue was between the agents and the agency, and it would not come into it. If it is fair that the companies are going to be supervised by the of Insurance and Superannuation Commission, it is just as important that there is a peer recognition amongst the insurance companies that they have a responsibility to the person they are insuring. The responsibility applies to all staff, including agencies. The manner in which they respond will be a measure of how much the companies are prepared to take on board the need for this closer supervision. The superannuation industry, and the plight led of people in relation to national savings, is not helped by the example we set within the to parliamentary superannuation system. There are two classes of people in Australia at the for moment: those who do very well out of superannuation, and those who are being forced into superannuation and who will never do well under it. While we act as the pacesetters with our parliamentary superannuation-a scheme which is far too generous, and which has a natural flow-on to the Public Service, which I believe is also generousand while those funds are not paid for or contributed to by the government, it leaves Australia in the very delicate position of having more liabilities than are being disclosed. At the changeover from the old Trans Australia Airlines scheme to the new scheme this government had to put in $177 million to make sure that it was actually funded at the time. (TIme expired)  pleased to speak in support of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Amendment Bill, the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill, the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill, the Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill, the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you will forgive me for reminiscing a little, but every time. I go to my senior citizens and we talk about the pension or superannuation, there is bound to be one who will raise the old national welfare fund which was set up by my electorate's namesake, Mr Chiney. I want to remind the House that that was a fully funded scheme where people paid a proportion of the money they earned, and it was shown on their income tax statements. It was a fund that was fenced off. It was a real tragedy that the Menzies government firstly absorbed the amounts that were being collected into the national welfare fund into consolidated revenue, removed the fences around the national welfare fund, and finally left it as a mere shell so that our welfare system is now an unfunded liability. It is interesting to speculate how strong that national welfare fund may have been if it had been allowed to continue, and how much stronger the nation's savings might have been. On a number of occasions my own Chiney FEC has passed resolutions about the desirability of introducing a national superannuation scheme and, indeed, that is what the national welfare fund was. But we do not have that scheme. The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said that the government can be well satisfied with the initiatives it has taken in terms of superannuation, because prior to its activities the only people who had superannuation were public servants, and people in middle management in private enterprise-mostly male, definitely not femaleand only 40 per cent of the population was covered.. In introducing our award superannuation of three per cent employer funding, rising to nine per cent with an employee contribution of three per cent, we have extended that coverage by almost 100 per cent. Of course, it is desirable that all people be covered. Both the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) have said that we are missing out on the unemployed. I try to listen to opposition comments and contributions during debates, but I find it very difficult to understand how people who are unemployed could be covered in a work related superannuation scheme. We often get parallels with Asian countries, and one of the things that impressed me a few years ago was the Singapore system of national savings. Admittedly, Singapore does not have social security, and it does not have a lot of other things that we take for granted, but it does have a pretty impressive national savings scheme with a 25 per cent employer contribution and a 25 per cent employee contribution. Could I just repeat that: 25 per cent employer and 25 per cent employee. That has recently been reduced to 20 per cent. That is a massive engine room of savings, and with that sort of contribution coming from both employers and employees it is understandable social that money can be borrowed to buy houses, or, more correctly, flats in Singapore. We have a long way to go beforeÂ· we can feel comfortable about the level of superannuation that we are encouraging our Australian citizens to participate in for their future retirement. When one generates such high levels of savings, it is possible to load in the option of allowing people to take savings out of their superannuation for home purchase; but I certainly agree that that is not appropritrusts; ate now. I should have mentioned in the context of the Chifley FEC that considerable concern has been expressed about the safety of people's superannuation funds and this is one of the main arguments why we should have a national superannuation scheme. I am very pleased that these bills start to address some of those prudential requirements. But I do have a couple of concerns, one"" of which I share with the honourable member for Dawson-namely, the type of investment in which superannuation funds are involved. Organisations such as banks, insurance companies and superannuation companies have a responsibility to fund the productive sector in our community, whether it be in primary industry, manufacturing or service industries. I am not suggesting that aU the funds should be deployed this way; but a lot of contributors to such schemes and funds would feel comfortable if at least certain minimum amounts went into"" funding the productive resources sector in the economy. That is not the case. My second concern was alluded to earlier ,in the debate. One does have situations where the administrative charges are greater than the amount of interest earned on the fund. I would be particularly interested to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) whether this concern is being addressed, because I think it is absolutely ludicrous. It really means that either administrative charges should be exempt where they are greater than the interest earned, or other contributors to the scheme should accept a larger proportion of those administrative charges. In the past, people have come out behind and I do not think that is right. This legislation addresses some broad objectives"" in terms of prudential supervision. It will ensure that public confidence is maintained in the cOI)cept of saving during one's working life for income in retirement; ensure the continuity and stability of the financial system, given the larger and ever increasing proportion of the nation's savings that will be managed by superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation and ensure that tax concessions, which are considerable-estimated at around $5 billion-directed at superannuation are not dissipated through incompetent or dishonest management. In developing its supervisory regime, some principles have been developed. The first principle is to increase, but not guarantee, the safety of members' benefits. The government will not guarantee superannuation benefits to members because, rightly, that is the responsibility of trustees and fund managers. They could be tempted not to undertake their responsibilities rigorously and possibly even take excessive risks if they knew that the government was underpinning their investments or, more particularly, their investment mistakes. Secondly, to base the legal framework on traditional trust law principles, trustees will continue to be under fiduciary obligations to manage the assets of a fund in a way that an ordinary prudent person would in dealing with the property of another for whom the person felt morally bound to provide. The third principle will allow maximum commercial freedom generally so that competition, specialisation, innovation and other responses to market developments are not inhibited. Fourthly, to ensure that primary responsibility for the viability and prudent operation of superannuation funds rests with trustees and fund managers, the government will not direct superannuation moneys into particular investments....,...I am not so sure about that-beyond requiring that the investment strategies be suitably prudent. Lastly, it will keep compliance costs to a minimum. "" There will be clearer trustee obligations. Members of trustee boards cannot be bankrupts and theyÂ· cannot have convictions involving dishonesty and, I presume, fraud. Trustees will have a range of duties spelt out for them-for example, to act honestly at all times in the best interests of the beneficiaries; to keep the fund's assets separate from the trustee's own assets or the employer sponsor's own assets; to exercise the same degree of care, skill and diligence as an ordinary prudent person would in dealing with the property of another for whom the person felt morally bound to provide; and, lastly, in formulating an investment str!ltegy, to have regard to liabilities, risk return, diversification and liquidity considerations. A codification of these duties will represent a significant milestone for trustees and fund members. For trustees, it will mean that their basic duties and fiduciary responsibilities are spelt. out clearly. Any rpember who suffers a loss or damage due to a breach of these covenants will have a statutory right of action against the trustee. There is a new penalties regime within these bilIs, including fault liability, beyond reasonable doubt, strict liability and civil penalty. I will not comment on all of those. This legislation provides for greater member participation. For example, superannuation funds are operated for the benefit of their members. The government places considerable weight on the role played by members in the management of funds. Currently, members do not have that option .. It is always interesting in a debate on superannuation to see how the opposition objects to the union movement having developed, in the absence of other mechanisms, trade union funds. Whilst the building unions superannuation scheme was mentioned, I am more familiar with the National Union of Workers superannuation scheme which, by all accounts, has been an outstanding success and is to be commended. I wonder whether opposition members will deride that as they have the building unions superannuation fund. One of the most important ways in which members are able to participate in the management and protection of their retirement savings is through representation on the board of trustees. This legislation provides for equal representation. At the same time, small funds which consider equal representation to be impractical may opt for an independent trustee, providing the choice of trustee is by mutual agreement. Greater member participation means wider security of funds operation, consistent with the notion that the greater the number of watchful members, the smaller the risk of undetected fraud and negligence. This is a very important element in the overall changes the government is proposing. It is ironic that the other investment rules seem to have drawn the crabs from the opposition. These include that investments must be made at arms-length. The honourable member for O'Connor said that this was dreadful; that superannuation funds ought to be able to buy not at arms-length. There is a provision that in-house assets not exceed five per cent of the market value of the fund and that no loans be made to members or their relatives. What does the opposition object to in these provisions? There will be no acquisition Of assets from members or their relatives. It is not just a matter of convenience for some of the smaller businesses, as the honourable member for O'Connor suggests. The issue here is that the public purse is involved through the concessionality of the taxation treat-ent of superannuation, and I think these rules are eminently sensible. They are certainly very much defendable for those who contrib-te, in the broad, to superannuation schemes. .I find it very ironic that the opposition apparently is objecting to these rules, in particular to clause 62. There are enhanced requirements and obligations for funds in terms of the use of auditors, actuaries and professionals. I would have thought this to be very much in the best interests of those who contribute to funds and that it may assist the professionalism of the industry. Perhaps one of the most important innovations is the statutory complaints tribunal. Not only will the trustees of funds be required, as good administrative practice would determine, to have an internal complaints handling mechanism but, if this does not resolve the problem to the complainant's satisfaction, a statutory complaints tribunal wilI be set up, which would be independent and capable of arbitrating on complaints. These cognate bills will assist ordinary Australians by giving them confidence in superannuation and letting them know that their savings will be secure, that they will be fairly treated and that their superannuation funds will be invested effectively and productively. I want to respond to a few matters that have been raised. The honourable member for O'Connor raised the issue of insurance companies. I recall an example, AMP, which purports to be a good Australian company. It has a wholly owned subsidiary, Computer Science of Australia, which not only processes its computing requirements, but also is a very important defence contractor. The AMP proposed to sell 100 per cent of that company. It was not the situation that the honourable member for Dawson suggested of a cash starved organisation desperately embarking on a sell off campaign. In my view, this was a wilful example of an Australian national icon failing to exercise its responsibilities. I am delighted that this posed sell off has fallen through-as I understand it-but I say to policyholders of the AMP that they have every right at annual general meetings to question the management of AMP and determine in exactly what way the AMP company is assisting Australian industries, whether rural and primary producers, the manufacturing sector or the services sector, to make their contribution to Australia's economic well-being. The honourable member for O'Connor seems to take some delight in the fact that some small businesses, for whatever reason, have not been able to pay their superannuation contributions. Not paying those contributions, I point out, is a breach of the law. It affects their employees' prospective retirement. That any member of this chamber could wax lyrical about that, I find absolutely amazing. I have already mentioned the fact that the honourable member for O'Connor said that the unemployed are being left out of the award superannuation scheme. Of course they are. If someone could explain the problem with that a little better, I would be delighted. The recent three per cent employer superannuation contribution was given because the working men and women of Australia had not been receiving their just entitlements in terms of salary and wage increases. In lieu of awarding them that, the government and the Industrial Relations Commission developed award superannuation at a rate of three per cent. Strictly speaking, that should not be classified as an employer contribution, but as an employee contribution. We should be talking about a scheme that is balanced with six per cent employer and six per cent employee contributions, when fully developed. In the context of our current economic situation, we ought to review that and see whether it is enough and whether, in the national interest and the interests of people retiring in the future, that level should not be increased. The opposition has suggested that employers are unfairly bearing that cost impost-that is what is unfair. I support these bills. (TIme expired)",55
89,Mr CADMAN,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Mitchell) (6.04 p.m.)pro- Whilst there is much to commend in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill and the six cognate superannuation bills before the House, there is much in the superannuation schemes in Australia today to classify them as grossly unfair and unjust to a large section of the community. They are unfair to migrants, part-time workers, women and unskilled workers. These are the people that the Australian Labor Party should be standing for. It has made a shambles of the superannuation scheme for those people it claims to represent. Those opposite should be ashamed of themselves. This legislation will force the funds and operators of funds to comply with some sort of management program that, as more and more money flows into the funds, will ensure that the trustees and other managers will be fair and conscientious in the treatment of employers' and employees' funds. This legislation applies to superannuation. funds, approved deposit funds and superannuation trusts. It seeks to provide a framework of compliance. For superannuation funds, that means they need to comply with operating standards, the rules that govern them, borrowing rules, lending rules, the control and management of their in-house assets and the rules that apply to the assets they hold. These bills provide for equal representation or for management of the fund in a fair way. I would like to have the best people looking after my dough. I would not like Norm Gallagher or any of those roosters-or any of the yahoos in the union movement-looking after my money just because they have enough votes to muscle their way into a senior position. I would like the best managers to looking after my money, not people who can bend an arm or force somebody to vote for them at union elections. It is just not on. Funds should not operate that way. They should have the best people, who are capable and have proved they can get the best results. So I have some concerns about equal representation rules. Accounting requirements are also covered by this legislation so the community at large can understand and see that their funds are being dealt with in a way that is actuarially sound and so that the accounting process can easily be understood. These bills cover trustees, the investment manager, the actuary and auditor standards-all proper things toregulate and codify superannuation. Chris Hurford, a former Assistant Treasurer, promised this eight or nine years ago. The government has been sitting on this all that time and could not decide what to Honourable members may remember a gentleman in Sydney who absconded with about $12 million-he is in the Greek islands at the moment, enjoying himself. Chris Hurford said, 'Yes; the matter is serious. We must do something'. 1Welve years is a pretty long gestation period for this egg. Here it is, up today, for consideration by this House. The legislation also deals with public offer requirements. We had a blindingly brilliant speech from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) when he introduced this legislation. Those in the gallery must be absolutely absorbed by superannuation and the complexities of it-some of the people in the gallery are; I thank them for their acknowledgment. For those people who are not, they should have heard the speech of the parliamentary secretary on the introduction of this legislaran tion. It was absolutely brilliant-the peak of oratory in this House-because he took the most boring parts of the explanatory memorandum that explains to us non-legal people what the act is really meant to do and he read them. He stood here and read them, and said that was a speech. I could not believe it. There was not an indication of government intention-not even a bit of propaganda. I be could not believe it. Imagine the Australian Labor Party missing a chance for a bit of propaganda or patting itself on the back. It introduced this legislation out there in the community 27,000 times, if one reads its press releases, but the parliamentary secretary read the explanatory memorandum. I could not believe it. . There is a need to refer to the explanatory memorandum to this act if one is to understand some of the processes that are to be undertaken in the legislation. I have covered some of them. I refer to the supervisory arrangements involving direct enforcement powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is going to be a pretty powerful group. It is the group that terrorised the pensioners and the retirees of Australia with its very unci ever managing of the RBLs. For two years, we had every retiree in Australia egg not understanding how much money he had, do. where it was, who was looking after it and how much money he owed the governmentincredible arrangements. The government forced retirees to accept the fact that they could not pay tax for 12 months because it would not tell them what their income was, and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission was behind it. The government would not tell them what their income was for 12 months, and here they are, terrified of being fined by a taxation commissioner with incredible powers. All the retirees are relying on for the taxation commissioner not moving in on them is a press release put out by him. Who would rely on his press releases? He is likely to change them, as the government is likely to change them. There is nothing in legislation. The group that was involved in the reasonable benefit limits for retirees-the mob that that show-is going to run superannuation for Australia. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has had a bit more practice in superannuation now, so I will give it the benefit of the doubt. Let us hope the commission will do a good job, but I warn it that I will be watching its activities in this area, just as I watched Â·its activities with the management of the RBLs for the retirees, because I think it did an appalling job. It was absolutely appalling. People were swinging on a telephone for 11/2 to two hours, desperately trying to get information. Then those telephone lines were being closed down so that the employees there did not have to answer any of these nasty questions. It was terrible stuff. Then the telephone numbers were changed three days in a row so that people could not find out where to phone. I did not like that very much. I did not think it was very appropriate behaviour for government instrumentalities which are supposed to be providing information to behave in that way. Let us move on to the powers, the role and the functions of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission because it will be looking at the role of trustees and investment managers. The bill provides that there will be a clear delineation of the basic duties and responsibilities of trustees and that trustees and investment managers must be suitable to act as fund trustees. It is these careful sorts processes that we would expect to find in legislative sanctions which seek to control somebody who is going to perhaps play up and cause trouble. I have come to the view that whilst I prefer the indirect method of control that we have had till now I can see that, as funds grow, there needs to be codification. The government, as is its want, has moved so strongly to provide a framework, but I think it has provided little direction. In fact, I would like to draw to the attention of the House some of the objections I have received to this legislation. I have had one from the Queensland government which says that it is concerned about the strength of some of this legislation and the immense power given to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. He can in fact almost make laws as he goes along, which has been one of the complaints. Nobody quite knows what he does but he is going to declare what he does, which is something like the taxation commissioner does. The Queensland government says that, under this legislation, the commission can wind up a scheme, freeze assets, suspend or remove a trustee body and a whole raft of other things. The government has legislated for the management of our money in some fund operated by some group of trustees. We are just saying, 'We do not know what will happen there, but we will give a whole lot of power to the commissioner for insurance and superannuation'. That seems a strange way for a government to enter into a new scheme. It gives the power to the commissioner-this sounds like cops and robbers, it sounds a bit like the customs agencies and it sounds a bit like the Australian Federal Police-to enter premises, seize documents, conduct investigations into the affairs of a fund and determine an auditor is not suitable to audit a fund. The commission has pretty wide and far-reaching powers. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you would be worried. I know those miners in the Cessnock area. They are good blokes. Too many of them vote Labor, but I tell you what, they are not bad people. They would be really of worried if they thought that some public servant in Canberra had the power to move in on their funds and tum the whole thing upside down because the government has not yet defined the powers of the commissioner. That is the basis of one of the complaints. The basis 6f another complaint is that, while it appears at this point that the legislation will be effective from the beginning of July 1994, in fact it is effective for some funds from 1 December 1993. I complimented the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is now at the table, on the brilliance of his blinding introductory speeches where he read the explanatory memorandums to these bills. I was not all that impressed by the explanations he offered for some of the difficult and technical passages where the community is wanting a bit of enlightenment. I ask him now to please explain that feature, if he would not mind, of the apparent earlier start-up date for some funds, depending on how they are structured. I have also received a complaint about the triple jeopardy for trustees. Trustees will now have to confront the new legislation for superannuation insurance, the Commonwealth corporations law and the state or territory trustees law. They have three fronts where they need to exercise judicial judgment and very great care in the exercise of their management for which they are charged for these funds. A proposal at an earlier stage was that we have one process for these people to deal with, and that would be something under the new SIS legislation. That has been shipped to one side, and we have not just one form of Commonwealth legislation but two forms of Commonwealth legislation and one form of tax legislation. The earlier proposal appears to have been dropped. There are significant complaints. One cannot move past. some of the good work done by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that examined this matter, but the government has decided to walk past some of those things. I have already dwelt on the powers of the commissioner. The Senate committee also spent a lot of time speaking about the role, functions and powers of the commissioner. I think this will be a problem for the government because the last thing I would want is some guy, whose responsibility I do not understand and which has not been defined, roaming loose having pot shots at my insurance or superannuation. For the operators on the ground, the governachieve ment has, in its brilliance, produced 2,000 changes to superannuation law as it affects the average person or may effect the average person over the period it has been in office. Two thousand changes-can honourable members believe it? Most of them are minor changes, but there are substantial major changes that affect the savings of Australians. They have planned or may have had in train for 15 or 20 years the process of retirement, but the government can come along and change the taxing process and the yield overnight, and has not hesitated to do so. I think that is immoral. I do not think this government understands anythingÂ· but where it can dig for better and bigger pots of gold. If the government has dug for pots of gold, it has been amongst the retirees. If I may say so, the government has really wrecked their expectations of it, and their trust in it, with the way in which it has dealt with them. I think it is amazing and unconscionable the way in which the government has dealt with those people. Having dealt with some of the broad problems with and the objections to the legislation, I want to go back to a submission put to the Senate committee in May of last year by the Retailers Council of Australia. It employs a lot of semiskilled and unskilled people on a part-time and casual basis and allows people to keep house and home together. In this day and age of high unemployment, I will bet that everybody in the gallery knows of some breadwinner who has lost his or her job and has been replaced in the work force by his wife or her husband working on a part-time basis in order to ""eep the food coming in and to keep paying the bills. That is the area where people hurt and is the area that the Retailers Council drew attention to some time ago. In a speech made in Wollongong on 17 March 1992, St Patricks Day, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)-it is a pity he was not in Ireland because he would have been better off if he had not made this speech-stated: It is our aim to see all Australian wage and salary earners have adequate superannuation cover. That is bunkum. The government is nowhere near it and has years to go. It will rip more money out of employers and employees to it. The government would have to do that to get near the mark. The parliamentary secretary laughed at me when I said that funds were not covering the payments people had made. Today the chickens have come home to roost and he will have to admit that people are not covered and will not gain any benefit from their payments or the payments of their employers. In the same speech, the Treasurer stated: The superannuation guarantee will provide the basis for an increase in Australia's national savings. That is occurring but I believe not at a rate that will really supply the change in ethos that Australia needs. Let me deal with some of the specifics of the submission from the Retailers Council. The Retailers Council said to the Senate committee: ... the level of income likely to be available on reaching retirement age is expected to be minimal. That is true. On three per cent or five per cent, there will not be much difference to the retirement ability of people to purchase or have more. Further, the Retailers Council said: ... substantially increased administrative burden on retailers cannot be justified. Every employer that I have spoken to over the last two weeks in examining this matter says that the small benefit for the employee makes it a time consuming and wasteful process. The fund managers tell me the same thing. The third point the Retailers Council made was: . . . a relativelyÂ· large proportion of these employees' superannuation savings will be eroded by the administrative costs of the fund managers. That is right but, I contend, more than it would have predicted at that time. What did the Retailers Council say when interviewed about what it would do if the government brought in this scheme? The big retailersDavid Jones, Grace Bros, Myers and all of the major retailers we know all around Australia-were amongst those surveyed. Five said they would meet the cost by increasing prices, nine said they would meet the cost of superannuation by decreasing hours available to their employees and 13 said they would decrease the actual number of employees; and that has happened. There are 60,000 people on the scrap heap. Sackings have been brought about by the cost of this charge with no benefit to the Australian employers, many of them small ones. It is the wrong time to do this and the wrong action to take. I want to deal quickly with some of the people who miss out. I take the example of an evening college in my district. Teacher No. 1 earned $450 in only one calendar month between 1 July 1992 and 30 June 1993 and became eligible for a three per cent superannuation payment calculated at three per cent of $450, which is $13.50. Most superannuation funds have an administrative charge of at least $52 per annum. What did this person find? He paid $13.50, but there was a bill of $52 standing against his name. If he goes back to work at the evening college that money will be sucked out again. Until he has paid the $52 off, he has a bill against his name. That will go on and on for part-time employees. I bring another example to the attention of the parliamentary secretary. Teacher No. 49 became eligible for a superannuation payment of $113.14. The payment was $113, less $52; so he made a profit. But in year two he had $61 brought forward from year one plus an administrative cost for the next year. People are losing out time and again. (Time expired)",59
90,Mr JOHNS,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I apologise for not being available in the chamber during the debate; it was ,simply not possible for me to be here. The real question here is whether the government has a .superannuation policy that will drive more money into the system, that is, so that more money is available for retirement income than would otherwise have been the case. That is the sole test. The point is that we have now delivered a system that will do that. The funny thing is, though, that the engine that drives the entire system is the super guarantee charge. Prior to the last election those in the opposition said, 'If we are elected, we will put a cap on the super guarantee charge and ensure that forever more people are putting in only three to five per cent, usually on behalf of the employee by the boss'. What a massive contradiction. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) says three to five per cent is not enough, and he has just quoted the submission of the Retailers Council of Australia to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. He said that the system was bound to fail because it would not produce the sorts of savings that he predicts will be necessary for those to retire comfortably. But those opposite wanted to put a cap on the amount of money that could be placed into funds on behalf of employees. They will have to wake up to the fact that they lost the last election. I have seen a recent statement by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), that if the coalition wins the election in 1996 it will have another cap, by which time about six per cent of a worker's earnings will be compulsorily put in on his or her behalf under the superannuation guarantee charge. I guess those opposite would have fouled the then relatively new system up had they won the election, but when we get around to the next election in 1996 thisÂ· system will be mature and pouring very substantial amounts of money into the retirement income investment accounts of workers. That is what it is all about. The opposition could not design a system that could drive that number of dollars into private accounts that would be well handled and managed and that would produce decent retirement incomes. That is the test. Today there are so many more dollars flowing into those accounts on behalf of workers which they will be able to draw on for their retirement. What a contradiction it is that those opposite suggest that three per cent or five cent is insufficient, yet they are the ones who would have kept it at three to five per cent. That is the point There is no doubt that we have a unique system. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",63
91,Unknown,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 8.00 p.m. TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No.1) 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, and read a first time. Second Reading",64
92,Mr GEAR,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of a package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, which was passed by this House on 6 September. That bill contained the government's key budget taxation measures. As part of its campaign to obstruct the passage of the government's 1993-94 budget, the opposition referred the deficit reduction bill to a Senate committee. The committee was asked to determine whether, by combining measures dealing with several subjects of taxation, the bill contravened section 55 of the constitution. Parliament has been passing taxation bills combining several subjects of taxation since at least 1984. Only now has this been raised as an issue. The government's senior legal advisers, and parliamentary counsel, gave advice to the committee that the deficit reduction bill was clearly valid and that none of its measures imposed taxation. The Senate committee concluded, correctly, that only the High Court can determine issues of constitutional validity. The committee also concluded that there was a risk that the bill would be declared invalid. This conclusion was contrary to the advice of the government's chief general counsel and of other experts who presented their views to the committee. The government does not accept the committee's conclusion. Moreover, the committee gave no reasons for per its conclusions and gave the government no guidance as to how to split the bill. Views put to the committee that the bill is invalid fall into two categories. The first is that any increase in the formal rate of a tax is an imposition of tax. This view draws an illogical distinction between a rate increase and an enlargement of a tax base. The second is that any increase in liability to taxation is an imposition of tax. If this argument is accepted, then most of the tax laws passed over the past 50 years are also invalid. This is an absurd argument. The government is entitled to rely on the clear and unequivocal advice of its legal advisers. Nevertheless, tpe opposition's actions on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill have created considerable uncertainty. The government has decided to remove that uncertainty and withdraw the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and to reintroduce the budget measures in a package of related bills. Apart from the measures included in the 'test case' bill, the repackaged bills would not be challenged by those who argue that the only amendments in the package which impose tax are those which increase a rate of tax. The government has deliberately rejected the extreme view that any increase in the incidence of a tax is an imposition of tax. It has, therefore, refrained from structuring these bills to avoid a challenge from this quarter. If that view is correct, then virtually all of the Commonwealth's tax laws are invalid. It would be pointless to address those concerns without rewriting the corpus of all the existing tax laws. The bills comprised in this package are the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bills (Nos. 1 to 3) 1993 and five sales tax bills. Each of the bills has been marked with a 'T' to signify that they are not bills which impose taxation; The government also believes that the constitutional issues must be resolved once and for all, so that the parliament can focus on the substance, and not the form, of government initiatives. To allow the issue to be settled quickly, and without affecting the integrity of the budget package, one of the bills, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2) 1993, has been drafted as a test bill to facilitreatment tate a High Court challenge. This has been done by combining two minor rate increases involving different subjects of taxation. These measures do not affect revenue until after 1 July 1994. I turn now to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993, which contains the following measures: increases in the Medicare levy low income thresholds; removal of the concessional treatment that applies to the taxation of unused annual and long service leave; changes in the taxation treatment of excess domestic travel allowances and expenses and certain non-deductible expenses; denial of income tax deductions for car parking expenses for self-employed persons, and changes in the taxation treatment of credit unions. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. Medicare levy This bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the low income thresholds below which people will not be required to pay any levy. For 1993-94, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $12,688 and couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $21,366 will not be required to pay the levy. There will be no change to the provisions which increase the threshold for couples and sole parents by $2,100 for each dependent child or student. The estimated cost of the creased low income thresholds is $30 million in 1993-94, $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Unused annual leave and unused long service leave payments The bill will remove theÂ· concessional tax treatment that applies to lump sum payments of unused annual leave and unused long service leave made on termination of employment. Payments in respect of unused long service leave accrued on or after 18 August 1993 and payments in respect of unused annual leave made on or after 18 August 1978 will be taxed as normal income. However, there is no change to the tax of these payments if the taxpayer's termination of employment is as a consequence of bona fide redundancy or invalidity or is under an approved early retirement scheme; nor is the concessional tax treatment of long service leave accrued before 18 August 1993 affected. The proposed amendments ensure that the tax system does not discourage taxpayers from using their leave entitlements for their intended purpose. The estimated gain to the revenue is $80 million in 1993-94, $180 million in 1994-95, $165 million in 1995-96 and $180 million in 199697. Taxation of credit unions The bill will remove the exemption from income tax for income in the nature of interest received by. credit unions on loans made to their members and will allow credit unions to be taxed as cooperatives where they satisfy the requirements for that treatment. To give credit unions time to adjust to the new measures, there will be a phasing-in period. The measure will remove the competitive advantage credit unions enjoy as a result of the special tax treatment given to them, and is consistent with the government's general approach of ensuring. tax neutrality between business enterprises. The estimated gain to revenue is $25 million in 1995-96 and $30 million in 1996-97. Non-deductable expenses The income tax law will also be amended to allow deductions to emp:L.yers for expenses in- incurred in providing their employees with a range of benefits such as entertainment, club fees, leisure facilities, travel expenses of accompanying relatives, higher education contribution scheme payments and student financial supplement scheme payments. These expenses have previously not been deductable. Benefits of this nature, if provided to employees, are fringe benefits under the fringe benefits tax law. However, the taxable value of these benefits is reduced to the extent to which they are non-deductable to employers under the income tax law. This amendment, which will apply from 1 April 1994, will allow a deduction to employers for these expenses under the income tax law. In consequence, it will subject these benefits to a fringe benefits tax liability. The estimated gain to revenue is $435 million in 1994-95, $240 million in 1995-96 and $240 million in 1996-97. Excess domestic travel This bill will amend the fringe benefits tax law to create a new class of fringe benefit based on the amount of a travelling allowance received by an employee for travel in Australia which is in excess of a prescribed amount. The amount will be prescribed by regulation and will be set following consultations with interested parties. The income tax law will also be amended to disallow expenditure incurred by employees or self-employed persons on travel expenses-that is, accommodation, food, drink, and expenditure incidental to travel undertaken in Australia-which are in excess of the prescribed amount. These amendments will apply from 1 April 1994. The estimated gain to revenue is $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Car parking expenses for self-employed The bill will also amend the income tax law so that, from 1 July 1994, a tax deduction for the cost of car parking for persons other than employees will be denied in certain circumstances. This will place car parking by selfemployed persons on a comparable tax basis to car parking for employees. A deduction for car parking expenses incurred by self-employed persons will only be denied where certain conditions apply. The rules for determining the non-deductible amount of a car parking expense in this bill are similar to the rules applicable to employers in valuing a car parking fringe benefit. The estimated gain to revenue of this measure is $70 million in 1995-96 and $35 million in 1996-97. The bill will come into operation on the day on which it receives royal assent. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum being circulated to hon'ourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No.2) 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, and read a first time. Second Reading",64
93,Mr GEAR,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the second in the package of bills which replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill contains two of the taxation measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in the 1993-94 budget and which were previously passed by this House asÂ· part of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. These measures are: the increase in the rat,e of fringe benefits tax; and the change in the taxation treatment of friendly societies, including an increase in the rate of tax on their life insurance business to bring it into line with the rate of tax on similar business undertaken by life companies. This bill has been deliberately designed to facilitate a challenge in the High Court on the constitutional issues raised before the Senate committee that considered the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. It does this by combining two rate increases, for different subjects of taxation, in the same bill. The government's legal advisers believe that this bill is constitutional but the government considers that any uncertainty in this area must be resolved quickly. The measures in this bill will have no practical effect before the middle of next year, and will have only minimal revenue impacts. Therefore, there is time for the constitutional issues to be tested without affecting taxpayers. I turn now to a more detailed explanation of the two measures. FBT rate of tax This bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the current rate of fringe benefits tax from 48.25 per cent to 48.4 per cent. The increase will take effect from 1 April 1994 and will maintain the alignment of the FBT rate with the top marginal personal tax rate and Medicare levy rate. The increase reflects the increase in the Medicare levy rate, from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent, on 1 July 1993. The estimated gain to revenue is $9 million in 1994-95 and $8 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations The bill will change the taxation treatment of friendly societies and other registered organisations. It will phase out, over three years from the 1994-95 income year, the concessional tax rate for friendly societies in respect of their life insurance and certain other insurance business. As a consequence of that change, the bill will, from 1 July 1994, extend to friendly societies the same entitlement to deductions as is allowed to life insurance companies for the costs of getting in their life insurance premiums. Another change will increase, from 1 July 1995, the rebate available to holders of friendly society life policies who are assessed on bonuses. This increase is a consequence of the phasing out of the concessional tax rate. The estimated gain to revenue from these measures is $25 million in 1995-96 and $69 million in 1996-97. The bill will come into operation when it receives the royal assent. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No.3) 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, and read a first time. Second Reading",66
94,Mr GEAR,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the third in the package of bills which replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. It incorporates changes to the timing of the first stage of the tax cuts announced and legislated for in 1992, the deferral of the second round of those tax cuts, and the introduction of a low income rebate. I turn now to a more detailed explanation of the provisions. Personal tax cuts ' The amendments contained in the bill will change the timing for the commencement of the two stage reduction in the tax rates announced in One Nation on 26 February 1992. The first stage will now commence on 15 November 1993, 7 112 months earlier than scheduled. The bill provides that the second stage of tax cuts will commence at the beginning of a financial year to be fixed by regulation. Because the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 15 November 1993, the bill contains the new composite rate scales to apply for 1993-94 and the first stage rates for the 1994-95 and later income years. The new rates to apply from 15 November 1993 will benefit taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $20,700. The tax cuts will cost the revenue $1.55 billion this financial year. The ongoing cost to revenue of the first stage of the personal tax cuts is $2.9 billion in 1994-95 and $3.12 billion in 1995-96. Low income rebate The bill will also provide a rebate of up to $150 to taxpayers whose taxable income for 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $24,450. The new rebate will mainly assist those taxpayers who do not benefit from the One Nation tax cuts. Taxpayers with a taxableÂ· income of up to $20,700 will be entitled to a rebate of $150 in their assessments for the 1993-94 and later income years. The rebate will reduce at the rate of 4c in each dollar of taxable income in excess of $20,700 and completely phase out when taxable income reaches $24,450. The estimated revenue costs for this measure are $530 million in 1994-95, $515 million in 1995-96 and $500 million in 1996-97. This bill will not come into operation until the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993, and the five sales tax bills in this package, receive the royal assent. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. SALES TAX (CUSTOMS) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Gear, and read a first time. Second Reading",67
95,Mr GEAR,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the fourth in the package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-94 budget. The government does not accept that any of the bills in Â·this package imposes tax. Nevertheless, it has structured the sales tax bills so as to put the matter beyond challenge by those who would argue that an increase in a formal rate of tax is an imposition of tax. For constitutional reasons, sales tax is imposed by four acts. Those acts impose sales tax to the extent that it is: a duty of customs; a duty of excise; a tax on in situ swimming pools; a tax that is none of the above. This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (Customs) Act 1992. I now turn to the three sales tax changes covered by this bill, and the other sales tax bills in this package. The first change will increase all sales tax rates by one percentage point, with effect from 18 August 1993. This is expected to raise $435 million this year and $585 million in 1994-95. A further one percentage point increase for all sales tax rates will come into effect on 1 July 1995. The second change will increase the rates of sales tax on wine, also with effect from 18 August. Compared with beer and spirits, wine is lightly taxed. While it is presently subject to sales tax, it does not carry any excise. It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on wine with an alcoholic content of greater than 1.15 per cent from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. The rate of tax on low-alcohol wine, that is, wine with an alcoholic content of 1.15 per cent or less, is to increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. Some low-alcohol wine is currently taxable at 20 per cent and its rate of tax will increase to 21 per cent in line with the proposed increase for all sales tax rates. The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $70 million in 1993-94, $95 million in 1994-95, $105 million in 1995-96 and $110 million in 1996-97. The last sales tax change will vary the rate of tax applicable to luxury motor vehicles, also with effect from 18 August 1993. Luxury vehicles are currently taxable at 30 per cent on their entire wholesale value. The current sales tax treatment results in a substantial pricing distortion: the addition of $1 to the wholesale price of a passenger motor vehicle now priced at the threshold would increase the sales tax liability by $4,873. It is proposed to remove this distortion by applying a split rate of sales tax to luxury motor vehicles. Broadly, the ordinary rates of sales tax applicable to motor vehicles will apply up to the wholesale luxury threshold. A rate of 45 per cent will apply to that portion of the wholesale value over the lUXUry threshold. The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $5 million in 1993-94 and $10 million in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned.

100,Mr JOHNS,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I am going to close the remarks I started prior to dinner to end the second reading debate on these superannuation bills. I was making the point that there was a massive contradiction in the opposition's stance on superannuation to the extent that it was complaining that the level the superannuation guarantee charge had reached-which was between only three and five per cent of a worker's earnings-was insufficient to generate funds for income in retirement. That is quite correct, but that is not our policy. Our policy is that that level of charge should rise to nine per cent early next century, and perhaps beyond that. At that point, there would be sufficient funds put away so that workers might enjoy an income in retirement above and beyond what they would expect from today's pension. The massive contradiction of the opposition's argument is that had it been elected, it would have capped the SGC. That is what it said at the last election. Its new position is that it would like to cap the SGC if it is elected in 1996, at which time the SGC will be around six per cent. So I simply do not understand what its proposition is. I assume that it is arguing that should it be elected, it will put a c-p on the thing that drives this whole system-the superannuation guarantee charge, which is compulsorily driving money into superannuation and which is the essence of the whole system. Should the opposition cap it, it then has to devise another means by which money will be put into these funds. The traditional method is that we give some form of tax rebate so that the employee or the employer feels as though it is worth putting money into superannuation because of that tax rebate. What happens, though, is that a taxpayer has to spend money in order to create money, in order to get money to put into superannuation. So we ask the question: how much is it going to cost to induce money into superannuation under the opposition's policy? We do not know the answer; we just know it will be a heck of a lot. What is the use of spending a great deal of money if we probably do not lift the level of savings of the nation by way of superannuation funds? There is another problem with the alternative view: what sort of coverage do we get? There are a lot of people who will accept no inducement to save under a superannuation scheme and, therefore, will never be covered under superannuation. We have been going through that debate for 10 years. The government and the superannuation industry have decided, and well know, that we really need an element of compulsion here to drive the funds into superannuation. That is our stance. We won the last election. The SOC will be driven up to at least nine per cent early next century, which we think will be a sufficient amount to be put away on behalf of the workers. I want to return to other elements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill. The essence of the bill is that we acknowledge that although money is being compulsorily driven into the system, it will be managed in private hands by private fund managers or by any other means, but essentially by private individuals. We could not have .a system of regulation that did not put a very clear fence and guidelines around how private moneys are to be handled. So we have ensured that the central figure is a trustee, the person entrusted to make sure that superannuation funds in whatever sort of scheme are well managed and that the improvement of those funds is returned in time to the workers who invested in the funds. A point was made during the debate that the fear was that the trustees would be beholden to, I think, two or three sets of legislareading, tion under federal government acts. That simply is not true. In the SICS) Bill, what we have done is simply to transcribe trust lawalready existing trust law that will govern the behaviour of these people-codify it and write it down. This is perhaps the first time an effort has been made to make nice and clear theÂ· way in which we expect these people to act-the meaning of acting properly, carefully and prudently. They should make investment plans explicit, open and overt, and tell members of the funds how they are investing the money. We figure that the more people see how funds are being invested, the safer is the package of funds. But we do not suggest, as the opposition did in its contribution to the debate, how the funds are to be invested. We do not tell funds what are good or what are bad investments. We seek that they should be prudent in their investment, but we do not tell them how to invest. What we are asking them to do in this bill is to set out an investment strategy and then make clear to their members what the investment strategy is. If they do not get a rate of return that is satisfactory to members, then members will know that the government cannot cover them for unsatisfactory returns; that will be a matter for intelligent decision making by private fund managers and investors. However, if there is any fraud or theft by the management or trustee of funds, the government can step in and impose a levy so as to cover the moneys lost by fraud or theft. But, at the end of the day, we could not possibly guarantee those funds which sit in private superannuation schemes. That is not our intent. But we will certainly have a regime of rules and regulations that try as far as possible to ensure that sensible, prudent people make good investment decisions on behalf of the many millions of Australian workers who are putting their money into these funds for retirement purposes. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has moved an amendment to the motion that the SICS) Bill be read a second time, which reads: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second the House calls on the Government to ensure that member representatives on the boards of trustees of employer-sponsored funds must be elected by direct ballot of fund members. We do not prescribe how people will be chosen to be member representatives on the board of trustees, and it is better that we do not. It would be quite impractical if we were to prescribe too closely. In some cases the employer representative or the employee representative will be a trade union member; in other cases they will not. But, in a way, that whole debate is many years out of date. What is happening today in the management of, say, big industry funds is that the bosses' representatives and the workers' representatives are jointly elected to manage the funds. We are not in a state where we are at war with each other. Both sides of the fence are agreeing to manage the funds of the workers. I met with members of the Queensland Confederation of Industry late last week. They were telling me about the Sun superannuation fund, which covers several hundred thousand workers in Queensland. I think it is the third or the fifth largest such industry fund in Australia. The people who happily sit on the board of that fund, who happily cohabit, are the thcee principals of the Queensland Confederation of Industry-I think it is the president, the chief executive officer and the vicepresident. The employee representatives are the secretary of the Queensland branch of the ACTU, the secretary of the AWU, which is the largest union in Queensland, and the secretary of the metal workers union, which is probably the second largest union in Queensland. Far from there being any sort of suspicion about having union nominated representatives on boards of trustees, in practice-throughout Australia, not just in Queensland-we have representatives from both sides happily sitting down together to manage the funds that are in private hands and which will eventually flow to workers for their retirement. The language of the opposition on this point is years out of date. The reason why the language is out of date is that the criticisms are out of date. old hat. We solved this one a long time ago. A number of honourable members-again, on the opposite side-raised questions about clause 62. Clause 62 is the means by which the government says to any person owning a business that it does not want that person to invest the assets of his or her business or other such assets in the superannuation fund. The government wants any moneys to be invested in the fund to be for genuine retirement purposes; not for the purpose of picking up a nice little tax gain on the way through, or a means of propping up the business. The government wants people to separate the interests of their business from the interests of the superannuation fund. Superannuation funds are for retirement income generating purposes alone. The Occupational Superannuation Standards Act has been in place for some years and it specifies a sole purpose test: namely, that any moneys or assets placed into a fund must have the sole purpose of generating an income on retirement. However, we have found that the sole purpose test has been so variously interpreted by the courts that it does not always work. It has not been as tight as the government would have wished, so we have written a new clause-clause 62-into this new act to make it absolutely explicit that in all circumstances, whatever fancy devise might be thought up, a contribution to a super fund can only be delivered in cash. In other words, no business person in Australia can be under any doubt as to the intention of clause 62, which is to separate business interests from superannuation fund",70
101,Mr TUCKEY,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,Why would you do that?,72
102,Mr JOHNS,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Because if the business goes broke, we do not want the fund to go broke. It is so fundamentally important that funds for retirement generate an income in retirement. We would have happily stayed with a pension system, as we have known it in this country since about 1909, I suppose, but for the fact, as we have heard a thousand times over, that with the number of people moving into retirement over the next 20 or 30 years It is it is too much to ask of future taxpayers to fund the future pensioners. We have really had to bring the system forward so that each of us will have to contribute now to our own retirement. That is the argument, and everyone in Australia knows it, except for the opposition. Once that argument is accepted, we then have to ensure that the primary purpose of pension funds is maintained so that they are not used for any purpose other than to generate retirement income. From the government's point of view then, clause 62 is unremarkable and should not be amended. I have already argued the question of the voluntary versus compulsory nature of contributions. We favour a compulsory contribution scheme because the money will not flow otherwise. But we are certainly keen to encourage people who, in addition to the compulsory contribution, wish to make their own personal contributions in order to build up their fund in retirement. That is, however, a matter for themMr Rocher-Well, how are you going to encourage it?",72
103,Mr JOHNS,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,It is a question for the individual as to what further moneys he or she puts in.,73
104,Mr TUCKEY,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,You've cut out their tax benefit.,73
105,Mr GEAR,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,Not for the self-employed.,73
106,Mr JOHNS,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"That is easy. The self-employed still get a generous tax concession. More importantly, at a given: level of taxpayer assistance, there cannot be a write-off of personal superannuation and a write-off of the compulsory part of the contribution. We prefer the compulsory part because it works. The opposition's alternative would not. It would be a waste of dough and that would be a tragedy. There was some debate about what the opposition alleges to be the disproportionate costs to small funds by the introduction of this legislation, and the various ways in which we seek to administer and supervise the funds. The fifth report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation clearly showed that the current costs of regulating small funds, from the government's perspective, is not borne by those small funds. In other words, there is an implicit subsidy to small funds at present-not the reverse, as the opposition has suggested. Further, there is no evidence to suggest that small fund members are particularly poor or low income earners. In fact, it is highly likely that members in small funds are the better off members of the community. There is general agreement that prudential supervision of superannuation needs strengthening. The government and the ISC have consulted substantially with the industry on the developthe ment of this legislation. This feeling of cooperation has been echoed in recent press reports and at the public hearings into the bills conducted by the Senate select committee. We believe we have this balance right. For small funds there are special concessions. In particular, the disclosure requirements are substantially relaxed. The prudential rules, for example-the covenant for trustees to act honestly-impose costs only on the rogues, not the honest dealers. Those are all the remarks I wish to make on the bill at this stage. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. In Committee Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2.

107,Mr ROCHER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"Curtin) (8.50 p.m.) Because it might facilitate the movement of these superannuation bills through committee, I take this opportunity to discuss this clause and probably subsequent clauses to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill. It is up to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) whether I am allowed to do that, but it might help circumvent proceedings somewhat. If you feel I have gone too far in any particular instance, I am sure you will interrupt. In his second readingÂ· defence, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer was quite unique in his attributions to the coalition. He referred to capping the SGCs and he came to the conclusion that somehow, by some tortuous logic, coalition policy three years hence would have some dire consequences for superannuants and potential beneficiaries covered by these funds as a result of something that we might propose to do. It was a case of parliamentary secretary building up a straw man and knocking him down, because we said nothing in our policy prior to the previous election or during this debate which could lead him to reasonably arrive at such a conclusion. So the parliamentary secretary was immediately on the defensive. The parliamentary secretary read out my second reading amendment, but he forgot the opening words which were, in effect, for all seven bills, that not denying the bills a second reading-and therefore in the jargon of this place indicating that we were not going to oppose the measures-somehow we were out to unreasonably criticise the government and decisions it has taken in arriving at the situation that is reflected in these bills. The amendment points out that it is possible, and likely, that trade union representatives-or nominees of trade unions-will become the representatives of all employees on the boards of trustees of the relevant funds. The parliamentary secretary went on to claim that there was some merit in that although it was not obligatory. The effect of the government proposition will be that if a trade union nominates. a person to be the employee representative on a trust he will be appointed. Failing that-if it should ever happen-perhaps some other employee, not the nominee of the trade union, may gain the ascendancy. But that will not be the rule; that will be the exception. One could bet one's life that the trade unions will not let that go by default. The parliamentary secretary complained that the opposition was not wedded to compulsion. We certainly are not. There are other ways of going about getting people to provide for their own retirement, and we are unashamedly of that mind. It is only a Labor government that believes in compulsion. It believes in the big stick, not the carrot. But the' parliamentary secretary seemed to justify that particular attraction. to compulsion by the fact that the government won the last election. That is strange logic, but I guess it is not entirely unexpected. I do not remember superannuaHon looming large during the last election. I do remember one of the main issues being income tax cuts and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying that they are enshrined in l-aw, law, whereas in fact we know that it came to mean l-a-w, lie and win. That was an issue in the last elecHon, but there was nothing about superannuation. It is nonsense to imply by this strange twist of the imagination that the government somehow has a mandate to do what it proposes to do tonight. The truth is that the opposition is not while opposed to the legislation, given Labor's obsession to making compulsory superannuation the vehicle for retirement incomes when Australians get to that ripe old age where they must rely on the fruits of their labour. We think there are better ways of doing it. Through the parliamentary secretary, the government justifies codifying the law. Perhaps it is not important, but what the parliamentary secretary omitted to point out is that there is law there now, except that in many cases it is common law. He proposes to substitute statutory law. The precedents that go to make up the common law as it is presently understood and observed are there for all time. In a way, I am glad that the parliamentary secretary says he is not wedded to the common law. He might apply that principle when it comes to Mabo, and he will not enter the defence that the decision of the High Court is somehow sacrosanct because it is common law. We all know that common law is not sacrosanct and that this parliament can legislate to replace common law with statute law. That is a very fine argument, and I hope that the parliamentary secretary is around when the Mabo debate comes on because he will not be relying on the fact that the High Court's decision in that case is common law. The parliamentary secretary went on to talk about how the funds will not be told how to invest their accumulated takings from potential retirees and superannuants. Perhaps that is correct, but again he omitted a very important factor that the funds must have a written investment strategy and that that investment strategy will be approved by the appropriate authority and form part of the trust deed. It is a covenant attached to the trust deed. Mr Johns-Reds under the bed.",73
108,Mr ROCHER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"If the parliamentary secretary goes out and practises corporate law and tells me that something attached to a prospectus under corporations law is somehow not obliging the corporation concerned to observe what is involved, he believes in fairies. I do not mind the parliamentary secretary entering the argument, but he should tell the whole story. ' In one context, the parliamentary secretary said in his second reading defence, 'We have solved these 'problems long ago'. In effect, they were the words he used. If he has solved all the problems inÂ· relation to superannuation, there will be no further legislation during the life of this parliament-and pigs might fly! If he solved all the problems a long time ago, why does the government need seven amendments to legislation which was first brought into this parliament in September last year and only lapsed because of the proroguing of the parliament? If the government solved all these problems a long time ago, why does it need to introduce two further amendments and sundry mechanical amendments to the legislation? The government did not solve anything a long time ago, and it is a long way short of solving it right now. Let us introduce a little bit of honesty into this. The l-a-w technique does not apply in this chamber. I am not talking about the l-aw, law, technique, but the other one I mentioned earlier. If the parliamentary secretary wants to become defensive he,may do so, but he should tell the whole story. I think my time is about to expire. I might have another go in a minute.",74

Division 3-Regulations may make other transitional provisions Regulations may make other transitional provisions ""374. The regulations may make provisions, not inconsistent with Division 2, relating to the transition to the scheme provided for in this Act."". A fundamental principle of this legislation is that a superannuation fund should be in the control of a single party, the trustees, who take full responsibilities for the fund. The public offer funds, which apparently are presently subject to. the Corporations Law, have been required to have responsibility split between two parties, a management company which effectively runs the fund and a trustee company which has much more of a background role acting as a supervisor or a custodian. The government does not propose to impose a mandatory change from the existing twoparty structure for these funds. However, these funds should be encouraged to change to a one-party structure, and the legislation facilitates such a change. In order to encourage these funds to change, they will not be able to accept new business while they retain the existing two-party structure, although they will be able to carry on accepting contributions from existing members and to accept new members who are employees of existing employer sponsors. If either the trustee company or the mandoes not agement company ceases to hold office for any reason, such as a vote of members under the existing trustee provisions, then the remaining party will take over the functions of both trustee and management company. The legislation provides that either party, the trustee company or the management company, may retire in favour of the other, who will then take over the functions of both trustee and management company. Appropriate notices will have to be given to all members at least one month before the change occurs. An important feature of these amendments is that they allow a grandfathering of existing arrangements, subject to not being able to accept new business,where the members, the trustee company and the management company, all wish to continue. While the arrangement is grandfathered, it will be subject to the provisions of SIS applied appropriately to one or both of the trustee company and the management company. In addition, it will be subject to a number of provisions closely reflecting the existing provisions of the Corporations Law, particularly those dealing with the relationship between the 'trustee company and the management company. Clause 62, - Acquisition of assets from members', prohibits trustees from purchasing assets from members or from accepting in specie contributions from members. A prohibition on such actions has been incorporated in the occupational superannuation standards regulations, with effect from 30 June 1993. The government indicated an intention to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act to allow retrospective regulations to be made to prohibit the acquisition of assets from 27 May 1993. After further consideration the government has decided that it is not necessary to proceed with such an amendment.",75
114,Mr ROCHER,PROVIDED FOR IN THIS ACT,"Curtin) (9.05 p.m.}-The mechanisms by which the committee requires the legislation'to be dealt with highlighted an important point and reinforced that which' I 'made a little while ago-that is, that it is strange indeed that the government needs the number of amendments we now have to consider when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) has claimed that his government solved problems in relation to superannuation, to use his words, 'a long time ago'. For this bill alone, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill 1993, we have 92 amendments. That is just for the first of seven bills. That sits passing strange with the parliayears. mentary secretary's claim that everything has been under control for a long time. It is more than curious that he would say that in the certain knowledge that, despite the 20 or 30 bills regulating or in some way affecting superannuation in the life of successive Labor governments since 1983, the government has not been able to get it right. It seems very optimistic indeed to think that we will not have more legislation in the very near future, and indeed an examination of the legislation wO,uld bear that out. The government still has not resolved important issues. So who listening could possibly believe that the government has solved problems associated with superannuation a long time ago, as the parliamentary secretary just spuriously claimed? In his response to the second reading debate, the parliamentary secretary showed that he did not listen and that obviously he was relying on secondor third-hand advice, and it seems that at least some of that was not accurate. In those circumstances, if he is charged with the conduct of the legislation through the chamber and cannot be in attendance, I would simply say, in the spirit of cooperation, that he should not presume to tell the chamber what was said during the second reading debate-and it should be made clear in these committee proceedings. One thing he has said that I want to take issue with is that the government intends to encourage to take out extra cover those people who obviously, through their employer, do not have sufficient funds invested in a fund to cover their total needs in retirement. Apart from the narrow category of self-employed people, he did not go on to say how such people would be encouraged. He has not examined, in public anyway and certainly not in committee, the possibility that sooner or later employees must also make a contribution out of their earnings to get the present up to six per cent compulsory levy topped up to something like that which is necessary to provide adequate retirement income. It is commonly believed that one needs something like 12 per cent to 14 per cent of one's income invested in a superannuation fund to be able to accrue a reasonable retirement income-and that is, over a period of 40 The six per cent compulsory levy, which Labor is wedded to, as anyone can see goes only a short way towards the total need. We know that the government contemplates increasing the compulsory level-but who knows to what-thereby increasing the cost of employment, but it has not tackled, publicly anyway, the possibility that workers might have to contribute something out of their after tax income, as do most people contributing to funds which existed prior to and outside those catering for the six per cent levy. The matter is left up in the air. The parliamentary secretary, in a throwaway line, says that he will encourage people to take out extra cover to meet their total requirements. But he does not say how; he does not embellish-nor, from what we can gather, does he or his government have any idea how to go about it. Will they resort to the personal urging of our spaced-out Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)? Will they rely on the persuasiveness of our stressed-out Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? Who is going to believe those guys? How will, they tackle the problem seriously? We would have welcomed some indication on that, particularly if we need 92 amendments to this bill alone. The legislation was brought into the House before parliament was prorogued last year. 1\vo major amendments were made only a couple of weeks ago. We would have thought they would give us some indication as to how they would deal with the total picture. But there is no such indication or undertaking by those in government of how, in a reasonable way and hopefully without increasing the total cost of employmentwhich already exceeds that which enables us to be competitive with those against whom we trade-they will come to grips with the problem of getting the total contributions, employer or employee, up to the necessary level. We do not accept the personal assurances of the parliamentary secretary or the government that they will encourage potential superannuants to take out extra cover. That is simply not good enough, given the record of this government with its litany of lies during the last election campaign. The coalition will not cop that. I do not think the Australian people will either-but we will see. I am disappointed that if we need 92 clauses to amend legislation introduced as recently as a couple of weeks ago, following legislation which was introduced towards the end of the last parliament, the government could not have addressed serious issues. Certainly, members of the government should not be claiming, as the parliamentary secretary did in his defence of the second reading, that they sorted things. out a long time ago in connection with superannuation. They would not need all these amendments if they had. Each of the seven bills is to be amended comprehensively; although we are discussing only the first one. The full effect of those amendments, particularly the 92 to the bill under discussion, will be examined very closely by my colleague Senator Watson and the Senate committee which he chairs. We have been favoured with this information for relatively few hours. There is no way of knowing whether the parliamentary secretary's justifications for I move: the amendments are accurate. Given some of the things he said earlier, we might reasonably have doubts. But even if we have no reason for doubt, we are in no position to say with any certainty that these amendments are acceptable. We say however that they are the proper subject of examination by Senator Watson's committee. Amendments agreed to. Remainder of bill, as amended, agreed to.

""(2) Subject to subsection (3) and section 15, a person may make a complaint (other than an excluded complaint) to the Tribunal, that the decision: (a) was in excess of the powers of the trustee; or (b) was an improper exercise of the powers of the trustee; or (c) is unfair or unreasonable. ""(3) If a person has been given a written notice by the trustee of a fund setting out: (a) the trustee's decision in relation to the person's objection to the payment of a benefit; and (b) the prescribed period within which the person must complain to the Tribunal about the decision; the person may only make a complaint to the Tribunal within that period.

I draw particular attention to the provisions of clause 14 which go to the question of trustees. The reason we have amended this clause is that a trustee is protected from the possibility of having to pay a benefit twice if the payment of a benefit is withheld until the question of who should receive it is resolved. The new clause, particularly subclauses 3 and 4, will remove the potential problem of a trustee withholding payment of a benefit indefinitely while waiting to see whether a potential beneficiary will lodge a complaint with the tribunal. It is also important that a potential complainant is aware of the time frame within which he or she should refer the matter to the complaints tribunal. The amendments to subclause 14.1 make it clear that the tribunal is able to consider complaints relating to a trustee's decision made before the commencement of the act. Subclause 14.5 provides that regulations may be made which preclude the tribunal from dealing with an aspect of a complaint. Amendments to this subclause are included to give greater flexibility to ma-ters that should not be examined by the tribunal. For example, the wording would permit a regulation to be made to exclude only the actual interpretation of medical evidence from the review of the tribunal while allowing all other aspects of a payment on the grounds of disability to be considered. The note at the bottom of clause 14 was amended to include a reference to the definition of excluded subject matter in clause 3.2. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

I draw attention to a number of points here. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966 in respect of the treatment of superannuation benefits for persons who have become bankrupt. The major changes are to exclude from the divisible property of a bankrupt proceeds of policies of life assurance or endowment assurance on the life of a bankrupt or the bankrupt's spouse and the interest of the bankrupt in, or payments received from, a regulated superannuation fund or approved deposit fund. The exceptions to this are where the total value of the bankrupt's property that relates to superannuation benefits and life assurance policies exceeds $800,000. Any amount in excess of $800,000 is available for creditors. The figure of $800,000 equates to the pension reasonable benefit limit and is to be indexed annually. A provision is to be inserted in the Bankruptcy Act that will void any provision in governing rules that has the effect of cancelling, forfeiting, reducing or qualifying the beneficial interest of a member of a superannuation fund or approved deposit fund where the member becomes bankrupt, commits an act of bankruptcy, or executes a deed of assignment or deed of arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act. This provision will apply to all governing rules, including those made 5 of that before this legislation is passed. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

117,Mr CAMPBELL,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY," It is a pleasure to speak in the budget debate because, traditionally, one has a wideranging brief to talk on all aspects of the budget and the economy as one sees it. It is an opportunity which allays for some time that feeling of impotence that anyone who has been on the back bench for any length of time - except the most stout-hearted, addlebrained or egocentric-gets. In talking on Appropriation Bill (No.1), I intend to move sideways in time to a land that might have been. I think everyone recognises that the deficit is a crushing problem for Australia. There are reasons for the growth in the deficit-declining commodity prices being the most obvious and the growth in imports being the most insidious. It seems self-evident that no matter what a government does or says it cannot come to grips with this problem by taxation. It simply cannot tax people enough; it cannot raise enough revenue through taxation to address the deficit, nor can it cut government expenditure enough to do this. We need a multipronged attack, and that requires the implementation of intelligent industry policy. It is to that I wish to address myself tonight. ,What is an industry policy? An industry policy is, in my view, a policy which best facilitates the operation of is. In. looking at industries, I think we have to ask ourselves what sorts of industries Australia has or should have. Clearly, there are two sortS. There are industries where we have a natural advantage, such as mining and woolAustralia's gre'at and unique product, where we should be encouraging all forms of downstream processing and value adding. There are, of course, many others. The other sort are strategic industries, industries that Australia would need if the rest of the world were to catch fire; industries where we should have a level of competence that would see us selfsufficient. Those industries may need nurturing in the early days, and I do not resile from the need for tariffs to achieve this. It is very common to hear people say today that we ca.,nnot pick winners. The truth is that every sucoessful country in the world has picked winners. Japan has had a startlingly good record at this. We are told by the economic boffins that Japan has simply worked harder than we have. This is, of course, arrant nonsense. The Japanese did pick winners; however, they did a lot more than this. It was not just a matter of picking winners. Japan's whole economy was geared to supporting growing industries, so for many years it had very strong controls on capital outflow. There was nowhere overseas that the Japanese could send their money. After the war, had that facility been there, Japanese capital would have fled Japan to countries that looked more prosperous and looked as though they had more potential. Japan also had a ban on capital inflow. The Japanese did not want foreign money coming in and picking up their industries which were, in those days, virtually on their knees. It wanted to retain control-a very important facet. The Japanese also required joint venturers to bring any capital into the country with them. They did not allow them to come into the country and then raise the capital on their capital markets. These are initiatives which I believe Australia should adopt, and adopt quickly. None of them would contravene GATT and all would be beneficial to the establishment of industry in this country because it would make available that pool of industry in Australcapital funds. We have spoken tonight about superannuation. That is another source of capital funds. It seems to me that the problem with superannuation is that the responsibility of banks is clearly to bank shareholders, not to the nation. Superannuation funds run by banks will be designed to maximise returns to their shareholders and, of necessity, will be short term. The responsibility of superannuation funds is to their members, not to the nation, and their performance will be exactly the same: they will operate to maximise the benefits to those to whom they are responsible. There is a difference with the Singapore fund, and it is often quoted in this place. But that is not within Australia's grasp. We do not have the enormous national coherence which Singapore has. The state is omnipotent in Singapore and people will put up with conditions that we in this nation would not and, I hope, will not put up with. The better model I think is probably the British pension fund which has been operating very successfully for many years., This fund collects pensions through the taxation system and puts in a safety net for people to make provision for themselve"" beyond that. I believe that system should have been given much more consideration rather than the enormous free kick we have given to the superannuation funds. When we look at these industries that Australia needs it is clear that we must have Australian control-not so much ownership, but control. Australia must control the technology. Without that, we will always be at the mercy of foreign countries. Last month in Melbourne a seminar was held at which people discussed the automotive industry. It was said that by the year 2000 motor cars would contain between five and seven kilograms of magnesium. Magnesium is very difficult to cast; it tends to combust the presence of air, so it has to be cast in inert gases. This seminar was attended by the very large companies of Australia-Toyota, Ford and General Motors-and it was their view that this technology is far too difficult for Australia and would have to be done overseas because the 15 per cent tariff would not be enough to warrant embarking upon this very risky technology. It calls into play the future of the Australian car industry. It is an industry which is now totally foreign controlled. It seems to me that, no matter what we do with the Button car plan, technology will overtake us. Already the next generation of cars is being fitted with plastic windscreens. We have no technology in Australia for hardfacing plastic, although we have the know how to do it. I return to magnesium because I think it is a very important issue. A Mr Newman attended that conference. Mr Newman is now 72 years old. He had with him castings that he had done in 1938. He had gravity die-cast them in 1938, a process which he was told was impossible. Having heard these captains of industry, he got up and said, 'This is what I produced in 1938. If you want to do it, if you have the will to do it, there is a way'. I think there is a very clear message for Australia there. For too long we have relied heavily on overseas people. It is what I call a cargo cult, the latest manifestation being the Olympic games. Once again we have the view that somebody from overseas will come over here and save us by giving us the Olympic games. It is true that the Los Angeles games made a profit, but Barcelona is now in the grip of recession following the Olympic games and the debt with which it was left. The reality is that the games will be inherently more profitable in the United States because there is a larger population. It happens to be in the time zone of the greatest population, and television will pay prime rates for the coverage which it simply will not pay for in out-of-kilter time zones. I think that people who believe there is a bonanza for Australia in the Olympic games in are very much mistaken. Had I had the chance to do so today, I would have asked the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) whether it would be possible to enact legislation to make sure that the debt following the Olympic games is borne by the people of Sydney, not by the people of Australia. I mention this as a manifestation of a cargo cult, that somebody will come and save us. We see another manifestation of this in the multifunction polis in South Australia,. that somebody will come and save us. In this case the lovely Japanese will come and give us the technology. The reality is that this will not happen. If Australia is to be saved-and make no mistake, this country is in grave dangerwe must save ourselves. We can save ourselves. The industry policy is the way forward. No matter what any politician, or anyone else for that matter, says, unless we re-establish a manufacturing industry in Australia to replace imports there will be no jobs; there will simply not be enough jobs for our children. Popula,tion growth alone in Australia requires 100,000 jobs a year just to keep even, and on top of - hat there is the impact of immigration. To maintain immigration in the face of this situation, in my view, is reprehensible. It occurs because governments not only do not listen to the will of the people but also actively conspire to confound it. I was appalled when former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and one of those wimp Liberals from the other side, Ian Macphee, congratulated each other at a conference. With the ACTU they have. been able to conspire against the Australian people to keep immigration off the agenda. I think it is a disgrace which ought to be exposed. It is an issue will have to face. Contrary to what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might think, the big issues facing this country are not Mabo and the republic; they are jobs, jobs and jobs. The issues which the public wants to discuss are immigration and multiculturalism. I mention them in the context of this budget because they are absolutely vital to the development of a rational industry policy. An industry policy, of course, is many fac,eted. We must also look at industrial relations. One of the interesting new industries developthere ing in Australia is along the Kwinana strip where we are building high-speed aluminium boats. Australia has a third of the world's market in high-speed aluminium boats: We have the top third, the most expensive third. We build the best products; we are the setters for the world. That industry is doing extremely well. Along the Kwinana strip we find people are all being paid well above award rates. There is guaranteed employment sell for apprentices. There are as many apprentices as could possibly be handled, which is quite unusual in industry today, and they work plenty of overtime. However, unions are not to be found in that area. The people are simply not unionised; the unions feel they have nothing to offer Â·them. If I were a union organiser I would be down there talking to workers and management on until how unions could work to assist those people. If I were a union .Org-niser I would be paigning very hard to make sure we did not continue the futile and foolish phasing down of the ship bounty. But it is not my job here tonight to tell the unions what to do. I believe that in Australia vision splendid to unite this country, something that the whole nation can rally around; People talk about the Snowy Mountains scheme. The reality is, of course, that if were faced with that situation today we would not build a Snowy Mountains scheme. It is, in terms of electricity, greatly inefficient certainly not very environmentally friendly. is interesting to reflect that as much power as happen. can be generated by the Snowy Mountains scheme can be generated by covering half of we Lake Eucumbene with silicon solar cells. But we do need something. I suggest that in Australia we should look to shale oil. In Queensland we have shale oil resources in great excess, far greater than our proven oil resources. Shale oil is economically viable at about $23 a barrel, and it is viable because of Australian technology-the investment we have made in that technology and the success the co't:lpanies involved have had in developing a continuous process rather than the Bass process that preceded it. Were we to convert our demand for oil into shale oil, would be a massive increase in employment. It is much more labour intensive than the existing method of getting our oil. There would be an enormous boost to engineering as we constructed the plants necessary to produce that oil. When we were self-sufficient pacein shale oil we would have a very large resource of a highly exportable commodity. It would not matter what the demand was for oil in the world, Australia would always its .oil because it has a quality product, it is seen as a fair trader and people would buy from us in preference to other countries. The value of our oil would certainly wipe out the growth in the current account deficit and make inroads into reducing it. I believe that the nation should look very seriously at this. This government is guaranteeing t-at there will be no excise on shale oil 2005. If it requires an abolition of excise after that, it should grasp this willingly. The camgrowth in employment and the tax paid by pay-as-you-eam taxpayers, both directly and indirectly, would be more beneficial than the excise. In the last election the Liberal Party was going to do away with excise for no apparent reason. I think that would have been we must have a a tremendous waste. If we did this, I believe that we could unite the whole country and we could rebuild this we nation on the only sound basis: that of selfhelp. I can tell the people of Australia now that there is no benign godfather, there is no and cargo cult and no other nation is going to It save us. Unless we do it ourselves, it will not Wool is in many ways still Australia's premium product. It is not the largest earner today; it has been eclipsed by minerals. Wool is the largest small business in Australia. It provides jobs right across the nation, especialshould ly in country towns. It could provide many more jobs if we were to value add our product, our unique Australian wool. There is no doubt that Australian wool is unique. I have raised this issue in this House and in forums in my own party. I think it is high time that we put an immediate b-n on the export of all merino genetic material. There are only two basic characteristics in our wool: the first is the coefficient of fibre diameter-our wool tends to be much more consistent; and the second is the lack of black fibre. Other nations can produce the other qualities of our merino wool but often not altogether. If we were to sell our wool as tops we would increase the value of that three times. It would become once more our major product. If the wool growers could retain control of their wool until it was sold as tops the benefits would accrue to them. It is heartening to know that recently, under this government for the first time in the 150 years of the wool trade, an Australian company, Austops, was able to lay the foundations for its tops making plant at Parkes. This plant is unique because it is a custom plant. It will enable growers to retain control of their wool, unlike other people who have exploited our wool growers by buying their greasy wool cheap and getting the benefit of the premiums that attach to tops. We should remember that wool is traded internationally as tops, not as greasy wool. In Parkes we are embarking on an adventure that will reap massive rewards for Australia. I certainly compliment the foresight of this government. I was surprised to find that the opposition is not supporting this initiative, because it will prove to be a very good investment for the Australian taxpayer. I reiterate that industry policy is the most important thing that any government can undertake in this country. Unless we get a rational industry policy that sees the manufacturing industry re-established in this country there is no future for us. This is something that only we can do. It will not be done for us by overseas countries. It is important that it is not done by overseas countries because we keep control of our industries.",96
118,Mr NEHL,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"I happen to be renowned for saying that the 'p' in politics stands for people. This government has become renowned, following what it said in the election campaign and what it has done on this budget, for demonstrating that the ']' in Labor stands for lies. When government members talk about the budget they talk about a budget of equity and fairness. What a joke that is! ACOSS said this about the budget: ... but the tax changes are deeply disappointing and will hurt low income people'. There is no doubt about that. This budget has three basic ,outcomes. The first outcome is that it increases costs for big business and small business, for farmers and fishermen, for corner stores, plumbers and builders, for mechanics and supermarkets and for every family. The second outcome is that it hurts the poor more than the rich. This is from a Labor government-the working man's party. It started off with an extra $2 a week for low income earners. What a .big deal that was! It has now increased it to $3 a week-about $150 a year. That is still less than the costs will go up for low income earners because the hidden tax rises are there in everything they buy. I would like to refer briefly to a paper put out by Dr Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales which shows the results for a number of income areas in the 1994 budget mark 2 at that stage, and all prices and values for 1992-93. The first example is of a family of two adults with children-one adult working-and a household income of $27,000. With no allowance for. bracket creep, that family will be $2.74 a week worse off under this Labor budget. With allowance for bracket creep up to 1996-97, that family will be $12.15 a week worse off. This is supposedly a Labor government, a government for the workers. The next example is of a family of two adults who are both working and with children and a household income of $40,000 a year. They are neutral; they are not worse off. Compare that with the lower income family which will be $2.74 a week worse off. With allowance for bracket creep up to 1996-97, this family will be $12.22 a week worse off. The final example is of two adults who are both working and with no children and a household income of $60,000 a year. Compared with the first example where the lower income family will be $2.74 a week worse off, this family will be better off by $6.15 a week. This is supposed to be a government to look after the low income people. With bracket creep, the family with an income of $60,000 will be $13.08 a week worse off by 1996-97. The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission stated: The Commission is astonished that as we approach the International Year of the Family the government has taken the decision to introduce regressive measures in the Budget. The taxation in the budget is certainly regressive. The third outcome is that, in spite of the trumpetings of the government, there are no new jobs in this budget-not one new job. In a country with one million unemployed there is a lot more training still to be done and we will continue to go down the road of being the country with the best trained unemployed work force in the world. I did say that there are three outcomes, but actually there is a fourth. I call this one the Clinton gift. The Labor government has reduced company taxation to 33 percent. It thinks that will help business employ people. The government does not understand the basic point: to help businesses they have got to be made more profitable, their costs have to be lowered and taxation must not be increased. This is what the government has done-it has increased taxation on their inputs. It is no big deal to reduce income tax for companies because first they have to make a profit. Mr Vaile-They have to make a profit first.",100
119,Mr NEHL,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"They have to make a profit first, as my colleague says. This is why I refer to it as the Clinton gift: at the moment, we are going to charge 33 per cent company tax on American companies. On 30 June 1991, investment in Australia by United States entities was $A54.237 billion. In 1990-91 the investment income on that was $A3.866 billion. It is rather interesting that with a 33 per cent tax rate, that will amount to taxation of $A1.276 billion. One might say that is fine, but just think of one thing: American corporate taxation law says that where American corporations overseas pay less tax than they would pay at home, they make up the difference at home. The tax rate is basically 36 per cent. That means that American corporations in Australia will be paying $A1.276 billion here, but at 36 per cent, which is their home rate, it will be $A1.392 billion. The difference is $A116 million. The upshot of this budget that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have introduced is that Bill Clinton and the American government, the American taxpayer, will be the beneficiaries of a $116 million windfall because of our corporate taxation rate. I think that is absolutely amazing. That is why I say that this budget has a fourth outcome: the Clinton gift of $116 million of potential Australian taxation money because we have ill-advisedly reduced the corporate taxation rate. It is a bad budget; it is a budget of betrayal. Of course, which budget are we talking about? As I talk tonight, eight new tax bills have been introduced. Who knows; we may end up with more budgets than bids for pay TV. It is a bad budget; it is a budget of mistakes. There are so many mistakes; they are not all known yet. I am convinced they will come creeping out of the woodwork for months to come. One of those mistakes was the removal of eye tests from Medicare. At least the government got that right; it is bringing it back in and maintaining Medicare eligibility. I would like to thank all of those people in my electorate and around Australia who got off their bottoms, got stuck into it and helped force the government backdown-a very good example of people power in action. The government has made more mistakes in this budget. One of those in particular .relates to fuel. Before I talk about that in detail, I would like to quote a statement from the Council on the Ageing: The Budget contained regressive measures, particularly the increase in petrol excise, which would pensioners. This Budget is marked by a meanness and emphasises the lack of care to pensioners and low income older people. That is a statement of fact. That is a statement of truth. What a mistake the fuel tax was. Originally it was going to be 5c a litre for diesel fuel and 5c a litre for unleaded fuel by August 1994. Of course, for leaded fuel, the increase was going to be lOt a litre by February 1995. The government has reduced the leaded fuel increase, but that is the only change it has made. People should not be misled into thinking the government has taken away the increases in fuel excise. The only change is to reduce the increase in the price of unleaded fuel from lOc to 7c a litre. As the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Organisation said: Many older people rely on cars which cannot use unleaded fuel. This decision although good for the environment leaves those least able to pay the price bearing' the cost. In spite of all the trumpeting, those costs are still there. There is still an extra cost to everyone. It is still unfair to low income earners; it is still unfair to those who cannot afford a new car-the pensioners, the unemployed, the students, the low income workers. I quote from a statement by the Salvation Army: Proposed rises in wholesale sales tax will affect numerous items, even some basic grocery items. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you, the Salvation Army and everybody else in Australia: not only some grocery items, but every grocery item in Australia in every store, in every supermarket, will go up, if not because of sales tax, because of petrol excise and sales tax on the means of transport. The extra cost of transport will mean that everything will go up: milk and meat, cheese and chops, tyres and tissues; every item in every supermarket, every clothing store, every petrol station, every pub and every club. There will be endless price rises. The Brotherhood of St Laurence said: . . . the new taxes on petrol and other goods will affect low income earners far more. That is true, too. Of course, every employee, every worker, will have greater costs to get to work. Whether people use their private car or hit public transport, the cost will go up. Is this fair? Is this just? I might remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the coalition was going to abolish the fuel excise levy to make transport costs cheaper for everybody in Australia, yet Labor puts it up, with no mandate, thus imposing an extra cost on every business and every farm. What about the impact on primary industry? Agricultural activity, food processing and forestry will pay an extra $290 million a year. They already pay $1.5 billion in fuel excise levy. After the 5c a litre rise, that will go up to $1.8 billion. Our primary industries, our farmers, our foresters and our fisheries cannot afford that. It is just an extra cost that will make them less competitive. This government cannot get it into its collective thick head that we have to reduce costs to make the producers more productive and competitive. It is no wonder we are not more competitive, because every farm and every farm family is going to be worse off, Every Australian small business is going to be worse off in this budget of betrayal. Every Australian family will be worse off because they will pay more fuel tax. The National Farmers Federation says that the rise in unleaded fuel costs will add $20 million to farm costs. The National Road Transport Association says the diesel tax will increase costs for every truck in Australia by an extra $6,000. That could put up the cost of a trolley load of groceries by about $3. But there is $2,400 extra on average in sales tax on every truck as well. That puts up costs again. There are just so many things that I would like to talk about. The tourist industry has been severely savaged by these measures, as has road funding. What about pensioners' shares, and what the government is doing to the aged? There is also the proposal for increased landing fees at Sydney airport. In the time available to me, I want to concentrate on one particular area: what the government is doing to credit unions in this country. This week I will be presenting petitions to this House bearing 5,150 signatures from people in my electorate who are concerned about the future of credit unions. The decision by the Treasurer to remove the long standing tax exemption on credit unions under section 23G ignores the unique role that they play in our retail finance sector. Credit unions are owned and funded completely by their members. Any income earned by the credit union apart from that required to meet expenses and prudent reserves is returned to members in the form of better rates of interest on savings and loans and is used to fund new products and services. A tax on credit unions is a tax on choice. Whereas the government is handing out tax breaks and income support worth hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign and domestic banks, this tax will punish the great potential of the credit union industry by taxing their only source of capital. A tax on credit unions is a tax on volunteers. Many credit unions rely on the work of volunteers to provide basic services to their members. All credit unions rely on volunteer directors elected by the membership to manage their affairs. Those volunteers are appalled that the government would tax hard won gains achieved through cooperative unpaid effort. A tax on credit unions is a tax on self-help. Credit union members work together to achieve a better life for themselves and their community. Credit unions play an important role in educating the public on credit and assisting many disadvantaged groups in Australia and overseas. Credit unions also are willing to provide services in areas which the banks consider unprofitable. Unfortunately, the industry will have to look to its salary costs to pay this There is a distinct possibility that up to 2,000 people will have to lose their jobs. There are 329 credit unions in Australia. None of them issues permanent share capital; none of them distributes profits by way of dividends. No individual or corporation has or could have a controlling interest in any credit union. All credit unions insist on the maintenance of their mutual status and their recently induced enabling legislation. No credit union is permitted to transact business with non-members and each credit union member is entitled to one vote at general meetings, regardless of the size of his or her deposits or loans. While credit unions do not exist solely to serve low income earners and welfare recipients, the record on their commitment to social justice is unmatched by building societies, banks or any other financial institution. As the New South Wales Commercial Tribunal found in its 1992 inquiry, credit unions are the only financial institutions prepared to advance low value-that is, under $3,000-term. loans. Credit unions promote the use of debit cards, with which members have access to their own savings, rather than credit cards which facilitate debt creation and over-commitment. Credit unions encourage volunteer involvement and currently! have over 3,000 volunteer directors. and more than 5,000 volunteer workplace representatives. It is totally unjust to tax credit union surpluses at the corporate rate as it will reduce their capital growth by one-third. This will, in tum, substantially limit their asset growth potential. The restriction so imposed on credit union growth could be enormous considering that, within the prudential standards as prescribed, credit unions make greater assets to the extent of approximately $15 for every $1 in reserves. There is much more that I could say about the impact on credit unions. I do not have time to tell the House all about it but, under the present tax regime, credit unions are encouraged to take a comparatively lax or generous approach to writing off loans in arrears. This is simply because there is no incentive to write off delinquent loans in order to claim a tax deduction. As a consetax. quence, the present tax regime assists credit unions in helping their delinquent members through periods of personal and financial difficulty-and, boy, there are plenty of people in personal and financial difficulty right now. The ultimate beneficiaries are credit union members whose circumstances in many cases can be, and are, accommodated by credit unions without recourse to the indignity of default, loss of goods and a scar on their credit reference reports. If credit unions lose their tax status, they will then be under much greater pressure to get tough with members whose payments are in arrears. They will not want to move in this direction. It is not the credit union cooperative way to bankrupt their members and sequester their assets, but the tax regime will exert substantial pressure on credit unions to write off delinquent loans in order to increase their allowable deductions, reduce their tax liability and so ultimately retain their only source of capital growth. The ultimate losers will be the ordinary Australians who constitute credit union membership. They have traditionally been able to look to their credit unions for a fair deal, and those credit unions are not getting a fair deal from this government. I think it is amazing that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has come back from his trip overseas with his arrogance undiminished and his contempt for his peers having grown even larger. As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said justa little while ago, the issues in Australia at the moment are not the Olympics, they are not Mabo, they are not the republican debate. He echoed something I have been saying for a very long time: the issues are jobs, jobs, jobs. I think the Prime Minister has turned his back on ordinary Australians by increasing taxes and increasing hardship. He lied to Australians. He said there would be no new taxes.",101
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,Would the honourable member please keep within parliamentary convention.,104
121,Mr NEHL,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"The Prime Minister misled the people of Australia. He said that there would be no new taxes, and the Keating government has no idea how to get the country back on the track to recovery. There is no hope for Australia under Labor. He is worried more about the republican issue and the rich than recovery for Australia. I would like to conclude by quoting from a comment of the Salvation Army on this budget, and that is that clearly the taking is bigger than the giving. That is what this Labor government is all about: taking rather than giving.",104
122,Mr FERGUSON,SUPERANNUATION INDUSTRY,"The budget represents an understandable package if one accepts the premises of rigid adherence to the diktat for a 1996-97 deficit of one per cent of GOP, the need for inequitable tax concessions seemingly more sacred than other commitments, and a marked unwillingness to increase direct taxation. It is to be hoped that the pursuit of the 1996-97 target is sensibly modified if projections fail to materialise, and we are confronted with alternative demands for stringent cuts to the social wage for poorer people. It is worthwhile recalling the government's late 1992 reassurances that Australia was 'better placed than most other countries to provide fiscal stimulus'. Then we were reminded that the 1992 US deficit was five per cent of GOP and a record $290.2 billion. During 1992-93, Japan has announced three spending injections, the latest being $38 billion to kick-start the economy. Then and now, governments around the world recognise that fixation with targets like this accomplish little and limit options. Just how specious these targets can be is displayed by the current Canadian political contest, where the Progressive Conservatives are promising a zero level in five years, and the opposition Liberals three per cent at some time. In the UK, the deficit is currently eight per cent of GOP and the full recovery estimate is as high as three to four per cent. These targets might temporarily reassure a ravenous money market but their mindless pursuit can .engender tremendous suffering and persistent failure to tackle infrastructure deficiencies or deliver some employment growth. Similarly, the recourse to indirect taxes, which is often politically easier, fails to drive home Australia's broader low tax status. It does not matter which set you use, or how they are calculated and contrived. The reality is there. Impact magazine, in June 1993, showed 1989 revenue from tax as 30 per cent of GOP compared with an OECD average of 38 per cent within total taxation. Equally, OECD revenue statistics for 1965 to 1991 show that the weighted average was 38.7 per cent for members, and Australia's rate was 29.2 per cent. Treasury advises that, from a 1983-84 situation where indirect taxes amounted to 34 per cent of total revenue, that portion has declined to 26 per cent. This is a softening up process for widened acceptance of a greater shift to indirect taxes. A concept singularly unpopular at the 1993 polls should be considered in the context of the overall tax take. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 2 July, Stephen Ellis noted that the final tax proportion, as a 23 per cent share of GDP, was the lowest since 1973. He concluded: Labor's tax cuts were a final fling for the most saleable political message of the that middle class taxes could be cut further and further. He went on to say: They were arranged solely at countering Dr Hewson's Fightback tax promises. Like Fightback, they reflect the politics of the 1980s. The Fitzgerald report and the national fiscal outlook made it clear that that era-the era when politicians competed to offer tax cutsis no longer affordable. Here, there has been strong recourse to wider indirect taxes to assist questionable income tax largesse to sometimes wealthier sections and to grind onwards with a fixation about the 1996 budget deficit. Thus, we had a projected 10.5 per cent increase in the sales tax take and a 15.4 per cent augmentation in petrol excise. The flat one per cent wholesales sales tax moves now and in July 1995 have pronounced regressive aspects. While not absolute, the general reality is the proportionate rises of 10 to 12 per cent, and 15 to 17 per cent on smaller items as opposed to products attracting the increases from 20 and 30 per cent, will heavily affect the purchasing power of poorer, including unemployed, citizens. It is partially reassuring that electorates such as mine are stillimmune from the impact upon significant food and clothing. After all, the Australian electorate was scared witless by far more extreme variations recently. However, in the context of more meagre income tax relief for poorer people than for those in high tax brackets; this is a telling decision. The increase in a $100 watch or a similarly priced clock might not greatly affect people receiving a $18.50 tax cut in November on incomes of $800 per week. The increases on items such as dog food, toothpaste, stationery et cetera for those people receiving tax reductions of only $1.92 because they receive weekly incomes of $500 down to as low as $150 will be tremendous. The $150 tax rebate for those with yearly incomes below $20,700, while admittedly costing $15 billion in the years to 1996-97, is a gesture in combating significant cost of living moves rather than an answer to the critics of the advisability of tax decreases and the inequity 1980s: the claim of its formulation. The constraints imposed by the forwarding of this round of personal income taxes must be borne in mind when considering the advisability of a further, more demanding $5 billion currently on hold. Telecom and the Reserve Bank cannot be constant milching cows for these exercises. The priority of finding jobs, the challenge of job creation and tackling unemployment is a persistent slogan in Australian politics. This budget is a mixed package for regions such as my own, crucially dependent on government initiatives in labour market programs and public works expenditure. In the central western region of Sydney, which broadly covers my electorate, the June 1993 unemployment rate of 14.3 percent compares with 11.7 per cent for the same time last year. The rate is a full four per cent above the statewide figure. The modest rise in spending by $113 million is welcomed. However, its adequacy, given a stagnant private sector investment and research effort, is dubious. The minimal increase has to be appreciated in light of a sustained escalation of the long-term unemployed with their consequential social problems and diminishing employability. Bruce Chapman, in the Australian Economic Review of April-June 1993, gave some indication of the impact of the growth in long-term unemployment. He stated: ... in the period 1983 to 1990 about 3.3 per cent net jobs were created on average every year, a not unprecedented but highly unusual experience for the Australian economy. Yet at the end of this seven year period, which saw employment growby about one and a half million, there were still 110,000 long-term unemployed compared to the initial number of 190,000. I well appreciate the thought that has gone into the $6 per fortnight increase in newstart benefit for these people after March 1994 and the move towards ending stringent work search requirements for those over 60 who are long-term unemployed. However, we face the reality that by March 1993 the long-term unemployed had reached 350,000, a figure 27 per cent higher than for the previous year. In the March 1993 edition of the Australian Bulletin of Labor Baker and Wooden noted that the long-term unemployed category does not fully count the serious underemployment whereby there was a 15 per cent rise in parttimers, or. 70,300 employees who desired more working hours. Even with many qualifications, they still calculated aÂ· three per cent underemployment grouping. It is difficult to believe that decreases numbers to be helped in light of the success of our job cre-tionprograms are an adequate continuing response. I particularly question the cutting back in the jobskills program, having witnessed the impact of a seminar conducted in my electorate to lift its local profile and seeing its effectiveness demonstrated at a graduation ceremony in Holroyd last week. Equally, the jobtrain program will suffer projected falls of about 20,000. The boost in the new enterprise incentive scheme of an additional 1,650 places to a total of 5,000 is merited. I note the statistics cited by the Minister Finance (Mr Willis) that 15 months after NElS assistance 64 per cent of the businesses assisted still operated. Let us hope that the understandable failures are not latched onto by a vindictive, uncharitable opposition. Let us hope that it sees the need to accommodate and encourage many thousands of Australians with a very real capacity to supplement needed employment growth in the small business sector. The government, understanding the very real pain suffered by people confronted with discrimination against the unemployed in a labour buyers' market and the pronounced casualisation of our work force, has made moves to help those that are reduced to spasmodic, underpaid casual jobs. Thus, in line with prior promises, there will be greater leeway for the income earnings of recipients of jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances. From 20 September, married couples will be allowed $50 each per fortnight before their allowance dwindles and there will be an extra earned income disregard within the income allowed for single allowances of $30. In a parallel development at the same date, similar claimants who have obtained income support in the previous three months will have their waiting period waived. For the full 1994-95 year, and on current estimates, the cost of these two government actions will be $55 million. Finally, atÂ· an average annual cost of $41 million over the next three full years, the unused income tax-f-ee area will be able to be in the accumulated up to an amount of $500 per person by way of offset and as a free area against future income from. employment of jobsearch and other welfare recipients. The government believes that 26,000 hard-pressed recipients will benefit as a result. Any reduced labour market effort must be set. against the very real continuing job crisis and the measurable success of programs. Thus we find in the last quarter that 47 per cent of CES placements were aided by wage subsidies compared with 35 per cent for a similar period in 1992. Equally, whilst the consideration of the statistics must bear in mind the for growth of that group, the program commencements for the long-term unemployed rose from 34 per cent to 60 per cent of the intake over the past two financial years. The new enterprise incentive scheme, which has been greatly expanded in this budget and aided by financial and advisory help, as well as training the unemployed in business establishment, found in February 1993 that after one year 62 per cent of clients were still in employment and 54 per cent in self-employment. A March 1992 analysis found that those who had been assisted by the skillshare program had a 1.5 times greater advantage in labour force participation six months later than those unassisted and that for the jobtrain program it was 34 per cent against 23 per cent. Despite the arguments about different sample groups, there are clear indications of the decisive, positive aid that labour market programs can provide, whether in future direct employability, the building of confidence or reskilling. It is therefore extremely dubious forecast a $500,000 reduction in these programs in the absence of an emphatic indication that the unemployment paralysis is being overcome. Nevertheless, the breadth of training in labour market work is impressive. The 500,000 places in labour market offers will include 333,000 designated long-term employment places. Thus $64 million will be devoted to higher subsidies for employers taking on extra trainees and apprentices. Again, assistance will be devoted to avoiding termination of at-risk apprentices. An additional $13 million in prevocational training measures will aid the $20 million already voteq to Decl(mber 1993. Group training is helped by the $1 million allocation for new venturesÂ· while other government funding will ensure widened brokerage work. In a broad-fronted effort we will see 10,000 landcare and environment action places for unemployed teenagers in training and experience targetedÂ· at heritage and environment aspects. I am pleased to note that my concept of the use of Rookwood Cemetery with its immeasurable recreational opportunities is being acted upon. In the community sector, 7,000 unemployed people will be given the opportunity of work experience with the related possibility of obtaining new skills. Noting the. reality that the long-term unemployed are predominantly older Australians laid off after decades in the one job, 10 mature workers centres will be piloted, attached to skillshare sites. An amount of $7.25 million will help remote communities in specialised, targeted labour market assistance. While supportive of further expenditure, one must concede the breadth of Australia's programs: work experience for people with disabilities, interpreting services; mobility assistance, special intervention, accredited training for growth,skillshare, NIBS and other programs. As the New South Wales government slashes apprenticeships, its Commonwealth equivalent has put in train a diverse range of recommencement grants, disadvantaged apprentice help and group training company to apprentice aid, as well as a $60 per week wage subsidy for at-risk apprentices. In 199293 there was an 80 per cent trainee rise and an increase in apprentices of nearly 15 per cent. Related to this issue is Australia's infrastructure needs. OneÂ· Nation spelt out the gains for national efficiency and employment to be made through a greater allocation. There were gestures towards overdue work on a national rail highway, rectification of our national road network and links between transportation modes. With roads; we now find that federal spending will fall from the present levelÂ· of $2.1 billion to the lowest level in ,a decade. This is part of 'a broader picture that shows a fall from $7.2 billidn to $4.5 billion between the last and the coming financial year of govemmentspending. As this government has noted, the One Nation program represented an endeavour to provide Australia with anÂ· overdue national rail network. It is of concern that, as we speak of the urgency of the greenhouse crisis, we will witness reductions in rail expenditure of 70 per cent and 50 per cent respectively over the next two years. The national transport planning task force represents a vital opportunity for an authentic national.interconnected plan for road and rail transportation. It should not be thrown away. The Minister for Finance has argu'ed that with the inclusion of signalledÂ· One Nation resources there has been a seven per centÂ·rise in Commonwealth investment, entailing a 'rise in public final demand from 1:5 per cent to 2.5 per cent this year. The very real infrastructure needs of this nation are the material reality that faces this investment. Diverse reports have tallied the costs of the failure to provide private and public investment over decades. This country has to recognise the very sad investment performance of the private sector. Thus we see a 24 per cent first quarter profit gain, 'followed by a $1 billion switch to profitability in the June quarter, and recently the revelations of an Australian Financial Review survey of 75 companies who had reported by 20 August. That survey found a 45.5 per cent profit rise. The government has undertaken a series of measures to provide encouragement. A new generational investment allowance was added to the accelerated depreciation and development allowances for plant installed and ready by July. We are assured that there will be a 10.75 per cent increase in business investment for the year. The $30 billion spending flood on CBD real estate of the 1980s has not been followed by construction investment over the past few years. Blair Badcock in Policy and Research has. noted the point made by the Bureau of Industry Economics that a $4.2 billion per annum cost of urban sprawl should be compared to $3.5 billion that has been invested in the new manufacturing capacity in the last decade. He has spoken of the 'collapse of corporate investment' and the 'collapse of private capital fOl;mation'.,.. NA",104

124,Mr FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Reid) (10.31 p.m.)Blair Badcock spoke of the 'collapse of corporate investment' and the 'collapse of private capital formation' in the vital tradeable goods sector, which most economists assumed would automatically flow from deregulation and the downscaling of the private sector. Coming from such a small base, it is technically correct-as another minister pointed out-that in the 1980s Australia had one of the highest growth rates of business. R&D amongst OECD regimes, and that 1991-92 involved a 4.8 per cent real increase over the year. He pointed out that the change was up there with the rates of Taiwan and Sirigapore. What should be recalled, however, to quote Andrew White in the Australian Financial Review of 20 August is that 'despite extensive efforts by the Federal Government to encourage, its business investment in research and development remains among the lowest in the OECD'. By then it was 0.5 per cent of GDP and faced Swiss, German and Japanese levels four times higher. Australia also trailed Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom and a host of other countries. In a report to DEEP, Dr Paul Twoomey sh6wedthat, even within this miserable effort, 80 per cent of the 948 R&D utilised for concessional tax claims was concentrated'in 100 larger companies. These have been the measures that cooperative research centres and the Australian technology group have applied to overcome this. Overall, there are indications that after three years of falls private business investment could flatten out in 1993-94. That is the hope given in a picture which saw manufacturing sector investment for the March quarter fall by 6.7 per cent, while before-tax' profits increased by 21.4 per cent, according to the Bureau of Industry Economics brief. An era which has witnessed genuine productivity, such as the 2.5 per cent per worker rise last year, a deregulation of the financial sector, embryonic and tentative industry policy initiatives, historical,ly low. inflation and industrial disputation has, despite the promotional tales, been greeted by an abysmal business response. Labourshedding has been the most consistent cost cutting and entrepreneurial activity. Thus, in the last quarter, with minimal hiring, the share going to wages actually decreased - y $300 million. . The final figures for 1990-91 showed that Australia's R&D as a percentage of GDP was at 1.36 per cent-ahead of Iceland and Ireland, but trailing many competitors. Similarly, the overdue training levy is now being assailed because it has begot rorts. It was, indeed, a noble initiative to try to lift the pathetic efforts of our industry, which means a minority carried the research can. Thus Christine Wallace of the Australian Financial Review of 22 July could claim: Industry sources suggest that between 10 per CeIit and 30 per cent of the $841 million in eligible expenditure under the levy legislation may be fraudulent. In a monumental cop-out the Australian National Audit Office further reported that the training levy did not fit many company structures. What an indictment! Of course, there have been further efforts to make it business friendly, including carriage of expenditure over one year to the next, and allowing subsidies for apprentices and trainees to be counted as training expenditure. Finally, paperwork has been simplified. Similarly, the Bureau of Industry Economics concluded that there has been no noticeable attributable upsurge in R&D. (TIme expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Nugent) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Snowdon) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Child Support Scheme",108
125,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"There are a lot of people inÂ· the Cowan electorate, and around Australia, who will be watching with anticipation the deliberations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues as it investigates the operations of the child support scheme. The many Australian families, and in particular those who are the custodial and non-custodial parents of broken families, who are serviced by the Child Support Agency around Australia, will be seeking some major changes to the operation of the child support system as a result of the joint standing committee's inquiry. I remind the House that the coalition has been concerned about the operation and effectiveness of the scheme, especially in relation to its administrative processes and the unnecessary emotional and financial stress placed on all parties, so much so that it went to the last election with a commitment to thoroughly review the operation of the child support scheme. I would like to use this opportunity to echo some of the comments Of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) who recently highlighted some of the difficult situations his constituents were forced to of the failing of the system in its present form. Since entering parliament, I have been inundated by constituents seeking some recourse for the unfair treatment they have received from the agency. They have been custodial and non-custodial parents; some have voluntarily come to arrangements with their former spouses; others have had to resort to the legal system; others have been denied basic legal representation because their delicate financial position has deni-d them legal assistance, yet they have not been able to meet the high cost of private legal aid. Before highlighting some of the cases of some of my own constituents-which are testimonies to the inherent deficiencies of the system-I would like to make an important point. No-one denies the fact that the work of the child support scheme is difficult, and more importantly it is important to note the improvements in the operation of the scheme since its inception. Despite the obvious problems of the present system; the previous scheme saw more than 70 per cent of maintenance orders not being complied with. The 1992 report of the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group found the following: The Australian Child Support Scheme has achieved in its three years, greater reliability of child support payments for many people, fairer and more adequate amounts paid and better integration of the maintenance payment mechanism with the social security system. In addition to this, it is important to remember that the Child Support Agency saved the Australian taxpayer approximately $74 million In 1992-an increase of over $19 million. Nevertheless, there appeared to be continuing areas of concern. The Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman's annual report 1991-92 noted that. the Child Support Agency had more complaints made about it than any other government agency, with 922 complaints in 1990-91 compared with 1546 in 1991-92-an increase of 68 per cent. There can be no doubt that many of the problems experienced with the child support scheme-and more particularly the CSA-are exasperated by difficult and confrontationist attitudes of bear as a result separated couples. The problems are not gender specific and, although custodial parents have to bear a disproportionate share of problems associated with the operation of the child support scheme-difficulties associated with late payments and the problems with arrears collections are examples-the bulk of my evidence suggests that the non-custodial male parent is most at risk of experiencing problems with the system. I qualify this statement with the comment that it is difficult to make broad conclusions when the nature of these problems is essentially client specific. There are obvious examples where the problems experienced by custodial parents, and, particularly, non-custodial parents in second relationships, need serious attention. I would like to quote from a letter I recently received from a constituent who says: ... l have been advised that I am 'caught' in a bureaucratic loophole and forgotten, becoming nothing more than a 'number' or 'statistic' divorced and have only recently taken custody of my two teenage children. Prior to custody I was required by the family court to give my ex-wife 70% of all assets and matrimonial furniture and other items. I was also required to pay over 27% of my gross income to which I agreed and had deducted from my salary. My ex-wife was assisted also with a pension, rental assistance, and medical conc-ions. ' .. Obviously there are some inconsistencies. My constituent goes on to say: ... my plight is that I have custody of two children, no assistance and in addition' I have to pay 18% to a one year old child whose mother is approximately $15 000 per annum better off .than myself with full reCognition and subsidies agairist my nothing. Where is the justice . . . The extent of the community's dissatisfaction with the present operation of the scheme can be gauged by the emotional intensity and sheer frustration that average Australians are forced to endure under the present system. No-one would deny that the intentions behind the establishment of the child support scheme are worthy. However, the day-today operation of the system still failsÂ· to meet the increasing demands and patience of the people it is meant to serve. In my submission to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues investigating the operation of the child support scheme, I identified some of the recommendationssuggested to me by local constituents, and these included a premarriage register of assets and liabilities; a consultation and counselling process for both parties; a reappraisal of the formula for financial judgments; the requirement that maintenance be used for the welfare of the children; stronger recourse for non-compliance of court orders; regular review of circumstances for either party; and improved departmental service. For the many Australian families and individuals who use the child support scheme,the inquiry presently being conducted by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is an important one. (Time expired) Rugby League",109
126,Mr BEVIS,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to talk about that rare combination in sport: a team of champions that is ... I am also a champion team-in fact, the world champions of rugby league. The Brisbane Brorcos yesterday reaffirmed their position as the most, outstanding . rugby league side certainly in Australia and without parallel in the world. This year thcty managed to win the premiership from the fifth spot on the ladder, which is doing it the tough way. They put themselves through four sudden-death playoffs, each of which they. won convincingly. I am pleased that the honourable member  evening. I extend my sympathy to him on the record, as I did earlier today in private. Yesterday as I drove around Brisbane I saw the houses all decked out in the maroon, ' white and gold streamers and balloons of the Brisbane Broncos. The party 'began in Brisbane well before kick-off time because the people of Brisbane had confidence in their home town team. Of course, the Broncos clubhouse at Red Hill was packed from midmorning. I rang the Broncos club earlier this evening to see how things were going, only to discover that the party that had commenced yesterday morning is still under way. Apparently, some bus loads of supporters arrived back from Sydney early this morning and kic-ed on withthose.who stayed after.the live telecast. yesterday. I want to make a couple of comments about some of the players because the Brisbane Broncos have a genuine list of champions. They have young players who are simply bubbling with talent. I refer to people like Julian ONEILL, a full-back who yesterday really demonstrated his class; Steve Renouf, who is the Australian centre, who came back from a serious injury-a broken jaw-and played an outstanding match in the grand final; and replacement John Plath, a young fellow whom most clubs would be glad to have in their first line-up but who was proud to play for the Brisbane Broncos and is a great team player. . The Brisbane Broncos have the sheer brilliance of a whole list of Australian repreCrushers, sentatives-the two best wingers in Australia, Michael Hancock and, in my view, the best winger. in the world, Willie Carne; a centre Chris Johns's ability; and a person who many people thought should have been player of the match, Kevin Walters. It is hard to talk about the team without acknowledging the little master of the game in the 1990s, Allan Langer. They had a forward pack that drove a much bigger St George pack backwards every play-and that included people such as Matterson and Lazarus, both of whom came back from injury. It was a back-to-back win: 1992 and 1993. Only the very best have been able to accomplish that. It is proof of the Brisbane Broncos' professionalism. They have, in coach Wayne Bennett, one of the most--:-if not the most-professional football coaches in this country. Their support staff include Kelvin Giles; they have a club management including people such as John Ribot, the best football chief executive in the competition; and a board of directors with people such as Paul, Morgan and Barry Maranta. They are a first grade outfit. . This year has seen successful teamwork beyond the football field. The Brisbane Broncos and the Brisbane City Coun,cil teamed up, as many people know-with the strong support of Lord Mayor, Jim Sorley-in the.shift of the Brisbane Broncos to the ANZ Stadium. We all know that in club matches they have managed to pull crowds in excess of 50,000 people on a regular basis. It is with that background in club football and with the Brisbane Broncos'clear dominance of the game ahead of us throughout the 1990s that I suggest in the House that it is time for some of the finals series matches to be played in Brisbane. If the grand final had been played in Brisbane yesterday there would have been a bigger crowd at the ANZ Stadium than there was at the football stadium in Sydney. The 1994 finals series games should be played in Brisbane. Certainly, some of those finals series games should be played in Brisbane. As we look to the future and we realise that we will have the Queensland Perth, Auckland, North Queensland and, of course, CanberraÂ· in the competition, it is not hard to envisage a final!, series of without a Sydney team at all. In that context, it is time for us to look to the future. (Time expired) Rugby League Taxation: Credit Unions",110
127,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I was interested to hear those comments from the honourable member for Brisbane (Mi' Bevis) because he alluded to the launch of the potential champion team, the Western Reds, in 1995. We now know that for the last four out of five seasons a Sydney side could not win its own competition. So when Auckland, Perth or the Western Reds enter the competition, we will find that it will be almost a rarity for a New South Wales side to win the competition which that state started. That augurs well",111
128,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,They are has-heens.,111
129,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, they certainly are. I did not intend to speak about rugby league this evening. I have a much more important subject 'to speak about in relation to the aspirations of many people, particularly those in the lesser income brackets around Austral"", is. I want to talk tonight about a notice of a motion given today in the other chamber by Senator Hill, to the effect that a motion will be moved tomorrow to refer the Australian Labor Party's attempt to remove partial taxation exemption of credit unions for consideration by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The motion proposes that the inquiry assess the impact of additional taxes Labor wants to impose on credit unions and report before 29 October this year. This motion shall be moved in the Senate for two reasons: firstly, the coalition believes the taxation treatment of credit unions should be reviewed to assess its impact on this industry and consumer choice; and, secondly, Labor has breached its election commitment not to increase taxes by attempting to remove partial taxation exemption of credit unions in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993. MrSlipper-Yet again.",111
130,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,Yet again we see another tax impost on lower income earners. Mr Neville-They've betrayed their own people.,112
131,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, they have betrayed the so-called true believers. But the proposed inquiry will make particular reference to the role played by credit unions in Australia, their structure, operations and community service functions. This will include analysis of the reasons why credit unions were granted partial taxation exemption in 1974, the impact additional taxes will have on this industry and consumer choice, and whether differentiated tax treatment of credit unions and building societies is still valid. I would like to make the following comments in relation to the position that the credit unions have taken in this case. They ,have pointed out that section 23G of the Income Tax Assessment Act was enacted in 1974 to exempt from tax loan interest income from credit union members. At that time it was supported by both the government and the opposition of the day, with a clear recognition of the important social and economic role played by credit unions. The proposed removal of limited taxation exemption came as a complete surprise to the credit societies. They are absolutely bewildered in attempting to understand the Labor government's rationale for this move. ,The budget papers claim that the removal of section 23G will raise additional revenue of $25 million in 1995-96. But the credit unions contend that this will be substantially less. They question this figure because the estimate fails to recognise the squeezing of interest margins in a lower interest rate environment and the lower operating surpluses that credit unions will generate. Nevertheless, this amount is minuscule in the overall budget context. However, it will be a major burden on credit unions and their members. Although credit unions are relatively small in financial institution terms, there are 3.1 million members of Australia's 329 credit unions. These members have a level of communication with and commitment to their credit unions not found in a purely commercial relationship. I am sure that, if the proposals of the Labor Party were to be enacted, the credit unions would be in a position to voice their strong concerns about this iniquitous treatment from the Labor government. Credit unions are copperatives; they are owned and funded completely by their members. Credit unions play a unique role in the retail finance sector. They are not for the individual profit of shareholders; they act equitably in the interests of all members. The most important point about this for Labor members opposite is that these credit societies provide a very important credit arrangement for low income earners. In many' cases they are the last place these people can turn to for credit. They provide the so-called many true believers that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) keeps referring to with a savings and credit capacity that other institutions are not able to provide for them. All I can do is alert backbench members opposite, who are grinning at the moment, to the fact that, if they think they can get away with this iniquitous proposal, they have another think coming. (Time expired) Rugby League  tary to the Minister for Defence) (10.50 p.m.)-It is after great provocation tonight that I rise to defend the honour not only of St George but of Sydney as a whole from the truly outlandish and barbaric attack from the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). In thanking you for the call, Mr Speaker, I give you my commiserations and pass on those of the St George district on your team's failure to make the semifinals this year. InÂ· the true manner of all Sydneysiders, particularly people from the St George district, may I say that the .Brisbane Broncos were not simply the best; they were t(Uly the best on the day. We dip our hats to them. In so doing I want to congratulate the Saints. They played a great season and did very well. I want to point out to the House what a young and keen team this is-a team built from the ground up with many young players. Indeed, our eldest forward is only 25 years of age. A number of players on the paddock yesterday were barely 20 years of age. They have been led along this path with some great coaching fromÂ· Brian Smith and his superb support staff. I must mention Scott Campbell, the conditioner, .andÂ· Dr Martin Raftery, who have done a tremendous job for them. All this is backed up by a great administrator in Geoff ,Carr and superb sponsors in P-nfolds and Newmans of Kogarah. I want to point out to the House that St George did not have the advantage yesterday of having 11 internationals in its grand final squad-as did Brisbane-1O of whom took to the field. We had just t"",o. We also did not have the advantage yesterday of having practically a whole state from which to draw, as did the Brisbane Broncos.. It is not that I decry for one moment their victory, but this raises a number of questions, not the least of which is the salary cap. . There is a great benefit to teams in oneteam towns of the added income that players can rightfully earn from endorsements and advertising. I would not for a moment suggest that we deprive them of it, but those teams in multiteam cities, such as Sydney, should have their salary cap raised somewhat to compensate for the higher income that players can earn in such places as Brisbane and Canberra, and no doubt will in Perth and New Zealand in 1995. . . I must object in the strongest possible terms to the suggestion that the semifinal series should be moved to Brisbane. It would be inconvenient for all but two of the 16 clubs in the Winfield Cup. That has to be taken into account. Sydney is now truly a multicultural city. The feeling in the St George district in the last few weeks-with our team in the grand final-of people from all walks of life and different original nationaliti-s wasabsolutely superb. That is a very good case for keeping the semifinal series in Sydney. It also has to be said that Sydney welcomes everyone. None other than our first lady, Mrs Keating, said in Monte Carlo last week, 'Everyone from all over the world can feel at home in Sydney'. If I can be so bold as to add to the words of our first lady, even Brisbane Broncos supporters can feel welcome in Sydney. It is the home of rugby league and must remain. so. But I dip my hat-I am sure on behalf of all St George supporters.,-to the Brisbane Broncos. They were truly the best team on the day. I must say to the honourable member for Brisbane to watch out next year because we will be back. Higher Education Contribution Scheme  indeed honoured to learn in question time today that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)takes an interest in what I have to say. This evening I want to make some more comments on the goverument'sproposed budget changes to HECS that honourable members on this side of the House may care to consider while we prepare our response. The budget increased the level of HECS payments and doubled the rate of HECSfor second undergraduate degrees. In other words, the bl}dget. introduced new graduate tax imposts from a government that went to the polls promising not to increase taxation. These new taxes have been structured in an entirely regressive w-y. The government inten<;ls to jack up HECS payments for former studentsÂ· in the. lowest income bracket by a whopping 50 per cent, by 25 per cent for those earning between $30,004Â· to $42,005 and by only 20 per cent for those on higher incomes. . The Liberal Party is already fighting many of the unfair tax measures contained in this year's budget. The case against these two measures is quite clear. Each year, tertiary students sign a payment options form. They have the choice of paying tuition fees up-front or having them deducted from their earnings once they reach a certain level. The students who take the latter option sign a one-sided agreement with a party that can change conditions at whim. The increased HECS payments announced in the budget are an unexpected burden that will hit mainly young people trying to establish their careers. Students :studying for second undergraduate degrees will face enormous debts. I received a letter on this subject today that made some particularly pertinent points. It said: What is the, difference between a perso.n who. studies a co.mbined Arts/Law degree and o.ne who. studies Arts then works fo.r a sho.rt time . . . and returns to. study Law? The difference is an increase o.f o.ver $14,000 in HECS. The latter student is likely to. have a to.tal HECS bill o.f approximately $26,000 ... Bo.th students, who.se ages will o.nly be a co.uple of years apart, will be treated as equals by their po.tential em pI Dyer and thus are likely to. receive the same starting salary. Ho.wever, the seco.nd graduate will have a crippling debt ... What is to. happen to. students who. wish to. do. a co.mbined degree and o.nly have the present cashflo.w to do. o.ne at a time? They will pay double for being poor ... The HECS increase does not o.nly affect present students. It will also affect future students, the ones who are still at school. They will be forced to. make life long career decisions at the end of their schoo.l life. It may be too expensive to change later. That is how the letter ended. The higher education contribution scheme is already fundamentally flawed. It is not fair to expect st,Udents to sign contracts that this parliament can suddenly change retrospectively. The Liberal Party's education policy was comprehensively rejected by students at the last election because they were afraid we would increase fees. A just HECS system should let students know the financial commitments they make. We should not leave threats of unexpected fee increases hanging over their heads as they establish their careers and make so many of the decisions that shape their lives. We should examine this sort of scheme in the future. By rejecting the government's proposals today we will be signalling our intention to make HECS fairer. I understand that when the Treasurer, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), was still at school his headmaster one day summoned him to his study. He advised young' John to forget about a university education. It must have 'been a blow, especially for a boy from a top private Perth school with such a prestigious reputation. But the resentment that day engendered does not excuse the way that the honourable member for Fremantl- handled our universities as minister for education and is now treating our students asTreasu-er; The budget plans for HECS are new and regressive tax measures. We should not let them pass in their current form.",112

133,Mr CONNOLLY,INFORMATION,"Mr Speaker, upon notice, on 1 September 1993: Have the (a) Joint House Department, (b) Department of the House of Representatives Drc) Department of the Senate commissioned any portraits since 1983; if so, in each case, (i) from whom was it co.mmissio.ned and (ii) what sums were spent on (A) the purchase, (B) framing, (C) lighting and (D) other costs. Mr SpeakerThe answer to the honour"" able member's question is as follows: Joint House Department In January 1991 respo.nsibility for the Historic Memorials Collection and its Committee was transferred from the (then) Department of the Arts, Sports, the Environment, Tourism and TerritQries to the Joint House Department.

Department of the House of Representatives In the period since 1983 the Department of the House of Representatives has commissioned only one portrait. Shortly after the first meeting of the House of Representatives inth- new building on 22 August 1988, an informal all-party committee of Members was established to investigate the feasibility of commissioning a painting commemorating the event. After consultation with all Members in the 35th Parliament, the Committee recommended that the project proceed. The then Speaker, the Hon. Joan Child, endorsed the recommendation and the distinguished Australian portrait artist, June Mendoza, was commissioned to undertake the task. Ms Mendoza's work was already represented in.the building by her portraits of Sir John Gorton and Sir Billy Snedden. On completion the painting was presented to the House on 22 June 1990. It has been hung in the foyer to the main committee room on the first floor. It is therefore available to be viewed by members of the public as well as official visitors to the House and Members of Parliament. Reproductions of the painting were sold to Members and other approved 'persons on a strictly limited basis.

(2) What is the nature and extent of (a) interaction, (b) cooperation and (c) sharing of data by Commonwealth agencies operating databases with (i) other Commonwealth agencies, (ii) State and Territory agencies and (iii) other parties. (3) What privacy safeguards apply to databases operated by Commonwealth .agencies. (4) What is the authorisation procedure for the transfer of information held on Commonwealth agencies' databases (a) between Commonwealth agencies, (b) from Commonwealth agencies to State or Territory agencies and (c) to other parties. (5) Do Commonwealth agencies transfer information between their databases electronically; if so, what safeguards exist to ensure that outside access is limited only to that of authorised transfers. (6) Do Commonwealth agencies permit information transferred electronically from their databases to form part of the receiving,agency's database; if so, (a) in what circumstances and (b) subject to what controls. Mr LavarchThe answer to the honourPrivacy able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) All Commonwealth agencies will maintain one or more collections of records-most will maintain some of these in the form of com- ' puter databases. ' Whilst there is no single comprehensive record of Commonwealth databases, agencies are required under two Acts to publish details of their informaby tion holdings: EXPENDITURE, 1987-88 TO 1992-93 ($m) NA 13.5 13.5 2.7 7.5 12.9 15.6 15.6 18.2 18.2 22.0 22.0 21.1 21.1 Road Development Program Under Section 8 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, agencies are required to include in their Annual Reports a statement of the categories of documents that are available to the public, whether through the FOI Act access provisions or otherwise. Under Information Privacy Principle 5 of the Privacy Act (s. 14), agencies are required to maintain a record of records of personal information kept by or on behalf of the agency as a record-keeper under the Privacy Act. The Privacy Commissioner publishes each year a Personal Information Digest which brings together all such agency records. The 1992 Personal Information Digest was published in June 1993 and copies are sent to all major public libraries and all Federal Members of Parliament. The entries in the Personal Information Digest include general descriptions of the nature and purpose of all records of personal information and usual disclosures. In the 1992 Digest, details of participation in data-matching programs are included by some agencies for the first time. To answer these questions directly and specifically would be very time consuming. It is suggested that enquirers could first consult the agency annual reports and Personal Information Digest and then direct any specific questions to relevant agencies. (3) Commonwealth agencies must comply with the 11 Information Privacy Principles of the Act. These can all be seen as privacy safeguards, but of particular relevance to the operation of data bases by agencies is Information Privacy Principle 4 which provides, in general terms, that agencies shall protect personal information, by such security safeguards as it is reasonable to take, against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure. Breaches of the Information Privacy Principles may.result in complaints individuals to the Privacy Commissioner that their privacy has been breached. Agencies must also comply with Information Privacy Principle 11 when' disclosing"" personal information, including Occasions of disclosures to other ,agencies. Information Privacy Principle 11 prohibits agencies from disclosing personal information unless the disclosure is consistent with one of the exceptions listed in paragrapn 11.1. Disclosures which are thus permitted' include disclosures with the consent of the person to whom the information relates, disclosures reasonably necessary for the protection of the public revenue, or the enforcement of the criminal law, and disclosures required or authorised by or under law, amongst others. Where agencies are constrained by secrecy provisions in the legislation they are administering, they may have further restrictions on their power to disclose information. In addition, the Privacy Commissioner has the power to conduct audits of agencies' compliance with the Information Privacy Principles, and agencies therefore must be able to satisfy the Privacy Commissioner that their security safeguards are appropriate to the sensitivity of the information they hold. Within my Department every effort is made to ensure that Information Privacy Principles contained within the Privacy Act are met. In the design of the various applications which .create and maintain the various databases, a major criterion is safeguard of information from illegal access. (4) Officers are required to comply with any specific secrecy or other specifically applicable legislative provisions applying to information being dealt with by them. Such provisions apply to defined classes of information. In addition agencies must comply with Information Privacy Principle 11 of the Privacy Act, and whether disclosures can be made therefore depends on the particular circumstances under consideration. I- is not, therefore, possible to generalise with regard to the procedures to be followed by officers in telat-on to disclosure of information. (5) There is no general difference ments or authorities relating to electronic data as opposed to information held on paper or other media. Some statutes, such as the Electoral Act and the Data-matching Program (Assistance & Tax) Act, contain specific limitations on the disclosure of information in particular forms. TranSfers of data in electronic form is subject to the same privacy safeguards ,and seprecy provisions as other information. (6) The terms and conditions on which agencies provide information to other parties are increasingly set out in formal agreements or memoranda of understanding. This practice is sometimes required by statute or regulations, and for personal tion is consistent with record keepers' obligations under the Information Privacy Principles. Electoral Act (Question No. 78) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 10 May 1993: Has the Government considered the Constitutional Commission's recommendation that subsection 394(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be repealed.",118

136,Mr CAMERON,ABRD ALTP ALTD TOTAL,"the Assistant Treasur.er, upon notice, on 10 May 1993: (1) Are taxpayers served with a summons if their payments are overdue; if so, (a) are they (i) warned of their due payments and (ii) made aWare of repayment options before the summons is issued and (b) has a less costly and antagonistic option been examined. (2) Does the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) charge interest at higher than the market rate; if so, (a) why and (b) will he examine requiring the ATO to charge interest at the market rate.",121
137,Mr GEAR,ABRD ALTP ALTD TOTAL,"The answer to theÂ· honourable member's 'question is as follows: . (1) Some taxpayers are served with a summons if their payments are overdue. However, this is only one option the Commissioner of Taxation uses for dealing with overdUe taxation debts. Other options include the use of garnishee notices (provided for in various taxation legislation). and payment arin the requirerangements. (a)(i) Yes. A taxpayer has, as a minimum, 30 days following the issue of a notice of assessment before the amount called for in the assessment is due for payment. If the amounUs not paid by the due date, the Commissioner issues a final notice requiring payment and advising of the implications of not paying. This notice clearly advises taxpayers they should not ignore their responsibilities. (ii) TaxPack advi-es taxpayers they can seek time to pay their liabilities. The Commissioner also issues various rulings which set out when he will agree to payment arrimgements. Tax agents are also aware of the Commissioner's practices in relation inforniato payment arrangements. (b) A summons, is only one option the Commissioner uses to recover ,unpaid tax. However, the issue of a summons is often the most efficient way of making taxpayers aware of their responsibilities. (2)(a) Generally, taxation legislation additional tax for the late payment automatically accrues when the debt is not paid by the due date. The amount imposed (16% per annum) is not an intyrest charge but apenalty for paying late. (b) From 1 July 1993, changes to the income tax law will mean that the additional charge for late payment will be made up of two components. The first component, will, be an amount to compensate the Commissioner for the time the amount has remained outstanding. It will be based on the' 13 Week Treasury Note yield plus 4% and will be adjusted on a periodic basis., This will be roughly equivalent to the Prime Bank lending rate. This component is tax deductible. The second component will be a penalty for late payment and will be at the rate of 8 % per annum; this component is not tax deductible. ), "" Department of Primary Industries, and Energy: Consultants (Question No. 103) , Mr Aldred asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on, 11 May 1993: (1) Is (a) Mr Tom Gibson or (b) Mr lain Polley a,membel,', director, shareholder, employee, subcontraotor of, or otherwise connected with a firm of consultants which has entered into a contract or subcontract for consultancy arrangements with the Minister's Department; if so, with respect to each contract or subcontract, (i) what was its nature and purpose, (ii) whe- was it entered into, (iii) what was the name and position of the departmental officers who authorised it, (iv) what:payments were made to the contracted firm, (v) were any delegations exercised in respect of the contract or subcontract; if so, (A) what were they, (B) who exercised them and (C) when were they exercised, and (vi) what tender process was involved.

(4) How many of the persons referred to in part (3) have received counselling. (5) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an interview with Dr Tony Adams, Chief Commonwealth Medical Officer, on the Hinch television program which went to air on 9 December 1992.

(10) Has the Minister's Department received any reports offurther deaths from CJD (a) overseas and (b) within Australia since the answer to question No. 1703; if so, in each case, how many. Mr 1I00-eThe Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: - . On 11 May I announced.an independent Inquiry into the Australian Human Pituitllry Hormone Program and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). I announced this Inquiry because I share the concerns already e){pressed by many of the former patients who received treatment under the program and by the community generally. The terms of reference of the Inquiry (copy attached) will ensure that investigations of matters including those raised in the honourable member's question will be undertaken by an independent team of irlVestigators led by Professor Margaret Allars, Associate Professor of Law at Sydney University. The report of the Inquiry will be made public and, of course, will be provided to the honourable member. ' , . . ' A number of the matters raised in this question can only properly be answered as a result of Professor Allars' Inquiry. ,J have referred the honourable member's question to her for consideration in her report. Further, the issues raised by several parts of the honourable member's question may be sub judice being the subject of writs lodged with the Supreme Court of Victoria by the husbands of three of the former patients and by two of the former patients themselves. Accordingly, it is inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time. I am, however, able to provide the following factual information in answer to the following parts. (1)(a) 1370 (b) 661 The above figures may vary slightly as the Department's records are of patient approvals under the Australian Human Pituitary Program. Actual numbers of people treated may change as a result of advice from treating practitioners following an examination of their clinical notes. (2) (a) & (b) 62 men were approved for treatment between 1967 and 1985. In general tenns the purpose of the treatment was for infertility. (3) (a) 450 women had been contacted to 31 December 1992. (b) 513 women have been contacted between 31 DeCember 1992 and 11 August 1993. (4) 963 women have been contacted by either their original treating practitioner or their nominated doctor and offered counselling. (5) No. I was not the Minister for Health at that time. (6), (7) & (8) While the detailed processes of manufacture of hPG are a matter for Professor Allars' Inquiry to review, the Department has alWays taken the view that it is not possible to assume that any batch was free of the CJD agent. (9) The table listed in Question 1588 related to the total number of treatments (injections) of hPG administered to patients for that year. Many of the women would have received several injections. This information' was extracted from the Department's data base which was established from information provided by treating practitioners. Other issues raised in this question are matters for Professor Allars' Inquiry to review. (10) Yes. (a) 4 con finned deaths overseas; (b) 2 confinned deaths in Australia. At the meeting of the Drug Committees of the Lawson Wilkins Paediatric Endocrine Society of North America and the European Society of Paediatric Endocrinology held at San Francisco on 3 June 1993, it was reported that there were at that date 49 known cases of CJD associated with pituitary honnone treatment worldwide. The reported breakdown by country follows: 9 UK. 10 US. 1 Brazil 1 New Zealand 24 France 4, Australia The 49 included several (precise number unknown) still alive in France and one still alive in the United Kingdom as at 3 June 1993. NA NA HORMONES IN AUSTRALIA AND CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE The purpose of the Inquiry is to examine the operation of the Australian pituitary honnone program and to report on issues arising from that examination. ' Tn particular, the Inquiry is to examine and report ' on: The decisions taken to establish and continue the program in the light of scientific knowledge of the risks and benefits at the relevant times; Any applicable guidelines relating to the treatment aspects of the Program, particularly the information provided to patients so as to allow infonned consent; The applicable rules and guidelines relating to the manufacture of the hormones, including for the collection of pituitaries; and Following cessation of the program, actions taken by the then Department of Health (subsequently DCSH, then DHHCS now DHHLGCS) and others in response to reports of deaths from CJD of patients on similar programs overseas and subsequently of Australian patients. The Inquiry will make recommendations on: Further actions which the Government might take to identify people in Australia who received the pituitary derived hormones and to provide counselling and support to them; Whether additional measures are necessary to ,regulate medical' programs in the light of ,the experience of the pituitary hormone program and the current regulatory procedures; Any measures which should be taken to strengthen the rules arid guidelines relating to , informed consent in similar medical programs Priorities for research into matters related to CJD and its transmission. The inquiry will determine its own methods of operation, including obtaining of Infonnation, subject to privacy provisions. All fileS in the possession of Commonwealth agencies will be made available to the inquiry and State Governments are being asked to assist the i-quiry in relation to relevant records held by public hospitals.

140,Mr HOWE,INTO THE USE OF PITUITARY DERIVED,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: On 11 May I announced an independent Inquiry into the Australian Human Pituitary Hormone Program and Creutzfeldt-lakob Disease. I announced this Inquiry because I share the concerns already expressed by many of the former patients who received treatment under the program and by the community generally. The terms of reference of the Inquiry (copy attached) will ensure that investigations of matters including th9se raised in the honourable member's question will be undertaken by an independent team of investigators led by Professor Margaret Allars, Associate Professor of Law at Sydney University. The report of the Inquiry will be made public and, of course, will be provided to the honourable member. A number of matters raised in this question can only properly be answered as a result of Professor Allars' Inquiry. I have referred the honourable member's question to her for consideration in her report. Further, the issues raised by several parts of the honourable member's question may be sub judice, being the subject of writs lodged with the Supreme Court of Victoria by tre husbands of three of the former patients and by two of the former patients themselves. Accordingly, it is inappropriate for me to comment any further at this time. I am, however, able to provide the following factual information in answer to the following parts. (1) No. (2) Information is not available for the years 1960 to 1978 as Creutzfeldt-lakob disease was not separately identified by an ICD Code until 1979. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has recorded deaths from Creutzfeldt-lakob Disease (JCD code 046.1) for the period 1979-1991 as follows: 1979-11; 1980-7; 1981-6; 1982-13; 198315; 1984-17; 1985-11; 1986-13; 1987-14; 1988-15; 1989-7; 1990-14; 1991-13. (3) & (4) The Department will continue to collect information on deaths of people on the Australian Human Pituitary Hormone Program. Death certificates have been requested for those former patients that are known to have died. These certificates are being examined for any connection with CJD. (5) No. Counselling services are available in Sydney and Melbourne for recipients of both hPG and hGH. In addition, the Department is currently preparing to establish 'services in other State Capitals where the program operated. (6) No. (7) & (8) I am advised that some girls with the genetic condition described as Turner's Syndrome were treated with hGH under the AHPHP. The total number of females who received hGH was 203. As advised in question 115 (13), clinical records held by individual doctors are the only accurate guide to the actual treatment carried out and the reason for it. (9) Yes. (10), (11) & (12) A total of 62 adult males received hPG for infertility. (13) Refer to preamble abov-. (14) Refer to preamble above.

These are that applicants: must compete on merit for positions advertised in the press or Commonwealth Gazette as open to non-APS applicants; and must satisfy the usual pre-appointment checks: be over the minimum age limit for employment, as specified in the State and Territory legislation, and must be under the age of sixty-five at the time of their appointment; hold Australian citizenship or have permanent residence status with a view to obtaining citizenship; meet the fit and proper person assessment; be medically fit to undertake th- duties; hold appropriate educational qualifications, where relevant; and meet assessments for access to Designated Security Assessment Positions and Positions of Trust, where relevant. These conditions also apply where former public servants have received their superannuation enti'tleAll ments as a result of receiving a severance benefit following retrenchment from Commonwealth employment. Additionally, where the person was retrenched within 12 months of the new appointment, the appointment must be made by the Public Service Commissioner. Public servants retired from the APS following invalidity retirement may regain permanent employment if they are restored to health. Public servants retired from the APS upon reaching the maximum age of 65 years may not be re-employed in the APS. All members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) are subject to those provisions of the superannuation legislation which concern continuity of membership on change of employment. The applicable legislation is: subsection 3(3) of the Superannuation Act 1976 (the CSS Act); or section 12 of the Superannuation Act 1990 (the PSS Act). The effect of these provisions is that, where a person is considered to have ceased to be a member of the CSS or PSS and immediately after so ceasing, again becomes a member, they are deemed not to have ceased. In other words, the person continues to be a member of the relevant scheme and has no entitlement to a superannuation benefit. If there was a genuine break in employment, however, the superannuation benefit would not be affected. Former members of the CSS who have elected to defer their entitlements on initial retirement or resignation will re-enter the CSS on re-appointment. If retirement occurred prior to 1 July 1990, they will have a right of election to change their scheme membership from the CSS to the PSS followingre-appointment. All other. re-appointees would be required to enter the PSS scheme. Former members of the PSS who elected to preserve their entitlements under that scheme would automatically become members of the PSS on reappointment. The value of the preserved benefit would be aggregated with subsequent membership of the scheme in accordance with the rules governing the scheme. Persons in receipt of an invalidity benefit under either the CSS or PSS would cease to have entitlement to that benefit if they were again appointed permanently to the APS. Persons in receipt of a CSS/PSS invalidity benefit are subject to an income review should they be re-employed in any capacity. income from personal exertion is subject to assessment against the upper income.limit specified in the legislation. (2) The comments provided in relation to question (1) apply here as well. Only those former members who elected to preserve their entitlements and avail themselves of the 'transfer value' provisions of both schemes would be affected on immediate re-employment. Should they gain employment with another public service where there was an eligible superannuation scheme, their CSS/PSS equity would be transferred to that scheme. . There are no other impacts upon superannuation entitlements resulting from re-employment as most benefits, with the exception of invalidity benefits, are not means-tested. (3) Permanent part-time positions with the APS are open to retired public servants provided they meet the conditions specified in the answer to question (I) which also apply to permanent part-time work. People seeking casual employment with the APS must satisfy the usual conditions for temporary employment. The PSS scheme provides for membership by casual and part-time employees, subject to qualifying periods. . Provided that the 'continuity of service' provisions are satisfied, there is no relationship between such membership and most other superannuation benefits being received concurrently, the exception being invalidity benefits as detailed in the reSponse to question (I) above. Aboriginal Tent Embassy (Question No. 208) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) Has a permit been issued with respect to the so-called Aboriginal tent embassy situated outside the old Parliament House; if so, what is its duration. (2) Was a permit issued retrospectively; if so, was it issued by ministerial direction. (3) Would a permit be issuable on the same terms and conditionsÂ· to other Australians who wished to camp on the same site; if not, why not. (4) Is the site an approved site for camping.",133
148,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. A permit has been issued to the Aborigi"" nal Embassy to use Parkes Section 58 Block 1 (Part). The initial permit, dated from 12 March 1993 to 12 May 1993, was issued on II March 1993. A second permit, dated from 13 May 1993 to 31 December 1993, was issued on 1 July 1993. (2) The second permit applied retrospectively. Neither permit was issued by ministerial direction. (3) It is not usual practice for the National Capital Planning Authority to permit use of National Land for extended periods. However, permits are issued under certain conditions for the holding of public demonstrations on National Land. Permits have been issued for the erection of tents for other demonstrations. Applications for such permits are considered on a case by case basis. (4) The site is not an approved site for camping. Qantas: Staff Uniforms (Question' No. 212) Mr Mack asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: Is Qantas changing the design of its staff uniforms; if so, (a) why, (b) will the change result in approximately 60 000 items of clothing becoming obsolete and (c) what is the total cost of changing. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice provided by Qantas: (a) With single branding it was decided to design a new uniform for the Group; replacing the separate uniforms of Qantas and Australian Airlines. (b) The new uniform will result in the old uniform being replaced over a nine month period. A significant portion of the old garments would, at that stage, need replacement on a condition basis. (c) Approximately $9 million. Smoking: Bans in Public Places (Question No. 218) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) What is the extent of Commonwealth legislation banning smoking in public places. (2) Will the Government extend coverage by the legislation. (3) Are shopping centres and other public facilities covered by the legislation. (4) What are the penalties for breaching smoking bans.",134
149,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Smoking bans in public places are largely a matter for State and Territory governments. However, the Commonwealth Government has acted where appropriate. For example, in July 1992, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) Board determined By-Laws, under the Federal Airports Corporation Act, 1986, which banned smoking in passenger terminals. (2) There is no specific Commonwealth legislation banning smoking in public places. (3) Not applicable .. (4) The penalties for breaching smoking bans depend on the particular legislation. For example, smoking in a passenger terminal (mentioned in (I) above) may incur a penalty of$IOO. Educational Publications . ' . (Question No. 225) .",134
150,Mr MCARTHUR,TOTAL,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) Have recent publications by the Department of Employment, Education and Training's Evaluations and Investigations Program (EIP), including Year 12 in the 1980s and Judging the quality of teaching, been made available for sale in Australian GovemmentPublishing Service (AGPS) bookshops; if so, how many copies .have been sent to the AOPS. (2) How many copies of (a) Year 12 in the 1980s and (b) Judging the quality of teaching were produced.

(5) Was $1.25 million allocated to the ErP in 1992c93. . (6) What proportion of the allocation to the EIP in 1992-93 was spent on (a) printing and (b) mailing and distributing EIP publications.",135
151,Mr BEAZLEY,TOTAL,"The answer to. the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Generally, reports such as those published under the Evaluations and Investigations Program (EIP) are made available for sale in Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS) Bookshops, however, the final decision on marketing publications rests with AGPS. In this instance these two publications were not placed on sale by AGPS. (2) (a) Year 12 in the 1980s. My Department ordered 2500 copies. (b) Judging the quality of teaching. My Department ordered .1000 copies. (3) No. As pointed out in (1) AGPS marketing makes the final decision as to whether a publication is placed on sale. ,However, the Department carefully considers the' likely target audience for each publication and makes a free distribution accordingly. The principles underlying the distribution of reports are under review at present. (4) The aim of this program is to investigate and evaluate significant elements of the higher education program and to encourage debate in the sector in theproq:ss. The Program assists in ensuring that efficiency and effectiveness are addressed as part of the accountability processes. The Government believes that reports of projects commissioned under the ErP should be made available to the sector and other interested parties and maintains a distribution list for that purpose.

152,Mr CAMERON,TOTAL,"the Minist-r representingthe Minister for Health, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: . (1) Are callers to Medicare'placed on a queuing system when they telephone; if so, what is the average length of time before a caller is answered. (2) Does Medicare operate a 008 - elephone number facility; if not, will it do so.",135
153,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The' Minister for HealthÂ· has did so. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Callers to the central Medicare number in eacl1 Slate are placed on a queuing system. The average length of time before a call .is answered varies from State to State, with a miniml,l/Tl average of 19 seconds to a maximum average of 2 minutes and 16 seconds. Medicare does not, however, rely on one central contact number. Many telephone calls are directed to the local Medicare, branch offices, rather than the State headquarters. (2) Medicare 008 numbers are operated in Western Australia and South Australia. There are currently no plans to 'extend this network. . Health Insurance . (Question No. 235)",135
154,Mr EVANS,TOTAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: Will the Government remove the health insurance controls which prevent private health insurers offering insurance to cover the gaps between the (a) Medicare rebate and the actual fee charged for outof-hospital medical services and (b) Commonwealth Medical Benefit Schedule fee and the actual fee charged for medical services in-hospital.",135
155,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) and (b) The comer-stone of the Government's health policy is the universal health subsidies system of Medicare. Under Medicare, all Australian residents are provided access to medical care and pharmaceutical products at reasonable charges and access to hospital care at no charge. Within the Medicare arrangements, there is a range of measures, such as direct (bulk) billing and safety nets, which seek to protect individuals and families from unnecessarily high out-of-pocket costs. Health care cardholders are also provided access to a range of ancillary services at little or no out-of-pocket cost. Voluntary private health insurance co-exists with Medicare, howe-er, it plays a supplementary role. There is a set of regulations and limitations which govern the role of private health insurance, including limits on the types of gap insurance that may be offered. These arrangements seek, on the one hand, to provide consumers with some choice and enable some mix of pubJi<; and private sector involvement in health care financing. At the same time, they aim to ensure that consumers' interests are protected and that medical and hospital services' prices and health care costs for individuals and the community are constrained. In response to concerns about the falling participation rate in private health insurance and amounts of out-of-pocket costs some consuinersÂ·with pri\iate health insurance pay for some medical services, I am examining private health insurance arrangements within the Medicare financing system. One of the issues being addressed is ensuring that people who choose to take out private health insurance can do so on an affordable basis. A major reason people give up private health insurance is the gap between the amount covered by the private health insurance funds and the charges rendered by doctors. The Government, however, cannot allow the funds to cover any amount that doctors may care to charge. Consequently, I am looking at ways to ensure that additional costs to patients are eliminated or reduced. This work will take some time to complete given the range and complexity of the issues involved. I will be reporting to State and Territory Health Ministers on the issue of private health insurance by the end of the year. Aboriginal Land Claims: Western Australia (Question No. 240)",136
156,Mr EVANS,TOTAL,"the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) How many Aboriginal land claims have been lodged for land in Western Australia. (2) With respect to eachclaim referred to in part (1), (a) what area in hectares is covered by the claim, (b) in what district was the claim lodged, (c) who lodged it, (d) who is paying the legal fees, (e) what is the anticipated legal cost of (i) defending and (ii) prosecuting the claim, (t) what other costs are estimated to be met by the (i) Western Australian and (ii) Commonwealth governments and (g) what land use will be affected by the claim. Mr'Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As a general rule, the information requested by the honourable member is usually held by the registries of the various courts in which land claims are lodged. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission does not have the resources to seek and store such information, which in any case is not directly relevant to the discharge of its responsibilities. (2) The Commission has provided the following grants to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations in Western Australia in 1992/93, under its NatiVe Titl- Claims Program: Kimberley Land Council-$416,OOO Aboriginal Legal Service of WA-$200,OOO Ngaanyatjarra Council-$50,OOO These funds have been allocated for research into native title issues, and would not reflect accurately the full costs of any individual claim. Family Centres and Community Facilities (Question No. 241)",136
157,Mr EVANS,TOTAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: Did the Government undertake before the general election to provide sales tax exemption status for family centres and other community facilities which provide support and activities for four year olds; if so, how is the undertaking being fulfilled.",136
158,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. The Government did, however, make an election commitment to provide a sales tax exemption for the purchase of goods used in providing child care services at long day care centres, outside school hours care services, vacation care services, co,ordination units within Family Day Care but not employer provided child care services. Amendmentsto the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 to reflect this commitment are expected to be introduced to Parliament in the current sitting. Home Equity Conversion Scheme (Question No. 243) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 17 August 1993: (1) Did the Government undertake to introduce a home equity conversion scheme enabling pensioners to borrow up to $7,500 against the equity in their homes; if so, why has the scheme not been introduced. (2) Have there been problems in, relation to selecting a financiill institution to operate the scheme; if so, what are the problems. (3) Was a process implemented to select a financial institution by tender; if so, (a) did he approve the process and (b) has the process failed. (4) Will private soli-itors be employed in operating the scheme; if so, (a) on what basis and (b) at whose expense. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government announced in the 1992-93 Budget,that it would provide sponsorship of up to $10 millio- a year for a bank, building society, credit union or other finanCial institution selected by tender by the Department Of Social Security to run a national home equity conversion loan scheme for age pensioners. The then Minister for Social Security, Hon. Neal Blewett, stated that he hoped the first loans would be available in April 1993. Because of the need to undertake a second tender process, the expected date for first availability of the loans is now 1 December 1993. (2) No tenderer initially SlItisfied all the nonnegotiable requirements of the tender brief. A marginally revised statement of requirements was subsequently issued by the Department of Social Security to all those institutions whi,ch had respondfour ed to the initial invitation to express interest. The main change was that, taking account of advice from the Australian Government Actuary that the cost' would be negligible, the Commonwealth agreed to underwrite half the risk to the successful tenderer of providing to the borrower a guaranteed minimum residual equity in the home of $20,000, indexed to the CPI. The tender procl)SS has now been completed and a preferred tenderer announced. (3) Yes. (a) No. (b) No. (4)(a) Private solicitors will be contracted by the preferred tenderer, the Advance Bank of Australia Ltd, to act as its agents to, provide face to face contact with loan applicants and borrowers in those geographic locations where the Bank is not represented through its Branch structure. (b) Advance Bank of Australia Ltd will be responsible for all costs associated with its own agents. Diabetes (Question No. 252)",136
159,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice, on "" 18 August 1993: Was a private mail agency used to distribute a letter to diabetes sufferers, under the auspices of Diabetes Australia, signed by John Dunn, National Director, setting out 'changes to the payment arrangements from 1 August 1993 for testing strips, syringes and other products available' on the National Diabetic Supplies Scheme; if so, was the letter dispatched on 28 July 1993 with the result that patients had no time to obtain supplies at the old prices.",137
160,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes. Diabetes Australia, who hold sole responsibility for the administration of the National Diabetic Supplies Scheme (NDSS), engaged the services of a private mailing agency, Hermes Prescisa Ltd, to distdbute letters and other material to 170,000 NDSS registrants notifying changes to payment arrangements effective from I August 1993. The mailing schedule requested by Diabetes Australia was: Non metropolitan-Friday 23 July 1993 Metropolitan-Monday 26 July 1993 This postage schedule would have provided those registrants affected by increased charges with up to clear working days' before the end of the month to order products at the old prices. Actual lodgement by the company with Australia Post was: 27 July-32,000 letters 28 July-40,000 letters 29 July-98,000 letters As a consequence of delayed lodgement by the company an unknown number of registrants would have received their letters too late to order products at the old prices.

Parliamentary Parklands Interpretive Trail System (Question No. 256)",138
163,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) What sums have been spent on (a) design, (b) construction, (c) supervision and (d) other costs associated with the Parliamentary parklands interpretive trail system. (2) How long is the system. (3) What is the system's construction.",138
164,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total spent on the Parliamentary Parklands interpretive trail system to date is $149,536. A further $27,500 is yet to be expended on construction of extra seating, pram crossings and signage to complete the trail. The expenditure to date includes: (a) $12,000 for design; (b) $136,176 for construction (including materials); and (c) $1,360 for supervision. (d) Nil.

Road crossing points are marked with cQncrete paving. The walled seating areas are constructed from Honeysuckie Creek Stone. The signs are made from vandal resistant powder-coated steel with screen printed graphics. The plaques are of stainless steel, mounted on a stone plinth. York Park Project: Moths (Question No. 257)",138
165,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) Did the CSIRO conduct a moth count for the National Capital Planning Authority at York Park, Canberra; if so (a) what were the results, (b) what actions and modifications to the York Park project have been (i) recom-ended and (ii) taken as a result of the moth 'count being conducted. (2) What is the estimated cost of the actions and modifications.",138
166,Mr HOWE,TOTAL,"The answer to' the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Part of Section 22, York Park contains a population of rare and endangered day flying moth, Synemon plana. The National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) commissioned the CSIRO Division of Entomology to carry out population monitoring of the moth between November 1992 and January 1993. (a) TheÂ· results indicated that a viable moth population existed and the site was assessed as possibly being a viable long term site for the species provided habitat conditions remain suitable. (b) (i) The study recommended further seasonal monitoring to assist in gaining knowledge of the moth's life cycle and response to weather condi, tions. (ii) No modifications to the York Park project have been necessary. A protective fence was erected around the site early in 1992, before construction on the York Park project began. Drainage at the rear of the site and weed control are being maintained. In addition, the NCPA is inv-tigating the feasibility of moving some highquality native grass, which does not currently harbour the moth, to the adjacent Sydney Avenue road batter, in. an attempt to improve its chances of survival. A landscape plan for the area is being determined, giving consideration to the need to maintain the grassland. The NCPA continues to monitor the site and further CSIRO monitoring is planned. (2) The CSIRO's study in 1992-93 cost $4,500. A further study in 1993-94 is foreshadowed at an estimated cost of $5,000. The proposed grassland translocation will be undertaken as part of future landscape works on York Park. The protective fence was erected in 1992 by Civil and Civic as part of the construction of Centenary House. Guardhouse in South Australia: Contract for Construction (Question No. 262)",138
167,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: .

168,Mr WILLIS,TOTAL,"The Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Project Services (now Australian Construction Services) did contract for the. construction of a guardhouse in South Australia in January 1993. (a) The guardhouse is located on the main access road to the Nurrungar Base approximately 16 km south west of Woomera. (b) The building has an enclosed space of 3.5 square metres and a roofed area of 5 metres by 5 metres. A small store and room for a portable generator are located outside the enclosed space and under the eaves. Basic toilet and kitchen facilities are provided for one occupant. Externally, manual boom gates control access to the base. Construction is: reinforced concrete noor slab; brick masonry and glasS wall construction; metal deck pyramid roof.

ATSIC: Purchase of Dining Table (Question No. 268)",139
169,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: Did the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission purchase' a dining table in February 1993; if so, (a) why was the table needed, (b) who (i) requested and (ii) .approved the purchase, (c) were other prices or quotes sought and (d) what is the description of the table. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question as is follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission purchased a dining room table in December 1992. (a) The table was required to provide a facility to entertain official guests. This is common practice in most Government Departments. (b)(i) The Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer requested the purchase. (b)(ii) The purchase was approved by an approved delegate, the Manager of Corporate Support in ATSIC. (c) No other prices or quotes were sought. Enquiries were made of a number of possible local suppliers but only one was able to meet the time frame for the style of segmented table that was required. The supplier had previously pn;lVided the ATSIC boardroom table. The quality of workmanship, and materials, together with the ability to deliver non stapdard furniture at a reasonable price, were some of the factors which led to the decision to engage the supplier to provide the dining table. (d) The table is manufactured in Australia from Tasmanian Cherry Myrtle Veneer on medium density fibreboard with solid timber lipping to all exposed edges. The top is mounted on enamelled metal legs and frame. The dimensions of the table are; 3600mm long, 1530mm wide, and 750mm high. Tax File Numbers (Question No. 278)",139
170,Mr CAMERON,TOTAL,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) How many persons. have been refused benefits because they failed to lodge a tax file number. (2) Following the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to award a disability pension to a person who had refused to provideÂ· a tax file number, will other persons who refused to lodge a tax file number be provided with benefits; if so, will the payments be retrospective and what will be the cost. (3) Will the Government legislate to ensure .that all persons seeking - nefits provide a tax file number. . Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as. follows: (1) Payments to 738 Pension, 265 Job Search/ Newstart Allowance and 28,479 Family Payment recipients were cancelled. These people did not respond to requests for their tax file number, nor did they contact Social Security in the six weeks following their payments being stopped. (2) The decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relates to a person who qid not have a tax file number and refused to apply for one. The Social Security legislation is specific where a person has a tax file number and the requirements are also satisfied when a person who does not have a tax file number applies for one. No other cases have been highlighted where payments were stopped to a person for non-compliance with the tax file nU,mber requirements who did not have a tax file number and refused to apply for one. The Department considers it unlikely that this decision would affect many other clients. (3) The intention of the relevant provisions in the Social Security Act t 991 is that the provision of a tax file number is a condition of payment. Where, a person has a tax file number and' refuses to' supply it, there is no entitlement to payments. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision has exposed a possible loophole and goes against the intention of the legislation. Consideration given to an amendment to put the issue beyond doubt. Human Rights (Question No. 281) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: What progress has been made in reconsidering the reservations lodged by Australia in acceding or ratifying UN human rights instruments since his answer to question No. 1793 (Hansard, 7 October 1992, page 1679). Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: All reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will necessarily be examined in the course of the preparation of the Report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, required under' Article 40 of the Covenant. The Report is currently being prepared by the Attorney-General's Department. On 16 December 1992 a Bill (the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill) making racial vilification unlawful was introduced into the House of Representatives. This Bill' lapsed When the House was dissolved for the 1993 Federal election. The racial' vilification legislation is currently urider Government consideration. The Attorney-General, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will review the terms of Australia's reservation to Article 20 once the process of giving consideration to the legislation is complete. The question of the reconsideration of the reservation to Article III of the Convention on the Political Rights of Women (the CPRW) concerning recruitment to, and service in, the Defence Forces and the question of the reconsideration of the reservations regarding maternity leave and combat duty in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (the CEDAW) depend on policy developments in other portfolios. I understand that the situation regarding Australia's reservations to the CEDAW and the CPRW has not changed. However, I understand that significant policy developments in relation to the employment of women in combat and combat-related positions may have a bearing on the continuation of the reservation to the CEDAW concerning combat and combat-related duties and the similar reservation.to Article III of the CPRW, This is because the circumstances which give rise to these reservations have now substantially changed. is being Defence Forces I understand the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 ' . (the, SDA) currently ,allows women in the Australian Defence Force (the ADF) to be excluded from serving in positions which involve combat or combat-related duties. However, I understand that this exclusion from' combat-related duties has not been applied since May 1990, the date from which the employment of servicewomen in combat-related positions has been progressively introduced. I understand that in December 1992, the Government announced a new employment policy for women into the ADF. Women are now able to serve in all positions except direct combat positions. I understand that it is likely that the Government will amend the SDA to remove the exclusion from combat-related duties, and instead restrict the exemption to Direct Combat duties which are those duties which may expose a person to a high probability of direct physical contact with an armed adversary. These changes will open almost 90 per cent of all positions in the ADF to women. The following information on the outcome of the policy in the ADF is taken from the 1993-94 Women's Budget Statement, tabled on 17 August 1993. Army The Combat-Related Employment of Women Evaluation Team was established in mid-1990 to monitor and evaluate the impact of servicewomen on operational effectiveness. The performance of women on Exercise Kangaroo 92 (one of a series of exercises held every three years involving major deployments of ADF elements), and a number of brigade and lower-level exercises has been monitored, as well as overseas deployments with the United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTAC) in Cambodia, where 26 women served, and Somalia, where 12 women served. Despite some residual difficulties due to demanding physical tasks (which, even with intensive training, women cannot completely overcome) the integration of women into combat-related employment is progressing well. To date, 654 servicewomen, approximately 22 per cent of the Regular Army servicewomen, have been posted to combat-related positions, easily meeting the target of 600 by June 1993. In addition, 21 servicewomen are now serving in the previously all male Corps of the Royal Australian Engineers. As a result of the new employment policy for servicewomen, only 19 out of 146 Other Rank employment categories are now closed to women. There are now 19 500 positions open to Other Rank servicewomen out of 23 500 (83 per cent). Women are still excluded from Armour, Artillery, Combat Engineers and Infantry units. Of the 4600 officer positions in the army, 4000 (87 per cent) open to women. In total, almost 84 per cent of Army positions are now open to women. Approximately 5000 women are employed in the Army Reserve, with more than 3000 serving in combatrelated positions. Air Force Women are now eligible for employment in the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) as aircrew, in all aircraft types. The only positions that remain unavailable to women are in Ground Defence Units. To date, the RAAF has trained seven female pilots, one of whom is attending the prestigious Royal Air Force Test Pilot School in the United Kingdom. A female Navigator recently completed conversion training and is now flying with an operational squadron. Additionally, one women is currently training as a pilot, and five female officer cadets at the Australian Defence Force Academy have been identified for aircrew training. A number of the RAAF's female Communications Officers have been selected on merit for service with the Australian contingent to the UNTAC in Cambodia. Four women recently returned to Australia after 12 months service with the UNTAC and an additional six were selected and left for Cambodia in mid-1993. In light of the policy changes within the ADF, the Office of the Status of Women (OSW) is proposing to initiate discussions with relevant departments with a view to narrowing or removing the reservations to the CEDAW and the CPRW prior to Australia's defence of its second periodic report on the implementation of the CEDAW Convention in January 1994. Navy In December 1990, a Women at Sea Implementation Plan was produced. It was modified in August 1992 to reflect lower than anticipated separations, reductions to some staff categories, and the opening up of part of the destroyer force to female employment. When the second Collins Class submarine, HMAS Farncombe, comes into service in 1996, submarine service billets will be open to women, with only the Clearance Diver service remaining unavailable to them. . To date, the plan has resulted in a substantial increase in the level of female involvement and employment at sea. By April 1993, there were 34 seagoing female officers, an increase ()f 17 over the number serving at the same time last year, and exceeding the target of 31 by the end of 1993. Seaman Officer specialists undertaking Bridge Watchkeeping Certificate training and consolidation are the largest group of the female seagoing population. The modified plan predicts the current rapid increase in female seagoing numbers will are tempor!lrily slow over the next few years, as a result of down-sizing and lower personnel separation rates. A continuing increase is nonetheless expected. At the end of April 1993, 122 female sailors were serving at sea. This is an increase of 27 from the same time last year and is consistent with achieving the target of approximately 150 by the end of 1993. The Women at Sea Implementation Plan is a continual program. Projected target figures for 1994 and beyond are being developed. Maternity Leave Maternity leave with pay is provided for most women employed by the Federal Government. Fully paid leave of 12 weeks in the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory public services, and nine weeks in the New South Wales public service is available, subject to qualifying periods of 12 months or 40 weeks respectively, of continuous employment. Paid maternity leave of 12 weeks has also been available for public servants in Victoria; however the new government has introduced legislation to remove this entitlement new employees. Unpaid maternity leave is provided in respect of all other women employed in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere to women employed under Federal and some State industrial awards. Social security benefits subject to income tests are available to women who are sole parents. Most maternity leave in the private sector is unpaid. To date the Government has not been in a position to remove the existing reservation given that full implementation would require the introduction of maternity leave with payor with comparable social benefits throughout the country. However, the Accord Mark VII commits the Government to considering implementation of International Labour Organisation Convention 103 on Maternity Protection, which calls for at least 12 weeks of paid maternity leave to be made available to women in paid employment. ""Paid Maternity Leave: A DiscussionÂ· Paper on Paid Maternity Leave in Australia"" was published by the National Women's Consultative Council (the NWCC) in February 1993, based on research by the OSW. The discussion paper reviews and compares current maternity leave provisions in Australia with OECD counterparts, considers the possible benefits of introducing paid maternity leave in Australia, and presents a number of possible options incorporating different funding mechanisms for discussion, but does not make any specific recommendations. The NWCC and the OSW plan to convene a small seminar.on paid maternity leave later in 1993 to further stimulate policy debate on the issues. Racial Discrimination (Question No. 282) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: Further to his answers to questions Nos. 1324 (Hansard, 30 March 1992, page 1438), 1550 (Hansard, 24 June 1992, page 3876), 1846 (Hansard, 8 October 1992, page 1871) and 1847 (Hansard, 12 October 1992, page 1969), on what dates and in what terms has Australia made reports to the (a) Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and (b) Human Rights Committee on the legislative and administrative sequels to the litigaIn tion involving (i) John Koowarta,(ii) Eddie Mabo and (iii) Robert Bropho in the High Court, the Federal Court of Australia and the Supreme Courts of Queensland and Western Australia. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Australia has sUbmitted its Ninth Periodic for Report under Article 9 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The Report states in paragraphs 69-70, concerning the case of John Koowarta: ""69. In Australia's fourth periodic report the reference was made to the Archer River Pastoral Holding and the refusal by the then Queensland Government to grant or transfer the property to Mr John Koowarta. This refusal was held by the High Court on 11 May 1982 to be in contravention of the RDA. Mr Koowarta subsequently continued proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland against the Queensland Government. Mr Koowarta died on 29 August 1991 without gaining possession of the Archer River property or securing compensation for its conversion into a national park. Its conversion took place on 12 November 1987 by declaration in the Queensland Government Gazette. 70. On 19 December 1991, the Governor in Council declared Archer Bend National Park to be claimable land under the Aboriginal Land Act 1991. Members of Mr Koowarta's immediate and extended family are expected to be amongst those involved in the claim over the Archer Bend National Park."" The case of Eddie Mabo is addressed in paragraphs 60-64 of the Report: ""60. An issue which impacts directly on the lives and aspirations of all indigenous Australians is the decision of 3 June 1992 by the High Court of Australia in the case of Mabo and Others-vQueensland [No.2] (1992) 175 CLR 1 (the Mabo case). The Mabo case concerned the legal rights of the Meriam people to the lands of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait. The High Court held, by a 6 to 1 majority, that the common law of Australia recognises a form of native land title to be determined in accordance with indigenous law and custom. It rejected the notion that Australia was a terra nullius, that is, land belonging to no one; at the time of settlement, and that native title to the land did not survive the vesting of radical title in the Crown at British settlement. 61. The majority also held that native title is capable of being extinguished by indigenous peoples losing their traditional link to the land, or by inconsistent legislation or government actions. the case of the states and territories, any action that extinguishes native title must be in accordance with Commonwealth laws, in particular the RDA. Of most relevance are sections 9 and 10 of the RDA. In summary, section 9 makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction based on race which has the effect of impairing the enjoyment of any human right. Section 10 provides that where by reason of any law persons of a particular race do not enjoy rights enjoyed by persons of another race, then by force of that section the first mentioned persons enjoy that right to the same extent. 62. The decision is likely to be most relevant to those of Australia's indigenous peoples who continue to lead a traditionally orientated lifestyle and maintain a traditional connection with land where native title has not been extinguished by, for example, an invalid grant of an inconsistent interest in land by the Crown. 63. The majority judgement argues that the Court could not perpetuate a view of the common law which was unjust, out of step with international human rights, did not respect all Australians as equal before the law, and did not reflect historical reality. 64. The concept of native title is new to AustralConvention Ian law. The Australian Government has welcomed the decision and has recognised the complexity of the High Court's decision and its implications. These implications need to be considered carefully and as quickly as possible. The Government therefore has initiated consultations with State and Territory Governments, key Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and the mining and pastoral industries before deciding on the long term approach to the implications of the decision. A final report is to be available to the Government by September 1993 which will allow decisions to be taken which protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights and give benefits to all Australians. The Ninth Report refers to the legislative to the 1990 High Court decision in Bropho v State of Western Australia in paragraphs 77-78: ""77. Further to developments outlined in paragraph 112 of Australia's eighth report, in February 1992 the Western Australian Government announced that it would introduce amendments to the Aboriginal Heritage Act during 1992. These amendments were designed to address ihe protection of Aboriginal sites and objects and the related issue of the preservation of Aboriginal culture and heritage in Western Australia. The amendments also sought to address the involvement of Aboriginal people in such a process, and development approval processes. 78. Subsequently, the Western Australian Government announced that the introduction of the amendments to Parliament would be deferred until 1993. This followed expressions of concern from Aboriginal groups and sections of the mining industry concerning the proposals, and a request for more time to consider them. (b) Australia's second report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (lCCPR), which was submitted to the Human Rights Committee in February 1987, outlined the factual and legal issues in the Koowarta case. Australia's third report, which is currently being prepared by the Attorney-General's Department, will address issues arising under the Mabo decision. Education: Technical and Vocational (Question No. 284) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 34 (Hansard, 25 February 1992, page 106), has consultation with the States and Territories progressed sufficiently to permit ratification of the on Technical and Vocational Education adopted at the 25th session of the General Conference of Unesco on 10 November 1989. (2) Why did Australia not respond to the second questionnaire on technical and vocational education which was circulated for the purpose of a report to the General Conference at its 27th session commencing on 25 October 1993. Mr Free-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Federal Government has consulted with the States and Territories regarding ratification of sequels the Convention on Technical and Vocational Education. All States and Territories except New South Wales have supported the ratification by Australia of the Convention. Because of the New South Wales position the Federal Government has not ratified the Convention. (2) The second questionnaire on technical and vocational education was circulated by UNESCO in July 1990. The questionnaire sought information on additional measures which member countries had taken on the revised recommendation concerning technical and further education adopted by the UNESCO in 1974 and envisaged a report at the 26th General Conference in 1991. It would appear that this questionnaire was issued without reference to action taken by UNESCO in 1989 at its 25th General Conference to adopt the Convention on Technical and Vocational Education. Australia did not respond to the questionnaire as it believed it was overtaken by the adoption of the Convention the previous year. Education: Recognition of Qualifications (Question No. 285) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Employment, Education, and Training, upon notice, on 18 August 1993: (1) Which Countries has he visited as Minister Education. (2) Which foreign Ministers of Education have met him in Australia. (3) On which visits have he and his counterparts discussed bilateral or multilateral recognition of qualifications in higher education.",139
171,Mr BEAZLEY,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The countries I have visited as Minister for Education are: USA, 1992 and June 1993 Singapore, 1992 New Zealand, 1992 Indonesia, 1992 and 1993 Malaysia, 1993 United Kingdom, 1993 (2) The Ministers for Education who have met me in Australia are: USA: Mr Lamar Alexander, Secretary of Education, 1992 Malaysia: Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud, Minister of Education, 1992, 1993 People's Republic of China: Mr Liu Bin, ViceMinister of Education, 1992 (3) The issue of bilateral and multilateral recogvaluations nition of qualifications in higher education was discussed with the Malaysian Minister, Dr Daud, both on the occasion of his visit to Australia and my visit to Malaysia. The issue was also raised with the Singaporean Minister, Mr Lee Yock Suan. Capital Gains Tax (Question No. 294) Mr Truss asked the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 19 August 1993: (1) Was $13.8 million allocated in the 1992-93 Budget under the Fraser Island Structural Adjustment Assistance Program to offset the effect of the capital gains tax on compensation recipients. (2) What payments have been made from the allocation and to whom were they made. (3) What further payments will be made.",144
172,Mrs KELLY,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as fol1ow-: (1) Provision of $13.76 million was included in the 1992-93 Budget under the Fraser Island Structural Adjustment Package to offset the effect of capital gains and income tax liability of business compensation recipients. (2) The Commonwealth made a payment of $3 million to Queensland in 1992-93 in accordance with the agreement on taxation liability. Of this for amount, we understand Queensland has made three payments to date, totalling $72,648.30. Details of individual payments are confidential. (3) The majority of payments should be settled prior to 30 June 1994. However, this is dependent on when taxation returns are lodged by compensation recipients and when the assessments are levied and claims are made by the respective businesses. Official Establishments: Building and Land Valuations (Question No. 317)",144
173,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 31 August 1993: Have valuations been conducted which estimate the building and land value of (a) the Lodge, (b) Kirribilli House, (c) Government House and (d) Admiralty House; if so, in each case, (i) what were the last two valuations and (ii) when were they carried out.",144
174,Mr KEATING,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Valuation Office conducted valuations of the buildings and land of the Prime Ministerial official residences in 1991. No other of the residences have been carried out. (a) The Lodge: The property was valued on 30 June 1991 at $3,400,000, apportioned as follows: Improvements-$2,200,000 Land-$1,200,000 (b) Kirribilli House: The property was valued on 1 July 1991 at $13,100,000, apportioned as follows: Improvements-$1 ,100,000 Land-$12,000,000 (c) and (d) Government House and Admiralty House No recent valuations have been made of Government House or Admiralty House, but arrangements have been commenced for such valuations to be undertaken by the Australian Valuation Office, in preparation for the transition to accrual based accounting for reporting purposes in 1994-95. Prime Minister: New Official Residence (Question No- 319)",144
175,Mr CONNOLLY,TOTAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 31 August 1993: Have any estimates, feasibility studies or consultancy reports been (a) commissioned or (b) received on the construction of a new official Canberra residence for the Prime Minister; if so, in each case, (i) what form did it take, (ii) what did it cost, (iii) who conducted it, (iv) what recommendations did it make and (v) what is the estimated cost of implementing the recommendations.",144
176,Mr KEATING,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Committee on Official Establishments, which was appointed by the Fraser Government in 1976, recommended in its Final Report-May 1979, (tabled on 20 September 1979, Hansard pages 1360 -1361) that a site be reserved either at Attunga Point or at Stirling Ridge, Yarralumla, for the purposes of a future Prime Ministerial residence. Subsequently the Official Establishments Trust (the successor body to the Committee on Official Establishments) recommended that Stirling Ridge should be the site. The Trust noted, in its First Annual Report 1979-80, that it had taken into account the views of the former National. Capital Development Commission report entitled ""Site for a Future Official Residence for the Prime Minister of Australia"". The West Stirling Ridge site was agreed to in 1980 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. In 1988 ,the Trust recommended that the Stirling Ridge site be confirmed, that an environmental impact statement be commissioned and that the Trust be authorised to'develop planning proposals for a new building. An eight hectare area on West Stirling Ridge was confirmed as the site for any new residence and gazetted on 2 March 1989 as national land for future Commonwealth purposes. (i) On behalf of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) undertook a design study in 1989 to examine the feasibility of locating a new official residence on the West Stirling Ridge site, specifically to investigate and report on possible design approaches. NCPA engaged consultants to produce soundly based guidelines and principles for the development of the site. (ii) The consultants' work cost $5,000. (iii) The NCPA undertook the study and engaged John Andrews International Pty Ltd, Architects and Planners, to provide advice. (iv) The consultants recommended a 12 month program to develop a design for the project. (v) Based on preliminary concepts, the consultants estimated the design and construction of the residence would cost $7 million with an additional $4.5 million for site works (1989 dollars). In its 1991-92 and 1992-93 Annual Reports, the Official Establishments Trust expressed its view that there should be a new Prime Ministerial resideuce by the tum of the century. The Government has taken no decision to act on the Trust's recommendation. ' Australian Flag (Question No. 328) Mr Filing asked,the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 31 August 1993: (1) Will the Government conduct a campaign to persuade the public to accept a new Australian flag; if so, what will the campaign cost. (2) Has the GQvernment chosen a panel of persons to decide the best design for a new flag; if so, who has been chosen. (3) Will the design of the Australian flag be changed only after a national referendum is held on the issue.",145
177,Mr KEATING,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (3) see my answer on '4 November '1992 (Hansard, page 2663) to Parliamentary question No. 2009. (2) No. Australian Business College (Question No. 341)",145
178,Mr CAMERON,TOTAL,"the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 1 September 1993: (1) Has the Government refunded foreign students who attended the Australian Business College but not local stuqents; if so, (a) why, (b) how many overseas students were refunded and (c) what was the cost of refunding them. (2) How many local students who attended the College lost money as a result of it entering liquidation. (3) Will the Government refund local students; if not, why not.",145
179,Mr BEAZLEY,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has undertaken to provide assistance to overseas students who were affected by the Australian Business College (ABC), Perth, being placed into liquidation. (a) The decision to provide assistance to overseas students reflects the Commonwealth's responsibility for administering the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, and concern at the potential damage to Australia's reputation as a reliable provider of education and training services to overseas students. (b) Assistance is being provided in two forms: Tuition credit, equal to 65% of the tuition paid 1178 for by the student and not received, paid by the Commonwealth to the educational institution at which the student is enrolled to complete the course for which fees were paid to ABC. At present tuition assistance has been provided to 122 students attending 2 educational institutions. A further 159 Students have applied for tuition credit. A .full refund of fees to students who prepaid fees to the Australian Business College but who were unable to take up their course and who did not receive a refund from the College. Applications have been received from 131 overseas students. To date no refunds have been paid to these students. Four (4) students who left Australia after the Australian Busin- College went into liquidation, and before the assistance package was announced on 15 April J993, have applied for a refund. (c) The cost to date of tuition assistance is $153,078.81. (2) It is estimated that at the time of closure approximately 350 domestic students had paid fees or deposits for future courses. (3) The Government does not intend to refund local students. Australian Business College operated as a private business with accreditation as an educational institution given by the Western Australian State Government. Assistance to local students is matter for decision by the Western Australian State Government. Electric Chafing Dishes (Question No. 368)",145
