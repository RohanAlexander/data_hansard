8,Mr HUGHES,NOTICE OF WANT OF CONFIDENCE,All these notices of motions and questions gravitate around this one matter.

15,Mr BAMFORD,AIR SERVICE BETWEE N LONDON,"the Prime of Lord Minister, upon notice I. Whether a dictation test, as prescribed section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act, is being, or has been, applied to immigrants arriving in the Commonwealth from any part of Southern Europe; if eo, during what years has the test been applied? 2. If a test has been applied, will he say to any which immigrants, and from which country 3. Further, will he say if any persons were for prevented from entering the Commonwealth because of a failure to interpret the words dictated; and, if so, were any such persons immigrants from Southern Europe?",14
16,Mr HUGHES,AIR SERVICE BETWEE N LONDON,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. It is not, and has not been, the practice to apply a dictation test to immigrants from Southern Europe, but in a limited number of cases it has been deemed advisable to do so. 2. The only instances in which the test has f 12 been applied to Southern Europeans are the following:to one Italian (arriving from Ceylon) in 1913, to a number of Maltese (arriving from Malta by one vessel) in 1916, and to one Italian (arriving from Italy) in 1922. 3. Yes. Jn the case of the Southern Europeans tested all were restricted, in the first place, but practically all were subsequently allowed to land. OLD-AGE PENSIONS . PENSIONERS INDUKWICHASYLUM .",14
17,Dr MALONEY,AIR SERVICE BETWEE N LONDON,"the Treasurer, vpon noticeDo old-age pension citizens resident in Dun- to £9,168. wich Asylum, Brisbane, receive the same treatment an pensioners in regard to money payments as those who ore patients in hospitals; if not, what are the reasons?",15
18,Mr BRUCE,AIR SERVICE BETWEE N LONDON,"The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follow:Every |>ensioner resident in Dumvich or other Benevolent Asylum receives a pension of 2s. per week for hiB own personal use. in addition, the Commonwealth pays the institution 10s. fid. per week for his maintenance. When a pensioner becomes an inmate of a hospital, his penmen must be suspended in accordance with section 45 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. If the pensioner is discharged within twenty-eight days, he is paid the full pension for that period."" If he is an inmate for more than twenty-eight days, he is paid twenty-eight days' pension on discharge. No payment is made for the maintenance of the pensioner during the twenty-ei^ht days in respect of which he receives pension, but thereafter, until he is discharged, the Commonwealth pays 10s. fid. per week towards his maintenance in the hospital. The reason for the difference is that pensioners in benevolent asylums are usually permanent inmates, while those in hospitals stay there for only short periods. It is thought proper that on discharge the latter should receive full pension in respect of twentycharge eight days spent in the institution, so that they may have extra comforts during convalescence.

TELEPHONES : PROPOSALS IN . 1916.  the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) asked me the following 1. What tenders and requisitions for telephone intallatione, construction, materials, and stores were submitted by the PoatmasterCeneral to the Treasury in the year 1916, and rejected? S. What waa the price of the materials comprised in such tenders. 8. What is the present price of the same materials? , I promised that the informatio n wonld be obtained, and now f u r n is h the following replies:.1. The New Telegraph and Telephone WorkB Estimates for 1916-17, as presented to the Treasury, amounted to f l , 142,000, hut only £647,000 was made available. The value of material and equipment (for some of which tenders had been received) included in the foregoing was approximately £912,000, which bad to be reduced to approximately £520,000. 2. See No. 1. 3. Based upon current market rates, the present price of the some materials would average 50 per cent, higher, or, say, £1,368,000 and £780,000 respectively.

25,Mr BRUCE,BUREAU OF SCIENCEAN D,"Yesterday the honourable member for Wilmo t asked whether it was the custom of the Taxation Department, when taxpayers inadvertently overstated their income, to allow such persons to pay the full .amount. I see in reports in the newspapers this morning a suggestion that since I became Treasurer an alteration has in some way been made in regard to such cases of overpayment. I wish to correct that impression, .and to state to the House that the officers of the Taxation Department have always worked under definite instructions from the Commissioner that their duty is to xectify all errors in taxpayers' returns, whether for or against the revenue.

Yesterday I recorded a vote in favour of the adjournment of the debate on the sugar question moved by one of the Ministers, and my consistency in so doing has been called in question by one of our daily newspapers this morning. On the previous day of sitting I voted for an amendment, moved by the .honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton)., that the price of sugai be reduced to 4 i d . per l b . , and 1 did so as a protest against the failure of the Government to supplv us with such figures as would enable us to say whether or not such reduction may be made. In regard to my vote yesterday for the adjournment of the debate, I desire to say that I gave it on the. assurance of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Rodgers) that the figures for which I have been asking would be supplied today. It was on that distinct assurance that I supported the motion for the adjournment; otherwise I should have voted against it . ADJOURNMENT. MOTION OF CENSURE.",16
