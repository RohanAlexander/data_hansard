3,Mr FULLER,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"Because of the acute of wire netting in country areas, which makes it impossible for landowners to cope with the rabbit pest and Parliato comply with the demands of the the Pastures Protection Board for the destruction of rabbits, as well as the many which prosecutions that have been instituted recently on account of failure in that respect, will the Minister for Works and Housing ask the State authorities to do all that they can to speed up deliveries of wire netting in country areas ?",11
4,Mr LEMMON,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"The manufacture of wire and wire netting is still suffering from the effects of the war. Whereas in pre-war years about 12,000 tons of wire was produced annually, of which a fair proportion was exported, at present only about 7,8.00 tons is being produced each year. In the circumstances, the Government has prohibited the export of wire and wire netting. About twelve months ago my department took over the control of the manufacture and distribution of wire used in making wire netting with the result that the production has practically doubled. The Government is encouraging the manufacture of wire for essential purposes and has received assurances that additional factories for the manufacture of this commodity will be established. One new factory is expected to commence production by the end of this year, and it is hoped that Australia will soon again enter the export market for this commodity. WAGE-PEGGING.",12
5,Mr HARRIS ON,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"Can the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that the Government has altered the wage-pegging regulations to provide that employees who claim that the nature of their work has been altered, or that additional duties have been imposed on them, may receive added emoluments? Is he also aware that effect has been given to the altered regulations by many shire and municipal councils? If so, what action does the Government propose to take in connection with Commonwealth Public Service employees?",12
6,Mr CHIFLEY,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"It is a fact that the wage-pegging regulations have been altered, but at this stage I do not propose to go into details, except to say that the alterations permit any industrial tribunal to make marginal increases within the limits prescribed by the formula.",12
7,Mr HAHRISON,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,And also local governing bodies ?,12
8,Mr CHIFLEY,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"I am not aware of the matters to which the honourable member has referred. All industrial tribunals have that power. So far as I know, practically all shire and municipal councils in New South Wales are working under State awards. Commonwealth Public Service employees are in precisely the same position; the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator can, on application by the unions covering such employees, increase within the limits of the formula, the marginal payments to such employees. The unions covering Commonwealth Government employees number 22, and they have presented a claim to the Public Service Commissioner, but not to the Public Service Arbitrator. It was realized that that number of unions could not be heard separately, and so the High Council of the Public Service unions- a body representing 22 unions of Commonwealth Government employees-requeste d that five representatives of the High Council - should meet the Public Service Commissioner, and myself if necessary, to discuss their claim. It was Dointed out that postal employees were not affiliated with the High Council, and. it was decided to ask their representative, Mr. Dwyer, the federal secretary, to join with the representatives of the High Council in discussing the matter with the Public Service Board, and with me, as the Minister administering the Public Service. The discussions began on the 14th February, and ' have continued. The representatives of the unions again met the Public Service Commissioner last week. Certain offers were made regarding adjustments, and I understand that they have referred the matter to their unions. So far, no claim has been submitted to the Public Service Arbitrator, who is the person to determine the matter, but I understand that a move will be made very shortly. I cannot give the honourable member any further information at this stage. TELEPHONE SERVICES. AUTOMAT IC EXCHANGE FOR TOOWONG.",12
9,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,Can the Minister representing the Postmaster General state when the automatic telephone exchange at Toowong will be completed? Will the Minister see that instructions are issued to responsible officers that sufficient equipment is installed in the exchange to enable all residents of the Toowong district to have the benefit of the automatic service at the same time as this convenience is long overdue?,12
10,Mr CALWELL,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"I shall be happy to ask the Postmaster-General to provide answers to the questions asked by the honourable member for Brisbane, whom everybody is delighted to see back in his place - Mr SHEEHY - Will the Minister TAX REDUCTION.",13
11,Mr FADDEN,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"Will the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that when he promised to consider the claim of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions that taxation should be reduced as a step towards relieving industrial tension, he submitted impressive Treasury figures to support his argument in opposition to any tax reduction at this stage? If so, will he inform the House of the nature figures, and will he make the same figures and data available to me?",13
12,Mr CHIFLEY,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"About twelve exact months ago, when discussions were with union representatives, I did circulate some figures relating specifically to taxafollow:tion, but I presume that the right honourable gentleman is referring to something that took place in recent months.",13
13,Mr FADDEN,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,In recent weeks.,13
14,Mr CHIFLEY,ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY HIS MAJESTY,"I can give the right - honourable gentleman an assurance that T. have not submitted in writing any figures at all. It is true that on sion, when representatives of the Ausin tralasian Council of Trade Unions were in Canberra, they raised the subject taxation, but I cannot remember whether participate. it related specifically to taxation of incomes under £300 a year. I do not it did. As I remember it, the president the Australasian Council of Trade Unions asked me for information about any posed tax reductions, and it is made some remarks on the subject, but I did not submit any figures. I may have mentioned some amount in what was very short talk, lasting five minutes haps. The Minister for Health (Senator MCKenna) addressed a union conference in Melbourne, and I think he discussed taxation, and submitted some figures, but no proposals regarding taxation were made by Senator MCKenna or by me. As for the second part of the right honourable gentleman's question, I am always delighted to give him all the information I possibly can. NA COMMISSION. , MOTOR VEHICLES. representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping state how many motor cars from the Army, Navy and Air Force released through the Commonwealth Disposals Commission have been allocated to South Australia? Will he supply the names of the firms in the trade that have handled these vehicles; and will he also state the order of priorities for the supply of the vehicles?",13
15,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"As the honourable of the member advised me that he would be seeking information on these matters, I took the opportunity of ascertaining the position from the Minister for Supheld ply and Shipping. The answers supplied to me by the Minister are as 1. Accurate information regarding the total number of cars declared to the Commission is not readily available. Declarations of cars is infinitesimal compared with .other types of motor transport vehicles. Twenty-one cars only have been declared to the Commission by the Deone occapartments of the Navy, Army and Air South Australia, and declarations of purely nominal quantities in other States of would not entitle South Australia to 2. Of the 21 cars in South Australia, think Commonwealth departments have abof sorbed nine and State departments four. Of the balance, six were marketed to the proFord Company, and two to General true that I Motors-Holdens Limited. 3. Priority to purchase for all cars is controlled by the Directorate of Emera gency Road Transport, which gives full perconsideration to each application, allocating vehicles according to the urgency of the need. Preference within priorities is given to ex-servicemen. For the honourable gentleman's inforclaims mation, the cars declared would exceed 2 per cent, of total motor transmaintenance. port vehicles made available to the Commission. A check is being made of total declarations in all States. The releases in Victoria are 14,870 trucks and 288 cars. Many of the cars declared are wrecks which can be used only for recovery of components. POTATOES.",13
16,Dame ENID LYONS,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House of the Government'3 intention in regard to the disposal of potatoes grown on acreages allotted under the 1947 scheme, but for the disposal which no contracts were signed?  of Australian potato-growers have signed contracts with the Australian Potato matter ? Committee. A small number of growers in Tasmania, however, have refused to sign such contracts. Under the regulapriate tions applying to the marketing of potatoes those growers will be required to market their crops at ruling prices fixed by the Prices Commissioner. NA AGREEMENT.",14
17,Mr WILLIAMS,FEDERAL AID ROADS,"In view of the that deplorable condition and the urgent for the construction or reconstruction many country roads, will the Government give consideration to the need for increasing the amount of money paid by the Commonwealth to the States under the Federal Aid Roads Agreement?",14
18,Mr CHIFLEY,FEDERAL AID ROADS,"As the honourable member knows, the Federal Aid Roads Agreement terminates on the 30th June next. The Minister for Transport and sub-committee of Cabinet have been examindustry ining the agreement in order to ascertain whether it should be continued, and so, in what form, and what amount should be paid to the States under it. tunity has been taken to hear the views of the various authorities associated road transport, and the Minister for Transport has discussed the matter the State Transport Advisory Council, and with representatives of those shires and municipalities which are' making for some share of the moneys set not aside for road construction and Representations have also been made in the matter by other bodies, including the Royal Automobile Club. I hope that within the next week the Government will be able to announce it3 decision in regard to the allocation of moneys for this purpose. NA WAR.",14
19,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Has the Minister for Externa] Affairs received a request from representatives of ex-service men and women who were prisoners of Avar in the hands of the Japanese that he demand of reparations on their behalf from Japan? Has any action been taken in this direction; if not, what does the right honourable gentlemen propose to do in the",14
20,Dr EVATT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The claims that have been made will be considered at the approtime, when peace negotiations in relation to Japan are being conducted. The matter will be taken up first with the Government of the United Kingdom and other British governments, and then with governments of the Allied Nations. I shall keep the honourable member and the House informed of what is being done in this matter. It must be quite obvious when claims of this nature are purneed sued we must act jointly with other of allied countries concerned. COAL.",14
21,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Can the Prime Minister say whether it is a fact that the Central Council of the Australian Ooal and Shale Employees' Federation has indicated to the Government the likelihood of a a general stoppage in the coal-mining on the 28th of this month unless the Joint Coal Board, for which proi f vision was made in recent legislation, starts to function? Is it a fact that, An opporthe personnel of this board has to be endorsed by the Prime Minister with and the Premier of New South Wales? If so, will the right honourable gentleman with endeavour to expedite the matter in order to obviate the industrial troubles which I believe could be eliminated by the new body?",14
22,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"It is true that the personnel of the Joint Coal Board has to be approved by the Premier of New South Wales and myself as also has the person selected to act as a Coal Industry Tribunal, which is the industrial authority under the relevant legislation. Great difficulty has been experienced by the Premier of New South Wales and myself in getting suitable men to occupy the positions. Apparently there was a general fear that the task of maintaining peace in this troublous industry would be very difficult. Ultimately, three men were selected and their names announced, and nearly every part of the act has been proclaimed. There has been a little delay in the gazettal of the names of the members of the Joint Coal Board due to some legal difficulty in regard to the terms of the agreement with these particular individuals, but the chairman actually commenced his preparatory work on the 1st January, and, I understand, the other members, although their names have not yet been gazetted, are engaged in surveying the position. I am hopeful that these names will be gazetted within the next week. Some difficulty has been experienced also in connection with the appointment of a Coal Industry Tribunal. The appointment is for seven years, and as certain legal qualifications are necessary, an endeavour has been made, to secure the services of a member of the legal profession, acceptable to both the Premier of New South Wales and myself. I hope to be able to make an announcement in regard to the tribunal tomorrow night. It is true that I have received information about the possibility of a general strike in the industry. It is not the first mation of that. character that I have received. FOOD FOR BRITAIN .",15
23,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"In view of the acute food crisis in Great Britain and of the good example set by the people of Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Argentina, who have sent gifts offood to that country, will the Prime Minister see whether a better governmental effort to help the British people is not possible? Will he consider setting up an all-party parliamentary committee to inquire into ways and means of increasing food shipments?",15
24,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Answerin g questions of a similar character previously I intimated, I think, that all the food that could possibly be spared was being sent to Britain. It is true that at one particular period the British Government was not able to provide shipping for additional sugar that was offered.",15
25,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That was three years ago.,15
26,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That , was when the late Mr Curtin was Prime Minister. It is also true that there has been a back log in regard to the shipping of sugar. In some cases the British Government has arranged to divert sugar and obtain supplies from the West Indies. Every possible effort is being made to provide Britain with all the food that can be sent.",15
27,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,What about New Zealand ?,15
28,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Rationin g in Australia in order to provide food for Britain is as severe as it is in Canada and probably more severe than in New Zealand. I will consider the honourable member's suggestion that a. parliamentary committee be set up. ELECTORAL ROLLS. ALLEGED IRREGULARITIES. - Mr JOHNSON (Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior) [3.27] - On the 8th November, 1946, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) asked the Prime Minister questions relating to published allegations that the inti- electoral rolls used in the Ashfield by-election held on the 9th November, 1946, contained the names of more than 1,000 persons who did not live in the electorate. The Prime Minister instructed me as the Minister responsible for the administration of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to have an investigation made with the object of ascertaining whether there was any truth in the allegations. Accordingly, the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth was directed to undertake a searching inquiry. I lay on the table the following paper, which shows the result of the investigations of the Chief Electoral Officer:Electoral Rolls for certain sub-divisions of Martin and Parkes-Allege d irregularities - Repor t by Chief Electoral Officer, and move That the paper be printed. Debate (on motion by Mr HARRISON) adjourned. LINSEED.",15
29,Mr CLARK,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"In view of the grave shortage of linseed supplies in Australia, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture make representations to the State Departments of Agriculture through the appropriate Ministers to increase production of linseed throughout Australia ?  make the necessary representations to the State Departments of Agriculture. I understand that Meggitts Limited, of Sydney, is already taking some steps by which it is supplying seed to certain people from whom in turn it will buy the linseed. I believe that the State Departments of Agriculture and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will give every possible assistance. The Commonwealth Department of Commerce and Agriculture will cooperate. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. PREFERENCE IN EMPLOYMENT-RURA L TRAINING .OF EX-SERVICEMEN.",16
30,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Certain sections of. the Re-establishment and Employment Act provide for the granting of preference in employment to persons who were not members of the fighting forces. ""Will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction inform me how many persons who were not members of the services have been granted preference in employment to date? Will he lay on the table of the House all the relevant papers in connection with their applications for and the granting of preference?",16
31,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I shall obtain for the honourable member as speedily as possible the information that he requires. At the moment, I understand, the number of individuals to whom preference has been granted and who are not ex-service personnel, is extremely small.",16
32,Mr DUTHIE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Ex-serviceme n who are undergoing rural training will shortly complete their training, but many of the farms that are being prepared for them will not be in production for from twelve months to two years. During this interim period, hardship will be caused to many of the trainees, especially married men, who may not be able to obtain employment on farms. Will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction state whether the Government has any plans to assist such men, either financially or in any other way, during that waiting period?",16
33,Mr DEDMAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The point raised by the honourable member arises in regard to the training of all classes of ex-servicemen. I have previously explained to the House that it is the intention and the objective of those who are in charge of the training scheme to have a flow of trainees coming out into the community at a rate at which they can be absorbed. It is not always possible to ensure that the number of trainees being released for any particular industry will coincide exactly with the number that can be absorbed in that industry. Perhaps the trouble is more acute in respect of agriculture than it is in respect of other industries. One reason why it is impossible to ensure that all the trainees will be placed in industry or, in connection with agriculture, will be placed on farms, is that the necessary accommodation, and the training staffs needed for their training, are not available except in so far as they can be obtained from State governments. Consequently, we have to ensure that the existing training facilities in the States shall be used continuously. This means that ex-servicemen must enter those training institutions in batches. Sometimes, when a number of men have completed their training it is not possible to absorb all of them immediately or, in respect of men proposing to go on the land, it is not possible to place them on farms immediately. The Government has considered that those individuals who cannot be placed in appropriate industries immediately their training has been completed ought to take every opportunity to find employment for themselves. They are encouraged to do so. At the present time, of course, more jobs are available in the community than there are men to fill them. Perhaps it is rather hard to expect individuals who have been trained for settlement on the land to take a job of some other kind. I shall examine that point, with a view to determining whether special' consideration can be given to trainees in that class. I point out, however, that in the last resort, since there are plenty of jobs available in the community, no absolute hardship is caused, because those men can obtain employment of some kind to bridge the gap between the completion of their training and the availability of their farms for settlement by them. ARMED FORCES. CONCESSION FARES.",16
34,Mr SHEEHAN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I ask the Minister for the Army whether it is a fact that State governments have discontinued concessional fares on trams and trains, which had been granted to members of the fighting services? As service perarranging sonnel receive only a small deduction of the allotment made to their dependants, will the honourable gentleman consider the advisability of granting travelling allowance to members of the the question. forces, in addition to their service pay?",17
35,Mr CHAMBERS,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"It is a fact that the various State governments have withdrawn the concession fares on trams trains which, after the outbreak of World War II . , they had granted to service personnel. This action was brought to my notice recently, and I have made representations to the State governments with a view to having the concessions reintroduced. I hope to be able, at later date, to inform the honourable memas ber that the States have complied with my request. FRUIT CANNING.",17
36,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Is the Prime Minisquestion. ter aware that because of the shortage refined sugar, some fruit canneries in Victoria are obliged to refuse to accept pears for canning at the present time? At the moment, this statement applies, not to every cannery but to several important ones, and it is expected that within several days, every cannery Victoria will be compelled to cease the canning of pears and peaches. Is the Prime Minister aware that if this shortage of refined sugar is not overcome, thousands of tons of peaches and pears, which are valuable items of food, will be lost to the Australian public and the people of the United Kingdom ? Does the right honourable gentleman know that this position arises as the result of 21 maintenance engineers in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited in Melbourne ceasing work? They acted upon the direction of their union, not because of any specific dispute that they have with the company which employs them, but because of the extension of a dispute with other employers. Will the Prime Minister state whether the Government has taken any action to expedite the return to work of these men in order ' to avoid monetary loss to fruit-growers, the loss of employment to orchard and cannery workers, and the loss of valuable food ? In addition, has the Prime Minister done anything, as an emergency step, to make good this shortage of sugar by for the transport of supplies sum after the from other States?",17
37,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Minister for a Labour and National Service will answer,17
38,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria, and Mr Cain, have been and still are negotiating for the purpose of obtaining refined sugar from other States. I understand that some thousands of tons have been guaranteed, if not already delivered. The honourable member asked whether anything has been done to get a the maintenance engineers back to work, their absence from employment is the real cause of the shortage of refined sugar in Victoria. Before I answer that, I suggest that the honourable member does not know all the facts, and should not have introduced that matter into a I do not desire to enter into a of discussion of that phase of it. He had no reason to do so.' If we investigated that phase of the matter, I should have to inform the honourable member that the company was a party to a lock-out.",17
39,Mr MCEWE N,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Not the Colonial in Sugar Refining Company Limited.,17
40,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Yes , it was. However, that is not the answer to the question; the honourable member introduced that point.",18
41,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"That is the "" red herring"".",18
42,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The honourable member dragged in the "" red herring"", and I could not let his reference pass without comment. The honourable member asked whether the Government had taken any steps to get the maintenance engineers back to work. The answer is that the Government has taken action. The matter has been referred to the court, as the honourable member probably knows, and Judge Sugerman-a n appropriate name in this dispute-ha s referred it to Commissioner Mooney. The Commissioner called the parties together on Monday and told them that he had been requested to hear their claims and make a decision. He said that he would do so and commenced the hearing. Thenand this answers the honourable gentleman's question-Commissione r Mooney suggested that the hearing be suspended temporarily to ascertain whether an arrangement could be made for the men to resume work at the sugar refinery immediately. He suggested that the parties work out a formula which would enable the 30 men concerned-no t 21 as stated by the honourable member-to go back to the refinery so as to relieve the which is as urgent as the honourable member has said. The parties then met in an attempt to evolve a means of getting the men back to work on a "" blank cheque"" basis before the commissioner came to a decision. The parties had three difficulties to overcome. The first was whether the men would be paid, according to the final decision made by the commissioner, retrospectively to the day when they returned to the refinery. The second related to annual leave payments for the men, who wished to ensure that the break would not interfere with their rights. The third related to payments from the provident fund to which all employees at the refinery contribute. The men wished to have their rights in that regard safeguarded also. They have not been able to secure a satisfactory settlement on these three points, on which agreement ought to be reached. In nine out of ten instances in disputes of this nature, such difficulties are ironed out, usually without any trouble. Until 1.30 p.m. today, the parties had not found a solution of the problems raised, but they will be called together again by the commissioner tomorrow and I believe and hope that he will help to work out a' formula which will enable the men to go back to work.",18
43,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,The Minister suggests that the whole responsibility rests with the company.,18
44,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,Not the whole responsibility.,18
45,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,That is the way the honourable gentleman is framing his answer.,18
46,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"No . The men have been asked to go back to work before a decision is made in connection with the general engineers' dispute. They may or may not get a satisfactory award. They have been asked to do so on account of the urgency of the sugar position. This would amount to them returning to work on a "" blank cheque "" basis. I consider that they were justified in asking that their leave payments and provident fund contributions should be safeguarded, and that the retrospective payment of any increase should be promised to them before they agreed to return to work. situation, That was a. fair request.",18
47,Mr BEALE,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,They are breaking the law.,18
48,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited broke the law when it locked them out. The position now is that the parties to the dispute will go before Commissioner Mooney again tomorrow, and I believe that he will find a formula where others have failed. NA SERVICES.",18
49,Dr GAHA,TASMANIA N SHIPPING,"I understand that the passenger and cargo vessel Ormiston, which operates between the mainland and Hobart, is to be taken off that run after its next trip. The service which it provides is necessary to Tasmania's sea-borne passenger and cargo trade. If it be the intention of the Minister for Supply and Shipping to remove that ship from the Tasmanian service, will he ensure that a vessel of equivalent value in terms of both passenger and cargo carrying capacity shall replace it forthwith?",18
50,Mr DEDMAN,TASMANIA N SHIPPING,I shall ask the Minister for Supply and Shipping to do what he can to comply with the honourable member's request. PUBLIC SERVICE. NA COMMITTEE .,19
51,Mr ABBOTT,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"I ask the Prime Minister whether a large delegation from the New South Wales, Queensland and Victorian branches of the Commonwealth Public Service Basic .Wage and Salaries Agitation Committee has been in Canberra yesterday today in regard to an increase of the wages and salaries of Commonwealth public servants, and that he has refused to grant an interview to its members. If there grave discontent among them? Do they complain of great delay having occurred in the hearing of a claim by the Public Service Arbitrator? Will the Prime Minister appoint a delegate Public Service Arbitrator to hear immediately the case of the officers represented by the delegation, and issue to him instructions to bring down an interim flat-rate award and then to proceed to the making of a final award and a re-classification of the Commonwealth Public Service?",19
52,Mr CHIFLEY,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"Apparently the that honourable gentleman was not present when I made a statement on this matter reply to a previous question; or, if he present, he did not listen to what I said.",19
53,Mr ABBOTT,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,It did not apply to what I am now asking.,19
54,Mr CHIFLEY,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"In reply to the honourable member for Wentworth, I pointed out that, following upon the reReconstruction. laxation of the wage-pegging regulations, approximately 22 unions representing the tatives Public Service presented claims to Public Service Commissioner. RepeatGeneva ing what I said earlier, they realized that it was not possible for 22 separate unions to be consulted.",19
55,Mr ABBOTT,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,What about the rank and filers?,19
56,Mr CHIFLEY,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"If the honourable gentleman expects me to answer his quesappointed. tion, he should listen to what I have to say. The High Council represents 22 unions in the Public Service, and I assume that quite a number of rank and filers are members of those unions. It has been pointed out that the postal workers are not affiliated with that body. The High Council appointed five representatives, and the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union appointed one representative. Those representatives of Public Sen'ice unions have had numerous consultations with the Public Service Commissioner. I have always been available to meet them, if necessary, and discussed the matter with them at an earlier stage. A further final consultation was held last week, when certain suggestions were placed before the representatives of and the unions. There is not, as yet, any claim before the Public Service Arbitrator, but I understand that one will be lodged very shortly- I do not know the exact dateby all the unions. Those unions that have made representations are the official representatives of all the Public Service bodies. of the INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT . AUSTRALIAN REPRESENTATION.",19
57,Mr RANKIN,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"Did the Prime Minister, when announcing Australia's representation at the second meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the World Trade and Employment Conference, say there would be three representatives of primary industries? If so, will the in right honourable gentleman inform the were House of the manner in which those three representatives will be appointed, and is he in a position to state the names of the three men concerned? «",19

59,Mr DEDMAN,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,The three represenof primary producers who will be the appointed to the delegation to go to for consultation and advisory purposes will be selected by a conference of individuals who are representatives of the different primary producing organizations. Those organizations have been asked to get together and to come to an agreement as to the delegates to be - BRETTON WOODS AGREEMENT.,19
60,Mr GULLETT,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"I ask the Minister for External Affairs a question arising out of a statement made by the Minister for Transport in Sydney in December last. Addressing a meeting of his constituents, the Minister for Transport said, "" No one is capable of judging whether Australia should be a party to the Bretton Woods Agreement or not unless in possession of the confidential files which were in the hands of the Federal Cabinet"".

Negotiations with the other State Governments will Indonesians continue, and it is hoped that a perrepatriated. centage of the materials available will be allocated to the construction of war service homes.

They were sentenced to terms of imprisonment; but last year the Dutch Government granted them an amnesty. The Dutch military authorities handed the men over to the Australian Government for repatriation to Indonesia Avhen shipping was available. As in the case of other Indonesians in Australia, these men refused to sail in Dutch ships, and the CommonAvealth Government thought that the best and most humane way to deal with the problem was to care for them until such time as British or Australian shipping was available to take them back to Indonesia.

71,Mr CALWELL,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"No . The Commonwealth Government is anxious to see the end of this problem, which is one of many which arose out of the war. The maintenance of these Indonesians is costing the people of Australia about £200 a week. There is no cost for guards, because the men in the camp are law-abiding, and are giving the authorities no trouble. WHEAT. SALE TO NEW ZEALAND.",21
72,Mr FULLER,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"Can the Minister for greater than 5s. 9d. Commerce and Agriculture say whether any negotiations have been entered into recently with the Government of New Zealand in relation to future wheat contracts ?  Zealand Minister, Mr Sullivan, visited Australia in December, 1945, and asked whether Australia could supply New Zealand with wheat for a period of five years at an agreed uniform price. It was recognized that if such an arrangement were made it would have to be at a price much lower than the rate being obtained for export wheat at the time-9s . 6d. a bushel f.o.b - but , on the other hand, it would be much higher than that to which, based on past records, prices might be expected to fall during the period of the agreement. The New Zealand Minister also pointed out that very high import prices would be followed by high prices for the New Zealand crop, and that even though very low prices followed, uneconomic duction in New Zealand would be stimuwould lated, and imports reduced in conthe sequence. The Commonwealth Government ultiment. mately decided, however, that it could sell from the then current crop-1945 46-unde r the ruling export price and a contract was completed for 4,500,000 bushels to be supplied out of that crop at 9s. 6d. a bushel f.o.b. bulk. The tract contained other details such extra price for bagged wheat and shipping arrangements. When this contract was under discussion the question of supplies for the following four years arose, and it was agreed that in due course a further agreement be negotiated. In discussing the price that might be included in a further agreement, we agreed that a fall in export prices was possible and that if prices did fall away in the following twelve months from the then current price, the price for four years would be a matter for discussion. It wasagreed, however, that the price would be no higher than 5s. 9d. a bushel. It might be less but it would not be more. No other details were decided upon and no contract was made as in the case of the 1945-46 crop, the understanding being that it would be negotiated later and if it were made the price would be no When Mr Nash, the New Zealand Minister for Finance, was recently in Australia he had with him the New Zealand Wheat Controller and a contract was then negotiated and approved. Its' e New main clauses are as follows:(1) Australia to supply all New Zealand's requirements over the four years 1946-47 to 1949-50. (2) A maximum of 4,500,000 bushels would be supplied out of each season's crop at 5s. 9d. a bushel f.o.b. bulk. (3) Any quantity supplied above 4,500,000 from any one season's crop would be at a price to be negotiated. (4) New Zealand would not take less than 3,500,000 bushels from any one of the four seasons' crops. In reviewing the whole of the circumstances, the Commonwealth Government prodecided that over the four seasons, it return current prices to the grower, outcome of the contract .with the New Zealand Government being on account of the Commonwealth Govern The Wheat Board will therefore not be paid by the Commonwealth Govern- ment for each cargo at the export price ruling at the date arrangements are concluded by the Wheat Board for the shipment of the wheat and the Commonwealth conGovernment will be paid by the New as the Zealand Government at 5s 9d.",21
73,Mr MCEWEN,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"by leave-The statement read by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture reveals for the first time to the wheat-growers and the public the attempt which was apparently made by the Commonwealth Government to sell product which, in all equity, belonged the Australian wheat-growers, much less than half of its realizable value on any normal export market. This matter raises the whole question of the propriety of any government in this country arbitrarily taking possession of the products of persons and arbitrarily disthe posing of them, by virtue of tional power, at prices substantially less than those which could have been had ordinary trading been permitted. This matter would never have come to the knowledge of the Australian wheat growers ",21

75,Mr MCEWEN,BASIC WAGE AND SALARIES AGITATION,"I take no exception to the interjection. We are accustomed to interjections of that kind from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I repeat that this matter would never have come to the knowledge of the Australian wheat-growers had not the New Zealand Minister for Supply fortuitously revealed, to the embarrassment of his Labour colleague in the Australian Government, that an "" undertaking ""-to use his own words - ha d been given by the Australian Government to supply wheat to New Zealand, for a period of years, at a price less than half the prevailing world parity price. Over a period of months, I asked repeatedly in this Parliament for information about this matter, and the wheat growers' representatives outside Parliament also sought information. We asked whether any negotiations had taken place with a view to disposing of wheat to the Government of New Zealand at the price mentioned. However, we were met by a stone wall of silence, and only now has it been possible for me, and the representatives of the growers associated with me, to force the Government to recant its original intention, and conclude an arrangement which honours the undertaking to sell wheat to New Zealand at a bargain price by placing on the Australian taxpayers the burden of making good to the wheat-growers the money of which they would have been deprived had we not been attentive to their interests, and directed public attention in such a a way as to compel the granting to of this measure of delayed justice to the at a price Australian wheat-grower.
