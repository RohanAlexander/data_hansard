1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Treasurer",11
2,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. In December 1991, the honourable member for Werriwa, John Kerin, lost his job as Treasurer because, although honest, he was incompetent. In August 1993, the Treasurer has proved both incompetent and bereft of credibility. When will he resign?",11
3,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That question does not even deserve an answer. Budget 1993-94,11
4,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is he aware of comments that this year's budget provides too much stimulus to the economy? Does the government agree that lower deficits are needed and would such deficits be responsible particularly given the slow growth in the world economy?,11
5,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice the Leader of the Opposition saying on radio in the last day it is even more irresponsible than before. The honourable member for Mayo said that, clearly, fiscal irresponsibility will remain the hallmark of this government. This is for a budget over which the opposition is saying it will oppose revenue measures to bring the budget deficit down to around one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. I remind the House that the budget has two features to it: one is to provide a stimulus this year, that is, to further maintain the growth in the Mr Thckey-Which budget are you referring to-mark 1 or 2?",11
6,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I call the Prime Minister.,11
7,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am trying to be heard.,11
8,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,11
9,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,11
10,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Listen, Yorga, just keep your place. Those opposite know their place; all of them. It is over there. The budget provides a stimulus of $2 billion this year, which is about the size of the One Nation stimulus of 18 months ago. Of the 2'/2 per cent GDP growth in 1992-93, one percentage point, or just on half of the growth in the economy, came from public demand. So the government's policy of lifting public demand and stimulating the economy has paid off to give us a growth rate equal to that of the United States. As wel.l as that, in this budget we continue that stimulus with the tax cutswhich add another $2 billion to the stimulus but which still bring the budget deficit down to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Last week the OECD's statistics came out. They showed that Australia's share of taxes to GDP is the lowest in the industrial world. We find that in the Economist the growth that we have at the moment for this year is forecast at 2.6 per cent for Australia and 2.6 per cent for the United States. But honourable members should listen to all of the other countries: Belgium plus 0.8 per cent; Canada 1.7 per cent; France minus 1.2 per cent; Germany minus 2.8 per cent; Holland minus 0.6 per cent; Italy minus 0.9 per cent; Japan minus 0.3 per cent; Spain minus 1.1 per cent; Sweden minus 3.9 per cent; Switzerland that minus 1.1 per cent; and the United Kingdom plus 1.5 per cent. What is Australia's growth? It is plus 2.6 per cent. In other words, in the OECD we are growing as fast as any other country outside of the United States because of the important cast of fiscal policy. As well as that, the budget travels down to a deficit of around one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. By contrast, honourable members will remember seeing on television the vote cast by Vice-President Gore, passing the American budget by one vote in the American Senate. As important and widely praised as that was, the American deficit will come down to only three per cent of GDP by 1997. That is three times larger than the Australian budget deficit in the same period. The United Kingdom will come down to four per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Australia is coming down to one per cent of GDP. The federal deficit of Canada is projected to decline from 5.2 per cent in 1992-93 to four per cent in 1994-95. On which basis, therefore, do we get these mealy-mouthed statements by the Leader of the Opposition about the budget being irresponsible and the shadow Treasurer saying that it is fiscal irresponsibility? If there is anything to argue over here it is this: why have opposition members, who supposedly commit themselves to decent fiscal policies, made such vandals of themselves in the Senate? Why have they decided to oppose it all? They must apparently think, in their naivety, that out there in the business community they can roll up to them on a Friday afternoon lunch and tell them about fiscal responsibility, but on Tuesday have the senators in their party vote against measures that bring the budget deficit down. It does not matter which way these people opposite go. This is a highly responsible budget. Not only that, it is the right budget for the period. It is the right budget to get the stimulus now and to bring the deficit down later. It just maintains the hallmark of this government as a fiscally responsible government-the most fiscally responsible government in the history of the Commonwealth. The first government to bring in a budget surplus was the Commonwealth Labor government in the 1980s. It brought in the second surplus, the third surplus and the fourth surplus. We banked those surpluses. We have spent them now to provide an increase in public demand over the period, which has given Australia a recovery and we are now starting to move. I want to sum up on two other points. I know honourable members opposite will hate this statement, but the Economist magazine, in the round-up of the bourses over the last two weeks, says: Eight of the stock markets in our chart reached all it out. time highs this week. European markets soared on hopes of interest rate cuts following the recent turmoil within the ERMI ask honourable members to listen to thisA well received budget helped Sydney to a new high. That is the first point. That is the shape of the markets. Mr Filing interjecting",11
11,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Moore.,12
12,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,12
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! the Prime Minister might resume his seat. Order! The Prime Minister is entitled to be heard in silence.,12
14,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the following week, in this week's EconomistMr Filing interjecting",12
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Moore.,12
16,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It says this: (a) To the stock markets in our table including Wall Street in London hit record highs. Some fell back in the week as investors took profits. Sydney was this week's star performer up by 1.2 per cent. That is the week of the budget and the week after the budget. So do not tell us about the markets because the markets have made their judgment about the budget. Not only that, the growth forecasts are there. We have a growth in prospect of 2.6 per cent against basically a set of negatives right across the world. So the fact IS the budget is right and we are now going to watch this irresponsible person opposite who has not shown tuppence worth of leadership, who is now marginalised in the Senate, oppose budget measures as no opposition has opposed them in all the years gone by. All I am saying is that you are just playing into our hands. Let me tell you this, brother: I will round you up like a sheepdog come the next poll just like I did last lime. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I was hopeful when you came to office that those sorts of remarks would cease. But if you want those sorts of battles I will give you some, and you know I can do it. Now cut",12
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,12
18,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rounded them up before the 1993 election and I will round them up again. Mr Thckey-Yes, go on; I rounded you up.",12
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor.,12
20,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rounded them up then and we will round them up again as the business communities spring this fellow opposite as an irresponsible vandal of the nation's finances. This budget is the essence of financial responsibility, and if the rabble opposite want to continue to oppose these measures in the Senate they will pay the price.",13
21,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister's problem is that no-one will believe him ever again.,13
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will get to his question and not abuse the fonns of the House.,13
23,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What about him-the great deceiver? I ask the Treasurer whether he remembers saying, on 20 August: I am not in the mood to negotiate, this budget was put together carefullyand on 23 AugustI say it's a package you can't just lop bits offand then the next dayAs far as I am concerned, and the Government ... this is not a negotiating document. Now the Treasurer has negotiated, he has lopped bits off and his credibility has been shredded. When will he resign?",13
24,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members, particularly the very excitable honourable member for Mayo, have worked themselves up into a bit of a frenzy today. They seem to be suggesting that I should be suffering some discomfort. I can tell them. I am not. What comes as a humiliation to the Leader of the Opposition, to use his word, is that this budget is going to get through. It is going to get through despite him, because in his pathetic response to the budget he said he was going to oppose basically everything.",13
25,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,13
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,13
27,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He did say he was going to support the tax on luxury cars. I do recall that. But he was basically going to oppose everything else. This man came into the job saying that what he wanted to do in his contribution to public debate was to make constructive criticism. He said this about three years ago. He also said that fiscal responsibility was an important part of what he stood for and that he wanted to support and improve the democratic institutions and processes in this country. 'What a long way away three years is because we now find that he is totally fiscally irresponsible. He would have us blow the deficit this year and every year for four Treasurer years to the tune of $3 billion by 1996-97. He is white-anting the democratic processes of this parliament. Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on the basis of standing order 145-the question of relevance. The question to the Treasurer was very simple, specific and straightforward: when is he going to resign? He should answer the question.",13
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is in order. He is answering the substance of the question.,13
29,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So in three years he has white-anted democratic processes. He has become totally irresponsible from a fiscal point of view and he wears as a badge of honour,13
30,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the standing orders which require any member not to refer to improper motives by another member. I suggest to you that 'white-anting' and other words used by the Treasurer really ought to be· withdrawn. If you look at standing order 77, it puts the responsibility on you to act in those circumstances-and I suggest you do so.",13
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am listening very carefully to the Treasurer and I am sure everyone else in this House is as well. The Treasurer is in order.,13
32,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Despite the attempts of this old gasp from the past on the other side who has had a bit of life pumped back into him to try to help the opposition this week, the opposition leader is the first self-confessed oppositionist. Do honourable members know .what an oppositionist is? It is someone who says no to everything. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order understanding order 145. The question was rather specific. I suspect that recountries. quests for an answer to what members of side of the House are or are not is totally irrelevant to the question. I ask you, Speaker, to get the Treasurer back to it or ask revenue. him to sit down.",13
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already ruled that the Treasurer is in order. I also refer honour the able members to the standing order in respect of disorderly behaviour in the House and taking frivolous points of order.,14
34,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite have to Australia's understand that because they are over there, they ask the questions and we give the swers. What the Leader of the Opposition has done as a result of his attitude and because has become an oppositionist is irrelevant. He has sidelined the Liberal Party of Australia. He should see the faces of his senators-totally morose. They see him as having created heroesMr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order understanding order 145. None of the comments-since my previous point of order-by the Treasurer have answered the question that was asked. I ask you, Mr Speaklast er, to get him back to the question.",14
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member incomes. will resume his seat. I have already ruled on this matter. The Treasurer will come to the substance of the answer and will conclude.,14
36,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have spoken to We people who are worth talking to-and that ain't those opposite-and, as a result, our budget will pass through the Senate. Taxation",14
37,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is adproud dressed to the Treasurer. Can he expand on the OECD report on the level of taxation in member countries and what are the implicacohesive tions for Australia?,14
38,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 21 August the OECD released its annual publication entitled enue Statistics of OECD Member Countries. This report shows the estimates of the ratio total tax revenue to GDP at all levels of government for each member country. These estimates enable comparisons to be made of the relative weight of taxation in member It also shows the break-up of total this tax revenue in member countries, which allows· comparisons to be made of their Mr relative reliance on different sources of The report confirms my comment in the budget speech that, based on 1991 figuresmost recently available-Australia has the lowest ratio of total tax revenue to GDP in the OECD. Since the 1990 figures, which show that Australia had the third lowest ratio, ratio fell slightly from 30.8 per cent to 29.2 per 'cent, while the ratio of the anUnited States rose marginally from 29.5 per cent to 29.8 per cent. The ratio of Turkey, a he relatively new OECD country, rose from 27.8 to become per cent to 29.4 per cent. The important point about all this is that it confirms that, whilst the tax average for the OECD as a whole has stayed. constant, Australia has been able to reduce its level of taxation as a whole. The important thing is that we have done this at the same time as we have provided very equitably for people in our community. Indeed, over the course of the 10 years we have done more than practically any other country, I suspect, in helping those people in our country who are on lower We have an elaborate and sophisticated set of social security arrangements in order to provide for greater fairness in this community. are also able to undertake the important investments, which only governments can undertake, in relation to some of the large public infrastructure, particularly investments in areas such as health, education and so on. I think this is something for Australia to be of-the fact that we have, with a low level of taxation, been able to provide such a fair society and, as a result of that fairness, a society. That is something which the opposition has never comprehended. The other point about this is that, as the RevPrime Minister mentioned, we not only have a small level of government and a low level of of taxation, but also have fiscal policy under greater control than practically any other OECD country. That is the reason why we were able to take the action we did to provide the stimulus to the economy when it needed it. That is why we are now able to moderate the fiscal stimulus and reduce the deficit over Treasurer? the course of the next four years. This shows just how beneficial it can be to have flexible fiscal policy, to allow the stimulus when it is The minister will continue. necessary and to draw it back when it is also appropriate. Opposition members are totally bereft on this issue. They say that they want lower deficits, whilst they oppose those measures which would bring about a lower deficit. They are totally irresponsible and simply not to be regarded in this debate in which Australia is doing so well and will continue so. Treasurer",14
39,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer and is in relation the budget. Were the Treasurer and the Prime Minister told in caucus yesterday, 'It was you that stuffed up?'. Was the Treasurer told yesterday that he is obviously tired and could do with a spell on the back bench? As he has obviously lost the confidence of his own Labor colleagues and the rest of Australia, when will he reSign?",15
40,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What a silly question, Tim.",15
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the Treasurer to refer to honourabk members by their correct titles or electorates.,15
42,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What a silly question the Leader of the National Party asked. Manufacturing,15
43,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development inform the House of the role of innovation in Australia's manufacturing sector? Can he advise whether the government's initiatives, including gr-ntschemes for industry research - d development, have been successful?",15
44,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. To the smart companies,. successful companies, innovation is an essential ingredient of their success. And, of course, it is becoming increasingly understood that innovation has a much wider dimension than",15
45,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you going to take over as,15
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting across the table. <,15
47,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no doubt that research and development plays a key role. And the honourable member for Higgins ought not to laugh too much about the concept of innovation. Honourable members may be very interested in the fact that he is the great innovator of this parliament. He is a man who in an Age newspaper article, when to do asked to describe his politics, described himself as 'moderate ALP'. Mr Costello-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know it is difficult for the minister to to actually get to answering a question, and I know he is one of the great bores of the parliament",15
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is your point of order? Mr Costello-He was in fact asked a question about manufacturing servicesMr Snowdon-And you interjected. Mr Costello-I did not interject, my friend; you are interjecting. Mr Snowdon-Yes, you did. You interjected.",15
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order? Mr Costello-He then went on to something completely irrelevant. He ought to get back to manufacturing services.,15
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister will get to the answer.,15
51,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Comrade Costello did not make that view known to the blue rinse set in Higgins.,15
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will refer to members by their electorates and correct titles.,15
53,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But he used to attend the Labor schools.,15
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think the minister needs your assistance, Prime Minister.",15
55,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members may also be interested to know that many years ago, being an innovator driving a Silver Top taxi, I happened to pass the old ACTU headquarters. I listened on the radio and I heard that another comrade, comrade Hawke, was attending a press conference in that particular building for the purpose of announcing his run to parliament. Being a fairly interested and active member of the Labor Party, I parked the old Silver Top cab and I whipped in-and who should be there in his doting role in 1980? Comrade Costello was attending Mr Hawke's press conference.",15
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have already instructed the minister to refer to people by their correct titles. I also invite him to to the substance of his answer.,16
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, there is someone on point duty.",16
58,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Back to the issue of innovation: the government's approach to innovation is very broadly based but, in large measure, it is directed towards encouraging business under the R&D 150 per cent tax deduction provisions. To give an indication of how big this program now is under Labor, last year a record of almost $2.2 billion was spent under that particular program. Much of that recent strong growth in the business R&D sector was in fact in the manufacturing sector. In addition, the government has in place a number of competitive grant schemes for innovation, which are playing an increasingly important role for small and medium sized firms that we regard as the growth ijrms and very much the future of our manufacturing sector. Further, about $40 million a year supports about 150 firms with the potential to successfully commercialise good ideas. I am pleased to announce that, as part of the budget announcements, the government will continue funding of these grant schemes at existing levels until at least the end of 1995. The honourable member for Parramatta knows of one firm in his constituency, Interscan, which is relatively well known to many honourable members of this parliament. A year ago I led a trade delegation to Taiwan. Me Sam Makeham was then the managing director of Interscan. That company had benefited very considerably from government assistance under various innovation and other programs. In the course of that visit to Taiwan, we were able to argue the relative merits of this company. I am pleased to say that that company has now signed contracts for microwave landing systems in Taiwan, which I think will be the first of many. John Dougall, the Managing Director of AWA, which now owns Interscan, paid tribute to the government for the assistance provided, suggesting that, 'It was a textbook example of the success achievable from mature networking between come government and industry'. Comrade Costello should take note. Mr Tim Fischer-A point of order!",16
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Allow me. Minister, this is the third occasion when I have requested that you refer to people by their correct title. I will take firm action if you infringe on this again. Treasurer",16
60,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Treasurer confirm that after last night's changes to the budget, and without taking account of bracket creep, the poorest 20 per cent of single income families, most independent retiree couples and the poorest 10 per cent of twoincome families with children will be worse off than before the budget? When will the Treasurer resign?",16
61,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the penalty for getting things wrong were to resign, the honourable member ought to right now, because what she has said is wrong. We will be releasing later today some preliminary analysis which has been undertaken by Treasury on this revised package. With all of the qualifications that we need to make about these household distribution analyses, 90 per cent of full-time wage and salary earner household types on average will be shown to be better off. On average, the vast majority of self-employed and farm income household types are also better off. I am not going to suggest that these analyses are gospel or ought to be treated as gospel, but we were asked to do this analysis and we have done it. We will be releasing the preliminary work this afternoon. We have been at pains to ensure that there were equitable outcomes as a result of the changes which were in the budget and the modifications that have been made to it. The opposition wants to totally ignore the great weight of expenditure matters, expenditure items and measures, which the government has implemented over the years and extended in the context of this budget. We have provided very substantial assistance to low income families. Again, in this budget, through the introduction of the home child-care allowance, we have provided more assistance to those families with children. These are the things which matter·in terms of getting cash into the hands of the person caring for the children. That is the important issue in ing equity in this country. Contrast that with the approach of those opposite who, before the election, proposed to cut Commonwealth expenditure programs. That would have had a devastating effect on the poor. So do not dare to come in here talking to us about equity, because they stand for inequality and unfairness. They always have and they always will. Long-term Unemployed",16
62,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to the Australian Bureau of Statistics final labour force figures for July which were published yesterday. What is the significance of the second consecutive monthly fall in the number of long-term unemployed? How will these figures compare with previous predictions for the long-term unemployed?",17
63,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the honourable member would comprehend, as indeed would most, that it is difficult to proceed to an analysis on what are basically monthly figures and that we have to be fairly careful, particulong-term larly with a survey in which people are relying on their memory as. to what state they have been in for some considerable period. While we cannot draw firm conclusions, there are nevertheless some encouraging features of those statistics. Long-term unemployed figures reached 370,000 in March, fell in April, rose in May and then fell in both June and July. The long-term unemployed number in July was 334,000, which was 36,000 below the March number. Those figures do reflect seasonal patterns. In the past that has been a common feature of this period of the year-that there has been a fall off in long-term unemployment-but not so in the last couple of years. Perhaps this reflects a .trend of returning to a greater degree of normality in the labour market. I believe that there are some reasons for that: not least has been the massive additional focus that the long-term unemployed have had from government labour market programs, which is both holding down long-term unemployed numbers, and also enabling them to exit the category of long-term unemployed terms of extendmuch more readily. Program commencements have increased from 227,000 in 1990-91 to over 490,000 in 1992-93, and there will be over 500,000 in 1993-94 as a result of the decisions in this budget. The share of program commencements going to long-term unemployed has almost doubled from 34 per cent in 1991 to 62 per cent in 1992-93, and will be around 66 per cent in this financial year. Over 330,000 long-term unemployed will be given a program place in 1993-94. In 1992-93 nearly 183,000 former program participants had found unsubsidised jobs or entered unsubsidised education three months after completing their program. Especially significant has been the jobstart wage subsidy program. In 1992-93 almost 60 per cent of jobstart participants were in unsubsidised work or education three months after the program finished. Jobstart commencements have increased from around 58,000 in 1991-92 to 154,000 in 1993-94. So, assuming the current success rate is maintained, that means that around 90,000 mainly unemployed people will find work as a result of this one budget decision alone. My department is currently reviewing its forecasts of long-term unemployment, and we are going to be in a better position to judge the significance of recent figures once that work is completed. With these sorts of statistics coming through, I personally believe that it is highly unlikely that we will reach the sorts of worse case scenario levels of 500,000 long-tenn unemployed that some commentators have identified. The figures demonstrate two things. The first is that long-tenn unemployment is at totally unacceptable levels-and the government does not resile from that. It is important to attack this problem with all the vigour that we can. Secondly, it is not often that· we actually have the pleasure of seeing a detailed, highly targeted and well-funded government program actually achieving successful outcomes in very difficult circumstances. But it is quite evident from the statistics I have outlined, and also from the monthly figures to which the honourable member referred, that our strategies are obviously starting to have some positive effect. Petrol Taxes",17
64,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer confinn that, after last night's decision, the government still plans to raise petrol taxes by over $1,200 million a year by 1996, with the impact falling hardest on low income earners who own cars that use leaded petrol? Is it a fact that last night's humiliating backdown has not alleviated the real pain of budget tax increases, and was little more than an exercise to con the Australian Democrats and the Australian people? When is the Treasurer going to resign?",18
65,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If the honourable member wishes to express a view or participate in debates- ' Mr Sharp-Give us an MPI!,18
66,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member wants to participate in the purposes of policy, in the objectives or the strategy of the budget, the opposition has to decide whether it is in the debate or not. The Leader of the Opposition has decided that the opposition is out of the debate-out of the debate here and out of the debate in the Senate. The opposition has to make up its mind whether it is in or it is out, but for as long as the opposition is out of it, I will treat it as the irrelevancy that it is. Long-term Unemployed",18
67,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security. In the light of the previous answer provided by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, can the minister advise the House of the measures being taken in his portfolio to ensure that the best use is being. made of the substantial resources being spent to achieve the government'- social and economic objectives in dealing with the plight of the long-tenn unemployed? Mr BALDWIN....:..I thank the' honourable member for his question. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training pointed out, contrary to the claitns of some, the government is doing an enonnous amount in this budget to assist the unemployed, particularly the long-tenn unemployed. The minister made refererice to the magnitude of the government's efforts in the area of labour market programs. These are. now very. substantial and are' crucial to the prospects of long-tenn unemployed people gaining work. Of course, we all know that the oppos-tion was committed to slashing those programs to pieces had it been elected to government., I would like to make specific reference t9 a number of measures being taken in my own portfolio area, the social security area. Within my portfolio alone there are eight separate packages of measures for the unemployed. Let me run through the major ones. There isa real increase of. $6 per fortnight over and above nonnal indexation in the rate of payment for long-tenn unemployed single adults. We are introducing an earnings credit, as well as liberalising the income testing arrangements for unemployed people by introducing an earned income free area over and above the basic free area for single people, and increasing the earned"" income free area for married couples. We are introducing, .as I said, an earnings credit. We are rationalising waiting periods. In combination, these measures will make it significantly easier for people who ate unemployed to participate in the labour market and maintain some contact with the labour market. ' .. We are introducing a mature age allowance which recognises the difficult circumstances faced by older workers, in current laboqr market circumstances. We are introducing a comprehensive package of measures, 41 in all, arising from the first stage of a comprehensive review of the government's newstart strategy. Joint initiatives between my department and the CES will put 200,000 additional long-term unemployed people into jobs over the next four years. This will arise from improved case management and other measures to help the long-term unemployed become more competitive for t-e jobs that are available. These measures build on the practical knowledge that we have acquired since the newstart strategy was introduced in 1991. We are particularly concerned to ensure that the very substantial resources that we are putting into assisting the long-term unemployed are utilised as effectively as possible. We think this review of the newstart strategy will enable us to make much more efficient and effective use of those resources. In the area of education and unemployed people's access to education and training, we have introduced a $200 education entry payment to assist the long-term unemployed to meet the costs of education participation. We are also rationalising the interface between social security and the AustudyAbstudy system to remove disincentives to participation in education and training. When we combine all these things, and look at what is being done in other portfolio areas, I do not think anybody could seriously maintain that there is not a great deal in that for the long term unemployed. We are also piloting some innovative approaches which are designed to enable not just the Department of Social Security but other parts of the government and public sector that are concerned with the unemployed-particularly DEET, but also DITARD and health, housing and community services-to better coordinate and integrate their activities at a local level, to enable staff local level to exercise their initiative to think about ways in which programs can be delivered more effectively to become more efficient, and to work towards a better integration of the activities of these different agencies. Altogether, I think when honourable members look at this in the context of the broader review of what is happening to our labour market which is being undertaken under the white paper banner, there is a pretty substantial body of effort designed to assist the unemployed. It involves putting an appropriate level of resources in and also trying to ensure that we make the best possible use of those resources. That, of course, is in total contrast with the opposition policies which would utterly ruin the chances of the long term unemployed maintaining some contact with the labour market. Treasurer",18
68,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Bob Hawke sacked the honourable member for Werriwa, John Kerin, as Treasurer when it was obvious that he could not cope. When will the Prime Minister sack his incompetent, humiliated and totally useless Treasurer?",19
69,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, what would reasonable assessors anywhere in the world say of a Treasurer who brought the budget deficit of this country down to a third or a quarter of comparable countries? What would they say? They would give him full marks. What would they say of a Treasurer who recognised the need to give the economy a further kick in public demand-a further stimulus-having secured what is now the fastest recovery amongst OECD countries; and wanting to maintain that recovery? What would they say? They would say, 'Good judgment and good economics. Good shortterm and good medium-term outcome'. That is what they would say. But what would they say of an opposition leader who went to an electorate with a policy and then abandoned it? Remember it? I still have a copy of it in the drawer here. Here it is, Fightback-Acme Fightback, the old Acme at the Fightback. Wiley C. Coyote blew up. He got the Acme Fightback, opened it up andboom! - away he went. Boom! T-woo! Away he went. I remember the film footage, of his coming up to the lights, coming out of the hotel, when they all slunk out in their monkey suits. All the business community crept out through the kitchens, out through the corridors, and home in the hire cars. As a matter of fact, Mr Speaker, I have a funny little tale. Mr Kean from Boral was an invited guest of the Leader of the Opposition. He gave his signed invitation to the driver and said, 'This is my memory of the 1993 election'. The driver was the nephew of the Minister for Labour. So we know just what the mood was on election night. We know that like that day at the lights when he came over to say, 'I think I will abandon the GST'Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 145, I protest the total irrelevancy of this babble from the Prime Minister. More importantly, Mr Speaker, do you think he is sane?",19
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Menzies will withdraw that reflection. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I am asking a question.",20
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I request that you withdraw that reflection. Mr Andrews-The Australian people can decide for themselves, and they know; I withdraw.",20
72,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude by saying that the Leader of the Opposition has abandoned the policy on which he ran. He now says that the GST and the Fightback policy has had it-it is gone. Yet he has the gall, the front, to ask me to sack a Treasurer who has introduced a budget which is going to help the economy now and help it in the medium term. Where does this man get off? Aboriginal Land Claims",20
73,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Prime Minister tell the House what progress has been made in recent consultations with industry and the Aboriginal community on the Mabo decision? Can he say when the government will be in a position to release details of its legislative program in response to the High Court decision?,20
74,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The cabinet this week will be considering again-and, I hope, finallythe draft legislation for the generic response to Mabo. As we have now had extensive consultations-and will have more when the draft is released-with the Aboriginal community, the mining industry, the pastoralists, and all of the various stakeholders, I hope to be in a position to table the Mabo legislation in the course of the next few days or next week. Mr Halverson interjecting",20
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Casey.,20
76,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government has developed a piece of what I hope will be landmark legislation. I am certain that it is superior to any Aboriginal land law in this country and something which this government will be very proud of. Having made the decision so that the lines of logic are in the draft bill, if anyone were to ask the Leader of the Opposition what his policy on Mabo is, he would say one thing: validate past titles. If we ask, 'What is your policy in relation to hearing and awarding native title?'-the core of Mabo-we find that he has no policy. After all this time, he has wandered all around the place trying to look as though he was consulting. At the Liberal federal council the other day, when the fixers put the vote into smother for him, and reference was made to all options consistent with the responsibilities of states for control of land including a referendum, which of course would be to abolish the impact of the High Court, up went the weak little hand to vote for it. Is this leadership? Jeff Kennett has made it clear. He said it would be walking away from government responsibility itself for the Leader of the Opposition to tum his back on Mabo. So here is a major decision from our most supreme of courts, the High Court, which the government has now spent six intensive months on in order to develop a primary piece of law. There is not a skerrick of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition, not an ounce, except for a squalid little resolution circulated at the federal council which he has voted for and which includes the passing of a referendum to be rid of the .impacts of the High Court decision.",20
77,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are squirming.,20
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,20
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know the Leader of the Opposition is squinning. It is just like the republic issue. All of the young voices of the Liberal Party are saying, 'For God's sake, give us a go to express ourselves on the republic'. But no, in went another fix motion. That one said the onus is on the government to say why the Queen of Great Britain should not be forever the Queen of Australia. On two things, there has been a total abdication of leadership; a complete and total abdication on two major issues. Here is the former Prime Minister saying that we have been knocked into a cocked hat by a small group of right wing conservatives. Here is the Leader of the Opposition being handled and managedMr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked a question which related to what his government was going to do about native title. What he has been carrying on with for the last few minutes has nothing to do with that. Why do you not ask him to come back to the question or sit down?",21
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Menzies will resume his seat. Mr Andrews-It is a favourite practice of the Prime Minister to just project onto others his own sins,21
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I warn the honourable member for Menzies. There is no point of order. The particular issue which the honourable member raises is one which I went into in the later days of the last session. The Minister is in order, and he will come to the question.",21
82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On these two key questions, instead of the matter being debated broadly and the Leader of the Opposition standing on a position of principle, he adopted the weak managed solutions put by people at the conference. We thought this would be a very telling conference for the Liberal Party, a conference where it could say where it was going as a party and how it related to Australian society. The honourable member for Wentworth squibbed both opportunities-on Mabo, which is a pressing and important national issue, and on the republic. If he will not give any leadership on Mabo or the republic, or let the fresher voices in the Liberal Party have their sayMr SincIair- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. For the last 10 minutes we have heard the Prime Minister consistently bucketing the Leader of the Opposition on policies that have nothing whatsoever to do with the question. I would suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that there is a problem if you are going to allow the Prime Minister to carry on the way he is, totally abusing the intent of our standing orders. If the Prime Minister wants to make a statement on Mabo, we are happy to give him leave. We are happy to give him an opportunity to speak about it, but it is absolutely against the intent of the whole of our standing orders to allow a Prime Minister to continue to attempt to denigrate anybody on this side of the House, particularly in the way he is doing. I suggest that you request the Prime Minister to withdraw.",21
83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister was asked a specific question. In that respect he was contrasting policy. The Prime Minister is in order, and he will bring his answer to a conclusion.",21
84,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will. If the Leader of the Opposition will not face these two principal issues, and if he is obstructionist through his party in the Senate in relation to the nation IS fiscal policy, what use is he to the democratic process in this country? The answer is none whatsoever. The federal Liberal Council Prime debate was the shabbiest, lousiest, paltry debate we have had in this country in the last 15 months or so. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 142, which of course states: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. It is about time that that law, that standing order, was applied in this place. He has plenty of responsibilities, and he might just start explaining to the Australian people how he is going to fix things, not talk about other matters.",21
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. There is no point of order. The Prime Minister has carriage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. He is in order. He will come to the conclusion to his answer.,22
86,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude on this point: the federal Liberal Party meeting was an absolute disgrace in terms of policy, and it showed how the Leader of the Opposition has failed the test of leadership on two key counts. I buried you, brother, once, and I do it a second time. I will wind up on that point.",22
87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,22
88,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was a shambles and he ought to be ashamed of himself, but he is not. We will deal with him in the future. On that note, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed' on the Notice Paper. NA Questions to Private Members",22
89,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I actually have two questions to ask you. The first is in relation to opposition questions on the budget. In view of the current circumstances, understanding order 143 will you allow questions from the opposition to the honourable member for Lilley and other leaders of the caucus economic committee so that the opposition can have the opportunity of questioning those who really have charge of the ongoing changes to the budget in the business of the House?",22
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,No. Photographers in Chamber,22
91,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My next question relates to the presence of photographers in this chamber yesterday and today. It has been the normal practice of Speakers in the past, when permission has been given, for the Speaker to notify all members of the House that this was to take place. Unless they have sneaked in without your permission, I would like to suggest that it would be appropriate to resume that courtesy of informing members of this chamber when cameramen are going to come in.",22
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"In respect of that particular question, that is a perfectly reasonable request. I must admit I did not see a cameraman within the chamber today. The normal procedure is that the serjeant's office advises my office, and as a courtesy honourable members would be advised. That will be a practice which will be instituted. Budget Legislation",22
93,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question for you. In the last 24 hours there will have been two developments in respect of legislation on the Notice Paper of this House regarding several bills relating to the budget mark 1. I rise understanding order 214, which says: Every bill not prepared according to the standing orders of the House, shall be ordered to be withdrawn. I point out that tabled in this parliament yesterday in another place was very important legal advice suggesting that the bills before both houses of parliament but at the moment before the lower house are not constitutional. I ask that you give consideration to that advice tabled elsewhere and report back to the House as to whether understanding order 214 you are now duty bound to order that those budget bills be withdrawn.",22
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will undertake to investigate the matter which has been raised and will report back to the House. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS,22

102,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,24
103,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Today in the Sydney Morning Herald an article by Gerard Henderson, amongst other things, stated: During an appearance on SBS's Face the Press on May 26, Dr Wooldridge was asked to comment on the High Court's decision in the Mabo case. He replied: ""What do you want me to say?"" What indeed. This is a figment of Dr Henderson's imagination. I have a transcript of the 45-minute interview supplied by SBS. Nothing that I said in that interview in reply to any question could be construed as Dr Henderson has said. NA Matters of Public Importance",24
104,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"I move: That standing order 107 (Matter of public importance) be suspended for all sittings up to and including Thursday, 28 October 1993. The opposition knows very well why this particular motion is being moved. The opposition was quite aware of the content of the debate that we had in this place during the last week of sittings in which we pointed out that, as far as we are concerned as a government, the imposition on this House of a timetable and schedule by opposition members in the Senate was one which deserved a NOES reply. Having been ordered by the Senate to consider exclusively government legislation until 28 October, on that occasion this House, in relation to one other standing order matter, decided that we might as well go along with it and conduct the affairs of this House PAIRS accordingly. For those who have perhaps not caught up with the detail of this matter, during the last week of sittings the Senate put forward the proposition that, unless urgency was begged of it, it would consider no item in the course of this year that was not introduced in the House of Representatives by 1 October and then exited the House of Representatives by 28 October. On the sitting pattern that was handed to the Senate, that effectively meant that the House of Representatives had two weeks to debate whatever the government considered of sufficient importance to the nation in order to put it before the Senate for a determination by Christmas. What that meant, as the senators well knew as they were advised at the time, was that we had to deal with some 100 to 115 pieces of legislation, 20 or 30 pieces of which y,rere budget bills, the rest urgent matters for consideration. The Senate knows, and in particular opposition members of the Senate know, that because of the nature of our constitution on administrative arrangements we are obliged to be one of the most legislative chambers in the world. That is the nature of our constitution. We cannot avoid it. We can do some efficiencies here and there. We can put forward omnibus bills but, whenever we do, that raises its own source of complaint. At the end of the day, we are stuck with no option for effectively governing this country than to have a very high rate of legislation during each sitting of the parliament. We were instructed by the Senate, acting in this case as an agent of the opposition, that we had to have all legislation that the Senate was prepared to consider this year in by 1 October and out by 28 October. f.. clause was added to that which said that, if the House of Representatives went and begged the Senate on any matter of urgency, then it would deign to consider whether or not materials introduced after that were urgent. Everybody knows the name of the game in this regard. Honourable members can always find on every piece of legislation handed to them a very good reason for deciding that it is such an important piece of legislation to the Australian people perhaps they ought to take the next six months to think about it. When going through a suggestion that some ma-ter is urgent, it is always open to the other Side in the chamber to do that. Given the way the opposition has behaved in the Senate, there is no reason to think that that would not be exactly the case. That has imposed an enormous burden on the government. It has obliged this gove.rnment which would normally have somethlOg like io to 15 per cent of its legislation in chamber by 1 October, to introduce virtually 100 per cent of it, save that element .which could be introduced and considered in the Senate first before it comes here. The government will meet that task. It is not a sensible way to draft legislation. There is a major pain and penalty on this government by virtue of that decision by the Senate. We will have to rush drafting of legislation. We will have to contemplate. the possibility that the legislation that we - ut lOto this chamber is, to some extent, defechve. We will have to play it by ear and, as occasion arises, in the course of the subsequent month when we debate that legislation, try to correct the defects that will invariably occur in any human institution placed under enormous pressure as that legislation is drafted. The penalty for the government is - ev-re. It is a penalty that the government wtll hve with because it has no option. The government simply has to operate to that legislative pattern and get the - aterial in. .It cann-t afford to take risks With the matenals that It has to hand. There is an obligation on all honourable members of this House to comprehend the effect that decisions .taken in the other place will have on us and the way in which we operate. The opposition has to learn, and it ought to know, that this is the chamber where major issues of this nation have their first airing. The reasons for this first airing are the nature of the electoral processes which produce this chamber, and the fact that it is the most current chamber in terms of its reflection of the previous election result. Whilst it is an enormous pain to government administratively to have to get that legislation in, and while a government has to be jealous of its reputation given what is likely to emerge in legislation that is under that pressure, this happens to be, from an opposition's point of view, absolutely stupid. I suppose those opposite get a small amount of kudos from nitpicking through that legislation and being able to point out where we may have one or two things wrong, but what they get in return is a charade of a debate in this House of parliament, in their own chamber. They know very well that with two weeks to operate we are going to guillothis tine those bills through this place. The whole damn lot of them are going to be guillotined through this chamber with minimal and contemptible debate in the course of that period. Those opposite have obliged upon us a standard of consideration of government legislation which we will simply conform to. The penalty for those opposite is that they do not get the sounding board in this chamber that oppositions have enjoyed in the past, at least not until this period of penalty imposed upon us by the Senate is over. When this period of penalty imposed upon - s by the Senate is over on 28 October, we Will be able to resume normal proceedings in this place, and we will be able to conduct our affairs in a common sense fashion. In the interim, apart from private members' business on Thursday, this chamber will devote itself to the business of the nation-the business of the nation being the legislation that i- put be-ore t-is chamber for implementatIOn, which Will determine how the nation is.governed. I might say that that glorious institution, the Senate, having lectured this chamb-r o- what it ought to be doing to pass up leglslahon to it for its due consideration, might for the first time in this entire period bf sittings actually begin to address a piece of government legislation on Thursday",24
105,Mr DUFFY,BUSINESS,This week?,25
106,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"That is right. It might get there. One wonders whether, since the opposition in the Senate has imposed this upon us, the Senate will achieve something a little bit better than it has in the past, when it has said it has been placed under an inexorable and excessive pressure by the House of Representatives to consider government items, and whether it will better the 50 per cent mark. It got up to 48 per cent apparently during the last block of sittings-the other 52 per cent was spent piffling' around with anything but the business of the nation-on government legislation. Then it has the hide to say to us, 'Well, we can resolve this problem by you working faster as opposed to us giving you more detailed consideration and more time to consider'. But it must be said that we would not want to hold our breath about that prospect,· given the pattern of sittings in the Senate so far. The government has been moving expeditiously in introducing its legislation and is providing the House with ample opportunities for debate, as indeed we will today. The rest of the day will include, among other things, the appropriation bills, which give the opposition ample opportunity to make any point it likes on the budget. Those opposite come in here and say that by being deprived of censure motions or MPls they cannot debate the budget and that they cannot put forward points of view of critical significance as far as the economic management of this country is concerned. Rubbish! They are going to have all evening to debate appropriations and to say anything they like on the budgetanything at all. So, as far as that little furphy is concerned, people ought to give that consideration. The nature of an appropriations debate is such that honourable members can be almost as vicious and as abusive as they like in it within a reasonable compliance with the standing orders. Because the debate is so broad on this legislation, unlike other pieces of legislation, those opposite have the sort of flexibility for debate that is normally accorded only in something like a matter of public importance or a censure motion. It is with reluctance that this is moved, as indeed it was with reluctance that we moved the motion to suspend standing order 399the standing order of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)except when a motion is moved pursuant to the standing order by a minister. This would not be the normal conduct of affairs in this place, but the opposition in the Senate chose the course of action that made this inevitable. What a stupid course of action it is from an opposition's point of view! From time to time one wonders where the opposition tactics come froni. What genius sits down and thinks through the consequences of these sorts of actions? Anybody could tell that the government was not going to simply lie down and cop that piece of nonsense from the Senate-a piece of nonsense which imposes an enormous discipline on the government-and not take appropriate action in this place. Everybody knows that this is the chamber in which the Leader of the Opposition sits; this is the chamber in which the Leader of the National Party of Australia sits; this is the chamber in which the. bulk of the opposition front bench sits; and this is the chamber from which the opposition would wish to form a government. What the opposition requires in this cllamber-as would any opposition-is maximum opportunity for exposure. So, whilst I am wearing my hat as a minister, I have to say that the imposition of the Senate is painful indeed because some of my legislation has to be drafted in that essentially cowboy fashion that I described before. But I am wearing my other hat as the manager of government busin.ess in the House, and all I see before us is a peaceful green meadow while all that legislation goes through on the gong. As a member of the chamber, I ought to be decently embarrassed about that, but as the manager of government business I cannot think of a more comfortable and sensible way to conduct the affairs of this nation. It is the opposition that opened that up, not us. It is the opposition that put that on the table, n0t us. In the Senate the opposition has turned tself into the cannon fodder of the Democrats and the Greens. The opposition has created a situation, which it is using skill, where it can go into the office of the Prime Minister or any minister and say, 'We have 36 votes in our back pocket from the Liberal Party and the National Party which we instruct to provide us with our opportunities to move our amendments, change the House of Representatives standing orders and procedures, anything we like. You must now treat with us'. It is quite right that we treat with the opposition. We do not have any alternative to that. We are obliged to sit with the minor parties and go through this exercise with them, be it on the budget or, I suspect, on any other matter, because they are able to say, 'We have this mob of ning-nongs in the Senate as our cannon fodder'. It is like the grand old Duke of York's 10,000 men: we march them up to the top of the hill and we march them down again. When they are up they are up, when they are down they are down, and when they are only half way up they are neither up nor down. As far as the opposition is concerned, that is about its value. Mr Sharp-Did you learn that at university, Kim?",26
107,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"No, I learned it when I was a child, which is about where the honourable member is now tactically. That is the value of the opposition when it comes to a consideration of how things ought to be sensibly done in this place. The opposition has determined to turn itself into cannon fodder for the purposes of discussion of the budget and discussion of the standing orders. In this chamber the opposition does not treat itself seriously. In this chamber the opposition does not assume that this is where it leads its parties from and this is where it makes its points of importance to the nation. The opposition allows itself to be led along by some of its most eccentric and lonely members who constitute its Senate team-its most inept tactical performers and some of its most outrageous frontbenchers. When a bit of common sense is supposed to prevail, those opposite wander around in this chamber like lost lambs. The government is obliged to respond to that. We are not going to let government go with simply because the Senate has decided to make life a bit hard for us. We are going to conform to what the Senate wants, but we are going to do it with every concentration that we can bring to bear and with the maximum amount of time that normal sitting patterns will produce devoted to government legislation so that the business of the nation has an opportunity to be discussed not only by this side of the House but by opposition members. Those opposite will have plenty of opportunidown ty to speak, to debate and to move amendments until such time as we move into a period of guillotine, which we will have to do fairly soon. But even then there will still be opportunities for debate on both sides of the House. What those opposite will not have is the opportunity, at least until 28 October, to introduce matters of their own into this place. That is something oppositions have always enjoyed and sensibly protected. It is a great shame for those opposite. It is also a question of common sense. Why do honourable members opposite do these things? They are at least portraying themselves as the alternative government of the country. Why do they want to set a precedent in this manner? We are mystified on this side of the House. If we were to ever find ourselves in opposition, the last damned thing we would do in the Senate is provoke circumstances in the House which permitted or obliged the government to compel the almost sole consideration of government material. It is not something that would cross our minds as a sensible way of dealing with the Senate. By all means, an opposition could set up all the committees it liked in the Senate to create major embarrassments and harass the government. That is not a stupid way to use the Senate. But to put the government in a position where it is virtually obliged, at some point in time, to curtail by guillotine the legislation that is before the chamber is an act of tactical stupidity which should not go unrewarded. This is part of the reward.",27
108,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,Since the election it has become more and more apparent that the government has an absolute fixation with getting rid of the gives Senate. Today we heard the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) say that the most current chamber in terms of the election result is House of Representatives. We need to underof the House. stand that in fact the most current chamber in terms of the election result is membership changed as of 1 July. In case the Leader of the House has forgotten-because his arithmetic may well be as bad as that his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins),27
109,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,They were elected at the same time. .,28
110,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"Yes, they were, but they took up their positions under a fixed appointthen ment.",28
111,Mr LAVARCH,BUSINESS,"That's a bit of a weak point, Sinkers.",28
112,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"Let me follow it through. The Attorney-General might be interested hear this. In the vote for the Senate-which was at the same time as the House of Repreof sentatives vote, as the Leader of the House identified-the Australian Labor Party achieved only 40 per cent of the primary vote. The Labor Party in fact finished with fewer senators after the 13 March election than had prior to the 13 March election. The do consequence for this place is that now the Labor Party must play host to senators more and more. The government needs to understand that, apart from a brief period in the 1970s, govyear. ernments of all persuasions-I am not too sure of which persuasion this government currently sees itself-have worked consisdoing tently with the Senate. But never before has it been necessary to introduce a motion of this ilk. That is the first thing that the people there need to understand. I know that this government wants to introduce a republic, I know it does not like today. the constitution, I know it does not like the Senate, and I know it is concerned that its own backbench is revolting against the decifrom sion of the front-bench. Recognising the quality of some of my colleagues on the backbench, I can well understand the concern. But the problem is that on only one previthat ous occasion has the standing order which for it. the opposition a right to initiate a matter of importance been negated. When was that? That was way back in 1975. Guess who the moved it? It was moved by the then Leader Mr Ruddock-It was not the war, maybe that where the it was the depression.",28
113,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"Actually, it was a depresof sion; but the honourable member will remember that we had a vote. That was in May 1975-1 trust that honourable members will appreciate the significance of that-and the motion was moved by the member for Grayndler, Mr Daly. The interesting thing about that particular motion, and the reason for it, was that it was moved prior to an exhaustive debate in this chamber on the Family Law Bill. The date and the significance of the occato sion are no doubt immediately apparent to most of us. In 1975 there were circumstances gross financial irresponsibility; the abuse of the responsibilities of government by the members of the then Labor front bench; and the absolute loss of confidence of members in their own backbench and front-bench. All it those symptoms are increasingly apparent. I not like to suggest to the wider electorate that 11 November 1975 will necessarily be replicated on 11 November 1993 but it does seem extraordinary to me that the only other time this occurred was in that coincidental The other thing that the Leader of the House needs to understand is that what he is is in fact reducing the power and effectiveness of this chamber, whose authority he pretends to assert. He does that every time out he denies the opportunity for debate, such as denying us the opportunity to suspend standing orders. We saw the consequence of that How ridiculous! No treasurer in the history of this parliament has had a worse reception his own membership than that accorded the Treasurer last night. As for his Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the only reason he is here is that the ACTU decided this morning he had just moved far enough. But wait The whole point is that the nature and character of the debates in this place have been so debased that we cannot even suspend standing orders to censure the Treasurer. The nature of parliament is such that we must be able to assert financial responsibility on the government. In case the Leader of the House forgets, 1975 was all about a government that had lost touch with reality and lost the sinews of exercising proper financial responsibility. The government itself is setting the pace. The government is not prepared to accept debate within this chamber but it is forced to within its own caucus. It is not prepared to allow a censure on the very issues which led to those fundamental budget changes. Indeed, it is dismissing them to the point where, seemingly, we now have only one procedure available to us, being question time, and then perhaps another opportunity in the adjournment debate itself. The media and the greater Australian electorate need to comprehend that this government has hamstrung the functioning of the effective house of the people to a greater degree than any government since Federation. This measure precludes the one opportunity for debate. I know that the Leader of the House has probably read it but there is any amount of rhetoric in Pettifer's House of Representatives Practice to sayMr Ruddock-I don't think he's read it.",28
114,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"He probably cannot read, in spite of being able to quote to us about noble Duke of York.",29
115,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,"Yes, I can. I read the words of Ian Sinclair religiously.",29
116,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"Yes, I have noticed that he has done that once or twice, and I trust he continues to do so. The nature and character of House of Representatives Practice suggest that the only opportunity for members of the opposition to raise significant issues of concern in the wider electorate is through matters of public importance. At Westminster they have a process of adjournment, but it is not an adjournment at the end of the day's proceedings. For example, in light of the crisis that faces today's Labor Party, there could well have been a motion of adjournment as we commenced proceedings at 2 o'clock this afternoon. Indeed, immediately after prayers it would have been appropriate for this House to have moved a motion of adjournment and then moved to a proper debate on whether or not the House still had confidence in the government of the Prime Minister. The nature of matters of public importance is a replacement of that old procedure. Matters of public importance are the only opportunity for those in the opposition to raise significant matters of public importance. We have lost the right to suspend standing orders. We have lost, or we are about to lose, the opportunity to raise matters of public importance. We are no longer able to move censures, although I would be interested to see just how the government intends to react to that motion that will stand on the record tomorrow as an indictment against the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, and, to an even greater degree, the Leader of the House for what he is doing by denying his prime responsibility to the people's chamber. The real problem is not just that the government is taking this high-handed and arrogant attitude, but that the government itself has lost its way. This is the second sitting week since the budget. The election was on 13 March. It is, in fact, the 14th sitting day since the people of Australia went to the election. In those 14 sitting days we have had only the a smattering of legislation. We have had no economic direction. We were given the budget on 17 August and what happened? Last night it was scrapped. We still do not know what the details are. The parliament has not even been advised. This is government by press release. It is a government that ignores the proceedings of parliament. Occasionally we see it respond to the Democrats, certainly to the ACTU, and then it listens-perhaps perfunctorily-to the bane and the natural concerns of the backbench of its own caucus. Mrs Sullivan-Because they shout at them.",29
117,Mr SINCLAIR,BUSINESS,"Because they shout at them, as the honourable member for Moncrieff identifies. The significant point is that, from the 14 sitting days so far this year, we have mark 2 of a budget that is still under review and a budget that is still subject to fundamental consideration and reconsideration. The people of Australia are suffering. We all know that unemployment is not going to be helped one whit by the changed budget or the initial budget. We know that the hurt to the poorer people of Australia because of the Treasurer's initiatives is significant. We know that farmers and small businesses are going to suffer, and we know that the general infrastructure will go down and the deficit will increase. The nature of the proceedings has been such that they have involved minimallegislation and lousy economic policy formulation. There has been no policy from a government which won the election by default, and we are now told that this motion is essential because the Senate forced it on us. It is only essential because the government does not know what it is doing. The government is working within the parameter of having constant changes forced upon it, and there are legal doubts about some of the legislation that is already in place. I ask honourable members to tum the Notice Paper. Notice No.6 is the ation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. In case the Leader of the House has forgotten, there have already been three significant legal opinions, tendered in the other place yesteric day, suggesting that that bill is nonmembers sustainable and that it will be invalid when is challenged, as it undoubtedly will be. So what do we have? We have a governyet ment that does not know where it is going and a budget that, at the very. least, is still subject to review. The only significant tion we have had has been as a result of the budget-and we have been told by very considerable and responsible legal opinion that it is invalid. We have a House been told it cannot raise matters of public importance or suspend standing orders; members of the House need to be good boys because the Leader of the House does not like us doing those things. One other thing that the Leader of the House needs to remember is. that there was another piece of legislation called the Superresist, annuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992. We might remember that that legislation had to be brought back into this chamber after the resumption of the parliament in August last year because, in the rushing of the legislation through here and the Senate, the government had not got the schedules right. If the Leader of the House wants to get legislation properly considered, he should not move motions to stop debate or preclude the opposition raising matters of major public moment. He should allow committee consideration and debate in the House to ensue. It is all very well for him to say, 'We have a timetable; we can't meet it'. If he knew where he was going, he would have no trouble with the timetable. His trouble is that he has a total division in the cabinet; more and more he has that cabal of people that seem to be within the kitchen cabinet of the Prime Minister determining the policies the government is going to pursue. The Minister for Primary Industries and . Energy (Mr Crean) did not know about the wine tax until a few hours before the introduction of the budget. He did not know about to the wool tax until he rang the honourable Taxmember for Parkes (Mr Cobb) to find out what it was all about. What is happening? The government is breaking up. The government has no leadership, in spite of the rhetorof the Prime Minister. Have honourable heard anything more ridiculous? it Yesterday he got up at the dispatch box and said, 'We are leading, leading, leading'. I am to see it. About all that is happening is that he is following, following, following; vacillating, vacillating, vacillating; and comlegislapromising, compromising, compromising. What it is all about is losing the way. This is another one of the steps taken down that sticky path in order to pass over more responthat has sibility to the upper house. It is not good enough. The opposition of course does not have the numbers. The opposition is not going to be able, in the division that will ensue in due course, to stop that irresistible product of the government having got more members in this House on 13 March. Equally, government members cannot nor if it is honest with itself can it deny, the validity of the members of the upper house; There are 36 coalition senators and they are not in any way compromised by any minor factional gro-p. The stance taken by the opposition was taken in· advance of any other group. It was taken after proper consideration of a budget that we believe is bad for Australia. Being bad for Aust(alia, we want to ensure that to the maximum degree the government cops the consequences of its indecision, vacillation and lack of policy on 13 March. We also want to ensure that the people of Australia do not suffer. In order to do that, it is essential that we have an opportunity to suspend standing orders, to censure the Treasurer anq the government where necessary. We need to have the capacity to raise matters of public importance. Above all, we need to have the capacity to tell the government to be honest with the people of Australia even when that government cannot be honest with itself.",29
118,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"O'Connor) (3.45 p.m.)When looking at the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), one is often reminded of schoolboy characters such as Billy Bunter. But one would think that in this place schoolboy tactics and schoolboy logic could really and truly be put aside. This particular motion is of course. one of those petty, petulant, arrogant little things where the Leader of the House seeks to demonstrate to the House of Representatives that he has the numbers. The fact that he no longer has the numbers in the Senate is rankling him to a degree that is very apparent by his words and sermonising, at which he is so good. . He wants to tell us about .our irrelevance. Thirty-six members of a house out of a total of 76 is hardly an irrelevance. He wants to tell us that we are captives of the Australian Democrats. We always count the Democrats in with the Labor Party. We always know that the only nice thing that can be - aid about the Democrats is that we cannot buy them; we know we can only rent them by the hour. But the simple fact of life is that the record shows that, in the end, the Democrats will go out on television, posture, carry on and give into the government. If what we hear in the press is their final position-and that would never really be known-they have delivered the people of Australia nothing; .not a thing. The simple facts are that petrol taxes are where they were on the night of the announcement of the budget. The propOsal is that perhaps some 3c of that total predicted tax burden on leaded fuel-which fuels the cars of the Democrats and the Greens supporters in the universities and in many of those areas-will not be imposed. I am wondering if the minister might get up later on and tell us, 'I can guarantee you that extra 3c will not be imposed. We will put it in l-a-w. We will put it in law'. The minister bemoans the loss of reputation of this place yet it is the government who introduced laws and corrupted them. It did not have the courage, the integrity and the honesty to stand by those laws. What are we talking about today? We are talking about getting rid of matters of public importance, having already seen a resolution bullied through this House to get rid of the right to suspend standing orders. The simple fact in both cases is that, as I explained to the House. the other day, it is tokenism. The government as it demonstrated yesterday, if it has a sensible legislative load, could knock off the matter of public importance wherever it chose-and it has· done so on many occasions. . The silly thing about the debate that we are having today is that the government had to find something to talk about. When we look at the Notice Paper the simple question is: where is the government's legislation? The government does not have any. It has to bring on this debate, which it does not need. It could have knocked off the matter of public importance by a simple division, as it has always been able to do in relation to matters such as the suspension of standing orders. But, no, it has to bring this debate on, parade itself as the tough guy, and throw its votes into the debate when there is no logic to it. This behaviour is silly, petulant, and arrogant, and it does not promote the cause of this parliament in any way. It. denigrates the .parliament further because it attacks certain principles of. the place, and it sets precedents which it apparently believes might not be copied by us sometime, using its example as to why this should be done. There is no excuse required forthwith for this outrageous action. We talk about the rights of members of parliament. The most crushed people, who yesterday discovered how arrogantly they have been treated, are the back bench of the government. It trots out the little questions members of the backbench, and tells them to ask the questions in order-one of the jokes being that the ministers frequently write them dud questions. They are not even subject to the standing orders. They all line up one after another and ask their little questions. It is too bad if they have a major issue in their own electorates. Mr Chynoweth-I rise on a point of order, My Deputy Speaker.",31
119,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"You had better have a point of order. Mr ChynowethThe honourable member speaking is obviously threatening me if I do not have a point of order. My point of order is that his speech is not relevant to the question at all. The honourable member is having discussions about the government, and it has nothing to do with the issue at hand.",32
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,32
121,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"I am reminded that the honourable member is one of those who contributed to the selling of all the trams in Melbourne so,that the conductors could be paid, and he could not even give you, Mr Deputy Speaker, a section of the standing orders as an introduction to his remarks on relevance. Relevance goes to many parts of this debate. There is nothing more relevant than the standing of honourable members of parliament in this place. Until last night-by their own admission-they have been treated like dummies. They have behaved like dummies. They rushed out there and said, 'Our big mouth Prime Minister will convince silly Australia that they can cop all these tax increases in our budget deficit reduction program'. What did the government get when it got out there? It ran into a brick wall of people who said, 'We don't believe you. We don't trust you. We don't want to know you'. Do you know what one honourable member on the government side said last night to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)? She said, 'We used to trust you, Joe, but we don't trust you anymore'. Let honourable members get up on for a point of order and deny that that was said. That is the state of politics in this place when the Labor Party does not trust its own Treasurer. They were the words that a woman said, did she not? Deny it. Get up and say that it did not happen. Mislead this House.",32
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor is usually very careful to pass his remarks through the chair. On this occasion he should do so.,32
123,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"Sir, I invite you to ask the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) to deny that that circumstance occurred in his own party room last night. The whole point is that for the first time in 10 years the honourable member for Dunkley did show a bit of courage last night. He has been totally subjugated, and this is the evidence. Mr Horne-Would you recognise courage if you saw it?",32
124,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"Listen, mate, I have had my involvements, and let me tell you that I know a bit about it. Courage is doing things when you are frightened, and I have done that a few times. The press gallery is vacant; on the other hand, the members might be looking at their television sets. I wonder whether the press gallery will be sufficient of a sucker on two issues, the first being this government line that the party with 36 votes in the Senate is somehow irrelevant. This is the party which took the lead in condemning this treatment of the poor and the underprivileged by loading up their petrol bills, and loading up the cost of everything they buy. I do not see the Democrats wanting to do something about the burden that the government has put on diesel fuels. Diesel fuels are probably the most environmentally sensible liquid fuel. The cost of diesel fuel goes on the price of every item that the government's constituents buy, through freight charges and other ways that, according to the government's own admission will add 0.7 per cent to the cost of groceries: I do not see that the government has done anything about that, or how it will do things for the car industry and everyone else who relies on that fuel to transport the components to the factories and deliver the fully built cars to the retailers. The government does not wan- to give them a chance; it has done nothtog. Its changes last night are tokenistic. The government and the Democrats will have a second go at trying to convince the Australian people that it is okay now. Let me give honourable members opposite who want to talk about whether we are relevant or not a lesson in simple arithmetic. We led you; we led the parliament. We are told that we have not got policy or commitment. We were the first to state our position on the budget. Then, I think, came the Democrats, and then came the government. It came along last in abject fear only when it discovered that its talking head, whom it has also discovered has no ability to administer this country, could not sell the budget for it. So !he government is in trouble. In its anger and m an a-tempt to divert public attention, it comes to here and cuts off the matter of public importance-something it could have done over the weeks in a fraction of the time that this debate has taken. I say to the government that, if it really needed the time today, why did it not bring some legislation into this place. The minister is so embarrassed that he got up and said, 'We are doing this to you as our final favour; we are giving you a bit of a chance to talk on the aJ;>propriation bills'. It is amazing that there IS anybody left on the government side wanting to talk about the appropriation biIIs. Appropriation is a very moderate word for what the government is doing. There are some other words that are more appropriate but one would get locked up for using them. The 'appropriation bills' is right! Then we see in the Notice Paper that there is also a loan bill. It is a loan bill all right. About 25 to 30 per c-nt of the government's revenues this year will be borrowed-that is, after hitting poor people with a massive load on their motor cars. Mr Cleary, the independent member for-Chifley, is it? No, it is the honourable member for Wills. I got my prime ministers mixed up. Mr Chynoweth-You are getting mixed up.",32
125,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"There used to be a prime minister down there. It is a pity for the honourable member for Dunkley that he is not around at the moment. He would not have got honourable members into this mess. The simple fact is that the honourable member for WiIls tells us that, in his working class electorate, he has checked the service stations and about 80 per cent of the fuel sold there is still leaded petrol. That is what he tells us. Mr Sharp-That's right. The poorer they are, the more they pay.",33
126,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"Yes. Honourable members should go to the car parks of the university students and see how long it takes to count the unleaded motor cars. They are not there. That is the government's other problem in simple arithmetic. The government has its own 30 votes, and it has the seven Democrats-that was never in dispute. They always vote with the government; they are the left wing of its party. We will see where the Greens eventually cast their vote. They are not wedded to the government; they are demonstrating independence. They stood up to all the sorts of blandishments that the government has managed to practise on the Democrats for all these years over the other issue. The government was on notice last May about the issue of the parliamentary program. The government shrugged it off, it had a little bit of a talk, and decided that it would charm the poor old Greens, and if it could not it would bully them in their traditional practice. The government lost both rounds. The budget has not been passed yet. The government has not got its rotten taxes passed yet. I think those particular ladies will go and count the leaded cars in those university car parks, and they will recognise their responsibility to those students who frequently have only that source of transport to their universities. It is an outrageous thing that the government has done today and it has done it suggesting that it needs the time. It has no legislation, yet the government knew last May that this was likely to happen. It made no plans because it does not know how to make plans. The government has let itself be run by the bureaucracy on its legislative, program. Half the time the government does not know what is in it. Most of the time it is wrong and Lee; M. J. we have to bring it back here time and time again to fix it. The Leader of the House wants to talk about us as ning-nongs. That is a nice, little childish word. I am amazed that he did not say, 'My dad can beat your dad'. He never voted down a speaker. He had a bit of integri- Simmons, D. W. ty. He kept out of the chamber when all of those people whom he tries to make heroes such as Whitlam and others did so. The simple fact is that he has got no care for this place. He is in here being petulant and arrogant. He is just trying to teach us a lesson. He has wasted time doing it, as he did the other day. If he thinks he is going to frighten us off in our determination to protect Atkinson, R. A. the people of Australia from the government's rotten taxes and. its mistreatment of the poor, Cadman, A.

127,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill represents a continuation of the Commonwealth government's commitment to the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP, which addresses the inequality of education opportunities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act was enacted in 1989 after obtaining joint agreement from all state and territory governments and the Commonwealth. The Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, which underpins the policy was introduced in 1990. The policy sets down 21 agreed goals for Aboriginal education to be pursued by all governments. The policy statement included a commitment by the Commonwealth to supplement its normal provisions of recurrent and capital funding for education in the states and territories with a dedicated commitment of funds on a forward triennial basis for assisting the implementation of the AEP through the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. Funding provided by this bill will provide the means to continue to build on the gains achieved since 1990. Since"" that time the Commonwealth has funded strategic initiatives directed at improving the - ucational outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is noteworthy introduction of the AEP the Commonwealth has allocated some $455 million in funding under the AESIP. These funds are additional to the other forms of direct assistance to individuals and groups. In this second triennium of the AEP which covers the years 1993 to 1995 the Commonwealth has nominated three national priorities. These priorities are: first, responding to the relevant recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody; second, implementing the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy, which provides for specific' initiatives for the advancement of Aboriginal an- Torres Strait Islander languages and literacy; and third, implementing the national reconciliation and schooling strategy which provides for specific schooling strategies which promote the reconciliation process between Australia's indigenous and non-indigenous people. In responding to the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the Commonwealth government recognises that a thrust of the recommendations is the elimination of significant social, economic and cultural disadvantages faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a process of increased self-determination and empowerment. There needs to be continued impetus given to increasing the self-esteem and confidence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Specific recommendations of the royal commission which are addressed by funding under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 relate to the increased employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers from 1993 and an expansion of preschool services from 1994. In the 1991 budget a range of initiatives were announced as part of the white paper on Australian languages and literacy. Significant elements of the white paper are initiatives directed towards the advancement of Aboriginallanguages and literacy, by the implementation of the national Aboriginal languages that since the and literacy strategy. The Aboriginal language education strategy, ALES, commenced in January 1993. ALES supports strategies geared at teaching Aboriginal languages in schools. These strategies "" include: special 'languages other than English programs' in Aboriginal languages for children attending Aboriginal schools; bilingual and bicultural programs; measures for the development of Aboriginal languages curriculum and materials production; and the provision of Aboriginal bilingual language teaching and paraprofessional staffing resources. Such activities, I believe, have a critical place in the maintenance and rejuvenation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. The Aboriginal literacy strategy, ALS, which also commenced in January 1993, supports special initiatives to improve the standard in English literacy of Aboriginal primary and secondary students, particularly those students whose first language is not English. Here again I see an opportunity to break down barriers, reduce disadvantage, and create positive self-esteem. The third priority of the Commonwealth for this triennium is the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. The role of Aboriginal studies, both as a discrete area of study and a- an integral part of all curriculum, is vital to enable the advancement in harmonious relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. It is also essential for bridging the gap between home and school for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Aboriginal studies will be all levels of education from preschool, through formal schooling to post-schooling and higher education. Aboriginal studies will make a significant contribution in the process of reconciliation. The negative attitudes towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on a large range of issues need to change. These attitudes are major obstacles in the development of harmonious cross-cultural relations. The process of including Aboriginal studies in the curriculum has created an opportunity for effective change. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewpoints on social, cultural and historical matters are providing much needed opportunities for non-Aboriginal people to redefine and increase the richness of their understanding of their society. It is also a strategy which will assist in maintaining the rich indigenous cultures of this nation and the identity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Bilingual and bicultural education is essential if strong and weakening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are to be maintained. From an educational perspective, it is vital that a balance be found between the maintenance of Aboriginal languages and the teaching of English literacy. The acquisition of knowledge and skills to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to live without disadvantage in the wider society on the one hand and the retention of Aboriginal culture on the other will continue to be a challenging issue. Elements of the reconciliation and schooling strategy for which specific funds were appropriated in 1991-92 and 1992-93 include: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies curriculum project, which contributes to the national collaborative curriculum exercise and to preparing a publication for use in Australian schools; a review and survey of best practice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schooling, which has led to the production of a video and teaching notes; the teacher in-service modular education system, designed to increase the quality of in-service training of teachers of Aboriginal studies and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander for students; a comparable exercise for teacher preservice training; the sister schools scheme, which was launched in 1992 and aims to encourage contact between students of predominantly non-Aboriginal schools with students in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schools; the local history project, which includes a video and resource kit and encourages and helps. Aboriginal school communities. to research and prepare local histories for use in the Aboriginal studies curriculum of their schools; steps to research and develop a national strategy to improve education and training for Aboriginal prisoners and ex-offenders, who are amongst the most educationally disadvantaged in Australia; the establishment of a secretariat to plan and organise the Third World indigenous peoples conference on education which is to be held in Wollongong in December 1993; and, finally, the school speakers program under which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people visit schools as guest speakers to talk about indigenous culture and history. Much more needs to be done to ensure the continuation of efforts towards achieving our set goals and to address the vital national issue of ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are equally as well taught, well educated, highly motivated and successful as any other Australian. A major review of progress in implementing the AEP since its implementation in 1990 is currently under way. I hope to complete the review in time for consideration in next year's budget of funding for the 1996-1998 triennium. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993 provides for a modest increase in commonwealth funding of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program for the years 1994 and 1995. The purpose of the bill is to appropriate funds to enable the commonwealth to continue to enter into bilateral education agreements with state and territory governments, non-government school systems, Aboriginal education institutions and Aboriginal education consultative bodies for the provision of Aboriginal education initiatives consistent with the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy. The government has allocated some $244 million as its commitment to the AEP in the current triennium. This amount includes $17.3 million in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, specifically targeted to provide additional preschool places and additional Aboriginal education workers. In addition, an amount of $16.8 million has been included for Aboriginal languages and literacy initiatives. This bill provides for the appropriand ation of $82.966 million in 1994 and $83.919 million in 1995. I commend the bill to the House of Representatives, and I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MACKellar) adjourned. NA (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL First Reading Bill presented by Mr Duncan, and read a first time. Second Reading",35
128,Mr DUNCAN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 was last the subject of extensive amendment in 1987 when provision was made for state law enforcement agencies' use of interception. After some experience had been obtained in the administration of the amended provisions, the act was reviewed by the Attorney-General's Department. The review looked at the experience of the various agencies which are given specific roles to perform under the act and also took into account the need for the act to reflect developments in the provision of telecommunications services arising from either technological innovations or the implementation of the industry reforms contained in the Telecommunications Act 1991. In December 1991 a discussion paper was published and comments were invited from the public. Copies were sent to organisations that had expressed an interest in the subject. Although few comments were received, the review team had regard to those that were made in framing its recommendations to the Attorney-General. This bill contains amendments to the act which the government believes are desirable following its consideration of the review. The amendments address some current practical problems with the act without disturbing the act's present balance between privacy interests law enforcement. While many of the bill's provisions are of a technical or administrative nature, designed to rectify some minor defects in the scheme of the act, there are some significant aspects which deserve to be brought to the attention of the House. The most significant change relates to the manner in which warrants are executed. Currently, the sole responsibility for executing 1993 warrants issued to a law enforcement agency-state or fec\eral-lies with the Telecommunications Interception Division of the AFP. That division's role was developed in 1987 as a means of strengthening privacy protection and ensuring that there was federal control over interceptions. It is for the same reason that the act also currently requires that, subject to a limited exception, interceptions may only be done as a result of action taken by employees of the carrier operating the service specified in a warrant, rather than directly by the police. The act's requirements that the Telecommunications Interception Division of the AFP execute all warrants has led to the development of a cumbersome and costly set of arrangements. These arrangements require all intercepted signals to be routed from a target exchange wherever it is located in Australia to the TID's facilities in Canberra, where the signals are recorded at the same time as they are rerouted to the monitoring centre of the law enforcement agency which applied for the warrant. This process can result in loss or corruption of signal quality, involves considerable expense and gives rise to some risk to the security of interception operations. The government proposes to replace these arrangements with a new system which will resolve most of the current deficiencies. As is the case at present, the new system will ensure that a law enforcement agency will only be able to receive intercepted signals as a result of the AFP taking action for the purpose of giving effect to a warrant. The AFP will also retain the ability to disconnect an interception directly when, for example, a warrant has expired. The technology by which this is achieved is a computer controlled cross-point switcher, which was developed by the Victorian police. Its advantages include better signal quality and reliability at a lower cost. The new system will also provide greater security since intercepted signals will no longer be diverted through Canberra. Existing reporting mechanisms will be enhanced by a requirement for a register of warrants to be kept and regularly submitted for ministerial inspection. The bill also provides for the Australian Federal Police, or the police force of a state or territory, to monitor or record telephone calls without a warrant in certain emergency situations. To respond to certain emergencies, such as sieges, kidnappings or hostage taking incidents, the police usually communicate with the perpetrators by telephone and often need to provide facilities to allow a second negotiator or medical professional to monitor conversations. As a general rule, the act prohibits a person from recording a conversation without the knowledge of the person speaking. Subsection 6(2) of the act already provides an exception to the rule in cases where a person uses customer equipment for which Austel has issued a permit authorising connection to the telecommunications network, but Austel's usual practice is to authorise such equipment only where the equipment emits at regular intervals a pip tone that helps to put people on notice that a recording is taking place. Because of the potential adverse effect on the rights of individuals, the government does not believe that it is appropriate for the to record telephone conversations in the types of emergency situations I have described without clear statutory criteria. Accordingly, the bill provides that the authority to record conversations without a warrant will only arise in specified circumstances, namely, where a police officer is a party to a conversation in situations of emergency involving actual or threatened loss of life or serious personal injury or damage to property, or with the permission of a person who is likely to receive ransom or extortion demands. In the former case, a test to be satisfied by the police is that, because of the urgency of the need to record the relevant conversations, it was not practical to apply for the issue of a warrant under the act. This test does not have to be satisfied in the latter case as the consent of the innocent party is a prerequisite. Police use of this authority will be reported to the minister and will be recorded in the annual report. A further amendment made by the bill is to remove the current restriction which confines a state agency's ability to seek a warrant to telephone services located in its own state. The government does· not believe such a restriction is appropriate since important investigations may be frustrated by a suspect's moving interstate. The removal of the restriction means that a state agency will still only be able to seek the issue of a warrant for the purpose of investigating an offence in the course of performing its functions. That means that a state law enforcement agency could only successfully apply for a warrant authorising interception of a service outside the relevant state if it could persuade the issuing judge that there is a reasonable nexus between the service specified in the warrant application and the agency's investigation of an offence for which it has responsibility. The bill provides for a number of other amendments, such as the inclusion of offences against part VIA of the Crimes Act 1914, dealing with computer crimes, in the category of offences for which an interception warrant may be sought, the inclusion of the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission in the list police of state agencies which may, subject to meeting certain statutory pre-conditions, become entitled to apply for warrants and the inclusion in the annual report made under the act of additional information relating to the costs associated with the performance of interceptions by law enforcement agencies. Details of cost have been included in the 1991-92 annual report in anticipation of this amendment. It is anticipated that the bill's financial impact will be to reduce the overalI cost of interception by about $2 million. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MACKellar) adjourned. NA BILL (No.2) 1993 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Sciacca, and read a first time. Second Reading",38
129,Mr SCIACCA,SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (4.33 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Social Security Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 gives effect to a number of measures that were announced in the 1993 budget. The bill provides for a $3 a week increase in the rate of newstart allowance paid to certain single recipients aged 21 and over without dependent children. The rate increase is an acknowledgment that the relative position of this group has falIen compared with other income support recipients. This increase will take effect from 20 March 1994 and will be additional to the indexation increase that has already occurred on that date. It will not apply to single recipients who are aged 60 or more, do not have any dependent children and have been in receipt of social security benefit continuously for at least six months as they already receive a higher rate of newstart allowance. Income and assets tests have previously been introduced for basic family payment to ensure that financial assistance is targeted towards those families with the greatest need. Given the current fiscal situation, the governprovisions, ment decided that the relatively generous limits should be reviewed. The bill provides that on 1 January 1994, the income ceiling limit for basic family payment for families with one child will be reduced from $64,938 to $60,000. The additional amount allowed for each extra child will be reduced from $3,249 to $3,000. Also on 1 January 1994, the existing assets test limit for basic family payment will be reduced from $607,250 to $550,000. However, the hardship rules that allow the operation of the assets test to be waived in certain circumstances will continue to apply. Families receiving a prescribed educational scheme payment are currently exempt from the basic and additional family payment income tests and from the additional family payment assets test simply because they receive a prescribed educational scheme payment. This means that a family receives family payment or additional family payment even if their income exceeds the relevant income test limit or may receive additional family payment even if the value of their assets exceeds the additional family payment assets test limit. The bill removes this inequity from 1 January 1994 by placing such families in the same situation, in terms of their total income assistance and support package, as other families who do not receive prescribed educational scheme payments such as Austudy. Social security clients must comply with notification requirements so that their payments can be administered efficiently. There can be complications, especially for the regular family payment review, when clients change address without notifying the department and cannot therefore respond to notices sent to them. To overcome such complications, highlighted by the cases of O'Connell and Sevel, the act will now make it a requirement for a family payment client to notify a change of address. There will also be a new discretionary power to suspend family payment if a person has been informed about having to notify a change of address but fails to respond to a notice because of a change of address. The current limitation on arrears should a decision to cancel or reduce payments be subsequently overturned on review, is also to be reinforced in light of the O'Connell and Sevel cases. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA First Reading Bill presented by Mr O'Keefe, and read a 'first time. Second Reading",40
130,Mr OKEEFE,DEPARTURE TAX AMENDMENT,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.38 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Departure Tax Act 1978 to provide that the rate of the tax be increased from $20 to $25 with effect from 1 January 1994. The decision to increase the departure tax was taken at the same time as the government decided to increase funding for tourism. As announced in the budget, an additional $80 million has been allocated to boost the development of new tourism products and for tourism promotion over the next four years. This funQing includes an extra $8 million in 1993-94 and $10 million per annum to 1996-97 fOJ; overseas market development by the Australian Tourist Commission which will help ensure strong growth in inbound tourism and add to job creation. The increase in departure tax will help offset this additional tourist promotion expenditure. At $25, Australia's departure tax will be around the same level as charges imposed on international travellers by authorities in the United States and Fiji and is below those levied in Japan, Hong Kong, Canada and in a number of European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Greece and Germany. The increase in departure tax is expected increase revenue by some $11 million in 1993-94, $28 million in 1994-95, $30 million in 1995-96 and $32 million in 1996-97. I commend the bill to the House' and present the explanatory memorandum for the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MACKellar) adjourned. NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION (SAFEGUARDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1993 BILL 1993 Cognate bill: NA (PRODUCERS OF URANIUM ORE CONCENTRATES) CHARGE BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 May, on motion by Mr Gear: That the bill be now read a second time.",41
131,Mr MCGAURAN,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"The coalition does not oppose the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Amendment Bill and the Nuclear Safeguards (Producers of Uranium Ore Concentrates) Charge Bill which are before the House. They seek to impose a· charge on commercial uranium producers to recover some costs incurred by the Australian Safeguards Office, the ASO, in conducting nuclear safeguards and physical protection programs which arise as a result of commercial activities. Specifically, the Nuclear Safeguards (Producers of Uranium Ore Concentrates) Charge Bill enacts the relevant cost recovery arrangements, while the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Amendment Bill sets the charges payable and specifies when they are to be paid. The charges will apply to the two uranium mining operations currently in operationthose uranium mining operations at Olympic Dam in' South Australia and Ranger in the Northern Territory. The charges are set at a maximum of $500 per annum per company. It is expected, however, that the charge for each company will be in the order of $340,000 per annum or 20c per kilo of uranium produced. The bills incorporate opportunities for the to relevant companies to participate in the structuring of the ASO's annual budget to ensure an appropriate 'level of efficiency in that office's operations. Moreover, charges will not apply if a company has not derived a cash flow from exports of uranium oxide production in the previous year; On this point, I should add that the annual budget for the ASO is guaranteed and is not contingent, as I understand it, on a set production level to be achieved by the two relevant companies. The financial independence of the ASO is therefore continuously guaranteed. The goverrupent considers that the ASO's activities encompass legitimate public responsibilities as well as providing services to industry, or at least services conducted on its behalf. Given this, the bills represent an effort them. to single out the costs borne by the government for the supply of industry services anq recoup these costs direct from the relevant producers. The ASO .conducts only one or two site inspections at Ranger and Olympic Dam each year, so industry does not derive a clear-cut service as such from the activities of the ASO. However, the bulk of· the ASO's programs do arise as a result of the companies' activities, so the user-pays principle can justifiably be applied. Activities co-ducttXl by the ASO in regard to the non-proliferation treaty are regarded as national security issues, the costs of which are borne by the community. On the basis of the ASO's current budget, the charges defined in the bills will cover 50 per cent of its total annual costs-some $780,000 out of $1.4 million. !include in that total of $1.4 million not just the $1 million per annum set aside by way of appropriations but the $400,000 or so that is picked up by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in regard to other liabilities and costs connected with the program. As I mentioned, the coalition does not oppose these bills. They enact a user-pays approach to the conduct of a governmental activity which largely arises from the result of the activities of private sector companies. This is an approach to public sector activities the coalition has long espoused. Like so many other policies advocated by the coalition, the government has now seen fit to adopt this particular policy in the post-election period. My only real reservation with the bills and the approach the government has adopted in this regard, stems from the manner in which the initial costing of the charges to apply to the industry have been set. I am pleased that there will be an opportunity for companies to have some input into the structure of the ASO's future budgets. This will ensure that the ASO obtains a level of efficiency that is acceptable for the industry, which is now to foot the bill for the bulk of its operation. However, I would have anticipated that the initial setting of the charges would have been conducted in hand with the industry groups which must now pay As the case is now, the industry is saddled with a fixed costing based on the government's desegregation of the ASO's responsibilities. Just by what mechanism and what precise proces- the government has reached its determination of the charges to apply to the ASO's industry related services or programs is unclear. Moreover, it is also unclear just how the 30 per cent of the ASO's budget the government will foot has been precisely identified and costed. From the lack of detail in the second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), it is apparent that a loose rule of thumb reasoning has applied. I raise this issue because a cost recovery exercise of the type to be put in place through the amendments to the principal acts is not an easy thing. The ASO does not explicitly provide a service as such to industry, let alone a service which can be readily singled out and costed. The government is applying a cost recovery requirement on industry as a result of activities it carries out largely as a result of the existence of the industry. The government must understand that when governments adopt a cost recovery exercise, such as that intended by virtue of these bills, they need to proceed in a transparent way which incorporates close consultation with the user groups. As I said, the coalition is pleased enough to note the government has provided for future consultation to take place in respect of the structure and allocation of the ASO's budget, but the initial decision which set the bottom line costings was set without consultation and virtually comes as a fait accompli to the industry. I would also add that the bills do not explicitly outline just how the future consultation between industry and the ASO will take place. I am sure the ASO is mildly interested in the mechanics of this exercise. What degree of interplay and negotiation will there be with respect to the ASO's budget and operational activities? What will be the forum through which this will take place and how will it be constituted? Will the industry be able to influence the direction of the ASO's research and development program? These are questions of detail that the minister's second reading speech has not touched upon. While the coalition will not oppose the bills, it will signal its concern that, if charges such as those outlined in the bills are to be placed at the feet of industry, then the client or user group deserves to have access to more information about the due processes than here provided. Moreover, I am unsure just how much the service provider-in this case the ASO-really knows about its new found relationship with industry. The bills give the distinct impression that they have been quickly drafted and pushed before the parliament without a great deal of deliberation. The momentum for the exercise seems to have been prompted by a desire to get a hold on the money from the industry as soon as possible. I would also add that I am unsure as to how the bills before the House align with other plans mooted by the government to streamline the supervisory and regulatory bodies overseeing the mining industry. Personally, I would have thought that any considered public policy process might have, firstly sharpened the organisational structure of its regulatory bodies and then moved to the costing and charging issues. At the moment there is a profusion of oversight and regulatory bodies all reporting to different ministers, and there is a case to be made that these need to be reorganised. We have, for instance, the office of the supervising scientist, which focuses on the scientific status of the Alligator Rivers region and the monitoring of the activities of the Ranger uranium mine, reporting to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. We have the Australian Safeguards Office reporting to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. We have the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which oversees the operation of the national nuclear facilities at Lucas Heights, reporting to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Similarly, we have the Safety Review Committee and the Australian Radiation Laboratory. We also have the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency reporting to the Minister for the - nvironment, Sport and Territories. On top of this, we have a plethora of related research and monitoring expertise in the universities and in government agencies such as the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation-if the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) has not closed it down-and CSIRO. Something needs to be done about the distribution of research, monitoring and regulatory roles across the organisations so that they can operate more efficiently and create fewer encumbrances for industry. There are simply too many bodies pursuing too many overlapping tasks. With these bills there are a great many points at which industry is being asked to hand over moneys to the federal government. If we are serious about helping industry, we ought to be streamlining these procedures as far as possible and freeing up industry's administrative resources. I believe the government has shown a willingness to move on this issue. If this is so it is difficult to see why the cost recovery issue for the ASO has been rushed into the parliament prior to the reorganisation of the research and oversight bodies. Having said this, I would not wish to deride the important work of the Australian Safeguards Office. Government undertakings have caused the coalition to have concerns with the bills before the House-not the undertakings of the ASO. The ASO exercises responsibilities in regard to the management of domestic and international nuclear safeguards and physical protection programs. Specifically, the ASO ensures that uranium oxide produced in Australia is securely maintained, that transactions are carefully monitored an.d that exports are used for peaceful purposes only. This requires close supervisory procedures from the point of production to end destination overseas. The supervision of production in Australia is carried out under guidelines required by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Monitoring procedures for exports are conducted under several bilateral arrangements with purchaser countries, though international atomic energy guidelines again apply. Before a country can receive Australian uranium, it must have signed a safeguards agreement with Australia. At the moment I understand there to be some 13 bilateral arrangements in place-including that with Euratom-which cover around about 80 per cent of the world's nuclear power generation. These bilateral arrangements legally bind signatories to ensure that Australian produced uranium-or Australian obligated nuclear material, in the parlance of the safeguard sector-is not used or diverted to the manufacture of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices; is not used for research and development of such weapons or devices; and is not used for military purposes. Further to this, Australia's bilateral safeguards arrangements also require Australia's consent for any proposed retransfer of Australian nuclear material beyond the jurisdiction of the receiving state or for the further enrichment of uranium. The ASO's activities in regard to accounting for domestic nuclear materials produced, stored and exported also serve to meet Australia's obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1970. The treaty is predominantly concerned with the suppression of the spread of nuclear weapons and weapon related technologies. The tasks undertaken by the ASO to ensure that Australian obligated nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful purposes also serve to meet the terms of that multinational agreement. While Australia, to the coalition's mind, is regrettably a small player In the international uranium export market, we have a significant role in enforcing safeguards and monitoring procedures. As exporters of uranium, we have necessary and important obligations to the international community-and for good reason. Australia has somewhere up to 35,000 tonnes of natural uranium and depleted and enriched uranium circulating within the international nuclear fuel cycle. This figure of 35,000 tonnes mostly represents the accumulated input into the nuclear fuel cycle since the early 1980s. The bulk of this is in countries such as France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Korea. It should also be noted that there are some 340 power reactors supplying some 83 per cent of the world's nuclear electricity generating capacity operating in those countries which are eligible to receive Australian produced uranium. Moreover, during the year 1991 there were some 51 shipments of uranium ore concentrates, totalling 7,218 tonnes, to conversion facilities in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Republic of Korea, France, Germany and Canada. In view of this, our contacts with the nuclear generated electricity industry are across a wide front, and that necessitates a high level of vigilance on our part. I mentioned moments ago that I regretted that Australia could not be a more significant player in the international uranium export market. This is not a policy prescription that the government has been able to embrace, because of internal policy reasons which are quite well known to the House. The government has remained wedded toa policy of only permitting the operation of three uranium export mines in this country. It is a facile and absurd policy position which has no credibility anywhere else, except within the Labor Left-and even there it is only held on to with such fervour because it represents the dying ebb of the Left's influence on the national political agenda. But the government must now appreciate that this political hangover from the 1970s must be exorcised from the conduct of its minerals and energy policy. Indeed, it is directly counter to many of the policy trends that the government has adopted in recent years. Putting the Mabo issue aside for the moment, we have seen the government increasingly accept some commercial realities in the mining sector. In regard to Mabo, of course, the government has not approached the issue with any appreciation of the commercial realities in regard to the mining sector. For instance, we have seen the market for LPG deregulated. We have seen some rationalisation of the interventionist policies in the coal industry, particularly those to do with levies and charges and so forth. We have seen a retreat on the use of export powers affecting iron ore exports. We have heard some strong talk on the competitive framework for a national electricity grid. We have seen the government accept, to some degree at least, that the natural gas market will not expand unless the array of state and federal administrative impediments are swept away. Generally, the government has shown some limited appreciation of what the industry has been telling it for so long: the needlessly regulatory presence of government is an obstacle to the optimal development of the minerals and energy sectors. But here in the uranium export market the federal government retains one of the great dinosaurs of public policy-the restrictive three uranium mines policy. I should say the two uranium mines policy to be exact. Labor policy permits the operation of three site specific mines: Nabarlek and Ranger in the Northern Territory and Olympic Dam at Roxby Downs in South Australia. Nabalek is mined out and in effect the three uranium mines policy is now the two uranium mines policy. I have heard all the government's excuses for the retention of this policy setting over years. Essentially, when pressed, the federal government, being too embarrassed to raise moral objections to uranium mining since the decision to allow exports to France, now has recourse to pseudo-economic arguments that market conditions do not warrant a change of policy. We all know this is hardly any sort of justification whatsoever. We all know that the capacity of the federal government to predict market conditions ahead of the industry is extremely limited, to put it mildly. The test of what the production levels for uranium ought to be, the relationship with the supply and demand factors affecting inventories and contract prices affecting global nuclear electriWar, city generating utilities must all be left to market itself. Whether uranium prices are up or down, or spot prices are in a slump, should not be a reason for the government to interfere with the development of the industry. When we are dealing with major companies such as Energy Resources of Australia Ltd, Western Mining Corporation, CRA and Denison, I highly doubt that the government's commercial intelligence is more advanced than theirs, especially when it is those companies' investment dollars which are at risk. But on the basis that the government knows what is best for the uranium export industry, the nation has been stuck with a policy setting which has robbed it of potential export earnings and a greater number of jobs. I say this because market conditions for uranium exports are on the improve. Once again we have that very brief opportunity to let the industry capture a greater share. It is an opportunity the government cannot afford to let slide by on the basis of some ideological fiction. The federal government knows that the market is building up momentum as well. Those members who have had the opportunity to read the budget papers would have noted in budget paper No. 1 that the federal government quietly announced that it intends to sell off the Commonwealth's stockpile of uranium. I would like to formally ask the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), who is at the table, to inform the House of the precise commercial assessments and tendering prothe cesses that the government plans to undertake-or which are already in place-to achieve this result of selling off the Commonwealth's stockpile of uranium. Both sides of the House would be interested to know, I feel sure, that the federal government is active in the commercial sale of uranium. The Commonwealth's stockpile has been with us for some time. I recall that it stands at around 2,500 short tonnes, mostly stored at the site of the Ranger uranium mine; but also in smaller quantities, around 250 tonnes, at the site of the national nuclear facilities at Lucas Heights in south Sydney. The stockpile dates from the 1950s, the time of the Cold when the Commonwealth for strategic the reasons held an understandable public interest in the exports of uranium from sites such as Rum Jungle. There was also later public interest in other mines over time, with partial public ownership in Queensland Mines' Nabarlek and what is now ERA's Ranger operations. The stockpile has been drawn on and substituted over time, and what we finally disposed of by commercial sale probably bore little resemblance to the original source of uranium. But, regardless of this, the government has finally acceded to market conditions and accepted that the supply and demand patterns are strengthening again. Having made this concession, the government must now go back and reassess the national and community returns of abolishing the three-mine policy. Rather than pumping out public funds to administer employment programs, the government should be committed to creating real jobs in a real industry. Here is its chance: it should abolish the three uranium mine policy. If the government is genuine in its declaration on budget night that its priority is jobs, if wants to be taken seriously and if it wants to see private sector investment increase, then the abolition of the three-mine policy will help deliver that. New market opportunities are opening up in the uranium export sector. Australia's uranium mining operations are amongst the lowest cost producers in the world. We hold 30 per cent of the world's lowest cost reserves, but we have a small market share-less than 10 per cent of the global market. That is about 4,000 tonnes produced against an annual world consumption rate of around 56,000 tonnes. The Canadian government, the major recipient of the largesse of the Australian Labor Government's restricted three-mine policy, is of course delighted with the government's dogmatic observance of the three or, more correctly, two-mine policy. Its higher cost producers hold around 30 per cent of the global market, supplying some 15,000 tonnes or more to the world market. It is laughing all the way to the bank with its foreign exchange earnings, while our lower cost producers watch their natural advantages go to waste. But we do have a real opportunity over the next year or so to move into the market and derive a genuine community return on one of Australia's few areas of comparative market strength. From the low earnings in the last few years, export earnings from the existing two uranium mines-Ranger and Olympic Dam-are predicted by ABARE to recover from $123 million in the current year to be $181 million in the next financial year; that is, exports are set to rise from around 2,290 tonnes to 3,600 tonnes. The spot pr-ce has recovered from its lows in January, when it dipped to about $US9.70 per pound, to be a little more than $US 10.30 now. ABARE contends that the spot price will continue to recover to be somewhere around $USll-about $13 per pound-by midway through next financial year. This upward drift in the spot price reflects growing demand for uranium by overseas nuclear based electricity utilities. The market is firming in the short-term, but it is firming up in the longer term as well-and in a more it convincing manner still. Power utilities are at last drawing down on their inventories which have built up over the last two decades. They are looking for reliable suppliers, and for a diversity of suppliers as well. The annual consumption of uranium has been about twice the rate of production for a few years now, and stockpiles have eroded. Overseas electricity utilities will reportedly consume some 56,000 tonnes of uranium oxide this year, but production is at only 28,000 tonnes. This is a trend which has been in place for some years now, and it has finally cracked open those huge inventories stockpiled as far back as the 1970s, when spot prices hit around $US40 per pound. Consequently, of late we have seen reports that the operators of Ranger, ERA, have won new sales contracts-two from the USA and another from a European utility. But if we are to capitalise on these trends we need to abolish the three-mine policy as soon as possible or we will watch the market pass us by yet again, to the Canadians' glee. Moreover, if we do not throw out the restrictive uranium mining policy, we will also see one of the world's great mining deposits at Jabiluka go to waste. Jabiluka, now called North Ranger after its acquisition by ERA, has the potential to be one of the lowest cost producers in the world. It is a rich deposit. In an improved market with firm contract prices and an exchange rate of around $USO.70c, North Ranger could earn $6 billion or more in exports over its life. Mr Lee....:... Is that open-cut or underground?",41
132,Mr MCGAURAN,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"North Ranger, I would exp'ect, would be underground. The absurdity of the whole exercise is that the govertunent will keep it in cotton wool. This is despite the fact that Ranger has mined out' its readily accessible ore lodes and must move into deeper, higher cost ' reserves,. rather than simply extend operations to its North Ranger site some 15 kilometres up the road to Jabiru. This is the absurdity that a restrictive mining policy has yielded. We could 'eventually be down to a one-mine uranium policy whilst we stare at some of the best uranium ore deposits in the world. ' In Western Australia we have - other world class deposit in Kintyre, owned by CRA. It has proven reserves of around 35,000 tonnes. Like Jabililkaor North Ranger, the Kintyre deposit can be mined at the lowest end of the cost speCtrum. If given the green light by the government, this mine could be brought onstre1ul1 within two years for an investment of around $130 million. Once in' production, Kifltyre could produce around 1,200 tonnes of uranium oxide a year and earn the nation an extra $65 million or so in· precious foreign exchange earnings. If the community found the budget of 17 August lacking in economic credibility and leadership and if it could not swallow the Government's pretence at being genuinely concerned for jobs and i-vesttilent, then walt until it grasps the full significance of the retention of the restrictive two uranium mine policy. , Mr ROBERT BROWN (Charlton) (5.09 p.rtq-If we needed evidence that not only Australia but any country involved in the nuclear industry requires sane, sensible policieS and appropriate safeguards, then the contribution by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) to this debate on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Amendment Bill provided that evidence. It really becomes tedious to hear constant references to the overriding, almost exclusive importance of commercial considerations. It is not just the people involved in the mining, processing and utilisation of uranium who /ire concerned about the uranium industry.' There are millions of people throughout the world who are now, have been, and will continue to be, seriously concerned about some of the implications. I will have more to say about that later because this legislation essentially deals with the question of financing appropriate safeguard arrangements through the Australian Safeguards Office to ensure that our role is a responsible one. I take this ,opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee), my good friend and colleague, whose facilitation of this legislation is quite apparent. With the minister's background in science and engineering, I was expecting hiQl to ensure that, as soon as possible after the last election, we would give effect to an llndertaking which was given in the budget for 1992-93 and bring in this legislation. He has done so. And he has done it quickly-not, as the honourable member for Gippsland suggested, by forcing it into the parliament. Surely the honourable member for Gippsland was aware that in the budget papers for 1992-93 reference had been made to the fact that this legislation would be prepared, and it has been. The honourable member for Gippsland claimed that consultations had not been held with the industry about the appropriate apportionment of costs. I do not know with whom in the industry the honourable member has had consultations, but the government's attitude to this was made perfectly clear by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech. He said that it was the government's clear intention that uranium companies be fully consulted each year on the planned program of the ASO's activities, the costs involved and the charge proposed before the final charge is set in the regulations. In other words, company officials will sit down each year with the Director of Safeguards and other relevant officials and seek to agree on the level of the ASO's activity in relation company operations. No clearer undertaking could have been made. While the claim was made that the ments. ASO's program this year had not been properand ly detennined, the Assistant Treasurer, again in his second reading speech, made reference to that when he said that the ASO's of activities for 1993-94 had not been determined at that stage. So the charge for 1993-94 cannot yet be specified. The honourable member for Gippsland heard the presentation of the second reading speech, and I know that he would have read it. I am surprised that, despite the evidence contained in the second reading speech, would have made accusations of the kind that he has, especially that quite silly suggestion that the legislation was rushed into the ment. Of course, it was not. It had been very carefully considered. Moreover, it was considered the interests of the industry itself, not solely in the light of the commercial interests to which the honourable member would like to give exclusive consideration. Millions people around the world-apart from those in the mining industry itself, who would probconcern ably applaud his comments-would find his comments and those expressed by the interestsome ed parties for whom he speaks, rather tedious and, to some extent, dangerous. The office of the Director of Safeguards was established by the safeguards act of 1987. That safeguards act gave effect to Australia's safeguard obligations as detennined by: the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; Australia's NPT safeguards agreethe ment with the International Atomic Energy Agency; agreements between Australia . other countries and Euratom vanous ing transfer of nuclear items and cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy; and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The functions of the ASO can be summaproportion rised in tenns of three essential. roles fulfils. First of all, it acts as Australia's national safeguards authority for the applicaformed) !ion of safeguards within Australia. Secondly, It supports and contributes to the effective to operation of Australia's bilateral safeguards agreement, and accounts for Australian obligated nuclear material under those agreeThirdly, it contributes to the operation development of the international safeguards and the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and advises the governprogram ment on these matters. Clearly, the Australian Safeguards Office has represented a considered and, to my knowledge, effective response to the need for countries involved in the nuclear industry to adopt appropriate arrangements, controls, monitoring, recording and reporting procedures to minimise the risks. It is not approprihe ate for people who are speaking for quite legitimate interests in Australia to minimise those risks. I do not think that any responsible parliacommentator referring in any way to the international nuclear industry would suggest that there are no risks. Of course there are. Some of those risks have .become more in the light of apparent recently. I am pleased that, as a result of more recent arrangements between the United· States in of particular, and the Commonwealth of Independent States-the former Soviet Unio{l-:-the that the world had about the prolifer-:ation of nuclear weapons has been eased to extent. The legislation. with which we are dealing is essentially concerned with that element. I do not believe, however, that that is the chief concern the people of the world have at this stage. The chief concern continues to be the way in which nuclear energy is produced and the adequacy of arrangements made for treatment and disposal of nuclear waste. In an area as inherently dangerous as nuclear power, not even the best safeguards will concern-' prove completely adequate. The processing of uranium, waste disposal and the development of nuclear weapons are all elements of the essential problem. On the other hand, there is a large and increasing of people, particularly in the more that it advanced <;!ountries which depend upon nuclear energy for power generation. (Quorum It is appalling when a member of the government is making a devastating attack on the policies of the opposition that it takes advantage of the opportunity to minimise the amount of time available to him. I appreciate the fact that so many members of the government, who are so conscientiously concerned about this issue, have simply swamped the chamber and come into hear the issues being canvassed. There is not only a question of power generation concerned here. Had it not been for a nuclear industry, then all of those people who in so many ways have benefited from the development of nuclear medicine would not have had those advantages available to them. I want to draw attention to Australia's nuclear safeguards policy, whi<;:h has enjoyed wide bipartisan support. I want to emphasise that one of the reasons why this government made a decision to involve Australia in the export of uranium was essentially an appeal made.to us by the International Atomic Energy Agency. It urged Australia, as a responsible nation with a responsible government, to become involved in the world uranium trade. The agency knew, as all responsible countries around the world involved in this industry knew, that Australia would not export uranium without appropriate safeguards. TheSe are some of the measures that have been introduced in order to ensure that those safeguards are put in place. The key objective of our safeguards policy has been and continues to be to ensure that Australian uranium and the nuclear material derived from it, such as power reactor fuel elements, always remain in peaceful use and are not diverted to nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices. In this, we have been fully successful-as the annual reports of the Australian Safeguards Office and the International Atomic Energy Agency attest. These reported assessments are based on internationally approved methods of nuclear materials accountancy backed by physical inspections of the nuclear material and comprehensive systems of nuclear material surveillance and control. To be an acceptable recipient of Australian uranium, a potential customer country must satisfy certain conditions. If it is a nonnuclear weapon state, it must be prepared to accept full scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on all nuclear material at all existing and future nuclear facilities as set out in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons-the NPT. If it is a nuclear weapon state, it must give an assurance that the AONM, the Australian obligated nuclear material, will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and accept that such material would be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency or equivalent-for example, European Atomic Energy Community-safeguards. All five nuclear weapon states are now parties to the non-proliferation treaty. In all cases, customer states must also conclude a treaty level, legally binding, bilateral safeguards agreement with Australia which includes an undertaking that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes, or nuclear material derived from it, would not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that the IAEA safeguards would apply. There are other key requirements in the bilateral agreements. Australia's prior consent with appropriate safeguards must be obtained for the retransfer of AONM beyond the jurisdiction of the receiving state, for enrichment of AONM beyond 20 per cent in the fissile isotope uranium 235, or for the reprocessing of AONM. There is a requirement for AONM to be subject to internationally agreed standards of physical protection, a provision for the imposition of legal sanctions in the event that elements of the agreement are not complied with, and fall back safeguards if the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards should cease to apply. Compliance· with the provisions of aU agreements is monitored by the Australian Safeguards Office and the safeguards office of the country or group of countries concerned. Those bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements have been concluded between Australia and an increasingly large number of other countries: Canada in 1981, Egypt in 1989, the European Atomic Energy Community in 1982, Finland in 1980, France in 1981, Japan in 1982, the Republic of Korea in 1979, Mexico in 1992, the Philippines in 1982, the Russian Federation in 1990, Sweden in 1981, Switzerland in 1988, the United Kingdom in 1979 and the United States in 1981. All of those agreements represent a quite conscientious and effective determination on Australia's part to enter into these bilateral agreements and to make sure that Australia's contribution to the international nuclear industry is appropriately safeguarded and that Australian yellowcake is appropriately monitored. There is no way that the cost recovery proposed by the bills will compromise these safeguards policies and arrangements, since Australia and its partner countries are under legally enforceable international agreements to comply fully with them. However, cost recovery will ensure that the companies, which would be unable to export their uranium but for the operation of an effecti-e safeguards system, pay a fair share of'the costs of those safeguards. In addition, cost recovery will undoubtedly result in the companies taking a far keener interest than previously in the efficiency and effectiveness of the company related safeguards operations and activities in the Australian Safeguards Office. I think that the provisions impose a fairly important discipline on those who operate in these potentially dangerous industries-not potentially dangerous; they are dangerous industries, as recent events have made perfectly clear. About 10,000 of the people called liquidators, who helped to clean up the radioactive mess after Chernobyl, have died of acute radioactive illness. Up to 500,000 may yet develop cancer and leukaemia as a result of the accident. It is obviously important for internationally responsible countries such as Australia to make sure that these safeguards are appropriate. Just a matter of months ago, there was an explosion in Russia outside the Siberian city of Tomsk. It was claimed that there were no particular problems with it,' but a similar claim was made at the time of the Chernobyl accident. This has occurred not just with the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc countries; in the United States, as the Cold War ended, the Department of Energy revealed in 1989 that there were about 45,000 potentially radioactive sites in America, and. 20,000 of them were government owned. So it is a world, problem, and Australia is making a significant contribution to its solution. Again, I appreciate and congratulate the minister for facilitating the introduction of this. legislation. It will help to impose a sensible discipline on the industry and will help Australia meet· its international nuclear energy obligations.",47
133,Mrs GALLUS,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I would like to endorse some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) and the honourable member for, Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) on the work that the Australian Safeguards Office does. I do not think there is any doubt that it provides an absolutely valuable service to this country. However, having said that I would like to take some issue with the government over this whole uranium debate. 'Perhaps debate is the wrong word. I am.concerned about the lack of debate that comes from the government side. The positions that it takes are inconsistent and somewhat holier . than thou. The honourable member for Gippsland has refetred to the government's three· mines policy, which is now the two miries policy. There can be nothing more ludicrous than a government which says, 'wfi will export. We will dig up uranium at two mines. That is okay but, boy, it becomes terribly immoral once we do it at three mines'. Perhaps the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who is at the table, can tell me why the uranium that we are currently digging out of the ground .at Ranger and selling overseas is moral uranium but the uranium that would come out of North Ranger-previously Jabiluka-is immoral uranium. Frankly, I cannot see the difference. It seems to me that. what is wrong with this debate is that thegovemment is taking this stand, and we are not opening this debate up and. having a look at what really are the implications. Are we exporting. uranium or are we not? If we are, why do we not do it properly? If we are not, why do we not cease to do it? We should at least have a clear, definite policy, not have one foot in both camps, that. is winning the popular vote and trying to sell some uranium. We might have a two-mine policy \mt we actually have' three sources of uranium being sent out of this country. It is interesting how eager the government is to sell its own uranium stockpile. I note in the budget papers of 1992-93 that we still have our 2,262 short tonnes of uranium oxide and that the government was desperately trying to get rid of it. In 1992-93 the budget papers said: However, strategies are being developed to tate the sale of at least some, if not all, stockpile in 1992-93. 1 was interested to see what had happened this year and referred to the budget papers of this year where, 10 and behold, we still have our stockpile. But, we have progressed. Before we were developing a strategy. Now the budget papers state that a strategy has been devised. This is a big difference. The budget papers state: ... which will see a significant portion of the Commonwealth's stockpile being disposed of in 1993-94. 1 wait with interest to see the next budget papers to ·see how that strategy has developed. The government is desperately trying to get rid of the stockpile and it could be called Labor's third uranium mine because 1 think it is worth $2 112 billion. That might go considerably to reducing the rather enormous government budget deficit that we seem to be carrying. My disappointment is with the government's failure to really debate the whole issue. It should bring that out in the open and have a debate with all the concerned parties. This is a key issue and, in a way, it is being put under the carpet. The attitude of the government is: we are not looking at it; we are not bringing it out and saying that these are the reasons why we will not do it. The government has said, 'That's it. Let's not discuss it, because if we discuss it the inconsistencies of our policy will become obvious. So there it is. We are going to have our twomine policy, our three-mine policy with our stockpile, and we won't dare discuss it'. But there are genuine concerns out there in the community. By not discussing the issue, we are getting tremendously uninformed debate. We are getting people who are saying, 'I do not want anything to do with it because it is bad'. They are saying this without understandto seeing anything about the industry, without understanding anything about uranium and without understanding anything about radioactivity. On the other hand, we have the industry saying, 'Why are we stopped from selling our uranium? We have 30 per cent of the world's facilideposits. We have only 10 per cent of the of the world's markets'. By contrast, Canada has only 10 per cent - f the world's deposits but it has 30 per cent of the world's markets. So there is something terribly illogical going on there, ,and we need to open it up. Going back to my concerns about uninformed debate, that is not to say that these concerns are not genuine of the people that hold them. 1 think all of us, as the honourable member for Charlton said, have to worry about how we dispose of nuclear waste. It is a genuine question-not one to be ignoredthat we should look at out in the open, and it should not be sidelined. The honourable member for Charlton has also mentioned-I do not actually know about this-the nuclear weapons issue. 1 think there is no doubt that this is a fear to everybody in this country. 1 looked through my own files to see what I had on this issue and was somewhat horrified to see that, as recently as July, the French parliamentary committee called for the resumption of nuclear weapons testing on Mumroa Atoll in the South Pacific. 1 know that everybody in this House would join with me in expressing our absolute horror that that is still going ahead, or even being contemplated. At the same time, having expressed outrage at that, may 1 say that France is one of the biggest users of nuclear energy for its fuel source. Mr Lee interjecting",50
134,Mrs GALLUS,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"The honourable member for Dobell is making comments suggesting that I am taking a hypocritical stance. May I suggest that some of the stances taken by countries which are opposed to using uranium in their own countries can be questioned. I refer to countries which use the power coming out of the grid in France, but that is all right because those countries will buy power that is nuclear generated on other soil. So Australia is not the only country which seems to close off the whole debate and take some very inconsistent stands. Still on the nuclear weapons issue, we have enonnous concerns about North Korea. I was following that issue and found a sequential story about North Korea. At one stage it was pulling out of the nuclear pact. That was in March 1993. Several months later, in August 1993, it had opened up debate again-it was back in the pact-and a few days later it was out of it again. So these are some of the worrying things that people see in the newspapers and the reason why we should get this debate out in the open. The government should stop hiding behind this partial yes/no and come clean on the reasons why we should and should not export uranium. It should differentiate between what is really good in the industry and what is really bad, and state the direction in which we want to go. It should say clearly where we are going and why we want to get there. There is quite a lot more that I could say on the matter of nuclear weapons, but I think we are all well aware of that issue. Again, I that everybody in this House shares with me the concern about Iran possibly having an atomic bomb. They would also have a concern about Iraq, prior to the Gulf War, having the makings of a bomb. It is believed that Iraq would have had an atomic bomb within 12 months had that war not taken place. Of course, we are well aware of the situations in Israel, India and Pakistan. The honourable member for Chariton also referred to the fear of nuclear plants. He mentioned specifically Chernobyl, which was involved in obviously the most famous accident. It is events such as Chernobyl which raise enonnous fears in the population so that any mention of a nuclear fuel reactor is met with absolute horror-not only the NIMBY syndrome but a very wide NIMBY syndrome. Not only do people not want it in their own backyards but they do not want it in their country. That is very easy for Australians to say, as we have very good sources of energy in this country and do not have to rely on the nuclear fuel cycle as they do in other countries. There are fears, and we should look at them and see how genuine those fears need to be. Is there really a danger with all nuclear reactors? What is the situation in France? Are we contributing to those problems by selling uranium overseas, or are we taking on a role that we have absolutely no right to take? I would like to hear some comments from the government on that. In conclusion, the government's policy here is hypocritical in the extreme. We have the three mines policy which is actually a two mines policy. That will go back to a three mines policy if we gf<t the uranium stockpile in it. We have genuine debate on the whole issue being stifled by the government's fear of having its own hypocrisy. on this issue revealed and its own inconsistency on this issue revealed. I think it is about time we had a look at some of these issues. The government should come clean with exactly where it does stand on the issue of the digging up and the export of uranium in this country.",51
135,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I also want to speak on and support know the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Amendment Bill because it is a step in the right direction. Nuclear safeguards are something that I have been interested in for a very long time. Back in May 1983 I made my maiden speech in the old Parliament House and in part I said: As in the normal Address-in-Reply debate, I should like to take this opportunity to talk about the electorate of FlindersI was the member for Flinders at that time and I must say that I have been congratulated for keeping the present member away from the Australian public for 18 months back thenhowever, with this difference: I have risen to speak about conservation; conservation on a grand scale. I should like to describe the electorate of Flinders after it has been obliterated by a one-megaton atomic weapon-a small one. I went on to say that there were flash points already set up in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Korea and I said: We in Australia can playa unique and important part in bringing about peace. We are a nation which has a high standing with most nations on this planet. We are in a position to put forward ideas and proposals which I am positive will be acceptThis able to many people. I went on to suggest a ministry of peace, which I am sorry to see we still have not got. We have a ministry of war all right, but we do not have one of peace. However, an institute of peace studies was established and we had an ambassador for peace. So there were a lot of steps taken in the right direction. Australia has played a very important role in bringing about changes in the perceptions of many nations in relation to war within the world. Some honourable members may have seen a couple of television programs recently. One was 60 Minutes and the other was the Sunday program. Both of these programs were in relation to the disintegration of the USSR and the growth of the nuclear industry in Asia. I can assure honourable members that things are not as good as they appear to be in the world scene. The threats between the USA and the USSR have sort of. diminished. However, there are now new threats coming. I would like to mention a few of those new threats as I speak on this particular bill this evening. On the 60 Minutes program there was a story on the Kazak experiment. It went from 1949 to 1989 in an area called the Pentagon. Russia tested about 467 nuclear atmospheric explosions. There were half a million people in this area and they were all affected by radiation, which was about 20,000 times more than the radiation that fell on Hiroshima. Russian soldiers were deliberately exposed to radiation. Of course, many died within hours or - days of being exposed. In this area now, the number of incidences of extreme genetic diseases and miscarriages is a lot higher than is the norm for areas within Russia. The film also showed the horrific deformations of humans which were caused by these nuclear explosions. Thousands of young Russians are developing fatal diseases and cancer. This is going on right at this moment. There were some villagers who believed that they were deliberately exposed to these explosions. They were told by Russian soldiers to get out of their houses, and they believed they were used as human guineapigs. has all just come to light in the last few months. They were instructed to actually stand outside their houses. At the present time the suicide rate in this area is 10 times higher than elsewhere in Russia. This is an extreme disgrace. It is something that I am quite certain everyone should be made aware of. Eighteen million people live in this area. Various members of one family alone died through cancer, including the father, the mother, the sister, the mother's sister, the aunt, the uncle, the father's sister and the mother's brother. In the last scenes of this particular shot from 60 Minutes there were four-year-old kids dying from leukaemia. They had a five per cent chance of survival. In the West they would have had an 85 per cent chance of survival, but because there were no drugs they were dying. The last distressing scene was a shot of these obviously very distressed young children, and the final words were, 'These are the children of the bomb. They are all dying'. (Quorum formed) I pose the following question: Which continent? At least four of its most powerful states have nuclear weapons, five have suffered civil wars this century, each has warred with at least two of the others, except one which has warred with one other twice, each has a current territorial dispute with at least one other, and arms spending by most is growing faster than Gnp? No prizes. It's Asia. Let me speak about a few of the developments that are happening in Asia. South-East Asia is the fastest growing nuclear market in the world. Of the 53 reactors currently under construction worldwide 26 are being built in South-East Asia. The International Atomic Energy Agency and the major reactor construction companies such as Mitsubishi and Westinghouse have targeted South-East Asia as a growth region now that they are doing so badly in Europe and North America. A nuclear technology cooperation agreement between Indonesia and Australia is being considered at the present time. It has not yet been signed. At the moment the Indonesians are rewriting it. The agreement will be secret, tabled in neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate; and even after signing, the nuts and bolts of the agreement will remain secret. We do not know whether the agreement will include Australia providing expertise and training for the Indonesians and whether it will involve uranium sales. Some years ago, as a member of the board of the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research, I saw some interesting satellite photographs, taken over several weeks, of the weather patterns that affect Australia. Moist air from the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere mix over Indonesia. If there were a problem with a nuclear reactor in Indonesia-such as the Chernobyl disaster-a radioactive cloud would come down into the north-west of Western Australia. It would travel down through and across the Centre and maybe even hit the eastern states. It would wipe out the cattle industry and Australia's reputation as a clean exporter of food. We would be tarnished with the same brush as most of Europe has been since the spilling of radioactivity from Chernobyl. It is very important to look closely at whom we supply our uranium to. I do not like our supplying it to anyone but we do. However, we should make certain that the safeguards that are put in place are strictly adhered to. Who knows what is happening in France? It is threatening to recommence nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll. Who is to say that our uranium is not being used there? Mr MCGauranWhat are you doing about it?",52
136,Mr CHYNOWETH,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"J am speaking about it now. The Philippines has asked for a draft nuclear energy policy to be drawn up by the end of the year. So there are things happening in South-East Asia, close to us. Another thing that has not been spoken about too much is the fact that the United States Department of Energy has resumed its policy of taking back spent fuel rods from research reactors. ANSTO can now send back 800 of its 1,600 fuel rods. Will it do this? Who knows? Will it send them back by ship? Will they go through the Pacific islands where there is a ban on the transportation of nuclear in. material? It is an interesting question. The Indonesian government, as J mentioned before, will soon call for the construction of its first power plant. It is to be built at Mount Muria in central Java at a cost of around $2 billion. It will be a 600-megawatt plant and it will be the first in a program of up to 12 plants across Java and Bali early next century. So far, there has not been much comment on Indonesia's plaris. However, they could affect us. The nuclear plant in Indonesia will be built in an area with geological problems. The Indonesian archipelago is very prone to seismic activity-there are volcanos and lots of earthquakes-so there could be quite a few problems. What will create problems is not just the position of the nuclear power plant but the letting of contracts in some countries. Whether these contracts will be plagued by corruption and nepotism, who knows? We have often seen buildings that are substandard. Will this happen in the building of these nuclear power plants in Indonesia? There is a real problem for Australia with the building of these power plants so close to our country and with the mixing of the atmosphere in that area. In 1988 I travelled to the UK. One of the reasons I went there was to look at what it was doing with nuclear waste. I went to a nuclear power plant called Wyllfa in Wales. The power plant was then about 30 years old. I do not know whether it is still running, but I imagine it is. The people there did not know how to shut it down or what to do with it because the cost of dismantling and removing the power plant would have been in the billions of pounds at the time. I imagine that it is still going and that the engineers are still trying to work out what to do with it. There was a suggestion at the time-it was not a joke-that all they needed to do was shut it down, remove the rods, cover it with a pyramid of concrete and say, 'Keep out for 2,000 years'. It is ludicrous, but it is happening with power plants all over the world. No-one knows how to dismantle them and get rid of the radioactivity which permeates a large percentage of the buildings they are housed Honourable members will recall that about 14 years ago the Three Mile Island nuclear plant had a small problem. This year, 14 years later, the clean-up has been finished. It was a small spill of water. The water had to be evaporated leaving the radioactivity behind. Just imagine how long it will take to clean up Chernobyl. Other members and I will not be around to see it. I doubt whether my grandkids' grandkids will see the clean-up completed. On the Sunday program recently-I think it was the week before last-it was reported that four nuclear smugglers had been caught with 600 grams of radioactive material. The material was uranium 235. The Germans have formed a special team to investigate the increase in smuggling of radioactive material out of what remains of the USSR. There were four cases in 1990 and 160 in 1992. That is a huge increase. Just imagine what could happen if this material got into criminal or terrorist hands. We are not talking about the uranium we produce here at Nabarlek, Ranger or Olympic Dam at Roxby Downs. We are talking about plutonium and weapons grade material. It can be bought. This television program showed an army officer from the Russian military selling this material. It approximately $1 million per kilogram for weapons grade material. The material was independently analysed. It was not just taken to be that type of material. Independent government analysis found it to consist of 70 per cent uranium 238, 10 per cent uranium 235 and 20 per cent plutonium 239. It was weapons grade material. The people who were pretending to purchase this material were asked whether they wanted to buy an atomic warhead from an SS20 Russian missile. The Russians do not know how much nuclear material they have. They have not kept account of it and do not know where it is stored. This material is starting to get onto the black market. A small A-bomb can be made by a proper engineer, I suppose. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee), who is at the table, is an engineer. He could probably whip one up. This type of bomb has never been constructed by such people, for one reason: no-one could get hold of the uranium and plutonium to make up this weapons grade material. That was the factor that stopped the production and proliferation of nuclear weapons. However,' it is now available to people with enough money. Just imagine what would happen if some religious nut or terrorist group got hold of one of these bombs or built one. What would happen in Australia if some rogue group held Sydney or Melbourne to ransom with it? How would we react to having a major city held to ransom? What would we do? Can honourable members imagine the turmoil that would be caused? What the West should do right now is involve itself in assisting the Soviet Union with money and resources in an endeavour to make all its radioactive materials and weapons safe. It may cost us billions, but one threat or one action against a major city could create a catastrophe which would cost billions more.",54
137,Mr GIBSON,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to follow the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) on the nuclear non-proliferation bills. I think I should also make the point that I am not a supporter of the nuclear industry or our participation in costs uranium mining. Because I was not in this place when other decisions were taken, I did not get the opportunity to participate in the parliamentary debates on such things as our three mines policy, whether we should be selling uranium to France or whether we should be involved in the industry at all., I need to make it clear to the House that had I been a member of parliament at that time. I would have taken a very strong position in opposition to our involvement in the uranium industry. All of the points that my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley has just outlined are the reasons why I also have a grave concern about Australia's involvement in the industry. Therefore, my participation in this debate this evening is not an endorsement of our involvement. Although I am speaking in support of the two bills before the House, I make it clear that I have some considerable reservations about the effectiveness of the Australian Safeguards Office and the agreements that we have with a number of countries which are supposed to be able to track down our uranium once it leaves our shores. The honourable member for Dunkley has outlined a whole range of reasons why he believes-and I agree with him-that we should not be involved in the ,nuclear industry, why it is· still a very dangerous industry and why Australia needs to be very concerned about what happens to its uranium. The reason I have such a strong objection to the nuclear industry is that I am not yet convinced-I do not think anybody who is objective could state otherwise-that the nuclear industry is a safe industry. Incidents continue to occur. Although we have heard that the Three Mile Island incident was quite a number of years ago, a number of other incidents have occurred much closer to this point in time. Chernobyl is one example of that. Another reactor accident in another part of Russia just a few months ago indicates that problems are still occurring. The first reason that I object to Australia's involvement in the uranium and nuclear industry is that there are still real problems in the construction and operation of nuclear reactors and they are not a safe mechanism for production of electricity. The second issue relates to the safe disposal of waste. We have our own nuclear reactor here in Australia, small as it might be, located at Lucas Heights, but the fact that we are not yet able to find a safe way to dispose of the waste from that nuclear plant is another reason why we should not be involved. Until we can safely dispose of that waste in such a way that it will not have implications for future generations, I do not think we should be producing the waste in the first place. It is totally irresponsible us as a generation of people to be putting the responsibility for the health of future generations and other contamination risks that will occur on them by saying that hopefully somewhere down the track we will have some way of finding a safe way to dispose of nuclear waste. I find that a totally irresponsible attitude. The third issue is with regard to the actual location of reactors and whether they are built on stable land masses. The honourable member for Dunkley made the point about international concern as to where Indonesia will be placing its reactors. I think that is a very serious issue that Australia needs to be concerned about. Any accidents that may result from the new nuclear reactors being constructed or planned in Indonesia will very directly affect the living conditions, environment and health of Australians because there will be a clear movement of radioactive material across the Australian coastline. It is important for everybody to understand that the nuclear industry is still very much on a learning curve and that it still has a long way to go in solving some of those basic safety questions. I do not believe that Australia should be involved in such an industry. I accept the argument that being a participant in the international nuclear industry gives Australia an opportunity to influence policy, to make sure that safety issues are raised and to ensure that those careful standards are maintained or established in other countries. However, the record shows that we have not had that much of an influence and that our uranium is still going into places where we are not absolutely sure that safe standards are operating in the nuclear industry in the production' of nuclear power or in our capacity to keep track of where that Australian uranium is going. Tonight we are talking about the Australian Safeguards Office. The purpose of the bills is to provide for the costs of the work of the Australian Safeguards Office to be recovered from the companies which are involved in exporting uranium and to recover from producers of uranium or concentrates a certain amount of the costs of the operation of the of Australian Safeguards Office by imposing a charge on those producers. We need to understand the role of the Australian Safeguards Office and then I will talk of some of my concerns about its capacity to achieve its obligations. The role of the Australian Safeguards Office involves in three main functions. Firstly, it acts as Australia's state system of accounting for and control of our nuclear material. It is supposed to keep track of where nuclear material that we have mined or refined has gone once it has left our shores. Secondly, the ASO is responsible for contributing to the effective operation of Australia's bilateral safeguards agreements with a number of countries and accounting for Australian obligated nuclear material under those agreements. Thirdly, it contributes to the operation and development of international safeguards and the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and advises the government on these matters. That is one of the major arguments. that are used to justify our involvement in the industry. Through those first two roles of the office we are supposed to be able to track down what happens to our nuclear material and therefore know that it will not be used in bombs, placed in areas or utilised in ways that we object to or have disagreements to people or countries that we do not have agreements with. It is that part of the role about which I have considerable consignatories cerns. The reason I have concerns is that there is no easy chemical method of identifying uranium of Australian origin so that we can track it through every stage of the nuclear cycle and everywhere it goes. Our uranium particularly safeguards are dependent on Australia being able to keep track of it on a kilogram kilogram basis. In this way, the ASO tracks Pacific. uranium through the fuel cycle by checking what we send in and by checking that at the end of the process it is allocated to civil stockpiles. If, for example, a reprocessing plant ceives spent nuclear fuel comprising 50 per cent of Australian uranium, plus the estimated percentage ,of that which might have been changed into plutonium, Australia attempts to ensure that the same amount of uranium comes out the other end for re-use for civil purposes. In the same way, the percentage recovered plutonium of Australian uranium origin should go purely for civil purposes. On paper the above looks feasible, but there are major problems. Uranium, particularly during reprocessing, often goes through civil and military facilities which are not open to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The bilateral agreements. which Australia makes with a number of other countries, although generally more stringent than the International Atomic Energy Agency arrangements, also do not result in these facilities being open for the purposes Australian inspection. Only the outlines of bilateral agreements made between Australia and other countries are made public. The nuts and bolts workings of these agreements are not put before the Senate or the House of Representatives to analyse. (Quorum/ormed) As I was outlining before I was so rudely interrupted, the problem with these international agreements is that we are not made fuiIy aware of all of their contents. The process is not transparent whereby everybody can see how the agreements operate, how they are put in place and whether or not Australia takes full account of every piece of uranium with or go that is exported. For example, Australia has signed bilateral ASO's agreements with countries which are not to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. One example is France, which was not a signatory when Australia agreed to uranium sales to France in the early 1980s-a decision 'fuel which I strongly objected to and still do, since there haS been talk, although I am not sure of its current status, of France by recommencing nuclear testing in the South However, it is known that, in the final event, if a country is found to be abusing Australian uranium by diverting it into a military program, Australia has no policing remechanism-apart from withdrawing from the agreements-to make the country in question stop such activities. Nor does Australia have the power to insist on entering a country and inspecting its nuclear facilities if that country chooses to close the door on us. We may enter into an agreement with a of country and sell it uranium. That country could, after getting the uranium, then opt out of the agreement or make access to facilities . difficult. Therefore, the standards that Australia has set in signing those bilateral agreedual ments are very much based on a mutual fully agreement that the countries involved will actually honour those agreements. Australia has no way of ensuring that those countries will honour those agreements once the uranium leaves our shores. The International Atomic Energy Agency does not have the power to enter a country to make inspecof tions. If a country is found to be in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and fissile material obligations, the atomic energy agency has no power to act independently to stop the offenders. Such matters, as in the case of North Korea, have to be referred to the UN Security Council. Further, the atomic energy agency has control only over fissile materials, plutonium and highly enriched uranium; not over the machinery and technology used to make fissile materials. A non-binding nuclear suppliers club, of which Australia is a member, supposedly acts to restrict the spread and use of dual use civil and military nuclear technology. After the Iraqi debacle, few, if any, companies which supplied dual use technology to Iraq were called into question by their national governments. According to the atomic energy agency after its final inspection of Iraqi facilities in November 1990, Iraq was an exemplary member ·of the atomic energy agency non-proliferation treaty regime. The atomic energy agency only had the power to go into Iraq on search missions because it was given that power by a special UN resolution. If it had not been for what occurred with Iraq invading Kuwait, there would have been no way that the. international community could have found out or acted on Iraq's obvious program of building up towards the production of nuclear weapons. In fact, we should be pleased that Saddam Hussein decided to become territorially aggressive and invade Kuwait because, if he had not done that, we would not have had the chance to actually go in there and crack down on his technology developments to make a nuclear weapon. That highlights Australia's problem with the atomic energy agency and the operations of the Australian Safeguards Office-we really do not have a very comprehensive and total way of tracking every piece of uranium that leaves these shores. Also, there is the problem of the material unaccounted for, which is called MUF, which arises during reprocessing operations. At these times material fed into the process goes missing. Highly enriched uranium, depleted uranium and plutonium have all gone missing at a number of civil and military reprocessing facilities. Presumably, if Australian material is included in a batch which is missing at the end of the process, Australia will go on to claim that whatever is there is Australia's and some other country will have to stand the loss. It is not known whether this is the case, but that is what could happen. It could well be that Australian nuclear material has disappeared and been used by someone else to produce weapons. Although I support the work of the Australian Safeguards Office, I do not believe it is as comprehensive as the legislation makes it out to be. I do support, however, the process of the legislation in making the companies that are making profits from selling uranium cover some of the costs. I do not disagree with that principle in the legislation. That is why I am prepared to support the. legislation while Australia continues to sell uranium. But the bottom line is I do not believe Australia should be involved in selling uranium. I believe there are still a lot of problems around the world in the uranium and nuclear technology industries, and Australia is morally involved. The children of Chernobyl are suffering massively from cancer because of the nuclear reactor accident at Chemobyl. Children who live around nuclear reactors in England are recording five times the national average for lymphatic cancer. That clear statistic is a sign of what can happen because of nuclear energy and the production of nuclear power. That is why I do not like Australia being involved in this industry.",55
138,Mr LEE,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I will try to keep my comments reasonably brief. I begin by thanking .all honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Amendment Bill and the Nuclear Safeguards (Producers of Uranium Ore Concentrates) Charge Bill. I will not go back over the reasons why the government has proposed to introduce this form of cost recovery on uranium producers. I thought that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr GiLson), summed it up well when he argued that the companies which make a profit out of the uranium mining activities at Ranger and Olympic Dam should contribute towards the cost of running the Australian Safeguards Office. Why? If we did not have the Australian Safeguards Office ensuring that we have a proper non-proliferation regime in place, then many Australians would have great concerns about the export of uranium. That is the reason the government believes this action is warranted. If we did not have that climate of confidence, which is there because of the good work done by the Australian Safeguards Office, then many people would have concerns about the quantities of uranium which might be exported from Australia. I will comment on a few of the remarks which were made during the debate. I will begin with the remarks of the shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). I welcome his complimentary remarks about the government's policies. on electricity reform and minerals policy as a whole. I hope that he is consistent in repeating those remarks in future debates. I cannot claim to agree with all of his comments this afternoon. In particuthe lar, he claimed that the cost estimate of $340,000, which was mentioned in the second reading speech, was presented as a fait accompli to the companies, and that it was unfair to them. As my colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Me Robert Brown) pointed out, unfortunately the shadow minister misread the second reading speech because we made it clear that that was the indicative cost based on the 1992-93 program. There has been consultation with the two companies concerned. Last October the department and the ASO sat down with Western Mining and ERA and gave a detailed breakdown of what activities carried out by the ASO should be built into the formula. The government has had no complaints or criticisms back from the companies since it provided that detailed breakdown last October. The reason for that could be that that the breakdown of the regime last year. The amount the companies will pay this financial year will depend on the work the ASO does this year, which will be the subject of consulthe tat ion with the companies concerned. For the honourable member for Gippsland to simply argue, as he did in his speech, that this bill of $340,000 was presented to the companies as a fait accompli simply demonstrates that he did not understand the remarks that were made in the second reading speech. Mr Gibson interjecting",58
139,Mr LEE,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,That may be the case. I will be seeking to improve that this afternoon. I would like to clear up the claim that in the 1993 budget we made it clear that we would be selling the stockpile. At least the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) understood that this was not a new development of the 1993 budget. It was announced 12 months ago in the 1992 budget. The government made it pretty clear that the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has responsibility for disposing of that stockpile in a proper and coordinated way. It is not my intention-I am sure it would not be the intention of the Minister for Finance-to outline sale arrangements which have to remain commercial-in-confidence. I certainly have no intention of seeking to compromise return to the Australian taxpayer. Mr MCGauran interjecting,59
140,Mr LEE,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I am pretty disturbed that someone such as the honourable member for Gippsland, by the comments he has made this afternoon, would seek to undermine the return which the Australian taxpayer may get. If he is speaking to the Australian producers regularly he might ask them how they would feel about any activities which he may undertake and which could undermine the return they would receive for the sale of uranium this financial year. Most of the comments made by the honourable member for Gippsland relate to the threemine policy. It has been no secret for some years now that the government's policy permits the export of uranium from Nabarlek, which was mined a long time ago, Ranger and Roxby Downs. The government's policy was also precludes the establishment in Australia of other stages of the nuclear fuel cycle-a matter of major difference between the government and the opposition. Any change in policy would be a matter for consideration by the next ALP national conference which to be held in 1994. For those people who argue that this something which is irresponsible and wrong, I would suggest that they read very carefully the recommendations of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, the Fox inquiry-I understand that the recommendations were abundant adopted by Malcolm Fraser and the former Liberal-National Party government-which argued for sequential development of uranium mines in Australia. I know that the opposition has walked a long way away from every produce policy proposal that the Fraser government ever put forward. I suggest that the honourblack able member read that report carefully. The honourable member went on to argue that the Labor Party's policy had 'robbed Australia export dollars'. Mr MCGauran-Yes.",59
141,Mr LEE,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"That is the comment he made and he has reaffirmed it now. I remind him that in 1991 we exported 4,453 tonnes of uranium and in 1992 we exported 2,750 there tonnes. It is quite clear that there is a market out there now which is not demanding the quantities of uranium which we can supply today; in fact, the two existing mines could treble their output without any new mines being needed. So the claim by the honourable member that this has robbed Australia export dollars simply demonstrates that does not understand the market forces that in place at the moment. He should also understand that a number of other factors impact on the strength of demand for uranihave um, such as what will happen to weapons grade material in the former Soviet Union. Some people are arguing that that should be diluted; for example, it could end up in power generators in the US nuclear power industry. That would have a major impact on demand for Australian uranium. No-one knows what will happen. That will influence the prices that Australian producers might get in years to come. Basically there a major difference between the government and the opposition on the three-mine policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) argues that we should have at least two Mitterrand, uranium enrichment plants in South Australia is and the Northern Territory, and that by the end of the decade there should be nuclear is power plants operating in AustraliaMr MCGauran-He never said that.",60
142,Mr LEE,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"Read the Bulletin. He is on the record as having said that in 1991. As someone who represents a part of Victoria that has fossil fuel reserves, I find it hard to understand that the honourable member for Gippsland is a member of a party which is suggesting that we should be establishing . nuclear power plants in Australia that will electricity at much higher prices than plants that run on fossil fuels, such as the coal in my electorate or perhaps Latrobe Valley brown coal. We find it difficult to understand the opposition's view for supportof ing an expansion of the nuclear fuel cycle in Australia, from mining to nuclear power and, therefore, the large-scale storage of high-level nuclear waste, when the approval processes are such that, if they are not finished in 12 months, there is an automatic tick; therefore is no proper consultative process for all of the environmental issues to be examined. I compliment the honourable member for Charlton and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) for their comments. The honourable member for Charlton commented about the safeguards regime and the of honourable member for Dunkley made a he number of very telling points about his are concerns on the effect of radiation exposure caused by the nuclear tests in the former. will Soviet Union. Like him, I believe that we to be concerned about allegations that smugglers are moving nuclear material out of the former Soviet Union. That is another reason we have to ensure that the safeguards regime is sufficiently strong to prevent activities such as that taking place; In conclusion, the honourable member for Hindmarsh expressed her concerns about French nuclear testing. She might care to read the Labor Party's policy on uranium because is it addresses this very question. Many Australians have concerns about the nuclear testing activities undertaken by the French government. We are pleased that, under Mr France is currently not testing. We hope that continues, no matter what the colour of the French government in the future. The government's policy seeks to ensure that companies that get a benefit out of exporting uranium are seen to contribute to the establishment of a proper safeguards regime that ensures the industry can continue.

143,Unknown,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"Sitting suspended from 6.32 to 8.00 p.m. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 August, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the bill be now read a second time.",61
144,Ms DEAHM,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS," Mr Speaker, this House recently debated a bill to revise the agreement that exists between the Commonwealth and three state governments for the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. That agreement has developed from arrangements set in place as early as 1914 for regulating the supply of water to downstream parts of the basin. Since 1914 our understanding of catchment management has expanded exponentially. The last 10 years, particularly, have seen the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement evolving to reflect the range and complexity of issues arriving from a holistic approach to natural resource management in the basin. I think that agreement is a highly significant political and administrative achievement. I recall Bill Hayden speaking several years ago at an environmental law conference in Adelaide. He said that the principles of environmental law challenged the existing notions of private property rights because they deal with things that occur over large areas unrelated to property boundaries, or with things that flow from place to place. He could well have said that familiar political rights are similarly challenged by the demands of environmental management. 1993 The business of government has traditionally been about management of contrived divisions of the land-states, shires and cities bounded by lines, drawn with little or no reference to the natural features of the land or to the living systems in place there. Those contrived divisions have generated rivalries and disjunctions that place enormous obstacles in the way of sound environmental management. The Murray-Darling agreement shows that we are learning to transcend those traditional impediments. Although it has taken us a long time to see the damage we have done to the river system, we now have an effective tool for the enormous task of restoring it, where possible, and implementing sustainable practices for the use of its resources. I will take the next few minutes to explain why I, from the seat of Macquarie, will be watching the operations of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement with close interest. Over near the eastern edge of my electorate there is a road that crosses a high saddle on a ridge. I can stand on that road and see the land dropping away into the far distance on either side. Water that falls on the western side of the road runs down through the Fish and Macquarie rivers, flows on into the Murray-Darling and eventually enters the Great Australian Bight near Adelaide. Water falling on the eastern side of the road runs down through the sandstone valleys of the Blue Mountains National Park into the Hawkesbury and enters the Pacific Ocean at Broken Baynearly 1,500 kilometres around the coast from Adelaide. That place shows clearly what a watershed means. It shows, when the land is divided into catchments, that the Hawkesbury, in my electorate, is the next-door neighbour of the Murray-Darling. I am looking over into my neighbour's yard. I have seen that they have many of the same difficulties and problems that I have in mine. I am very interested to see how they will go about fixing their problems and what they will use to do it. The most obvious thing that the Hawkesbury has in common with the Murray-Darling is that the need for restoration and for sustainthe able future management has become critical. Unlike the Murray-Darling, however, the Hawkesbury has no history of overall catchment management systems or agreements. A trust for management of part of the Hawkesbury catchment is about to be established by the New South Wales government, and there are great expectations for what that body might achieve. A few minutes ago I was faxed the names of the members on that trust. I believe that past and future experiences from the Murray-Darling will be important for the Hawkesbury trust, and I hope to see that the lessons learned in one catchment are carried across into the other, whenever they are appropriate. The Murray-Darling system covers one-seventh of the land area of the continent, and the rivers are under stress because of the demands arising from the scale and diversity of land uses within such a huge area. The Hawkesbury catchment is much smaller, but the river is under extreme stress because it embraces the inexorably sprawling Sydney metropolitan area. My electorate covers some of the most vulnerable and worse affected sections of the river-the sections where it flows through the soft alluvial plain. Those are the places where settlement and development have been concentrated, and where the greatest demand occurs for future urban growth. Two hundred years of agricultural use have left the catchment generally denuded of its original native forest cover. Despite pronouncements by Governor Macquarie, the banks were cleared early and have suffered much abuse. The banks have also been weakened by many years of in-stream dredging and sand extraction that have altered forever the hydrological characteristics of the river. More recently, the demands of recreation users have led to further bank deterioration. Regrading and total clearing of the banks for the convenience of waterskiers have left them susceptible to damage from the wash of high speed motor boats. Because of the clearing and modification of the catchment, floods in the river are faster and more frequent than before. Each flood event now brings about the collapse of great lengths of river bank, and stream in many places is observed to be wider and shallower year by year. Landholders sometimes attempt to delay this process by dumping building rubble or old cars and buses on the banks, but all this eventually comes to rest in the stream bed. Anyone who has seen the pitiable state of the banks of the Hawkesbury River downstream of Windsor would surely agree with Bill Hayden's contention that certain 'rights' ought to be challenged. Activities such as extraction, bank regrading, clearing and high speed boating should not be allowed to continue in areas where they are so manifestly destructive. Degradation of wetlands is another factor that the Hawkesbury River shares with the Murray-Darling. Most of the original wetlands of the Hawkesbury were within my electorate, but much of the system's capacity for water purification has been lost as they have been drained, cleared and filled. Those wetlands that have survived are often under extreme threat as agricultural and market gardening activities are displaced by urban expansion from prime land into places that have previously been considered marginal for farming, and that therefore still contain remnants of the original natural environment. The great quantity of diffuse source urban run-off already entering the river requires extensive areas of created wetland for treatment and polishing. That requirement will be much greater if the proposed new urban growth occurs. It is imperative that wetlands in the Hawkesbury system be restored .and protected, and that land capable of supporting created wetlands be set aside to deal with future development. Ground water salinity is one of the major environmental issues in the' Murray-Darling. Many professionals concerned· with the Hawkesbury believe that, by the end of the century, salinity will be the most important issue there also. The Hawkesbury basin, despite its urban image, is the source'of a surprising amount of farm and market garden production. The Sydney market benefits from the large quantities of fresh vegetables and fruit that are grown close by, and the Windsor district is the state 'slargest supplier of rooms to domestic and overseas markets. The estuarine regions of the Hawkesbury River are important oyster farming and prawn harvesting areas, and also play a crucial part in: the life cycle of fish species that underpin offshore fisheries. All this production is threatened by increasing urbanisation in the catchment. Vegetables cannot be grown' on ground covered with hou'ses or saturated with salt; mushrooms cannot be grown withpolluted water; oysters cannot· be sold if they are full of E.coli; and fish, cannot breed in. water impenetrably clouded with mud. Preservation of agricultural land is becoming an increasingly important factor in the debate about future land use in the Sydney basin. Agricultural production is threatened by increasing salinity as well as by encroaching urbanisation. Algae-the famous blue-green algae-is perhaps the most spectacular manifestation of river degradation- The Murray-Darling achieved international notoriety with dramatic a-rial shots of 1,500 kilometres of water the colour of turf. The Hawkesbury had a much smaller bloom at the same time, but the effect on the regional consciousness was profound and confusing. ; The degree of confusion is illustrated by responses to the recent discovery that a small algal bloom in part of the Hawkesbury was toxic to humans. The local algal monitoring committee, set up following the report of the task force that examined the outbreak in the Darling, should have, published . warnings about the toxicity. For various internal reasons, it did not immediately, do so, and outrage erupted in the regional press over the committee's negligence in failing to properly warn the public. The outrage stimulated the committee to issue the necessary warnings, and a further outrage immediately erupted in the. local press because of the damage that was done to river based businesses by - alarrnist' reporting. This may be amusing, but it illustrates the complexities of environmental management in· a diverse catchment with many competing uses. An occurrence of algae is of the greatest significance to the Hawkesbury River as a symptom of environmental degradation mushthroughout the catchment area rather than as an event in itself.. Algae grows well in water that is rich in nutrients and flowing slowly, and - ere we come to the crux of the issue for the Hawkesbury-population growth in the Sydney basin. One-fifth of the Australian population now withdraws and diverts water from .the Hawkesbury for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes. Water that should flow in the Hawkesbury is flowing instead through long and expensive deep ocean outfalls off, the coast of Sydney. The rivet receives sewage effluent treated to various degrees of purity from nearly one million people. Sometimes, in summer, that effluentis nearly all the .flow there is in the river. Ifcurrent predictions come to pass, the Hawkesbury, by the end of the century, will be giving up its water to about one-quarter of the total Australian population; it will be receiving treated sewage from an extra one million people; and it will be expected to provide a range of recreational facilities and experiences for many of those people. The relationship between the water required by such a population, the rate at which people use water· in the future and the amount of water available in the system must be seriously addressed. The environmental consequences of withdrawing even more water from the Hawkesbury River must become determinants for planning the future of Sydney. I began speaking tonight about. the Murray-Darling agreement. I will now look briefly at the tools available for management of the Hawkesbury. In the past, that task has been left in the hands of a bewildering array of state agencies and local government bodies. More recently, the Sydney Water Board adopted elements of the total catchment management role through·its clean waterways program. It was able to do that because it could collect huge sums of money from a general environmental levy. Those efforts have now disintegrated. The water board is being dismembered .and the functions it so recently assumed are being given to agencies that are most unlikely to be funded for their new responsibilities. The notion of a catchment based environmental levy has been totally discredited by the state government, which has seized as dividends exactly the amounts raised by the water board levy. This has serious implications for the new Single River Authority which was to be funded in the future by such a levy. That. authority is itself somewhat suspect. Mysteriously, its area of responsibility does not include the Bowral-Goulburn growth corridor, which happens to comprise the state seats of the Premier and the planning minister. Nor does it cover the water impounded by Warragamba Dam at the headwaters of the Hawkesbury. Thus the authority will have no authority over the allocation or management of that water. Further, I discovered tonight that there is no representative of the Hawkesbury City Council on the new trust, and that is an absolute disgrace. The whole situation creates a potentially disastrous disjunction between the river's major regulatory and planning body and the river's major environmental burden. The Murray-Darling has a federal government overview because it crosses state boundaries: I believe that the issues relating to Hawkesbury are as important to the nation as those of the Murray-Darling. I believe that there is a legitimate federal role in the Hawkesbury, and I believe that there are arrangements in place for that role to be pursued. Essentially, the issue is about the future development of Sydney and New South Wales. There are two federal programs that can address this issue: the better cities program, which provides excellent guidance for urban renewal in Sydney, and the strategy for balanced state development, produced for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which sets the growth of Sydney in its proper context as an issue to be addressed as part of the future of the whole of New South Wales. The balanced state development strategy asks why Sydney continues to grow at the expense of the environment in the Hawkesbury basin, and at the expense of the economies and communities of rural New South Wales. It proposes a comprehensive strategy to answer that question and to find a better outcome. At the last New South Wales state ALP conference I received unanimous endorsement for a motion to carry forward the initiatives identified in the strategy for balanced state development. The delegates there clearly saw that it is now imperative to simultaneously take control of the cancerous growth of Sydney and the death by neglect of the rest of the state. The delegates saw that those two things are faces of the same tarnished coin. Significantly, the motion called for the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), as the minister responsible for the better cities program, to convene a Commonwealth-state joint working party to address issues such as the integration of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan planning; reasons for the continued concentration of new arrivals in Sydney; infrastructure policies that subsidise metropolitan housing growth; and regional employment strategies and appropriate relocation of industry from urban to country areas. I hope to see that happen. I hope that in my time as the member for Macquarie I will see for the Hawkesbury a concentration of effort the and a unity of purpose to match that expressed in the Murray-Darling agreement.",61
145,Mr SPEAKER,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"Order! Before I call the honourable member for Adelaide, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",64
146,Ms WORTH,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS," Mr Speaker, I am pleased to address the House for the first time. I congratulate you on your elevation to this important position. I note that in your address following your election you mentioned that you hoped the words 'fairness' and 'impartiality' would not be brought into question. You also mentioned letters from your constituents expressing concern about the process of parliament. In wishing you courage in your position as Speaker, I also bring the concerns of people in my own electorate of Adelaide about parliamentary process. During the election campaign there was a constant message that, while the community sees robust debate as a good thing, it feels that the games and point scoring trivialise people's concerns. More recently, during a visit to St Brigids Primary School, I asked what message I should take to Canberra. I was told, promptly and politely, to please ask everyone to be better behaved. Parliament will always be a place of conflict but, Mr Speaker, we can choose how we manage that conflict. I intend to argue with reason and passion but without malice. As a former health professional, I have gone from a position with one of the highest trust ratings to one with .one of the lowest. A recent ethics survey said that federal MPs rated 11 per cent on the trust scale, a fall of eight per cent in the last 10 years-and that was before the last federal election and budget. I look forward to the day when we will all enjoy a better reputation. Exactly 48 years ago today, in his address at the inauguration of the Liberal Party of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies said: In a few words, liberalism proposes to march down the middle of the road. While I am· a member of this House, that is what I propose to do so that I can represent all people in my electorate. Tonight, I can only touch on a few subjects in which I have a special interest. Dame Enid Lyons, the first woman elected to the House of Representatives in 1943, said that she was conscious of representing everyone in her electorate, adding: When women's issues came up I always spoke loudly on them. That is what I shall do. My predecessor, in his maiden speech, said that he was the 11 th member for Adelaide, and that, 'All the others were blokes, I am afraid'. I am pleased to have broken the drought-especially since the seat of Adelaide is named after a woman, Queen Adelaide, through the city that bears her name. It is appropriate that the seat of Adelaide will be represented by a woman when South Australia celebrates 100 years of suffrage for women next year. South Australia was the first state in Australia to give women the vote, and the first democracy in the world to allow women to sit in parliament. I wish to pay tribute to the men and women who fought for such reforms 100 years ago. Politicians, women's groups, journalists and individuals argued in fierce debates that took place both in and out of parliament about· a woman's place and role in society. Did women belong to the home or to the house? Those against female franchise believed that women were generally intellectually and physically inferior to men and that their true place was in the kitchen. They warned that giving women the vote would cause marriage and birth rates to drop and children would be neglected while women attended political meetings. Worse still, women would even want to sit in parliament. Those for female franchise said that women had proved themselves the intellectual equals of men and had to observe the law even though they had no part in its making. Women were also taxed as citizens but denied the basic democratic right of citizenship. Social justice required that women should have the same rights as men. One hundred years on, women have an important role in parliament but, looking around, there are still too few of us. I pay tribute to all those women who have been elected-for each time a woman sits in the House it makes it just a little easier for another woman to succeed. So many people have encouraged and helped me that it is impossible to acknowledge them all, but I would like to acknowledge the leadership shown by Jennifer Cashmore, who was elected to the state parliament more than 16 years ago and who, sadly, will leave it when Labor has the courage to call an election. She is a shining example for women to follow. Courageously, and almost alone at the beginning, she picked up the impending collapse of the State Bank As a widow, Queen Adelaide 'gave away the major part of her fortune including a gift in 1847 towards St Peter's Cathedral, which is now a p-omment and historic landmark in my electorate. The cathedral lends its name to the northern e-d of the Adelaide cricket ground, recognised as one of the most beautiful in the world, overlooking' the banks of the River Torrens. On the opposite bank is the Adelaide Festival Centre, home of the internationally renowned Festival of Arts and the flagship of a vibrant arts community. Nearby, North Terrace is lined with museums, art galleries and two acclaimed universities. East of the state's central retail area, Rundle Mall, is the street circuit ,for the Australian Formula One Grand Prix-another international event that has placed Adelaide firmly on the world tourist map. Along with world-class hospitality facilities, the electorate also contains the state's major public and private hospitals. Adelaide is a diverse and multieultu'ral city. Its people enjoy a quality of life unparalleled in other cities. Of course, Addaide is the living heart of South Australia. The state is rich in heritage and culture, with an economic base centred on mineral resources, manufacturing, agriculture and our famous automotive and wine industries. It is this living heart is threatened by Labor's budget. South Australia is reeling from a double dose of Labor over the past decade. The recession has compounded the hardship experienced in our rural areas .. Labor's mismanagement in the State Bank debacle has seen our state debt balloon to nearly $7.9 billion-that is, around $5,400 for every man, woman and child in South Australia. With so little optimism, through the recession and the State Bank disaster, the success of our wine industry was one shining light. But that success is now placed in jeopardy by the government's latest move to squeeze tpore revenue from an industry that has survived and prospered despite our economic misfortunes. Nowhere in the wine producing world is domestic consumption taxed to the extent that Australian wine is. taxed. Our rapidly growing competitors in. California are taxed at just 50c per litre. In France, our traditional competitor, the wine taxis 67c per litre. But, in Australia, sales tax plus the licence fee before the budget totalled $1.07. Now, after the 55 per cent sales tax increase, that goes up to $1.47 per litre. All this is being imposed by a government demanding world competitiveness from its industries and holding the wine industry up as a role model! But this is an issue for all industries, not just wine. I would warn· industries that if they can demonstrate sustainable international competitiveness, a significant contribution to regional economies and tourism, rapid export growth, world leading technology, value adding to 71/2 times farm gate value, a quality niche in a highly competitive international market, and emerge as Australia's most visible overseas product, then they are ready fofLabor's tax grab. This exposes the hypocrisy of this government. To those who say that this is not a tax on exports, I ask them to consider the following: this tax directly takes away the pre-tax profit the wine industry 'generates in the domestic marketplace. This prevents the industry from increasing historically low returns on investment to levels that will justify future investment in export development. This is an indirect tax on· exports. It is a tax that will that flow on and depress the business of tens of thousands of hotels, bottle shops and restaurants around Australia. It has been in my family that I have learned and affirmed my core values: to honour creativity and enterprise, to respect all people and to work for justice. It is in liberalism that I have found a political expression of those values. From time to time, commentators have written that there has been little difference between the major parties or that the Liberal Party needs new direction. We do not need a new direction, we just need to remember our direction. This budget helps; It is a budget that king-hits the old, the poor, the sick, those who want a better education and those who have lived by the rules. It makes the difference between Labor and Liberal clearly - vid.ent. Sir Robert Mel1zies, in his inauguration address, said the watchwords for liberalism would be: A fair deal and a good opportunity for everybody; no privilege, if by privilege we mean advantage, except for the industrious and skilful; A sound and appropriate education for every child, whatever the economic condition of its parents; Generous provision for every citizen against the chances and disasters of life; High pay for high endeavour. ... It is therefore t!J the preserving of the freedom of the citizen, his mind, his body, his spirit, that liberalism dedicates itself. Only from genuinely free, progressive, diligent and encouraged individuals can a really powerful nation be built. With today's unemployment rate at 10.7 per cent and nearly one million looking for work, there is not an Australian family that has not been touched in some way by this tragedy. One in eight children comes from a family with unemployed parents. On this subject, Menzies said: Employment: this is the greatest of our domestics problems. For every individual who thinks and talks about this problem the Depression has left an indelible mark upon the mind and conscience of this generation. The Depression was more than an economic incident. It has made a profound impression on the national conscience. Our first resolve must be and is that never, while we have a brain to plan with or two hands to fight or work with, must such a depression occur again. These principles are as relevant today as they were then. They should remain as the foundation for the policies we make in the 1990s as we struggle to meet the challenges of world competition. During the winter recess, a debate has been raging in my electorate among a large group who live by these principles. That debate centred on the issue of unrealised capital gains on shares being treated as income for pension purposes. Pensioners who own shares are feeling betrayed and retirement plans have been thrown into chaos. There is a ground swell of fear, uncertainty and insecurity among people who have prided themselves on their virtues of thrift, enterprise and independence. Renewed interest in the share market comes at a time when concern has been expressed about the low level of national savings. The FitzGerald report on national savings, released in June, highlighted the need for increased investment as a key to long-term economic growth and high living standards. At a time of debate about buying Australian goods and working together to build Australia, we actually have a scheme which reeks of actively discouraging investment in sound Australian companies. I am pleased to stand up for pensioners in my electorate and pleased to have presented eviden.ce on their behalf when the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs held its public inquiry in Adelaide recently. Hundreds turned out to protest, which moved me to comment that this was democracy in action: ordinary Australians coming out to let the government know what they thought. We must encourage those who are prepared and able to provide for themselves to do so. They should be rewarded, not punished. Mr Speaker, I have been fortunate in my life experiences, which now span my home and this House. In addition, I bring experience of the p'aid work force. I trained and worked as a nurse at Calvary Hospital in North Adelaide. Long before articles were written about women in management, the sisters of the Little Company of Mary were managing budgets and running hospitals. These women were having a profound influence on those they educated, worked with and cared for, and in so doing earned a high level of respect in the community. I have worked in a number of senior and management positions within the private health sector. My management experience with responsibility for more than 100 staff has involved me in negotiating with employees and unions for the best possible outcomes for both employees and employer. I know from practical experience the benefits of a happy work force where flexible working arrangements have meant greater productivity. Further, I have enjoyed the experiences of liaising with hundreds of medical practitioners, other health care professionals and, most importantly, thousands of patients. Many have discussed their concerns about our health system with me. My experience with a number of private hospitals such as Ashford, Calvary, Memorial and St Andrews-all in my electorate-has given me a clear understanding of their operations. Those hospitals are all owned and run by communities or churches as non-profit organisations. Their guiding principle is to provide a high standard of care. Many of those providing health care feel that the health policy debate has been hijacked by those who do not actually provide health care. It is perceived that the primary goal of current health policy is to control costs, rather than to ensure improvements in health care. Health care is not just about money; it is also about compassion and people. Improving health care along with education and accreditation must be high priorities in long-term planning. Overall, we should all be able to get the best value for the health dollar. A strong private sector must be able to work alongside the public sector in a complementary way. I note with interest and pleasure that already moves are under way to export health services and expertise direct from my electorate to Asia. The benefits from this will be measured not only in dollars but also in research. Despite pre-budget publicity, nowhere in the budget is there any incentive for people to take out private health insurance. Private health insurance contributes more to Australia's health care system than the Medicare levy, supports over seven million Australians, including 800,000 Australians aged over 65, and provides almost $500 million in revenue to the public hospitals each year. I often hear from pensioners and families who are severely financially disadvantaged, but they still take out private health insurance so that they have a choice of doctor and hospital when they require hospitalisation. Despite the recent increase in the Medicare levy, this budget contains the first signal that Medicare is being dismantled with rebates for optometry services to be scrapped. All this comes from a government which ran a campaign against the coalition at. the election saying that we would dismantle Medicare just because we promised incentives to those who took out private health insurance. Now it would seem that caucus is less enthusiastic about dismantling Medicare than the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and. the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I thank the many people who gave me the opportunity to serve in this place. I wish to pay tribute to my family-all four generations that I have known. Each generation has had its special influence on me. During the campaign, and without waiting for a result, one of my aunts wrote, 'Your grandmothers in heaven would be proud of you'. That gave me a fresh perspective in that, when they were born, women were not allowed to vote. I have been very fortunate to enjoy all the benefits of an extended family. My father, daughters, sister, niece and cousin are here with me today; others will be listening in. I thank and acknowledge all the encouragement, the influence, and the help that I have received, especially from my parents and my three children. I thank the hundreds of Liberals who have played a part in my political life-to those fellow Liberals with whom I have worked in a long political apprenticeship, to those who put their faith in me at preselection, and most of all to those who have worked tirelessly in my local campaign. The swing in Adelaide was 2.9 per cent. The telephone calls to my office during the past week from disillusioned ALP voters indicates that swing can be significantly increased. My most humble thanks are reserved for the thousands of electors in Adelaide who put their trust in me and my party. You have my admiration and my respect for resisting the campaign of misinformation. I believe that this budget vindicates your wise choice. To the electors of Adelaide, I assure you that I am in this place for all of you and, as long as I have a brain to plan with and hands to work with, I will do my utmost to make a change for the better in Adelaide. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",64
147,Mr ELLIOTT,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I commence my remarks by congratulating the honourable memb-r for Adelaide (Ms Worth) on her first speech in the parliament. I wish her all the very best during her time here. In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No.1) 199293 which is before the House tonight-there are a number of important issues that we need to talk about-I would just like to go back to the fundamental point that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) raised in the budget speech when he said: The primary focus of this budget is jobs: jobs in the short tenn by providing a further fiscal stimulus to the economy this year-to sustain Australia's economic growth until the motor of the world recovery kicks in. And jobs in the medium and longer tenn by boosting the capacity of Australian business to expand production on a worldcompetitive basis. We have a situation where our economy is growing. As has been said today in question time, the growth in our economy exceeds the growth in all but one of the economies of DEeD countries. There is every reason to believe that that growth can be sustained with a responsible mix of fiscal stimulus in the short term, together with a medium-term budget strategy. That is what this budget has been all about. Despite all that has been written, not enough has been said to explain the importance of that strategy over the time ahead. There are a number of lessons we learn from the very difficult recession that has been occurring both here and around the world. We need to recognise the importance of getting some fundamental ingredients right in the future. The first one of the ingredients that are clearly pivotal to continuing economic growth and, therefore, employment growth is to maintain a low inflationary setting. Today our inflation rate is the envy of most of our competitors. It is the lowest inflation rate in 30 years-inflation expectations the like of which we have not seen in our lifetime. We also have an interest rate regime which is low; it has remained low, and it will be sustained over the longer term. That, again, is helpful to our recovery, helpful to our competitive position, helpful to consumers in Australia, but it is particularly helpful to encourage business investment to pick up in Australia. We know many of the problems that have occurred around the world, that have impacted upon us relating to commodities, are symptomatic of the fact that the economy was too reliant on the commodity sector and on the ebbs and flows in prices that occurred in that sector. We need to have an economy that is transformed, that is made more competitive through industry development strategies, so that we have an export culture that develops and is enhanced. We should, as the MCKinsey study rightly identifies, look at the companies that are already successful exporters and try to build on that success. The appropriation bill that is before us tonight goes very much to that target. In particular, I want to refer to . a few of the measures relating to export enhancement-the one-stop shopping to encourage exporters. Many small businesses do have trouble, first of all in knowing the range of measures that are available to assist them, but secondly in knowing just how to develop the critical mass that is needed to achieve the optimum results as far as exports are concerned. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide, commented on the value of health services and on the opportunities that health service industries offer for exports. I am very pleased to say that in this budget the range of initiatives, particularly relating to the pharmaceutical industry factor f, has been strengthened. There is no doubt that the strength of those initiatives is being very much felt by a range of pharmaceutical firms and by the broader Australian community through the export orders that have been won across that sector. I have numerous examples of that sort of expansionary export culture being developed that emanates from firms in my electorate. I am very pleased to see those initiatives being given the impetus that this budget provides. The other range of industry measures relating to the market Australia campaign and those of a more general competitive arrangement relating to taxation for companies is again important for export and import replacement ingredients. But it is just as important in trying to encourage the re-ignition of private sector investment in Australia. The fact that we have already implemented the measures to reduce the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent is very much a part of that competitive reform process. If we look at what is happening in business today, as business profitability is being restored in this low inflationary setting, a couple of things can be said about that. First of all, many businesses have been through a process of trying to get their books back in order and trying to look at cost structures following the recession. Equally, we have had a situation where the way in which they market themselves had to change. We have had a situation where businesses in their relations with their financial institutions have undergone a fairly significant transformation and a period of some considerable stress. Those things are gradually being restored and quite rightly we can confidentially predict that the additional fiscal stimulus provided in this budget will ensure that the strength of the recovery that we have now with growth rates of just over 21h per cent can be very reasonably sustained into the future and accelerated throughout the financial year. We do this in a context that is built around the structure of the cooperative arrangements that we have had through the broad labour movement. We have had wage outcomes that have helped contribute to the various inflation results that we have achieved and they have helped contribute to the competitiveness of labour costs. All of those things, I think, reflect the fact that Australia is well placed produce a sustainable recovery that does produce jobs growth through this financial year. At the same time, in providing a stimulus this year the budget is affordable and can be managed. The deficit this year is projected at $16 billion. That represents 3.8 per cent of GDP. When we look at the deficits of other OECD countries and compare them to our GDP ratio it is evident they would give anything to try to achieve that result. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out in question time today that the United States has just initiated a deficit reduction strategy of trying to achieve three per cent of GDP by 1997. He said that that is three times the rate that we have already proposed in this budget, yet the United States thought it was doing rather well in getting down to that figure. The important point about this is that we do have a realistic strategy to achieve that GDP of one per cent that we outlined before the election. That is duly delivered in this budget along with the various election commitments. Added to that is the fact that the actual contribution that the· public sector borrowing requirement is making is still reaching only five per cent this financial year. Again, that compares favourably with all those other countries we would be seeking to adequately compare our economy with. The ingredients are there for growth. The strength of the recovery is flowing through all the time. This is evident because the government had the good sense to recognise the importance of the measures in the One Nation statement. The government had the good sense to recognise the need for further fiscal stimulus in last year's budget. It had the Investing in the Nation statement in February this year and it had further fiscal stimulus through this budget. All of those things produce the recovery that we need to get going in the shorter term. As the public sector demand on borrowing requirements is diminished over the medium term, we will get strong private sector growth. Much has been said about some of the individual elements of the budget. The government in this budget is delivering on over to 100 of the very substantial election commitments it made, which were directed at the people who have the greatest need in society. Those measures related to health, families and the unemployed. They were all directly targeted and were strong assistance measures in this budget. It is important that we recognise the need to maintain that social fabric through the budget which has been achieved throughout the 10 years of the Labor government. For as long as the opposition says that it wants to make this massive cut in outlays, I think vie are entitled to keep pointing to the strength of the social policy agenda that we have delivered. It is now very much part and parcel of the Australian way of life. The election was very much about trying to maintain those social service commitments that the government has seen as rightful priorities. Much has been said in this parliament about the question of taxation and comparing ourselves with some of the Asian countries. There are not too many honourable members in this House who would say that they want social policies delivered of the same type and scale as occur in much of Asia, which has inadequate health care and so on. Australians need to reflect on that. If we want to have comprehensive health care, age care, education and child-care services, we need to recognise the necessity of a tax regime that effectively meets those objectives. The impo(tant initiatives that have been taken in the labour market recognise the value of accepting the restructuring that has been occurring. One of these initiatives is accepting .the need to create more opportunities for people to return to the work force. All the studies that have been done highlight the fact that the more emphasis that is put on making that progression possible through a range of flexible labour market programs the more can be achieved. The range of measures in the labour market have been expanded in this budget. They have been well tuned to meet the needs particularly of. the longer term unemployed, who are a great concern to all of us. Clearly, it is important that the whole community recognises that getting unemployment down must remain the highest priority. I come now to some of the other important parts of the budget. I refer very briefly. to issues and initiatives relating to child is an area that has been talked about for some considerable time. This budget really does cement in place the important changes that recognise the fundamental issue of child care to families, particularly to women. The budget provides more funds to expand the places in child-care facilities and create flexibility in the way the funding for those places is delivered. It also recognises the increased value placed on those who care for children at home. The budget delivers on those key election commitments. The budget also delivers on the key commitments relating to the seniors health card, the extension of dental health services and the measures relating to the social security system through the family payment system. They are all important measures designed to provide more help to Australian families. They are fundamental to what Labor principles are all about. .That contrasts fundamentally with the opposition's proposed $10 billion worth of cuts in public expenditure at the last election. The opposition was fundamentally about savaging public sector services to the people of Australia. There is no doubt that $10 billion could not be cut out of outlays without really savagely millions and millions of fair dinkum, hurting Australian families. This budget recognises the importance of those key ingredients relating to the social security system-the continuing commitment to ensure the pensioner. arrangements are above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The opposition when in government never got close to it. The ratio kept falling further behind during the opposition's time in office. I tum now to the important initiatives in the budget relating to the needs of the older unemployed. One initiative is the recognition through the mature age allowance of the importance of those people to be given more direct and 'targeted help to ensure that their particular needs are fully met through a range of social security arrangements. I say with a great degree of confidence that when we produce a document on budget night that identifies and pays for 100 commitments that have been given in the election campaign we are entitled to say very clearly that we care. It have honoured the commitments we have given. The taxation measures are probably a good example of that success. We made clear that we would move to introduce the first stage of the tax cuts-a recognition that the cut in ,income tax rate for the middle income group from 38, per cent to 34 per cent was a priority, given the range of tax reform measures that had already been undertaken. It is important that this process of tax reduction be seen as a package. There have already been cuts at the bottom of the income scale and the top end of the income scale, but the targeted tax cuts are now directed towards those on average weekly earnings. It is an important and appropriate priority. There are measures that have caused considerable comment recently. I think the changes that were foreshadowed last night by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer only serve to strengthen the process contained in this budget. I certainly welcome and applaud the fact that the retrospectivity of the long service leave tax is no longer to be applied. Rather than the approach of the opposition, I would argue that the government has rightly listened to the concerns about that issue and has addressed it, has addressed the problems that people foresaw relating to optometry and has addressed the leaded petrol tax issue in a fair and reasonable way. That is to be welcomed and I support the measures wholeheartedly. There are measures in this budget that are important to individual electorates. In the few moments that are available to me I refer to· a couple of the things that are important to my area. In my first speech when I came into this House I referred to the problems caused by past inappropriate urban development in parts of my electorate and the urban flooding problems that occurred as a result. I am very pleased that the government has maintained a program over the last three years to do something about that problem in a sustainable way. This budget will ensure that the works under the western Sydney drainage initiative are carried through. They are important for the well-being of people in my electorate in making their homes free from flooding-and I certainly support them. I also support the important measures which deal with the quality of life in our cities, particularly under the better cities program. Some important projects have been approved, including the transit west scheme, which covers part of my electorate. That scheme is built around improving urban public transport initiatives, transport access for Parramatta transport opportunities for people who travel through the region. I warmly welcome the efforts made by the government to ensure that that scheme progresses as quickly as possible. I welcome the fact that there are important initiatives in the budget relating to industries that offer Australia tremendous opportunities to become the clever country in every respect. One of those industries obviously is tourism. There are important measures to sell the message about Australia's virtues as the place for tourists to come from all over the world. I congratulate the government, on the expansion of those measures. ' Some groups that do not always get the attention they should, such as those dealing with the arts-they are an important part of the cultural development of Australia-have been given some appropriate recognition in this budget. I congratulate the government. We have a strategy which recognises the important contributions of the community towards ensuring a sustainable recovery. It is a recovery that all Australians can participate in. This budget is providing the opportunity for economic and productive investment in the private sector and some fiscal stimulus to the economy. The importance of that cannot be understated. There is concern within Europe about the Japanese economy-and uncertainty about whether we will get reasonable outcomes to the trade talks and so on. All those things highlight the fact that our recovery has to be built on a partnership in which the government is providing firm direction through the fiscal measures it undertakes. It has to ensure that those fiscal measures are providing low interest rates and low inflation over the longer term. There has to· be a degree of certainty that those types of ingredients will be maintained. The budget strategy is fundamental. Opposition members continually say that they will oppose everything in the budget, which suggests that they do not want to have a fair dinkum and genuine contribution to the debate about the economy. They are not interested in getting the best outcome for Australia. They have not learnt anything from the result of the last election. They were and losers then and they want to keep being losers. They are going to keep the mentality that they had before the election. It has become a permanent state with them. As far as I am concerned, the revisions that have been made to the legislation will ensure that we have a real and sustainable recovery and strong economic growth in the long term. Australians can look forward confidently to jobs growth and economic recovery over the next two to three years. Mr SPEAKER""--Before I call the honourable member for Sturt, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.  speech is an opportunity to state a personal philosophical direction. That is what I intend to do. Many friends and family have travelled from Adelaide and Sydney to be here tonight, and I would like to acknowledge their presence. They worked tirelessly from my preselection to election day, and I am grateful for their support. The win on 13 March was as much theirs as it was mine and that of the Liberal Party of Australia. I have one disappointment; that is, my father, who died in 1988, cannot be here. I have been very fortunate to be the recipient of great affection from my very large and boisterous family. I would also like to acknowledge my predecessor, Ian Wilson. He served the parliament from 1966 to 1969 and from 1972 to 1993. He was the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment from 1981 to 1982 and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1982 to 1983. He achieved the extraordinary feat of winning Sturt back in 1972 in the face of a landslide to the ALP. He will be fondly remembered here by friends on both sides of the House. I am currently the youngest member of the House of Representatives, at 26. Being the youngest member, I am close to young people suffering under narrow federal government policies. Whether they be students, young entrepreneurs or willing workers, young people are being consigned to the scrap heap or pulling up stumps and heading overseas. According to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, up to 43,000 young people were denied places in universities in this country this year, while it is estimated that a further 100,000 failed to gain places in TAFE colleges. A generation of Australians is growing up with the very real spectre of long-term unemployment. Some 88,300 young people were characterised in the last ABS figures as being long-term unemployed. People at my age are making choices that will affect them for the rest of their lives. They are marrying, buying houses and establishing career paths. It is important that we consider these people in our deliberations. I hope that I will provide a voice for my contemporaries in this place. I am not a complete political novice. I served on the federal executive of the Liberal Party over two years and the state executive in South Australia for four years. I stood as a candidate in the 1989 South Australian state election against the then Premier John Bannon, in his seat of Ross Smith. At Adelaide University I was involved in. student politics, as a member of the union board, vice-president of the students association and president of the Liberal Club. Over three years I worked for my friend Senator Amanda Vanstone. My previous occupation as a solicitor has equipped me well for the job of a parliamentarian. This experience brought me into daily contact with the problems faced by both business and individuals struggling to survive in this recession. I was responsible for helping to establish new businesses and trying to save existing firms from bankruptcy. I also worked for large corporations in both the mining and manufacturing industries. A large part of my practice was in immigration law, working for companies as well as helping individuals deal with government. One of the problems my clients faced over the last few years was unimaginative government policy that has been inclined to ignore the needs of businesses and individuals. This budget is just another slug. It seems the government is unconcerned by the damage it does to free enterprise in this country. The sales tax hikes and the still significant petrol excise increases will directly affect the add-on costs to business. The wine industry, particularly important to my home state of South Australia, is being hit for six by the government. Overseas wine experts have observed in the past that our sales tax system has impeded exports. Despite this, the industry has shown impressive growth. The 55 per cent increase in sales tax on wine may destroy this as, according to the Winemakers Federation, we will have the most highly taxed wine industry in the world. This budget is uncaring and discriminatory. The indirect tax increases are still essentially inequitable. Despite all the twists and turns by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the grandstanding from the Australian Democrats, they still disproportionately affect lower income earners. The government has increased HECS payments by one per cent and accelerated their repayment. There is no relief for anyone in the budget. The budget does nothing to build confidence in the government's ability to put our economy on the right footing. It further erodes the standing of politics and politicians in the eyes of the electorate. Politics and the things that governments do affect all our lives. The contribution that politicians can make to society' is vastly underestimated and their worth is undervalued. The three most important aims of any government must surely be: to create an environment where equality of opportunity can truly exist; to alleviate hardship-whether that be violence, ill health and infirmity, loneliness, lack of education or job opportuniall ties, isolation and the financial troubles that hardship can bring; and to alleviate all forms of human poverty. The single most important means to achieve these goals is through a strong economy and full employment. Only through a strong economy can all citizens participate and realise their full potential. The greatest threat to these goals is economic collapse. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures on budget day showing that one in six people were looking for work at some time in the last 12 months. Five bankruptcies occur every day in South Australia. We have become too comfortable with mediocrity in Australia. We seem to accept as almost inevitable the existence of an underclass in this country. We have one class with varying levels of wealth and privilege, education and comfort, stability, longevity, family and continued prosperity, and we have an underclass of poverty, isolation-both physical and mental-ignorance, uncertainty, ill-health, despair and pessimism. Today between 450,000 and 500,000 children are living in poverty. Some 1.85 million Australians are living in relative poverty, according to the Henderson poverty line, and 1.1 million are in absolute poverty. The budget will widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. The Taxation Institute of Australia has calculated that, while the top 10 per cent of income earners will be better off, under the government's original proposals an average family on annual income of $25,000 will save only $115 on income tax while facing additional indirect tax imposts of $145. Still, this government likes to proclaim that it has a mortgage on social justice. Government must set the parameters. It must ensure that the players in our economy are free enough to expand and survive while at the same time protecting those incapable of protecting their own interests through lack of education, political might or economic strength. To we who are liberals there is a place for government in promoting economic growth and the recovery of this country; in protecting the weak from the strong; and in ensuring that citizens are treated fairly and equitably. That does not imply that the state will always be right or will always have the panacea for our country's ills. Indeed, a true liberal will expect government to limit itself, to encourage the freedom of its people and broaden the opportunities for choices to be made by each individual as free as possible from government intervention. Liberalism, unlike socialism and conservatism, rejects historical determinism. Liberalism asserts that by acting as individuals we can shape our society in a way that learns from the errors of history. Robert Kennedy once said: Neither fate, nor nature, nor the irresistible ties of history, but the work of our own hands, matched to reason and principle, will determine our destiny. In the 1983 Alfred Deakin lecture, the hon said: Liberalism, a faith in man's ability, reason and judgement is our best and our only hope in the world today. The philosophy of liberalism, summed up in those statements, can be the engine that will drive Australia to greater prosperity and stability. My own state of South Australia is in need of such an engine. It is in need of a radical cultural change in thinking. South Australia faces severe economic problems. Last year's Arthur D. Little report summed it up by saying: South Australia's economy is poorly structured and vulnerable. Industry today is structured for yesterday's conditions. Adapting to today's tions will be challenging. Unless the challenge is met, standards of living will continue to decline. The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies has found that if the challenges are not met up to 130,000 jobs could be lost between now and the year 2000. The Arnold government's own Economic Development Authority has warned that South Australia will face a 17 per cent unemployment rate by the end of the decade if its policies are not reversed. But we can rebuild. Adelaide is the centre of the wine industry in Australia. The Winemakers Federation is based in Sturt and the famous Grange Hermitage was first made at the Magill vineyard in Sturt. Our three universities, the Australian Submarine Corporation, the multifunction polis and defence and related science and technology industries can be the focus for future development of industry. Tourism is finding its feet in events such as the Formula 1 Grand Prix, arts festivals, Kangaroo Island and the wineries. Adelaide has the potential to be at the forefront of technological change. If we develop an export culture similar to that already achieved in the wine industry and is not sabotaged by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), our automotive component and have electronics industries as well as precision engineering, food processing, medical and aide scientific instrumentation, health and educainternational tion could all be growth areas for the South Australian economy. By using our intellectual ability we can rebuild South Australia and Australia. Comaides, panies such as the Australian Submarine Corporation are developing technology that is capable of export. The ASC is worth $4,600 million for South Australia, but in the long term it could provide much more. The ASC is not just about submarines. It is short-listed to build a fleet of minehunters for the RAN and is negotiating with the Philippines govview ernment to build three patrol boats. The ASC is looking for submarine work in Korea, Canada and Taiwan. This expansion in the technological field is vital for Australia. Our high level of educational proficiency and skills makes intellectual property and technolcondi- ogy a natural growth export. industry. My late father, Remington, an eye surgeon, helped establish the Australian Cranio-Facial Unit with its leader; David David. Since then the unit has performed nearly 4,000 operations to correct massive abnormalities of birth or injury through bums and disease. The unit is renowned throughout the world. It is an example of health as an industry capable of export and able to generate employment and investment. The unit contributes to research in the clinical aspects of cranio-facial surgery, in applied research in biomedical computing and imaging as well as speech dynamics. The unit's research group has evolved a safer design for motorcycle helmets. All the component parts of health and that which goes into developing a project such as the cranio-facial unit are saleable commodities overseas. Governments around the world will invest huge amounts of money to become proficient and set up similar projects-investment that all ends up back in Australia. Similarly, education is an industry that we can tap into' both in South Australia and Australia. Adelaide, with its three universiit ties-one of which now has a campus in Malaysia-and the multifunction polis can a real role in education exports. Two of the three international high schools in Adelare situated in Sturt, offering students the baccalaureate and drawing fee paying students from Asia. Education is not just about teaching and learning; it is about learning devices, curricula, textbooks, teacher specialised equipment and technology. It is from these things that huge export income can be gained, especially in Asia. When a Brown Liberal government is elected at the coming state election I believe South Australia will overcome its collective defeatist attitude. A marketing company has placed in my electorate a billboard of a rear of a nude with the caption, 'Get off your butt, South Australia'. When new policies and new incentives are in place, we will be able to look again at some of the industries I have mentioned to get my state moving again. I was fortunate to be chosen by the Liberal Party as its candidate for Sturt. The Liberal Party is not just the anti-Labor party. Sir Robert Me.nzies was a great Australian as well as a man. with great affection for the British parliamentary system we inherited. It is interesting that in 1944 someone immersed in all things British did not follow the example of their main anti-Labor forces and call his new party the Conservative Party. He called it the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party was started as a body of people who believed in progress, of people who looked to the future and wanted to keep Australia going inexorably forwards. Through the 1950s and 1960s it brought an era of prosperity unequalled in Australia's history. The Liberal Party stayed in government because it was seen as the party of ordinary Australians. The party was seen as one that cared, believing in both the individual's to work hard and gain the fruits of that labour, as well as remembering those in society who were finding the going tough and helping them through. The party had a social agenda. One of our errors in the last few years has been that we have talked too much about economics and not enough about society. We have been a party too concerned with accountancy and more concerned with balancing the bottom line than thinking of the sort of society we want this country to be. When we look at our records and traditions, we see a proud history. Our party introduced old age and single parent pensions, maternity leave and, in South Australia, established the housing trust, to name just a few examples. The reason for their introduction was simple: Liberals felt that it was part of the role of government to actively intervene to make Australians' quality of life better. They did not just implement a framework for society to do so by evolution. It is people who count because they make up Australian society and give it its character. The Liberal to give Australians a more tolerant and egalitarian society, with opportunities for all to live their lives with dignity. I joined the Liberal Party because I believe that it represents the sort of Australia. I hope we can be-individualistic, detennined, self reliant, compassionate and progressive. We have markedly differing views on both sides of the House on how we can get Australia moving again. However, I like to think we can be certain of one thing: we have all come here because we have a ge-1Uine desire to see good don-. Honourable members-Hear, hearl",68
148,Mr FITZGIBBON,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I am not a mean and nasty individual but sometimes I come here to speak and, if I am not as thoroughly prepared as I would like, I often gain five or 10 minutes by criticising what was said by the opposition member who spoke previous to me.

149,Mr FILING,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,What do your winegrowers say?,76
150,Mr FITZGIBBON,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"If opposition members want to talk about wine, why do they not stay for a while? They might hear a few truths about wine. Going back a few years, to when I was 26 years of age, I was an idealist. I had a burning desire to set this world right. But I am having problems these days. I am trying to find out how one remains an idealist and gives people everything they want and yet manages to reduce a budget deficit from $16 billion. I am just having a wee bit of a problem working that out. We just heard a very moving speech about what a great party the Liberal Party of Australia is and how the poor old Australian Labor Party does not care on health matters. Opposition members should ask the people of Australi;l which party traditionally cares for the health of the people of Australia. The Party exists answer is Labor. We heard pontification about child poverty. We could talk for several days about that. The Liberal Party claims that it cares for kids'We're prepared to pay them $3 an hour. We're prepared to pay them that gigantic sum of money and let them continue to live in poverty, but at least we can say they're not unemployed; they're out there with a job'. The other day the House heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) distinguish on educational matters between the achievements in government of the Labo.r Party and of those opposite. (Quorum/ormed) The 1993 federal budget was most interesting. As is the norm with budgets, it was received differently by different people. Budgets do not always please-they are not intended to please. But this year's budget was a key document designed to ensure our nation's economic health into the 21st century. There were tough decisions but the budget discloses a plausible strategy to reduce the country's deficit and maximise the benefits for Australia when the world economy picks up. Low inflation and low interest rates will be maintained to provide a suitable environment for business and job growth. In order to stimulate economic growth tough decisions have to be made. But the tough decisions were certainly not evidence of hitting the poor. All consumers will pay more because the wholesale sales tax on some items will increase by lc this year and lc next year. But there will be no tax increases on food, clothing, milk, gas, water, electricity, newspapers, books, paint or public transport. The Labor budget is far more friendly than the opposition's plan to impose a 15 per cent GST on everything. What was the opposition's reply to our budget delivered this year? The reply was hopeless. The budget reply was totally devoid of economic analysis. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) offered no alternative scheme to raise revenue to reduce the deficit. Sensational news is more attractive than truth and the stock-in-trade of media people is criticism. However, while most media people gave a sour reception to this year's budget, the most frequent comment I heard from people in my electorate the day following the delivery of the budget was, 'It is a better than we expected'. Framing a budget in difficult economic times is no easy matter. Any politician can get a bit of cheap publicity by ignoring the good elements of a package and rubbishing the tough decisions. Sensible people realise, however, that there must be a few nasty elements in any budget in order to have the final figures add up. There has never been a budget which pleased everyone, but this year's budget certainly pleased the business world, with the stock market continuing to soar to impressive heights. It would be sheer political opportunism and bloody-mindedness for a hostile Senate to misuse its powers and reject the tough items in the government's package, particularly now that the government has modified the budget to satisfy· popular demands. The budget, and the tax changes in it, should not be seen in isolation but in terms of what the government has been doing over the years by improving equity not only in the tax system but in the social security system as well. People on lower incomes have been the chief beneficiaries of the massive expansion of the additional family payments system which has increased by more than 75 per cent. Pensions have increased by 14 per cent in real terms at the same time, and pensioners can now live with considerable dignity due to their financial independence. Families, despite the recession, have benefited from programs which give special financial assistance to those in most need. There is ample evidence in the 1993 budget of the Labor government's keen sense of fairness. I was not completely happy about the increase in the price of leaded petrol when it was first announced. But I must say that, although I am pleased with the changes and modifications that have been made, a lot of nonsense has been written about the increase. It has been said that poor Australians will be hit more heavily· than others because they tend to drive aging cars which generally use leaded petrol. That is true, but if a low income person-such as a pensioner-were to drive a car an average of 15,000 kilometres per year, the total cost of the increase in the lot first year would be $53. Against that, the low income earner-the person on less than $23,200-would have received a tax rebate of $100. Now those people will get $150. Even with increases in leaded petrol prices over the next three years, if the tax rebate were used entirely for paying the additional petrol bill the owner of an old car would remain marginaIlyahead. Yesterday the rebate for low income earners was increased. Who is to say that in next year's budget there will not be a further increase in the rebate? My information is that the $150 rebate will be additional to the pensioner rebate for all those pensioners who still pay tax. I am glad that the government has modified the budget to make it fairer for the battlers as far as petrol is concerned, but we should sit down and think about some· of the other factors which caused the cabinet to make a decision which might have seemed somewhat unfair. In the mid-1980s the government made a decision that in future no cars which used leaded petrol would be sold in this country. I notice that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition .(Dr Wooldridge) is in the House. As a doctor, he would appreciate the fact that in Australia at present probably 300,000 children are receiving medical treatment as a result of being contaminated by the fumes from leaded petrol. In the Western world, all but two countries have a petrol price differential. What really made me laugh was the claim by an opposition member that the price differential between leaded and unleaded petrol would cause the price of cars which still use leaded petrol to drop by $2,000. That is a load of rubbish. If anyone opposite has a car which uses leaded petrol, bring it to me now, we will get an independent assessment of its value and I will pay a pre-budget price for it. I guarantee those opposite that that will not drop $2,000 in price. I fought hard to prevent the increase in the wholesale sales tax on wine. I guess I and the others who fought alongside me had a partial success because the wine industry was saved from what it feared most-an excise on wine. I could talk all night about this because it is rather complex, but that excise did not come about. Instead, there was an increase of one per cent in the wholesale· sales tax rate and then 10 per cent, which takes it up to 31 per cent. I do not worry too much about that. I know that it will cause some problems for my vignerons, but I have great confidence in Australia's wine producers. I believe our wine will remain competitive on world markets and our wine industry will continue to thrive. Local wine producers in my electorate depend on the number of tourists we can attract to our vaHey. I am quite confident that the advance in tourism that the Hunter VaHey will receive will more than provide a satisfactory compensation for the increase in wine tax. I feel some sympathy for the boutique and family businesses that are slowly being squeezed out of existence by the big wine producers, but we must realise one important thing about the price of wine. I know that there are people in this House who have a deep interest in wine, and people will say that we may not quibble about the price of wine because we earn a fairly decent salary. But the increase in the wholesale sales tax on a bottle of wine valued at $10 retail would amount to only about 53c. If a person goes to the ceIlar door and asks, ' Mr Vigneron, how much is that bottle of wine?', he or she will be told, 'That bottle of wine is $10'. That person may then walk to the nearest bottle shop in town and ask, 'How much is that bottle of wine?' and be told, 'It is $8.50'. Yet when that person goes to Pokolbin or to one of the better class hotels in Sydney and sits down at a table, the bottle of wine for which he or she paid $8.50 at the bottle shop is $24 or $26. The pricing of wine is an absolute joke in this country. I like my vignerons, they are great blokes and I help them whenever I can. They contincar ually emphasise the fact that we need a domestic market in order to do weH in exports, and I accept that. But they say, 'Look, just when the export market in wine is booming and really doing well, along comes this dreadful Labor Party and imposes a wholesale sales tax and kneecaps it; destroys the Australian wine export industry'. People in the community still do not realise it, and maybe some at the table do not realise it, but there is no tax paid on wine that is exported-not one cent. So let us get rid of this nonsense that the extra tax on wine is going to destroy our wine exports. Cabinet has to make a fair decision. I received a letter today-I am sure the cabinet would have been aware of this-from the Fitzgibbon). Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia. It really goes to town about the preferential treatment which wine receives in relation to spirits and alcohol. Go and have a yarn with the local publican. He is not too sympathetic about the increased charge on wine because it only brings a little parity into the business. I have many things to talk about and I running out of time because of the silliness the opposition in calling quorums. But I think try. it is only fair to mention that optometry has been fixed up-no worries there. We have fixed up the long service leave worries-no problems there. But I want to say a few things about the tax which was supposed to be so dreadfully unfair on those people who had accumulated holiday leave or long service leave. I felt sorry for those people and I am glad the decision was changed. I just cannot imagine anyone in my electorate who did not want to slit my throat-every policeman, every teacher, every member of the defence force-as a result of our decision to make the changed taxation arrangements for superannuation retrospective. I was teaching, but I was also mayor at time, and I often had to take· time off from my teaching position for mayoral duties. took long service leave, and that was taxed the marginal rate. I know a woman who was working in a position where she paid SlJperanof nuation. Her mother was ill, and. that woman took three months off to care for her dying mother. She paid tax on her long service leave at the marginal rate. When we talk about fairness, I think everyone recognises that it is not fair that people who preserve their long service leave should be taxed at the marginal rate. Everyone was worried about retrospectivity, but that has now been wiped and we have made ourselves popular again. I know that all Australians are universally loud in their praise of this governa ment which has brought down a very fair budget. (1ime expired)",76
151,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"I enjoyed listening to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr I enjoyed listening to him talking about lead levels in children and about wine. The fact is that, while 200,000 kids may have lead related illnesses, this government gives only a lousy $100,000 to research into lead in children-and that has got to be gUilt money. Having used as an example the way other countries use the differential between leaded and unleaded fuel, the honourable member am then talked about wine. In Australia we now of have the highest taxes on wine of any counThis is a cheap, nasty and regressive budget. It is a leaderless budget, and it is a budget of betrayal. Two weeks ago the Treasurer (Me Dawkins) stood on the other side of the House and delivered the budget, and he claimed it was a budget about jobs. We were told that it was a non-negotiable document. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer steadfastly proclaimed for a few days that there would be no deals-not with the Senate, not with the unions, not with industry, not with community groups, not with the churches, not with anyone-no way. The Treasurer categorically stated that there will be no overall change to the budget or to the the government's debt reduction strategy. Then he went on to say, 'It is a package you I just can't lop'. But, once the impact of the at totally regressive nature of that document was felt, there was almost universal condemnation it. We have only to look at the business, industry, trade union and community groups that have called the budget a sham to see that finally the illusion of this government as a caring and responsible government has been shattered. Let me list some of the groups that have spoken out and condemned this budget. The first and most important group is the Australian people. Seventy-two per cent of Australian people believe that they will be worse off because of this budget and, more importantly, majority believe that Australia will be worse off. According to a survey conducted by Arthur Andersen, more than three-quarters of small to medium sized businesses also rejected the budget. The Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and. Industry, Ian Spicer, has said that business remains sceptical of the government's economic strategy, and that it was hard to see how a net increase in wholesale taxes and fuel taxes could in any way contribute to a recovery; they were more likely to increase inflation. The Chamber of Manufactures in New South Wales endorsed Ian Spicer's remarks and agreed that, rather than putting forward a strategy to encourage employment as. the Treasurer claimed, there would in fact be 52,000 fewer jobs created by the year 2000. Rick Farley of the National Farmers Federation claimed that regional Australia would pay $108 million extra fuel tax as a result of the levy on leaded fuel, and that farm families, already struggling, would pay $20 million. (Quorum formed) I note that in the New Zealand parliament the government has to maintairt a quorum at all times. That is something that we might promote here, and we.will very much enjoy seeing how the government's backbenchers like spending half their time sitting in their seats. We also had the unofficial arin of the government-the ACTU-talking about this budget. One of my constituents, Mr Martin Ferguson, said he could not defend the indefensible. Mr Michael Easson, the Secretary of the New South Wales Labour Council, could not find anything but a 'subdued response', and in writing in the Canberra Times he said, 'What about the promise of no new taxes?'. It would appear to some that the government is acting with an arrogant disregard for its own electoral commitments. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.

He was in fact interjecting.  Deputy Speaker. You were calling the honourable member for Watson for interjecting, when quite clearly the honourable member for Kooyong started that exchange. You have not drawn his attention to the rules of the House. I gather you will do a better job shortly, will you? . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-The parliamentary secretary went very close to reflecting on the chair. The chair's ruling was entirely in order. It is quiteimproper for any honourable member to interject when he is out of his seat. The honourable member for Kooyong was distinctly in his seat and the honourable member for Watson was not. I do not appreciate the implication made by the parliamentary secretary.  Deputy Speaker: the honourable member for Kooyong was quite clearly interjecting",80

156,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS,"-,-The proudest moment in my life was when I stood up in this parliament to make my first speech. For six years I have watched government members making a mockery of parliamentary democracy, and we are going to make them wear it around their necks day after day after day. I was talking about this budget. We have here a government consumed with creating, maintaining and projecting an image of itself and an image of an egalitarian, pro-active and socially responsible budget. But it is all artificial. It is all part of a carefully created illusion. The reality is that we have a motley collection of individuals forming a collective government led by a man who is more intent on becoming 'II Presidente' and enjoying the trappings of office than accepting the responsibilities of office. He is more interested in flipping through leaflets about executive jets, lUxury carports or teak dining tables than in the plight of ordinary Australians. In fact, to be absolutely accurate, we are not certain that the bills presented to the House today by the Treasurer, which we are supposed to be debating, are in fact the bills we will be voting on. Because of that, I intend to move an amendment to this bill. (Quorum formed) These measures are a continuation of the farce and duplicity. They are not in any sense a strategy for economic rehabilitation, nor do they contain any genuine social responsibility. The one constant factor in whatever version of this budget we end up with is that it provides not one shred of hope for the 940,000 Australians .unemployed and the further 750,000 underemployed. Because the end document that we are debating may bear no relation to the bill that has been introduced, I move the following amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes: (l) the likelihood of foreshadowed amendments to the Budget; (2) the vacillations and confusion about the Budget; (3) the pernicious impact on low income Australians; (4) the failure to reduce unemployment; and (5) the continuing abrogation of responsibilities towards the long--rm unemployed"". This government's betr-yal of our unemployed and hard working Australians is a national disgrace. The Treasurer said that the primary objective of this budget is jobs. Of course, that is simply part of the theatrical rhetoric, because the government's own budget documents tell it that unemployment in 12 months time will still be 10.75 per cent. The government admitted this even in its own documents. We have to lOOk hard, we have to dig right down, to find the Treasury-speak, but it is buried there in budget document No. 2 where it says: While some reduction in the unemployment rate is expected by mid 1994, progress on reducing unemployment fundamentally depends on achieving faster rates of economic growth. Basically, those opposite do not have a clue and they are waiting for the rest of the world. in his election speech in March this yearjust six months ago-the Prime Minister stated: ... unemployment is the greatest problem we face. It is the problem of the era. He went on to ask the question: what is the strategy for the 1990s? He gave the following response: Over the next three years Labor will place the emphasis where it has to be-on business and on incentives to invest. More sleight of hand, more empty rhetoric. There is not a single job in the budget. At the National Press Club on 9 February this year the Prime Minister gave us another example of this when he said: We have decided that the simplest and most effective way to encourage Australian companies to work for Australia is to lower their tax burden. Whacko! If people reckon that increased taxes and increased petrol costs are the way to prosperity, this is the budget for them.

162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seconded? ' Mrs Gallus-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.  point of order. In the events leading up to the division the honourable member for MCEwen, in drawing the state of the House to your attention, was quite clearly interjected upon from the gallery facing you. It was quite clear and it was quite loud. My first question to you is: did you hear it?

163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I was unaware of any interjection from the gallery, which is scarcely surprising given the hubbub in the House. I have no intention of making any comment to the gallery at this stage but, of course, should any interjection from the gallery be repeated, i would instantly draw the attention of people in the gallery to the simple truth that they are obliged to sit in silence and it is a privilege for them to be in the gallery.",83
164,Mr BEVIS,PAIRS,"In addressing the appropriation bills and the amendment before the House this evening, I want to make some introductory remarks about the context in which this budget has been delivered and the economic situation confronting Australia domestically and internationally. This budget has been framed not just with the current financial year in mind, but with a view to the next three financial years. In that context, it is an economically responsible budget designed to ensure that the fiscal management of the nation is maintained in a manner which will increase employment, assist in the development of wealth, ensure that inflation and the consequent interest remain low, and ensure that the benefits of that wealth creation are fairly distributed amongst the people of Australia. The budget proposes a deficit in this financial year of approximately $16 billion, which represents 3.8 per cent of the gross domestic product. That is roughly the same as the previous financial year, 1992-93, when the figure was 3.6 per cent. A $16 billion deficit is a significant amount of money, but it needs to be seen in the context of previous budgets in Australia and also in the international context. It is important to acknowledge that the federal Labor government, during its period in office, has returned four surplus budgets. That is no mean feat. In fact, as I have pointed out on a number of occasions in this place, the only surplus budgets that have been returned by the Commonwealth of Australia have been those four budgets under the Labor government when Paul Keating was Treasurer. ' It is a fact of history that the Liberal Party, throughout its entire period in office, did not once-not on a single occasion-return a budget with a surplus. Of course, it had the luxury of governing in Australia during those boom years of the 1950s and 1960s; in that postwar boom where the entire Western world was experiencing enormous growth. Even in those extraordinarily comfortable economic times, it was unable to manage a single surplus budget. Against that background of four surplus budgets, the government has decided to ensure that there is an injection of money into the economy on this occasion and is looking to a deficit budget this year of 3;8 per cent of GDP. (Quorum formed) I thank my colleagues who have entered the chamber to ensure that we have a quorum and again demonstrate the government's interest in the budget bills. The budget involves an injection into the economy of some $16 billion, about 3.8 per cent of GDP. Before the interruption, I was mentioning how the Labor government's record quite favourably compares in that regard with previous Liberal governments. It is worth noting that, in the current context internationally, the deficit of 3.8 per cent is well within what is presently rates being returned by similar economies around the ""World. In 1992 the budget of the United States had a deficit of 4.4 per cent; Germany, 2.3 per cent; France, 4.9. per cent; Italy, 8.8 per cent; the UK, 7.1 per cent; Canada, 2.7 per cent; and Japan, 2.2 per cent. The deficit projected in this budget of 3.8 .per cent provides a stimulus to the economy in keeping with the sort of injection of funds into like economies around the. world. It is a responsible level of deficit to ensure economic activity. The government has also included a number of important commitments. Going into the election earlier this year, the government made a promise and gave a commitment to the people of Australia that we would introduce income tax cuts. Those cuts were legislated for last year and were, at that time, to take effect on 1 July. I am sure it is a matter of satisfaction to all members of the government that those income tax cuts will now take effect from 14 November this year, more than seven months prior to the date set out in the undertakings given to the people of Australia earlier this year at the general election. that is something which we can all be satisfied about and proud of as members of the government. In commenting upon those income tax cuts, I would also like to make reference to what I think is the legitimate area of where those benefits will most apply. I refer to the people in the income brackets of $28,000 to $50,000. People in this chamber would be aware that, in spite of some of the rhetoric from those on the opposite side, previous budgets and economic statements have ensured that income tax cuts to those on incomes below $28,000 have been delivered in earlier budgets. Those people on incomes below $28,000 have been given priority by this government throughout the last decade, and have been able to gain the benefit from substantial income tax cuts. On this occasion, and in the context of that series of budget initiatives over previous years, the government has determined-as was announced before the election-to provide income tax cuts to those people predominantly in the income brackets of $28,000 to $50,000 per annum. Over the years many of us in our constituencies would have been approached by people in that income bracket-in many cases, by those on a single income who have found the going tough over recent years. Because of their relatively higher income, they have not been able to access many of the fringe benefit and social service programs that are available to those on a lesser income. I think the government's decision to commit itself to those tax cuts and to include them in this budget is most appropriate, and is one that will be welcomed by the electorate. There are a number of initiatives within this budget which have drawn some interest in the public debate over the last 10 days or so, and which have drawn more than a little debate around this chamber. It would be remiss of me not to make some comment upon them. Foremost amongst those is the increase in the petrol excise. I am very pleased to note that, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last night, the government has reduced the price differential between leaded I think and unleaded petrol from the previously announced 5c to 2c. In dealing with the question of increases in the price of petrol, I guess it is fair to say that nobody likes to see any tax go up. Petrol· excise falls into that category, but we tend to lose sight of the position of pricing of petrol in Australia compared with that of the rest of the world. We are in a situation where petrol pricing today in Australia is amongst the lowest in the Western world, with a petrol price now second or third lowest in the OECD. In fact, after the increases proposed are implemented, Australian petrol will still be priced at a level which is about third lowest in the OECD. One of the other interesting features is that, when we look at those other countries, we also find that most of them have a substantial price differential between leaded and unleaded petrol. That is for good reason. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and other ministers have, on a number of occasions, quite rightly pointed out the health and environmental considerations in relation to leaded petrol. When we look at other nations around the world with whom we would like to cpmpare ourselves, we find that there is a price differential of between 3c and 16c per litre. The price differential now proposed by the government of 2c is well under the average and will mean that the price differential between leaded and unleaded petrol in Australia is in fact one of the lowest in the OECD. I believe there are only two countries that do not now have a price differential. All countries that now have a price differential have it at a rate higher than that proposed in this budget. Coupled with that increase in the excise, though, is a decision by the government to provide an additional tax rebate to low income earners. It was .originally announced that there would be a tax rebate of $100 annum. The Prime Minister's office last night announced that that would be increased to $150 per annum for those people earning under $20,000 per annum. That will be a as substantial benefit to those people as a free payment to meet any added costs that the petrol excise increase might otherwise impose. The other issue which was very important to the people of Brisbane and to many workto ers throughout the country was the announceformed) ment of the change in the concessional tax rate on accrued long service leave. We all know of many workers in our constituencies who have saved up their long service leave. Many of them have had no access to superanproviding nuation for the great bulk of their working and will rely upon that accumulated long service leave to fund their retirement. Under the original announcement, those people equally would have suffered a heavy financial loss. Effectively, it would have been a retrospective application of a principle which I think people would agree with-that principle of course being that leave is there to be taken and not to be used as a substitute for superanit nuation. I am very pleased that, as announced by Prime Minister last night, the government has ensured that the tax treatment of accrued long service leave for all leave accrued to 17 August this year will continue to attract the concessional tax rate. I know that there will be many people in the electorate of Brisbane expired) who are,' as I am, very' satisfied with that outcome. . The final issue in that bag of items that been of some contention over the last few days and that I would like to mention in course of this debate is the change tooptomthen etry costs. Medicare is one of those issues which dramatically separate the government from the opposition. It is one of those issues which the people of Australia used as a key detenninant in deciding whether they were going to vote Liberal or Labor. Overwhelmingly, the people of Australia said they wanted a Labor government that been was committed to maintaining an equitable tax system and a wages system that was fair to all workers which provided protection per them through the industrial commission and through their unions. In' addition to that, and importantly, they wanted a Labor government that was committed to maintaining Medicare a universal health cover for all Australians. taxAccess to good quality eye care is a fundamental part of that basic health cover. It is to the government's credit that it has in the last day announced that the eye test will continue be eligible for eye care benefits. (Quorum It has become evident in the parliamentary sittings since the last election that we have with us an opposition that has forsaken any pretence of developing alternative policy and any constructive comment to the life process of government. That fact has been reinforced over the last few days with its petulant behaviour in the Senate and its petulant behaviour in this chamber. It is no accident that we have descended into this procedural quagmire. It is the result of an most opposition motivated by revenge without a skerrick of positive philosophy left within its ranks. That revenge and negative energy that is perpetually pursuing in this chamber and in the Senate will be seen by this House and the by the people of Australia as an untenable and unattractive aspect of yet another part of the Liberal Party's operations. If the opposition thinks that that fairly basic and negative approach to politics will score it any political points, it needs to reassess its position. (TIme",83
165,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"The debate on this budget tonight has really has descended to a farce, not just because we have seen the extraordinary events of the the government calling quorums on itself and getting the numbers wrong-we have almost come to expect that Labor will get its numbers wrong; it gets them wrong in big things such as the budget so it is not surprising it cannot count to 30-but also because we are debating a budget that is already dead. We are debating the unchangeable budget that has already been changed. Parliament has not officially told of any of these alterations to the budget The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) first had to report to his masters at for the ACTU. It is more important that the ACTU knows what changes are in the budget than it is for this parliament to know what is going on and what the government is proposing for the future of this nation. This budget has been: Ii disaster. It is cult to remember a federal budget that has been less warmly received-and rightly so. This budget, despite our nation's acute difficulty, offers no vision for a better Australia. There is nothing at all to inspire a national recovery. The government talks about creating 500,000 places as job creation schemes in training, yet the unemployment level will not fall at all this year. This government that claims to express great interest in the downand-outs, the unfortunate Australians who have been unable to get a job in the recession, can produce nothing in its master budget at the beginning of its three-year term in office that will do anything to reduce unemployment. For most people the income tax cuts that the government is talking about will not even cover the rises in indirect taxes and the cuts in health programs. Indeed, despite the income tax cuts that this government talks about, the budget actually will raise $1,208 million more in income tax during the year. There are no tax cuts. Despite all the government's talk about cutting expenditure to the bone, expenditure and outlays are actually up by $5.5 billion. What is worse, the cost of actually running the Public Service is up by 5.6 per cent. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which is one of those departments which has again suffered cuts, actually has an increase in administration costs of 11.5 per cent. It has less money to spend, less work to do, but an increase in its administration costs of 11.5 per cent. The bureaucrats in Canberra seem to be well and truly immune from any of the problems. The rural sector has been particUlarly hard hit in this budget. Not only will the rural sector have to face imposts in its indirect taxes, it will also be hurt by a number of specific measures. The wool tax is up to 12 per cent; the tax on wine is up 50 per cent and on low alcohol wine by over 100 per cent; and cigarettes are up $1 a packet. Fishermen will face increased charges for managing fisheries. Some farm children will lose Austudy entitlements and the country areas program for schools has been axed diffientirely. Farm families will pay increased prices for almost everything they buy as a result of the increased sales tax. But because most struggling farmers are not paying any income tax they will also not qualify for the government's tax rebate for low income families. Their cost of living will rise without any. compensation at all. A lot of people in the community, people managing companies, have asked the very obvious question: what would happen to this Prime Minister if he were a company director under the laws which his government has implemented for companies and not a mere prime minister? It is clear that the information included in his prospectus, namely his policy speech, was completely false. It contained information deliberately intended to mislead potential investors-the voters. His annual report, the budget, exposed many previously unreported expenses and obligations-a record deficit. The shareholders will not get their promised dividend-tax cuts which were I-a-w-and will have to pay compulsorily big tax rises to keep their company afloat. Let us not forget, when we talk about a failure to honour promises and the dishonesty of the approach, the role of the Australian Democrats. Their advertised corporate plan was to keep the others honest. Now they seem to be just doing deals to suit their own agenda rather than honouring their commitments to the shareholders. It is clear that the government has failed in this· budget to address the problems confronting our nation. It has added more pain for no gain. NA",85
