5,Mr SPEAKER,AYES,"Order! It being past 9.45 a.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to on 5 February 1997 the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Question proposed: NOES That grievances be noted. Executive Salaries",15
6,Mr JENKINS,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"At a time when the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is critical of the pay increases achieved by a number of Australians through bargaining with their employers, in particular the Transport Workers Union in Victoria, there is a group of Australians whose pay increases abound seemingly unchecked. I am speaking about senior executives. The government does not seem to pay as much attention to the massive increases achieved in executive salaries as it does to the modest pay increases of ordinary Australians. Indeed, the Minister for Industrial Relations is quoted as saying that with the new decentralised system executive salaries are no longer the problem they once were. Yet there can be no clearer demonstration of the destructive power of unregulated capitalism than the obscene amounts of money that are paid in executive salaries. Regrettably, governments of all persuasions have been either unwilling or unable to control executive salaries. For example, during the wages freeze of the early 1980s, when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was last Treasurer, executive salaries rose by 14 per cent. At the National Economic Summit Conference, after the Hawke government was elected, there was enough concern about uncontrolled executive salaries that a call for restraint was included Worth, P. M. in the communique. PAIRS Throughout the life of the Hawke government, when ordinary wage and salary earners contributed so much to national recovery and reconstruction, there were attempts to bring Fahey, J. J. executive salaries under control, but without success. In 1988, for example, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Ralph Willis, called a summit on executive salaries but was unable to get the main players to accept that executive salaries should be controlled in any way other than by the market. In the 10 years between 1983 and 1993 award wages increased by 53 per cent, and average weekly earnings went up by 74 per cent, as did inflation. Over the same period, executive pay increased by 133 per cent. According to a recent article in the Independent Monthly in the past year, salaries paid to the executives of the top 150 companies increased by six to eight per cent-10 to 15 per cent if you include the cheap share deals and bonuses that have become a common practice. The latest survey of executive salaries by Cullen Egan Dell has shown that senior management remuneration increased by 6.3 per cent last year. This increase is well above price increases of one per cent that the consumer price index registers and the 4.5 per cent upper limit of pay increases regarded as acceptable to maintain low inflation. Let us not forget we are talking about large increases upon already extremely large salaries. An article in the Independent Monthly magazine in June estimates that there are 45 senior executives in Australia who earn more than $1 million. There are many more who would earn well in excess of half a million. In 1993-94 there were 13 Victorian executives who earned more than $1 million and 44 who earned between $500,000 and $1 million. I dare say that none of them live in my electorate, the electorate of Scullin. When you consider that someone like the CEO of Westfield Holdings earns an estimated $72,000 a week, it is sobering to look at the average taxable income in a seat like Scullin. The mean average taxable income in Thomastown in 1993-94 was $24,700; in Lalor it was $24,041. As I said at the outset, there is no clearer example of the destructiveness of the market than its failure in relation to executive salaries. One cannot pretend that executives are worth these obscene sums or that it has anything to do with performance. Over a number of years we have seen celebrated examples of the opposite. There is the case in 1989-90 when Elders IXL increased its executive remuneration packages by 23 per cent at the same time as there was an 80 per cent drop in operating profit. Then there case of Adsteam, in the same year. This company's chief executive had a 53 per cent pay increase at the same time as the value of the company shrunk to eight per cent of its former worth on the Australian Stock Exchange. As the Independent Monthly revealed in another example, MIM Holdings' share price was 'on its way to the cellar' when its chairman retired with a payout of over $2 million. Then there is the celebrated case of the soon to be unemployed CEO of Coles Myer, Peter Bartels. Despite Mr Bartels' spectacular salary package of $2.8 million, the performance of Coles Myer under his leadership has been spectacularly questionable. The annual report shows that Mr Bartels' salary package jumped by 75 per cent in 1995-96 while the company's profits plunged by about a third to $280 million. It was reported on Monday that, as part of his exit package from Coles Myer, Mr Bartels received 200,000 Coles Myer shares valued at $1 million. This was in spite of the fact that he was not due to receive the package if he ceased employment with Coles Myer before November 1998 'with the exception of certain circumstances'. I think the Australian public would like to know what the circumstances were that have now allowed this payment. Perhaps it was the one-third plunge in profits. Again, as the Independent Monthly points out, performance is no guide to executive salary. It cites the example of the highly successful retailer Woolworths, which pays its CEO $665,000, which ranks him 95th out of the top 100. In recent months there has been another celebrated case of an individual being paid a fabulous sum when on any assessment his performance, based on the performance of the company that he leads, is not worth one-tenth of it. I am speaking of Mr Ross Wilson, Managing Director of Tabcorp. By any standards Mr Wilson is paid a king's ransom-or, more precisely, a Premier's ransom-to run Victoria's Tabcorp. As an Age commentator flippantly put it, Mr Wilson's salary package is roughly twice the GDP of Tasmania. Mr Wilson was paid initially $675,000, in 1993-94, plus an interest free is the loan of $6.75 million to buy shares in Tabcorp. His salary has increased to just over $1 million. The shares bought at $2 each are now worth $S.20-an appreciation of nearly $10 million. The dividend is being used to pay off the interest free loan. The question is: does this sort of level remuneration have anything to do with the capacity to perform? Given the farce that occurred last Melbourne Cup day throughout Victoria, the answer is clearly no. On the most important day of racing, Tabcorp failed in its most elemental function: facility for people to put a bet on. In my electorate and in shopping centres across Victoria, queues snaked their way across car parks with thousands of punters waiting to place a bet on the cup. Malfunctions in Tabcorp's computer put services on hold for about three hours on the most important day of racing. Ordinary Victorians, who in their lifetimes will never earn as much as Mr Wilson does in one year, stood and waited to put their couple of dollars on the Cup. Mr Wilson, of course, was not affected. He was with the glitterati at Flemington, able to on course. The big losers were TAB agents, small business people, who ultimately pay Mr Wilson's fabulous salary. They are estimated to have lost millions. Because of the crash, takings at agencies were down by about 10 per cent based on last year. But what was Wilson's reaction? A sort of grudging halfapology, hardly what one might expect from allowing it someone who gets paid so much that the system runs smoothly. Initially, Mr Wilson would hear nothing of compensation for the small business people who make up Tabcorp's network of agents, but he has thought better of it. It must be said that the performance of Tabcorp is not a good ad for privatisation. Where does the buck stop? Should Mr Wilson's salary package be reviewed? Even the Victorian Treasurer is reported to have admitted that the Wilson package has been biggest mistake. There is no mechanism stop similar packages arising. As former Senator John Button said recently, the lem about large executive salaries in country is that the executives themselves 'are not good enough to justify them'. While the Prime Minister, and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), have sounded off against executive salary increases in recent times, of what are they going to do about it? What they have just done is secure the passage of measures that have the potential to reintroduce market anarchy into the method of fixing the wages and salaries of ordinary Australians, a fact already being bemoaned by the Minister to provide a for Industrial Relations. Clearly there is a need to have an inquiry into executive salaries involving, at least in part, an old-fashioned work value case. It is high time that the same sort of productivity tests that have been applied to the wages of ordinary Australians over the last decade and a half are also applied to the top executives. One measure that the government should consider is the introduction of an upper limit similar to that introduced by President Clinton in the United States in 1993. This upper limit applies to the collection of corporate tax. bet Effectively, it removes the deductibility of executive salaries above the limit of $1 million. While some are critical of its effectiveness, it is an important symbol in pushing executive salaries towards performance based compensation. In other words, the government should be saying, 'What is considered to be a reasonable level of executive remuneration? Mr If you want to pay your executives more, do not expect the taxpayer to subsidise it by to be deducted as a cost of proto ensure duction.' (Time expired) Automotive Industry-Tariffs",15
7,Dr SOUTHCOTT,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"At the last election the coalition had the prime goals of helping families, creating jobs and encouraging small businesses. The success of the motor vehicle industry in Boothby's industrial heart will be central to achieving those three goals locally. The Productivity Commission has been his asked by the Treasurer to report by May of to this year on assistance to the Australian automobile industry from January 2000. The probProducti vity Commission's draft report, this released last year on 20 December, has produced a majority opinion which proposes the reduction of tariffs to 5 per cent by the year 2000. With its main assembly plant in Tonsley Park in my electorate of Boothby, Mitsubishi supplies just over 10 per cent of the domestic car market. That makes it the smallest producer of the four Australian producers and, due to the consequent economies of scale, it is the highest cost producer of the four Australian manufacturers. I recognise quite well that a tariff is a very inefficient form of protection in terms of the increasing of domestic prices and also in the way that it can contract output. But I feel that the commission's majority report has neglected to factor in the regional impact that the continuing lowering of tariffs will have on the South Australian economy. I am not a big supporter of tariffs. As I said before, tariffs are an inefficient form of protection, but this is a problem that we have inherited from the old days of the tariff board and it is a problem that I have inherited to some extent as the member for Boothby. My deep concern is that a further reduction in protection immediately post-2000 at the same pace-that is, 2.5 per cent as we have seen happen over the last decade-may lead to the closure of Mitsubishi' s Australian operations and to a possible flow-on effect to the component suppliers. For example, in my electorate we have Henderson's-Automotive and Munro and just outside my electorate we have Britax Rainsfords, all of whom supply component parts to Mitsubishi. I recognise that members of parliament do not come into the House to represent companies, but they do represent their employees. At the end of last year Mitsubishi Motors Australia employed 5,188 people and of those 1,605 reside in my electorate of Boothby. If you consider the possibility that Mitsubishi Motors may close its Australian operations, then that would have a flow-on effect which goes much further than those 1,600 people. It would have a multiplier effect on services, energy and also on the component suppliers, many of whom are clustered around that central part of my electorate. S('-th Australia is still recovering from the mismanagement during the 1980s of the State Bank. That was a heavy blow to a regional economy and the disinvestment of one of the car producers would be a further blow. Of course the car industry provides a considerable amount of the gross state product. Automotive manufacturing is responsible for something like one-sixth of South Australia's gross state product. It is responsible for one-third of its exports. It is enormously important to the state of South Australia. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-as he has said publicly and also privately-is well aware of the regional impact that any downturn in the automotive industry would have on South Australia. My concern is that an immediate move to 5 per cent tariffs, if that were to mean the closure of Mitsubishi's Australian operations, would devastate the region south of the city. I know that they are not crying wolf if they hint that they are going to pull out of Australia if the majority report is implemented. No-one thought that Nissan would go, but they have gone. Australia has gone from five to four car producers. That point should be recognised by the commission. I believe that a freeze in tariffs post-2000 is not unreasonable, or that a smaller decrease than 2.5 per cent would not be unreasonable. But the automotive industry needs to be well aware that that does not mean any letting up of the competition. That would mean that they still need to continue to find those productivity improvements. I have always supported the Button plan. I believe that it has provided a tremendous improvement in productivity in the automotive industry. We should recognise that the gains as the car industry has been opened up to international competition in productivity have been quite outstanding. But before lowering tariffs into the next millennium, Australia still needs further improvements of efficiency in the tax system, the labour market and the energy and transport sectors. For example, at present passenger motor vehicles have a wholesale sales tax of 22 per cent; services which compete for the consumer dollar do not. In addition we need to continue with trade liberalisation and to improve overseas access for Australian exports, though I recognise that that should not be used as a bargaining chip for the further lowering of tariffs. One of best views from my office can be seen by looking out of the window at the large semi-trailers conveying the new Mitsubishi sedans into Marion Road from Alawoona Avenue. They drive past on their way to the docks. That was part of a contract that Mitsubishi won two years ago which enables them to supply 20,000 of their Magna and Diamante cars to every market outside Japan. Just recently, Mitsubishi Motors Australia broke into the Taiwan market, selling something like 2,000 cars in Taiwan. That is a first for Australian cars. So we should recognise that there has been an enormous change in the work practices of the automotive industry as it has striven to compete in the international market place. For example, increasing use is being made by Mitsubishi of robotics, something which Japan has led the world into allow Japan to compete with low wage countnes. South Australia, with only one-twelfth of Australia's population, contributes something like one-third of Australia's automotive industry. A submission from I think the South Australian Development Council shows that they have developed the South Australian model, SAM, to factor in what the effect of tariffs will be. That was used in conjunction with the national Murphy model 2, MM2, to calculate what effect tariffs would have on South Australia's economy. That model calculates that, from 1996 to 2000, as tariffs go from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, there will be an output loss of 2.2 per cent in manufacturing, a 1.6 per cent output loss in electricity, gas and water, and a l.5 per cent output loss in recreation and personal services. That contraction in output is largely due to lower automotive industry prices which lead to lower output and employment in the car industry and in South Australia as a whole. It will also lead to about a 1.3 per cent decrease in employment in South Australia. This is made up predominantly of a 2.6 per cent loss in manufacturing, a two per cent loss in electricity, gas and water and a l.5 per cent decrease in wholesale and retail trade, transport and communications. That will mean an increase in long-term unemployment of 0.3 per cent. However, if you factor in continuing tariff decreases from the year 2000 to 2004, the employment loss in South Australia increases. It virtually doubles to 2.71 per cent, and it means that unemployment will be about half a per cent higher at the end of the next decade than it otherwise would have been. More importantly, real private consumption will decrease by 3.2 per cent, and there will be a 2.5 per cent loss in South Australia's working population due to migration. The same national model shows an overall increase in real national GDP of the order of 0.1 per cent. So it is important to note that, for a small national gain, South Australia bears the greatest brunt of exposing the automotive industry to international competition. (Time expired) Legal Aid",17
8,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, in your earlier contribution you discussed the preoccupation of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) with wage increases for transport workers in this country. That essentially came from what we were told was, in theory, the government's aim. A crucial part of those negotiations was the negotiation and discussions about penalty rates on Saturday. It is part of the kind of deal that this government supposedly endorses. You made the distinction that we do not see too much concern, too much interest or too much activity by the Minister for Industrial Relations regarding the massive growth of executive salaries in this country. Another issue in the melting pot at the moment which goes to inequity and the drive by this government to basically stratify this society is that of legal aid. In the last few days the Sydney Morning Herald has concentrated very substantially on one particular aspect of this issue. A person facing charges for drug related matters might have to be released because of his inability to obtain legal aid, as a result of this government's efforts. That is only one aspect but it is probably the most controversial and most worrying one for some people in middle Australia. This question of legal aid and this government's determination to. basic,ally deprive large numbers of Aus-rahans. of. t?e ability to represent themselves m our JudIcIal system has many other implicatIOns. I do not know whether my electorate is different, but I have had the most correspondence on this particular matter rather than some of the other controversial issues that we have seen. This correspondence comes from a wide range of organisations, two of which I am pleased to say are centred in my electorate. The first group is the Vietnam veterans. I recently had the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) telling me how good they were while he was out backslapping, unveiling plaques and running around the office. I think they are a bit more concerned with the repercussions of this government's attack on legal aid and the impact that it will have on the ability of people who fought for this country-many of whom were conscriptedto fight issues such as the impact of defoliants, pensions, disability services, et cetera. In letters they have written to me they were very critical about what they see as a major attack on ex-servicemen in this country through this drive by the government on legal aid. The second group is the Women's Legal Resources Centre. I am pleased to say that I helped them to obtain premises in my electorate when I was a state member. They have written expressing their very grave worries about the impact of these changes on women. Amongst their comments to me in a letter of 11 November was this: The proposed cuts breached the Coalition Government's pre election promises to maintain funding to legal aid, to match and extend. Labor's access to justice measures and t.o redress ces which disadvantage women In the legal system. They go on to note: Over 30,000 women apply for domestic violence restraining orders in Australia each year - nd about 60% of these women have dependent children. They say quite clearly that those people will particularly suffer from this government's fairly draconian attack on legal aid. They further state: Only in the most limited circumstances is aid available for family law property disputes. Women who are excluded from the family home with no assets are not able to obtain their share of the family assets to which they are entitled to receive because they have no money to afford to take their matter to court. The Women's Legal Resources Centre also point out that we are going to have a wide variety of repercussions and by-products. For example, women will be forced into refuges because it will not be viable to fight their cases for their homes. The government is running around the place with some excuse that, since 1973, when Commonwealth legal aid was introduced, there has supposedly been an avoidance of responsibility by state governments and that the federal government should take on this matter in a very aggressive fashion. The reality is that 55 per cent of legal aid funding in this country does come from the federal sphere, and this heavy-handed attempt to supposedly solve the disparity in the way it is funded has led to a grave undermining of the system. There is always a very difficult balance in deciding what is a state and what is a federal responsibility in regard to legal aid. The situation is that the government has said that over the next three years it will slash a massive $120 million out of this system. This is a system which at the moment people are questioning. It is means testing. People are saying at the moment that large numbers of people cannot get representation; they do not get a chance to fight their cases against companies and they do not get their opportunity to have legal rights in this country because they cannot afford it. Even under the Imbalanprevious system we had this problem. One really has to have grave worries about where this whole thing is going to go. Another group that has been in contact with members of this parliament is the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists. It is very timely this week, with the variety of meetings that are being held in the national capital in connection with Jose Ramos Horta, the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, to put on the record that organisation's very strong support for the Timorese cause. But on the particular matter at hand, they said that their organisation: ... regrets the decision of the Federal Government to reduce funding the legal aid system by more than $100 million over three years ... The organisation is concerned: . . . that the reduction in funds will reduce the rights and ability of the financially and socially disadvantaged people to get access to justice, the right of accused people to a fair trial and consequently Australia's ability to perform its international human rights obligations. So as I say, there was a wide variety of organisations-there was a national coalition meeting on this issue which included everyone from Care Australia, the Salvation Army, the Uniting Church and the Bar Council, all of these organisations-coming together and saying, 'This government's decision, this minister's decision to attack legal aid and people's ability to have their day in court, is an extremely serious change in this country.' For instance, the Legal Aid News of December 1996, covering the work of the legal aid organisation, gives some indication of just how broad the matters they tackle are. This is not just the example given by the Sydney Morning Herald of a drug dealer being unable to defend himself and therefore on the verge of being released. It covers an extremely diverse range of issues, and it really gives you some indication of why we must have a strong legal aid intervention in this country. Amongst the issues that the Legal Aid Commission took up in the month before that last journal was issued were the rights of elderly people in a nursing home who had paid large amounts of money to enter that institution to resist a very extreme increase weekly costs and charges on them; child support advice; and the conduct of an insuradopt, ance seminar for citizens to get abreast of insurance law and make them aware of some of the traps in that field. A domestic violence conference was conducted by the legal aid even institution. They took on the New Wales state government in regard to tenancy agreements. That action was of such a consevoluntary quence that the New South Wales govern to ment, the department, had to alter its tenancy agreements because of the matters raised by the legal aid team. They also exposed in court, and fought for a large number of people who were exploited by, a migration scam-an issue that is of great concern to me. These people had paid as much as $30,000 to a character or group of characters who were supposedly going to get them permanent residence and did not have one chance in 20 million of accomplishing that. But once again, this is an indication of just how many people are affected by this attack being made by the government. There is also another case in that journal of a woman's ability to get 50 per cent of an estate in a property settlement; again, she was defended by legal aid. Another case that month-and, as I say, this diversity of activity occurred in the course of only four to six weeks-was based upon a police admission of perjury and fabrication of evidence, a person being released as a result of that. In conclusion, this government's attack on legal aid is a very serious attack on broad, middle Australia and people's ability to have their day in court, their ability to fight for their rights. I urge reconsideration of this matter. These people should not suffer because of the minister's preoccupation with technicalities about whether this is a state or federal responsibility, because there are many people being deprived of their rights through this measure. Compulsory Voting",19
9,Mr SLIPPER,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the chamber this morning to support the principle of voluntary voting. At a time when we are discussing having a people's convenin tion and there has been some speculation over the voting system that the government will those who support compulsory voting have come forward once again to urge that as a nation we should not only give people the right to vote but also compel them to votein a situation where, if they fail to vote, South some of them will end up in gaol. The government's likely decision to have voting in the election of delegates the people's convention is not to be taken as a precedent with respect to the advance of voluntary voting in other areas-and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made that clear. But I must say that I find it very difficult to understand how in a democracy those opposite and some other people on our side of politics could seriously argue that not only should someone have the right to vote but that one ought to compel people to vote as well. A very large number of people at election time might feel that they are prepared to support one party or the other. But there is also a substantial minority of Australians who feel that politicians are not worth voting for; they might not want to vote for either side. Of course, most of those people do vote under the threat of a fine or imprisonment; that is why they go to the ballot box. I believe that one must reasonably wonder about the quality of voting that those people cast. Most of us have been at polling booths at 6 o'clock, just before the polling booths close, and we find people who wander in on their way from having a very pleasant liquid afternoon; sometimes it would only be 300 metres to the polling booth, but those people might take 600 metres to get there. Those people in a close election are the people who, in fact, could be determining which side of the political spectrum will form the government of this country. Honourable members opposite would be aware that, in the 1993 election, had about 1,000 people scattered across a number of marginal seats voted differently, the government would have been changed and Paul Keating would have been thrown out and John Hewson would have become Prime Minister. What I am saying is that, in a democracy, it is very important that we, at an election time, get the government that the country deserves, the government that the country wants, the government that has the right policies to make sure that the country has future progress. But we now have a situation where an election could well be decided by a minority whose onl.y inte-est in casting a vote is simply to aVOid a fme or simply to avoid the sanctions currently in the Electoral Act, which are at times quite draconian. I believe that, if Australia is to support democratic principles and individual civil liberties, compulsory voting must be abolished, as its existence constitutes a denial of individual rights which we all hold so dear in Australia. On the Sunshine Coast we have had people who have been threatened with imprisonment because they did not vote at the last federal election. If one listens to the proponents of compulsory voting, one would almost believe that those who support voluntary voting, as I do, are somehow opposing democracy. It is almost as though voluntary voting would be a novelty. It is almost as though voluntary voting is not something that happens in many other parts of the world. Many people in our community are not aware that voluntary voting was abolished for federal elections only in 1924, when a National Party senator, Senator Payne, brought in a private member's bill. No leader of either side of parliament actually participated in the debate, which slipped through the parliament in just a few hours. Senator Nick Minchin, in an article he has written, points out: Senator Payne had a genuine concern about political apathy and felt the solution lay in compelling Australians to take a keener interest in the welfare of their country. Senator Minchin also points out: At one stage in his second reading speech Senator Payne said: 'If the amendment of the electoral laws, which I am submitting, is enacted, it will be found that in a short time there will be a wonderful improvement in the political knowledge of the people.' What an incredible statement. In the years that have passed since 1924, I do not think any serious person could suggest that there has been a wondrous improvement in the political knowledge of the people, and surveys have been taken. One survey to which I wish to refer indicates an appallingly low level of knowledge about our political system, origins and history.",21
10,Unknown,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Honourable members interjecting,22
11,Mr SLIPPER,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Those honourable members who are interjecting obviously should join the campaign for voluntary voting because I believe that they genuinely seek a situation where, at an election, we always get a government which is elected on the considered vote of the electorate. One simply ought not to have the current situation continue where, in a close poll, a government might change or not change as a result of voter apathy. In 1994 there was an Australian National Opinion Poll national survey, the results of which were included in the report of the Civics Expert Group by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. As I mentioned a moment ago, that survey found an appallingly low knowledge of our political system, origins and history. One ought to look at the facts of this survey. Only 40 per centMr Laurie Ferguson-What do the figures show-75 per cent support it?",22
12,Mr SLIPPER,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,We won the election with a massive majority. Mr Laurie Ferguson-There must be other reasons why you won the election; that can't be the only one.,23
13,Mr SLIPPER,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"We had the most enormous swing that we have seen in this country for a very long time, as the honourable member for Reid well knows. But I was referring earlier to the 1993 election, where you crawled back into office only because the then Prime Minister was prepared to lie and rob and cheat and say anything to get back into office. The simple fact of the matter is that, had 1,000 people across the country changed their votes at that poll, the government would have changed. But we have a situation where people are forced to vote; and, of course, the reason that many of those people vote is to avoid a fine rather than to cast a serious vote in the interests of choosing the party which best able to deliver good government. Going back to the ANOP survey, only 40 per cent could name the two federal houses of parliament; only 24 per cent knew that senators were elected on a statewide basis; only 19 per cent had some. understanding of federalism; only 18 per cent knew something about the content of the constitution; and 60 per cent did not know how the constitution could be changed. A Saulwick survey in 1994 found that year 11 students who were soon to vote were 'profoundly ignorant' of our system of government and how it works and that many had only a rudimentary knowledge of how the system of government works. In New Zealand, the closest example to Australia in culture and history, where enrolment is compulsory but voting is not, voter turnout at recent elections has been 88 per cent; in Germany, where they have voluntary voting, 87 per cent; in France 79 per cent; in Great Britain 77 per cent; and in Canada 75 per cent. Al1 of those great democracies have voluntary voting, and one can see that the percentage of people who tum out to vote in a voluntary election is not very far short of the percentage of people who tum out to vote in Australian elections. Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting",23
14,Mr SLIPPER,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The point that I want to make to the honourable member for Reid is that people in those countries are prepared to come forward and do their civic duty. They vote because they want to vote for one party or the other party. What we have in this country is a situation where a substantial number of people vote simply because they have to. I think it is better to have a government elected on a slightly smaller percentage of the Australian vote, if that percentage is a considered percentage. This is an issue that should transcend party politics. After all, surely we are interested in good government in this country and surely those opposite can also see that it is important to have voluntary voting. A Herald-AGB MCNair poll published in the Sydney Morning Herald in November last year asked the following question: would you is vote at the next election if voting were voluntary? They found that 88 cent said that they were either very likely or likely to vote with only 4 per cent being very unlikely to vote. In effect, the voter turnout-and other similar democratic cultures support this-would be almost at the same level as with compulsory voting. Most of the other major democracies in this world do not have compulsory voting. We are in a minority. This country has not always had compulsory voting. It has had it since only 1924, when it slipped through the parliament. I believe that it is everyone's right to vote, but it is the absolute antithesis mocracy that people are fined and in some cases gaoled for failing to vote. It is totally unacceptable in the democratic Australia of 1997. The question of compulsory or voluntary voting should be considered by the people's convention. It should be debated on a non-party political basis. Surely we are all about freedom. (Time expired) Compulsory Voting Allandale Nursing Home Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (10.38 a.m.)Rarely do you hear renditions of self-interest more offensive than the one we have just heard from the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). The bottom line is that most in the Liberal Party-I know there are some exceptions, like one Petro Georgiou-believe that there is an advantage to them in abolishing compulsory voting. They want a system which has developed in many other nations overseas where a minority of the nation elects representatives to represent them in the national parliament. I do not think that is a result we want in this country. What I find offensive, and what I am sure people in my electorate will find offensive, the implication that compulsory voting can lead to people in some electorates at least wandering to the polling booth in a drunken state. That was the implication I drew. There is the suggestion that they may not be too interested in voting at all and that their may not be cast in a manner we see as fit and proper. I draw the implication that the member for Fisher sees an advantage to his side of politics in the abolition of compulsory voting. Those in electorates like my own-where people have the audacity to vote in favour of parties like the Australian Labor Party-might be the very people he is referring to when he suggests that people are inebriated and approach polling booths in a manner which he considers less than fit and proper. I move to the issue I wish to raise today. I am very disappointed that the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) has exited the chamber. She should be here to hear what I have to say as this is an issue that she should be taking a very strong interest in. I refer to of de- the Allandale Nursing Home in my home town of Cessnock. I have raised this issue in the House on two occasions, and I will continue to raise it until I get some satisfaction. Allandale Nursing Home is state government owned and controlled. In its heyday it contained more than 400 nursing home beds. The state government in collaboration with the federal government-both past and present, I am happy to add-is transferring many of those nursing home beds to other homes in the geographical area covered by the Hunter Area Health Service. Sixty beds have already been transferred and it is the intention of the Hunter Area Health Service to transfer some 100 more. The bed transfers are about addressing the maldistribution of beds in the area covered by the health service. I am the first to recognise that there is not an equitable distribution of nursing home beds in the area covered by the service. But what neither government has been prepared to recognise is that there are some fairly disastrous employment implications as a result of those transfers. I am sad to say that Cessnock does have a is higher rate of unemployment than the national level. It certainly cannot afford to lose a large slice of one of its major employers. Allandale Nursing Home is large enough to justify the economies of scale necessary to have its own laundry, kitchen, cleaning staff and tradesmen. vote Indeed, the nursing home traditionally has been the trainer of nurses and the first point of call for those school leavers seeking an apprenticeship. It will have disastrous implications for employment in the Cessnock area. At the very least, I am pleased to say that the state Minister for Health, Andrew Refshauge, has agreed to postpone the transfer of the next 100 beds until the issue has been given the opportunity to be more widely canvassed. A number of public meetings have been held on the Allandale issue. It has been a very difficult issue for state member Stan Neilly and me because we recognise that there is an inequitable distribution of nursing home beds in the area covered by the Hunter Area Health Service. When attending those meetings full of very angry people concerned about job prospects and full of many elderly people concerned about their access to aged care services, we have tried to allay their fears. We have taken a responsible approach, have attempted to explain the maldistribution of beds in the area and, at the same time, have worked very hard to ensure that further transfers are deferred until such time as proper plans are in place to replace those jobs that will be lost as a result of bed transfers at Allandale. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can imagine that some of those meetings have been quite angry. It would have been very easy for me to simply say, 'Yes, this is an absolute disgrace. There is no justification for the transfers whatsoever.' That would have been easy. But for me as the member for Hunter, and for Stan Neilly as the state member, it would not have been the responsible thing for us to do. You can imagine my disappointment when at a public meeting held in February 1996, attended by hundreds of people, the then National Party candidate for the seat of Hunter, one Michael Johnsen, attended the meeting and announced to all and sundry that he had consulted the then shadow minister for health, the now Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), and had gained a commitment from Dr Wooldridge that, if a coalition was elected, nothing would change at Allandale. 'Everything would remain the same at Allandale,' Michael Johnsen assured the hundreds of angry people at Allandale in February last year. I have with me the media release issued by Michael Johnsen at the time. It is entitled 'Coalition support for Allandale'. It states: ""The Coalition supports the retention of the Allandale Nursing Home,"" said Coalition candidate for Hunter, Michael Johnsen. ""The issue of aged care in Cessnock has concern for quite some time and people can feel secure in the knowledge that a Coalition government will continue to support Allandale as long there is a need."" It goes on: ""Clearly the need is there and is expected to actually increase over time as the community continues to age."" Mr Johnsen gave the commitment at a public meeting over the issue held at Allandale Nursing Home. ""Aged care is not an issue that should be played with. ""The Coalition supports and actively encourages the increased use of such a facility in Cessnock."" ""Staff at Allandale can also feel secure in knowing that a Coalition government will support the service they provide, so vitally important to our elderly citizens,"" Mr Johnsen said. The first thing I did when I was elected to the federal parliament was write to Dr Wooldridge. First I congratulated him on his appointment to the ministry, but then I asked him to honour the commitment to Allandale made by Mr Johnsen prior to the election. My letter, not surprisingly, has never been responded to. But, alas, my surprises do not c-ase there. This week I picked up the Maitland Mercury where the Allandale Hospital is the issue again. This time the headline is 'Dungog missing out on nursing home beds'. This was a story created by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who has in his electorate the township of Dungog, which happens to have a nursing home-like so many others-a little short on nursing home beds. So the member for Paterson wants the bed transfers from Allandale accelerated in order to shore up nursing homes in his own electorate. I wish I had time to read some quotes from the article, but what he basically says is that Dr Refshauge's decision to delay further transfers-at our request-is causing nursing homes in his electorate to miss out on vital services. I suggest to the member for Paterson that he honour the commitment given by his party prior to the election. If the member for Paterson wants additional nursing home beds in his been of electorate-it is very simple-he should convince his government of the need for more nursing home beds, not the need to transfer as from one area to another. He should recognise that nursing home beds are underprovided. He should spend more of his time honouring his party's commitments rather than attacking facilities in my electorate. (Time expired) Water Conservation",23
15,Mr NEVILLE,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to speak today about water storage in the Burnett River catchment and about the need for a more pro-active stance on water conservation in this country. I recognise that two factors have lead to the downgrading of water conservation as an issue over the last decade or so. The first is that economic rationalists would have us believe that every water project should be justified not only by cost benefit and broad economic data but also by the user-pays principle applying to funding for each and every scheme. The second revolves around the greater appreciation of environmental issues concerning river flows, salt and the potential damage to flora, fauna and marine environments. Sadly, some have misrepresented the latter, forcing both sides of the water conservation debate into entrenched positions. Even more sadly, working through the issues to determine the regional and national interest becomes the last rather than the first item on the agenda. Time and time again we go through periods of horrendous drought only to be followed by raging floods. I do not want to sound simplistic, but we have seen in the last week this huge expanse of water going through the community in Charleville and you cannot help but think that, as a nation, we could harness and husband the resources in a more appropriate way. I recognise that there are some very fragile ecosystems, such as the Cooper Basin, and I for one would oppose the dam that is being proposed on that watercourse. But, in our economic rationalism and at times our extreme absolutism in conservation, I think we have lost the vision of greening this vast, dry country. If, as the rhetoric we are going to become the 'salad bowl' of Asia, if the supermarket to Asia is to fulfil its potential, then we must become a much more professional and consultative community in the managing of our resources. I warmly welcome the concept of a national water audit. I applaud studies into recycling, trickle and drip irrigation, trash blanketing and other moisture retention methods, urban conservation education, studies into salt intrusion and a host of other sensible measures. But even these depreciate in their true value if we do not tackle the need for strategically positioned major water storages. The fact that mistakes were made in the past over irrigation-excessive clearing, insufficient river flows and the like-is not an excuse for turning away in this generation. To give us some idea of how essential this is in regional Australia, the Queensland government, through its Queensland Water Infrastructure Task Force, called for submissions for a 15-year program envisaging an outlay of $1 billion on water type projects. Would you believe that at this stage they have received bids in excess of $7 billion? One billion was their figure and $7 billion the figure for the bids. I think this illustrates just how quickly we need to address this matter of supplying water to regional Australia. I vigorously support the government's $1.1 billion environmental package and the establishment of the water audit. This will give us the opportunity to establish world's best practice in these areas. If the Telstra sale is highly successful-and I trust it will be-I would like to see the vision extended further. I strongly advocate a national infrastructure fund of at least $1 billion running parallel with the better knowledge flowing from the water audit and armed with better environmental practices which will flow from the $1.1 billion scheme for the environment. This way, Australia could enhance its productive capacity immeasurably and in an environmentally sensitive way. Quite apart from all this, there is an urgent need to enhance and consolidate rural and regional Australia. We cannot treat the bush in the next decade with the neglect that was says, experienced in the last decade. We can and should have assistance schemes of various types in times of crisis, but there is no substitute for a vote of confidence in the bush to replace years of denuding with a new vision of tangible enhancements. On the western edge of my electorate, the Dawson Valley scheme is currently under active consideration by the state government. I want today not so much to promote the scheme but to illustrate what it can achieve. That particular scheme, which envisages a major dam in the headwaters of the Dawson River, will trigger two coal mines, a power station, an extension of the rail line from Taroom to Theodore, linking two rail systems, double or even treble cotton production in the Dawson Valley and make that valley virtually drought free. That is the sort of vision we need to be looking at. I do not want to talk so much about this scheme, but one in my own electorate-the Bundaberg irrigation scheme; one which actually was preceded by the Burnett-Kolan scheme and rejected by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in the mid-1960s. The Burnett-Kolan scheme, which was the forerunner of the Bundaberg scheme, was a remake of that particular enterprise. It was suggested to the federal government and the state government in 1969. Sir John MCEwen backed it very heavily and it commenced in 1970, with the completion of the Monduran dam, a major water storage approximately 1.1 times the size than Sydney Harbour, and was completed in 1974. The whole scheme was completed in 1992. It was a very big scheme, stretching over 20 years. It is a system of weirs, channels, piping, and river based and underground irrigation. It has enhanced my area immeasurably over that period. For example, the area under cane production went from 38,000 hectares to 47,500 hectares, small crops went from 2,000 hectares to 4,000 hectares and tree crops went from 200 to 4,000 hectares. It is arguably the most intensive irrigation scheme in Australia. It supports sugar production of $240 million and small crop production of $100 million. That is a third of a billion dollars just from those two cropping areas. When we also bear in mind that that represents 600,000 tonnes of sugar and that we export nearly 85 per cent of that to an internament tional market, it is also very much an export earning crop for Australia. The original scheme envisaged a second storage at Kalliwa. Kalliwa is about 40 to 50 kilometres south-west of Bundaberg. I would like to promote in this parliament today the idea of a study into that dam as soon as possible. It is a $150 million scheme and it will contain 1.85 million megalitres of water, delivering 400,000 megalitres per year. Just to put that into perspective, the current allocation from the existing scheme, Lake Monduran, in Bundaberg, and the various associated weirs, is 259,000 megalitres, but the demand is 440,000 megalitres. You can see that there is a vast capacity already for the utilisation of water. To put this into layman's terms-you might ask me what that will mean in terms of production in your area-it would mean that sugar would increase 30 per cent in terms of vertical integration-that is, the existing sugar growing areas-and horizontally by 35 per cent by the inclusion of a further 13,000 hectares. It would mean less salt intrusion and it would mean doubling of small crop and tree production from 4,000 hectares to 8,000 hectares. That is quite significant; it is quite a major scheme. In addition, the Queensland state government has identified that the area could grow 1,000 hectares of sweet corn over a 42-week cycle. (Time expired) Telecommunications Towers",26
16,Mr FILING,AYES GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate today to speak on two issues I believe must be addressed by the government as a matter of priority. They are not issues just confined to my electorate of Moore, bLlt widespread. They affect thousands of Australians and are the source at present of enormous frustration and anger directed against the government. The first is in relation to telephone towers. I wish to speak today on the serious public concern and frustration that is growing across Australia in relation to the almost willy-nilly erection of mobile telephone towers. I know that many members on the governside are aware of the strength and size of these concerns throughout their electorates. Yet I am amazed at the lack of progress achieved by this government-that is coming on top of what the previous government didso far. I know that the national telecommunications code was the creation of the previous Labor government. Of course, a previous Labor minister initiated a national review in 1994 and then did not act until December 1995, and then only basically to make a promise to change things if that government was re-elected. This government has conducted its own review and acted, but what they are offering is a case of too little, too late. On 21 November last year I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), to inform the House as to why telecommunications carriers can build towers and roll out cable just about wherever they want to, often against the wishes of the local communities affected. The answer I received foreshadowed Minister Alston's review and subsequent announcements to affect telephone towers but promised some hope at the time. Let me refer to a specific case in point in my electorate. I have been closely involved with residents in the northern suburbs of and the Wanneroo City Council in trying to establish sensible controls over the siting of mobile telephone towers. In the MindarieOcean Reef area, Optus had sought to establish a tower immediately adjacent to a local private school. I represented the residents association to Optus, requesting that an alternative site be utilised. I did not ever contend that the tower should not be built in the area, but rather that the location was unsuitable and that alternative sites were available-in parts of public open space and the Tamala Park refuse centre site, well away from residential habitation or schools. Optus took the view that these sites were technically inferior and, since they were not obliged to comply with councilor residents' recommendations, the school site was where the tower would go. Why were these residents concerned? They are not troglodytes opposed to the progress of technology. Rather they have genuine concerns about possible health risks related to locating these transmitters close to schools or residenask tial property while doubts exist about them. Dr Peter French, a respected cell biologist from St Vincent's Hospital, said on the 7.30 Report that he had found: . .. when we expose cells to a mobile phone frequency that the cells alter their cell shape, they increase their rate of cell growth and also they change their secretory properties. :rhe changes that we are talking about are very Important. They relate to very important basic cell functions and, therefore, there is a need to be aware of this and, therefore, to approach the use of mobile phones with some caution. His research is not unique in its findings. Te1stra acknowledge that there are pockets of research which show there are questions and more work to be done but that there is no evidence to show that radiation from the phone is unsafe. Their advice reminds me of recent denials by tobacco companies before US Congressional hearings where vested financial interests still manages to deny health risks associated with another lifestyle habit. The minister announced his review on 3 December 1996. He went further to announce Perth the details-one of which might compel carriers to co-locate transmission sites--{)n 23 December, with them to come into effect on 1 January 1997. Optus acted to erect its tower immediately after this announcement and before the new code came into effect. This school at Mindarie now has a previously extant Telstra tower behind it and an Optus tower beside it. I know that many members own and use mobile phones and will recognise that signal strength is often a problem. Not in this school: the transmission power reading blasts to full constantly 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fortunately, the children are there only five days a week and of course only during school terms. I know that some people have been content to say that we have no proven risks of these transmissions, but if we want to introduce a new drug or food or medical device that might irradiate the body one must first prove its safety, not rely on the public to prove its dangers before it can be approved for use. I the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) to stand up in this House and personally vouch to the safety of these devices to the electorate. If not, why are we allowing unfettered siting of these telecommunication towers? What will the liability be to the Commonwealth if we do not act to protect the public in the absence safety? There is another aspect These companies have been granted powers that give them enormous financial advantage and distort market economics. All other businesses must comply with planning requirements by councilor state authorities. These carriers are able to ignore councils and they ignore such requirements, and successive governments have allowed the situation to continue. I contend that these companies are being allowed to operate outside the government's own competition policy by virtue of their favoured status, which I believe must be remedied. It is clear to me that the regime relating to the siting of telecommunication towers has more to do with the sale of Telstra than it has to do with anything else. In fact, one does not have to be an absolute genius to work out that, in the absence of this unfettered ability to site telecommunication towers wherever they want to, the realisable asset value of a telecommunications carrier would be diminished. I also want to point out that the school I used in my illustration is a non-government school where parents pay fees for the education of their children. This school operates as a small business in the marketplace, competing for the delivery of its educational services. I am advised that the parents are now making arrangements to remove their children from the school and find other educational arrangements because of the uncertainty as to the safety of mobile telephone towers. Here we have another instance where the lack of a forthright approach to competition policy is affecting another small business-in this case, a non-government school.",27

The following order shall be observed in considering a bill in detail: I. Clauses as printed and new clauses, in their numerical order. 2. Schedules as printed and new schedules, in their numerical order. 3. Postponed clauses (not having been specially postponed until after certain other clauses). 4. Preamble. 5. Title. Provided that(a) in considering an Appropriation or Supply Bill, any schedule expressing the services for which the appropriation is to be made shall be considered before the clauses and, unless the House otherwise orders, that schedule shall be considered by proposed expenditures in the order in which they are shown; (b) in considering a bill to impose taxation, any schedule shall be considered before the clauses; and (c) in considering an amending bill, the schedules shall be considered in their numerical order before the clauses. When such a schedule is considered, items within the schedule shall be considered in their numerical order. Consecutive items which amend the same section of an Act shall, unless the House otherwise orders, be considered together. For the purpose of this paragraph an amending bill is one whose principal purpose is to amend an existing Act or Acts. In reconsidering any bill the order set out above shall be followed. Standing order 65 (Member not to speak twice): Add at the end: ""or consideration of amendments to a bill made or requested by the Senate."" (3) Standing order 68 (reply closes debate): Add at the end: ""or consideration of amendments to a bill made or requested by the Senate."" (4) Standing order 86 (matters not open to debate): Omit paragraph 0). (5) Standing order 232 (motions need not be seconded): After ""detail"" insert "",or during consideration amendments to a bill made or requested by the Senate,"". The proposed amendment to standing order 226 results from a recommendation of the Procedure Committee last year. I want to place on record the government's thanks to the committee for the work that it has done. In respect of three of the technical changes, the government has also had the advice of the Clerk of the House. I also want to record our thanks for his advice on those matters. As a preliminary comment, we have also had discussions and briefed the opposition party on the proposals. I understand that generally they are supportive of them. Standing order 226 sets out the order in which bills should be considered in the consideration in detail stage. For new bills the order remains the same as always, that is, clauses first separately, then any schedules and other matter such as the title or preamble. For bills which amend other acts, the amendment changes the order to allow the House to consider first the schedules, considering each item in the schedules separately, if it wishes, then the clauses and other matter. This retlects a change in the format of these bills. They now contain the substantive amendments in the schedules rather than in the clauses. The committee felt that the House's capacity to examine amending legislation and members' traditional right to debate and vote on amendments separately should be upheld. The government concurs in this view and has proposed this amendment to enshrine the right of members to deal with issues individually when they are contained in schedules, just as they have always been able to do in respect of issues contained in clauses. Of course, the House, by leave, will still be able to consider schedules as a whole or the entire bill as a whole in the same way as it does with new bills. The amendment to the standing order also provides that consecutive items within a schedule which amend the same section of an act will be considered together. In essence, the amendment provides that the items within the schedules of amending bills are dealt with of in the same way as the clauses of bills traditionally have been and still will be for new bills. In a nutshell, the amendment to the standing orders simply retlects the fact that the manner of drafting of legislation as it comes before the House has changed. We are simply changing the standing orders to meet that fact. We have relied on close examination of the issues by the Procedure Committee. There are four other technical amendments which are proposed for the House's consideration. They are machinery amendments and come as a result of the advice that we have had. In respect of standing orders 65, 68 and 232, these amendments are intended to clarify the application of certain rules of debate which apply during the consideration in detail stage of bills to the consideration of Senate amendments and requests. These rules are the ability to speak more than once - standing orders 65 and 68-and the waiver of the requirement for a seconder, which is standing order 232. The amendments do retlect the current practice and I do not believe, therefore, that they contain any matter of controversy or contention. In respect of standing order 86, 'Matters not open to debate', this amendment removes a reference to cognate debates which is no longer meaningful since the omission of standing order 217C on 1 May 1996 and the return to informal arrangements for cognate debates which currently apply. As I said, we have had consultation on these matters with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). I would hope that these amendments have the support of all members of the House. Just looking forward very brietly, we have also had some discussions with the opposition parties on another matter with regard to the standing orders. That relates to the conduct of the counting of divisions. We have some ongoing discussions about that. I would be happy to brief the Independent members on those discussions. We, essentially, are looking forward to a proposition of picking up some parts of the Procedure Committee report in respect of consecutive divisions and to adopt a proposal of an extra couple of counters on the government side for the first division so as to reduce the time involved in counting. Again, on those matters we will continue to consult. I commend the motion to the House.",29
19,Mr CREAN,STANDING ORDERS,"The opposition does support this motion and the amendments to the standing orders. I, too, would like to place on record the opposition's appreciation of the work of the Procedure Committee in recommending the changes to standing order 226. This is the circumstance of the parliament taking up those recommendations and it reflects the changed circumstances by way of presentation of bills, as has been outlined by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). I also indicate that we accept the sensible suggestions made by the clerks in relation to other housekeeping measures, those contained in the other standing orders mentioned-65, 68, 232 and 86. We look forward to further discussions with the Leader of the House on those other matters he has alluded to.",31
20,Mr FILING,STANDING ORDERS,"I only wish to briefly ask the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) if he would not mind responding to what the briefing in relation to the matters he raised at the end of his presentation will consist of and whether there is any opportunity for an input. There was a meeting before Christmas of which I was alerted, but we were excluded from that. There was no representation for Independent members at that particular meeting. That was between the government and the opposition party. There is no such thing as opposition parties, I might point out to him. We are not an opposition. We are non-government but certainly not an opposition party. Therefore, his use of 'opposition parties' now twice in the House not only is incorrect but may actually mislead members of the public into thinking that there is more than one opposition party when in fact it is only the Labor Party.",31
21,Mr REITH,STANDING ORDERS,"On indulgence, there is no sense of exclusion of anybody. The Procedure Committee had a report. We had a preliminary discussion with the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) and a couple of his colleagues just to get a sense of their views about where we might go in the proper handling of the matter. In the party room of the government parties this week I was given authority to further discuss how we might sensibly come to a more efficient means of counting the vote. As to the briefing, I am simply saying to you that if you would like to have a chat about it I will give you the benefit of our thinking on it. At that time. I am sure you can input your views. As to the opportunity for people to express their opinion, the member might appreciate that we do have a Procedure Committee. It is a formal process, and that is the formal opportunity for people to express their opinions. The committee actually called for submissions on it. Perhaps you made a submission or some other members of your 'non-party' made a submission. It is an open book. I would be more than happy to talk with the member about it, and I am inviting him. I am not inviting him to make a big song and dance about it, but just to have a chat. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 February, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time.",31
22,Mrs JOHNSTON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Canning) 01.14 a.m.)The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a major change in the way in which Australia will present and run its finances. It fulfils an important election promise made by the coalition to ensure that our national accounts are presented in a fair and honest manner. It guarantees that all Australians can be in no doubt as to their nation's fiscal situation. An important part of last year's budget was the announcement of a charter of budget honesty. This bill requires departmental heads of Treasury and Finance to sign off on an economic and fiscal outlook within 10 days of a federal election being called. It will not be interfered with by self-interested politicians keen to hold on to government. Instead, independent and responsible government officials will ensure that the process is not tainted by party politics. Many members in this place will remember that on 21 December 1995 the then Labor government released a mid-year review of the 1995-96 financial year, which predicted a budget surplus. In good faith, this coalition made its election promises on the understanding that the budget would be in surplus. I will not repeat today the comments made earlier by the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) as to how the former government repeatedly deceived the Australian people during the election campaign. We all know that they left us with a $10 billion black hole. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in his budget speech, 'We could not stand back and ignore the problem. Although we did not create it, we will take the responsibility it.' This bill will ensure that the Australian people are never again deceived in such a dreadful way. Political parties will not be able to get away with saying that they cannot keep their promises because they did not know how bad the nation's books were. In this bill such problems are addressed, and I believe it will go a long way to restoring some of the faith that the Australian people have lost in members of this place. The Australian people will know the full account of the nation's books before they go to the polls and cast their votes accordingly in future. The charter of budget honesty shows this government's strong commitment to responsible and accountable government. Indeed, we need to rebuild trust in government after the previous Labor government's deceit. Our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that, to build trust in government, we must start with economic honesty where people can have an honest account of the state of the nation's finances and the plans the government has for the future. This bill is a practical gesture towards the broader goal of rebuilding confidence in the annual accounting process and, indeed, in government itself. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill will focus on three important areas: firstly, it will clearly separate the recurrent and capital sides of the budget; secondly, it will establish benchmarks against which fiscal policies can be assessed; and, thirdly, it will seek to achieve prudent public debt levels and the more appropriate balance between operating revenue and operating expenditure. The need for such arrangements has already been supported by the National Commission of Audit and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. All of what I have said may sound slightly technical, but it basically means telling the truth to the Australian people. Last week the Treasurer announced the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook prepared in accordance with the charter of budget honesty, although this legislation has not yet been enacted. This review provides updated information on the forward estimates and to fix economic outlook and includes information never before reported on fiscal risks and contingent liabilities. The outlook also contains a statement of risks, which sets out a comprehensive list of factors that could impact on the government's fiscal position. These factors include policy reviews under way, possible Senate rejection of the budget measures, litigation and contingent liabilities. As the Treasurer noted, the statement of risk represents the first time an Australian government has completed a list of such factors and represents a milestone in the improved disclosure of information by governments. I am very proud to be able to speak on this bill today. I am also very proud to be a member of a government which made a commitment to more honesty in government and is now delivering it. The strategy adopted in this bill will allow this government when next going to the polls to look voters in the eye and say, 'Here are our commitments and here is how we are going to pay for them,' in the full knowledge that we can indeed pay for them. There will be no mysterious deficits, need for smoke and mirrors and no excuses for not being able to fill our promises. Previously speakers from the opposite side of the House seem to have mysteriously forgotten that it was they who conveniently neglected to tell us that the books showed the nation was in deficit. How could they have campaigned telling people that the books were okay, that they had done a good job that things were as good as they were ever going to get? Thankfully, the Australian people did not listen to Labor and threw them out of office. Since being elected as the member for Canning, I have had many people write or phone me and just stop me in the streets tell me what a good job they think John time Howard and the government are doing, particularly after the budget was delivered. Some members opposite said yesterday that we deceived the Australian people. But I can tell them that that is not how the people it. They see Labor's $10 billion deficit and they know we have to clean it up. People know we just cannot keep on borrowing forever and a day and send the bill to some mysterious tomorrow. They voted for us in because they were sick and tired of irresponesty. sible financial management. One constituent recently wrote to me and said: May I take this opportunity to say how impressed I am by the integrity you and your government contributing towards the federal politics of our country and to wish you every success in efforts to overcome the problems in so many that were handed to you by the previous governsay ment. I think that just about sums it up. When receive letters such as that, I know that are on the right track. I applaud the Treasurer for introducing this Charter of Budget Honthe esty Bill and I commend it to the House.",31
23,Mrs CROSIO,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Prospect) (11.22 a.m.)The first thing I would like to say about the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 before the House is, 'Thank goodness it's finally here. Thank goodness the government has now decided to do something about it.' It means that once this debate is finally out of the way we on this side of the House will not have to listen to the government members go no on about their so-called charter of budget honesty as if they were the most virtuous bunch of politicians ever to occupy the government benches, as if they were the first to ever initiate any sort of regime of fiscal disclosure, as if Labor had not put in the hard that yards on budget transparency years before them while in government and which they have now used as the springboard for this and piece of legislation we are debating today. On its charter of budget honesty, I believe for too long this government has played the errant schoolboy, bragging to his mates about his Saturday night exploits until everyone has started thinking that he is all talk and no action. The government has talked about it, to bragged about it and spent a little bit more boasting about it, but it never really did anything about it. We were beginning to wonder. I for one am glad it is here because, as I said, I am frankly sick to death of hearing about it. I am glad it is here because it see gives those of us on the opposition side participating in the debate an opportunity to refute some of the garbage, smears and innuendo we have heard spewing from the government benches concerning Labor's term office and our own level of budgetary honIt also provides us with an opportunity to offer some constructive criticism of the bill in the process. The question of a charter of budget honesty are raises some interesting issues. It is a matter your worthy of some serious and thoughtful deareas bate-something which some critics would is not a frequent occurrence in this chamber. It is certainly something that we have not I been hearing from the majority of government we members during this debate on this bill. Rather than focus on the inner workings of bill, rather than take a closer look at what the charter actually hopes to achieve and whether it will do its job properly in its present state, the crux of their argument has been little more than an unwise and unwarranted attack on the previous government's record. I would have liked to have spent my entire 20 minutes concentrating on the former, but I cannot let the latter go unaddressed. The last election campaign featured a concerted effort by the coalition to discredit Labor over what it unjustly portrayed as an attempt to deceive the Australian people by refusing to provide forward estimates for revenue and the budget during the campaign--opening up the books, so to speak. It was an election, and all is fair in love and war, but the arguments we presented in government were sound then and they are sound now, and we do not resile from them a year later. In fact-and this is a point that our friends on the other side might like to try to forget-our arguments were so sound they were even used by the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) 13 years beforehand. I would like to jog the memories of the government members now. What did the member for Bennelong have to say as Treasurer in 1983 when he was questioned by journalists as to whether he intended opening up the books to provide a 'guesstimate', based on a set of wobbly numbers from the Treasury department, of the next financial year's budget deficit? Let me quote him directly from a press conference that he gave on 21 February 1983. Admittedly he was only Treasurer then and he is now Prime Minister, but he said: I can't put it more firmly than some estimates because the nature of calculating these things is such that you really don't know until much closer to the event precisely where revenue and expenditure are going to go . . . He went on: Let me point out that this time last year when the Government got its first look at the likely shape the 1982/83 budget it appeared on the basis of calculations then that our deficit position would a great deal better than what it ultimately turned out to be and the estimates of revenue which made certain assumptions about wages growth and certain assumptions about activity growth were much more buoyant. I genuinely believe that it's impossible go hard on the size of next year's deficit ... This was a message he repeated time and time again during this period. On 8 April 1983, the Financial Review reported that Mr HOWARD then Treasurer of this country, the member for Bennelong-speaking on ABC radio warned 'that the forward projections were unreliable as in the space of only a few months there could be substantial changes in both the economic outlook and the budget situation'. Yet he and those speakers on the government side deny the same right of explanation to us. I dredge up the past solely for the purpose of teaching some of our newer members on the government side and some of their more experienced colleagues, who should know better, that it always pays to tell the truth. In relation to their attempt to besmirch the Labor Party's record on providing full and complete budget honesty, they have not been telling the truth. If they had been telling the truth, they would have admitted that Labor in government followed established practice in not releasing forward estimates for revenue or the budget in the middle of a financial year-a practice laid down by our predecessors and followed by our current Prime Minister. If the government members wish to try to tarnish our record in this regard and attack our reasonable refusal during the election campaign to gaze into that economic crystal ball for their own cheap political benefit, they should remember they are attacking the actions and justifications of their own leader in the process. As for the Prime Minister's attempts to castigate and crucify Labor on this matter, just as it will forevermore, his past comes back to haunt him. Let us have by all means a charter of budget honesty. Let us see if we can make things even more transparent and open without the pitfalls, but let us not have any of the hypocrisy from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or any of the other governof ment members. Let us not have them criticising the former government's actions when be they themselves were quite prepared to use that same explanation when last in office. I believe Labor has a proud history of promoting budget transparency, which is to second to none in this country. Early in our previous period in office we introduced forward estimates for outlays for three years ahead of the budget year. Later on we introduced forward estimates of revenue, which meant we also initiated forward estimates of the budget outcome. These estimates were updated at budget time every year. It was Labor that introduced the mid-year review of the budget. It was Labor that published the annual tax expenditure statement, significantly improved budget papers and attached financial impact statements to all explanatory material for new legislation with the aim of facilitating a clearer public understanding of the budget process. No other government in our history ever made such a concerted effort to provide the Australian people with the same degree of budget information as the former Labor government. That is not fantasy; that is fact. So let us have no more of the absolute claptrap about how this government is the first to ever think of making the budget process more transparent. The charter of budget honesty could be a step in the right direction, but it is a step following many taken by us between 1983 and 1996. I wish to make one final point before I tum to the bill itself. I am not a masochist, but in one respect I take great joy in hearing the government members crowing about this bill. I enjoy it because to me it is a sign of the hubris which is already starting to spread through the government's ranks, eating its away along its benches, starting at the front and working its way to the back. The Prime Minister has tried so hard in advising his pack of young and inexperienced charges to avoid such pitfalls, but I encourage them to do go on. The government is so proud of this bill and the levels of honesty which it supposedly represents that it thinks it can ignore the fact that the road behind it, not yet even 12 months long, is littered with its broken promises, examples of its dishonesty, and its wholesale betrayal of the Australian public in relation to its discarded election commitments. The longer the hubris does go on, the longer the members opposite ignore their budget dishonesty and try to stake the high moral ground, puffing themselves up with the same sort of self-important pride we see in the Treasurer whenever he enters this House, the sooner the Australian public will become wise to their act and the sooner they will send this government packing-and I, for one, certainly am all in favour of that. Forget budget honesty for a moment; let us talk about budget dishonesty. How many budget promises have the government now broken? How many election commitments have they transgressed? I will tell the House: $17 billion worth of broken promises at last count, and the government is only 11 months old. When in opposition you said that you would not touch universities. You set about them with a carving knife. I think the promise was 'to maintain the level of Commonwealth funding to universities in tenns of operating grants'. Now, following the cuts announced both before and in the budget, $2 billion will be cut from universities over the next four years. You also said you would not touch child care, yet you set about it with a sledgehammer. The promises here, if my memory serves me correctly, involved maintaining a non-means tested child-care cash rebate, maintaining the system of child-care assistance and maintaining operational subsidies. None of these commitments have been kept. The government also said they would maintain the social security safety net, and then they got out the scissors, breaking promises regarding everything from the earnings credit scheme to rent assistance. I could go on and on but I merely want to remind members opposite of what they have to be proud about when it comes to their so called budget honesty. The answer, of course, is a big, fat zero. Let us now tum to the make-up of the charter itself. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has already stated on our behalf, we support the government in introducing its charter of budget honesty, but this support is qualified by a number of amendments being made to this bill to make it substantially tighter. In my own opinion, perhaps the biggest hole in the bill is found in clause 3(2), which states: Nothing in the Charter of Budget Honesty creates rights or duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings. That is interesting, isn't it? We can pass this bill, the government can carry on with all of its hoopla and circuses about how wonderful it is and how concerned it is with financial probity and honesty, but if-heaven forbid-it chooses not to live up to the demands it is placing on itself, if it chooses not to meet all the requirements laid down by this bill, then there is nothing to be done, through either the courts or any administrative appeals tribunal, to force the publication of any of its financial and budgetary reports. What is to be done? Do we merely take the government at its word when it promises to disclose the relevant information? Let me answer that with another question: if we are now in the fashion of taking political parties at their word, why did the government need to introduce the Flags Amendment Bill last year? Both of the major parties plus, if I remember correctly, the minor parties in the Senate all stated quite publicly and without reservation that they would not involve themselves in any change of the flag which did not involve a direct vote by the Australian people. Yet these words were not good enough for the government. They legislated to ensure that no party could break their word in the future, which brings us back to the charter. If we did not take the word of politicians six months ago, what has changed now? If the government wants to be consistent, if it wants to raise the bar that much higher or, perhaps more importantly, if it wants the Australian public to really believe it means business with this charter, the legislation should be amended, in my opinion, so as to allow judicial force to ensure the publication of all of the relevant budgetary and financial reports, including pre-election reports and policy costings. Anything less, I think, can be read as a lack of determination on the government's part to provide the strongest legislation possible. This brings us to another flaw in the bill. The previous hole could perhaps, if we were charitable, be put down to legislative oversight. It often happens when bills are being prepared. Yet the bill's faults as they relate pre-election reports and policy costings, especially as applied to the opposition, appear less of an innocent mistake and more of a sly attempt to slip one through under the noses of the public and the present opposition. What we have here is the equivalent of a legislative hidey hole which really portrays the coalition as being more concerned about keeping power come the next election than about being genuinely open about the nation's budgetary position. For example, if the bill were passed in its current state, costings of opposition policies could be undertaken only at the discretion of the Prime Minister, and there is no provision in this bill before the House to obligate the Prime Minister to initiate such costings. Quite obviously, this is an unbalanced and unacceptable situation which is clearly advantageous to the incumbent government. Just as I would suggest that an amendment needs to be made to the legislation which would allow the judicial enforcement of the government to release its budgetary forecasts, I also think there should be an amendment which obliges the Prime Minister to refer any request for the costings of promises by the Leader of the Opposition. Another inadequacy of the bill is that it seeks to allow only the costings of previously announced opposition policies. This would result in a situation where policy decisions would have to be made on the basis of incomplete information and be announced irrespective of the costs. Again this is a situation which may be to the government's advantage but which really cripples the opposition. Let me turn elsewhere. What about the failure of the bill to provide for a forecast of national savings? If there is one subject which the Prime Minister and his Treasurer like to lecture this parliament about it is the importance of national savings, yet here we are faced with this great watermark of the Howard government's first term in office and there is nothing in it which refers to national savings. Again I ask the question: why? We have had the Prime Minister and the Treasurer congratulate themselves on their Commission of Audit, yet in some respects this bill provides for even less accountability to than that recommended by the same commission. Again I question: why? We had Mr Costello in opposition demand of the Labor government that the economic forecasts in the 1995-96 budget be prepared without any political intervention and that they were to be certified by the Secretary to the Treasury. Yet the government has now only deemed this arrangement necessary for the pre-election statement-not the budget nor the mid-year review. Why the change of heart? Why is the Treasurer not prepared to submit himself to the same level of honesty that he demanded of us when he was in opposition? These failures reflect-or more to the point cast serious doubts---{)n the government's own desire to provide complete and honest details about its financial management. It all smacks of that sinner's old line, 'Oh Lord, make me pure, but not just yet.' A line which I know is a favourite of the Treasurer. It shines a light on all the rhetoric, does it not? The government talks the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk they are all a little bit more reluctant; they are a little bit more backward. The government is using the smoke and the mirrors to make itself look like it is the on the white charger when it comes to budget honesty. But really when you take all that away the government is looking a bit like Don Quixote stretched out on his exhausted horse. As the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) mentioned earlier in his speech in this House, if you strip away the rhetoric and the hyperbole, what you have is a modest bill. I would go one step further and say that not only is it a modest bill but in its current state it is a flawed bill. If the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and all of those harping government speakers we have already heard in this debate want to actually back up their words now with some real action, and if they want to. do more than just fool the Australian people into thinking that they are introducing a watertight system of budget honesty, they would take our suggested amendments on board and make some radical changes. Until they do, this bill in its present form-even though we support the intent-deserves little more than our criticism of it. I do not commend the bill in its present form to the House. I believe we should sit down, redraft it, include those areas of concern which have been raised and allow those amendments to be made. What we will then have is a genuine piece of legislation that will meet the commitments and rhetoric given during the campaign. More importantly, it will be a piece of legislation that will stand up to all courts.",33
24,Mr TUCKEY,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"In her presentation on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) reminded me of the old Labor adage-and I might not have it completely right-that you never apologise, never resign and never admit you were wrong. I would like to test that against recent history. Notwithstanding her protestations, the reality of new the last election and the budget figures was that those figures were available to the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as Minister for Finance. They were available to the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and that was proven by the fact that they were published by the current Treasurer (Mr Costello) knight within days of our achieving office. The reality was that we were not talking about some projections or anything else. The figures were there. It is clear that the leaders of the government at the time could not have failed to have been aware of the situation. They were pressed throughout the election and of course declined to comment. That is what this bill is about. I remind the member for Prospect that, as I am advised, the bill also requires the secretaries to the Treasury and Department of Finance to release a pre-election report that will provide updated fiscal and economic projections. In addition, the bill requires that the secretaries to the Treasury and Department of Finance cost and publicly release the fiscal impact of announced election commitments as requested by the government or the opposition. That is what the bill is about. It is giving an independent responsibility to public servants to advise the Australian people and is consequently putting that sort of obligation on politicians. I am advised that the charter will require governments to outline how they will reverse stimulatory fiscal measures adopted to dampen an economic downturn. This will improve fiscal discipline by ensuring that governments are committed to unwinding fiscal stimulus measures later in the economic cycle, and I want to return to that point. Initially I want to quote a bit of history. We are talking about fiscal management. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to consi-er the history of those years when AustralIa was almost entirely managed at state and federal level by the Labor Party. I can start with my state of Western Australia and WA Inc. WA Inc. was about such funny little deals as buying a petrochemical project that was not even in the advanced planning stages and, as far as I can establish, whose total asset was a block of land which had· been bought from the government for very little money. The Labor government of Western Australia under a Premier called Dowding bought it for $450 million. Then, surprise, surprise, the partners had to share it out in the fonn of $350 million to equal partners and $100 million for the other. They bought blue sky. I can still hear that Premier saying on the radio, 'This is a great opportunity for Western Australia.' If it was, why not take the block next door and start from scratch for $10 million? We know why. The $350 million was needed to bailout Rothwells Bank which owed all its money to the trade union movement and the Catholic church. Then there was the bailout of Robert Holmes a Court. The state government insurance commission had net assets of $64 million and paid him $800 million for assets that were eventually disposed of after, no doubt, the huge addition of interest charges for $400 million. If we aggregate those two bits of economic management, we find they are equal to the proceeds that the Court government got by selling the then State Bank, which we knew as the R&I and is now called Bankwest. I approve of the privatisation of the bank, but I am devastated to think that all we got out of the sale was the repayment of the debts associated-and not all the debts associated if we add interest-with those two agreements. The lady who now sits on the opposition front bench in her former role as Premier borrowed $1,000 million a year to fund such activities as repainting our schools. That was the level of economic management that we had in Western Australia-corrupt, dishonest and incapable management. Then we cross the border into South Australia. What did we achieve there? The South Australian economy was devastated because of the Bannon era. If he put as much time into checking the books of the State Bank as he did jogging, South Australians might have a future. There is a huge task facing that state. I sincerely hope that some of these forthcoming resource projects might drag them out of the economic morass that they were delivered under Bannon and his Labor colleagues. Let us cross the border into Victoria. You know what we used to say about Victoria? What is the capital of ViCtoria-$2? That is where they were under Cain and Kirner. I made the passing remark when they had that strike on the trams, because they were probably the last remaining people in the world to employ tram conductors. I have been to a lot of Third World countries where they learnt not to do so. The workers went and welded the trams to the rails. They thought that was a protest. I said, 'No, it was to stop their Japanese owners repossessing them.' The response of Cain and Kirner to massive losses in public transport was to sell off the assets to pay the debt. In fact, it was to pay the wages, which is worse because they created the debt which I understand was costing something like $800 million a year to service. It had nothing to do with achieving the efficiencies of privatisation. Just go and find some money anywhere-debt led recoverers. I have said-and I think it was pretty right-that their public transport system under their administration was losing so much money that it would have been cheaper to buy all regular commuters one motor car each and let them drive to work. That was the cost. You cannot do that. I find in the press today that under a Liberal administration Victoria have a $2.4 billion surplus in their budget. Yes, it was substantially achieved by asset sales. When people raise this question of asset sales and the fact that public assets are going off, I remind them that technically they were all sold under Labor. They were so heavily mortgaged in the commercial sense that they had to be sold to put the economies of our states back on a reasonable footing. I can keep going around the states. For a large part of that period, there was a coalition administration in New South Wales. Interestingly, with a Labor administration there now I read in the paper today that their first-ever budget has blown out already. It is in very bad shape. Let us cross the border into Queensland. Whatever you thought of him, old Joh left them with so much money in hollow logs that it was not funny. Mr Goss went through two terms of office clearing everyone of those hollow logs out to the extent of sequestering the real estate industry's privately established malpractice fund of about $160 million. They took it into government revenues, spent it and gave the people of Queensland a government guarantee. In other words, the next time-and we hope it never happens again-that a major real estate crash occurs, the taxpayers of Queensland will pay the bill. That industry had provided for itself. Then we get to Canberra. We just heard the member for Prospect talk about 'bringing home the bacon' . You can remember all the rhetoric about these brilliant budgets, but, when you rule off the economic bottom line at the defeat of the Hawke-Keating Labor government regime, you find that the debts of the Australian government-not the nation but the Australian government-grew in that period from about $20 billion to $100 billion. During that process public debt interest, as identified in the budget, reached about $10,000 million. The spokesperson from the other side who is in the House at the moment, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who speaks of her concerns about child care should make a few simple comparisons as to where the money is going. We spent $11,000 million on education and we inherited $10,000 million in interest. We spend less than $10,000 million on defence. She ought to stop and think about why that happens. In replying the other day to some people who wrote to me about education, I raised the issue of Medicare. I know how popular Medicare is, but I want to remind the House of what it is doing to expenditures in other areas. Pre-Medicare, federal outlays on defence were about $4 billion, federal outlays on education were about $31f2 billion, and federal outlays on health were about $3 billion. What are the figures today? Federal outlays on health are over $19 billion; federal outlays on education, which I have just mentioned, are $11 billion; and federal outlays on defence are $10 billion. I made the point in a letter to the editor the other day that, when the cuckoo gets in the nest, all the other chicks starve. Mr MCLachlan-Kick them out.",37
25,Mr TUCKEY,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Yes. The cuckoo is Medicare; the cuckoos are the people who dreamt up a scheme that is now taking nearly 20 per cent of the federal budget and delivering less by way of services than was ever achieved and supplied under past arrangements-the queues, the people in the corridors, twice the money for half the output. In economic terms that is a disaster. That is the achievement of the previous government. The bottom line is $80,000 million of additional debt. I have referred to it over the years as a policy of 'Let the children pay'. It cannot go on. I have drawn it to the attention of people, and senior economists say to me, 'Well, there's not really that relationship.' But the reality is that government deficits under Labor, expressed as a percentage of GDP, nearly every year equated to economic growth in Australia. We got all this garbage about, 'Oh, of course, we don't affect the foreign debt,' which, of course, at the end of their regime stood at about $200,000 million. They borrowed an additional $80,000 million out of domestic markets, admittedly, but they have the gall, if not the stupidity, to stand up here and believe everything they say. I think this is one of their great problems. I think the member for Prospect actually believed everything she said-'It wasn't our fault. Don't blame us. You did it before us.' Two wrongs always make a right in Labor's view-as long as they can find something we did, even if they have to go back to Billy Hughes when he was a Liberal. The reality is that they stood up in this place and said that, if a government of Australia extracts an additional $80,000 million from domestic savings, it does not have an effect on our international debt. If at this moment $80,000 million rained into this room and the Treasurer picked it up, took it back and paid off the people who have lent us that money initially in the domestic market, does anyone suggest that our international debt would not fall by $80,000 million? Of course it would, if only because the savings were back here to be borrowed. When they sold their paper on the domestic market they did not even know who bought it. I can remember reading articles where waiters, restaurant workers of Singapore were buying Australian government paper. To sustain that level of borrowing we had to pay very high interest rates for it. The Singapore workers knew all about it; they could not do better with their money anywhere else. The reality is that every dollar borrowed has to be serviced by way of interest and debt repayment. Any government that pursues that policy does it with callous disregard for future generations. They must pay it back. Unfortunately, that payback will not always materialise in higher taxation or those sorts of charges. It will frequently materialise in lower living standards as the economy is unable to deliver to the people because of a rapacious government. You can have any level of public services you like, provided you have the guts to charge the public that demands or thinks they need them. When you provide those services through uneconomic procedures-in other words, you do not use the most efficient means of providing them-there is a massive waste of money in getting them to the people who need them. I am quite happy to stand up here and identify examples of that, including our funding of Aboriginal people. We have a budget line item of $1.3 billion and thatapparently after years, almost decades-has been unable to raise housing standards and health standards of remote area people. Why? Because a large proportion of it goes off to Canberra where there is no Aboriginal problem. That is just a simple example. I have given the effect that Medicare has had on all other levels of services. It is the cuckoo in the nest, and it will go on killing off the others, including the area of concern of the shadow minister. If you are going to put large amounts of money in that area, then you will take it away from somewhere else. That is a test for the Australian people. This document is starting to address those issues. Let me just touch on my major area of concern in all of this. There is a need for budget honesty and for political honesty. But, more importantly, that responsibility in many regards resides with both government and opposition. In opposition, the coalition first proposed the issue of privatisation. When the government eventually became converted to it because of its fiscal woes-not its philosophical understanding or its appreciation of the efficiencies that might be achieved just because it was going broke-did we stand up and deny our position? No, we supported the government. It was never an issue for the Senate. Of course, when it got to places like the Commonwealth Bank, it was the then Prime Minister's saviour in his own caucus. Had we wanted to be mischievous on that issue, it just would have got blown out of the Labor Party's own areas. We stood on those issues. Why? Because we believed that they were in the national interest. It did not matter what the Labor Party stood for in government. In opposition, it stands for one thing and one thing only: political opportunism. We saw time wasted this morning on the most specious of issues-as though it would matter whether somebody was told before or after Christmas. The realities are that we now have some very pressing issues confronting the Australian people. One of those comes back to this budget honesty, that is, our tax policy. It is clear-and it has been proven in a previous election-that, if people want to go out there and run a scare campaign on taxation, they will always succeed. But God save the economy, God save the ability of a government to properly service those in need when all its revenue options are cut off because of an outdated tax system. Why can't the members of the opposition chick recognise that and say, 'We have a bigger obligation than our own re-election'? Why can't we try to get together, which will be the only solution, and come up with a sensible tax system-not one that damages people? Why can't we get together and identify the best system and identify the difficulties that must be overcome in implementing it? Just give the Australian people a hand. The spokesman on Aboriginal affairs is still running around saying that we do not have to do anything serious about the Native Title Act, another invention of his party which is now a proven disaster with regard to the possibility of people getting jobs and the growth we need.

26,Ms MACKLIN,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Jagajaga) (12.01 p.m.)The problem with this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is that it does not go far enough. Any bill that purports to introduce a new charter of budget honesty, in my view, would need to include a commitment to describe the impact of changes in the budget on the living standards and the lives of all Australians. Of course, this bill does no such thing. It is impossible not to be overwhelmed by a deep sense of irony when attempting to couple this government's budget with the concept of 'honesty'. We have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who, before the election, repeatedly stressed that he would look after the weak and the vulnerable; that, whatever happened, they would not suffer. He wanted Australians to feel 'relaxed and comfortable' and he was for traditional families. But now, as Prime Minister, he has to live up to and be judged against these promises. And these are promises that we have already seen broken. In the first place, we have what I would have to say is a ludicrous attempt to define degrees of honesty. We have promises that mayor may not have to be kept, as expediency dictates, and then we have core promises. Core promises are what apparently this government really believes in and what the government really stands behind. One of the most fundamental of these core promises was the commitment to families. This was supposed to be delivered via the family tax initiative. But one thing that this government does not seem to understand is that Australian families are not the same in the 1990s as they were in the 1950s. Today we have a large number of single parent families. We have a great increase in the number of families where both parents work and we have a number of families where older children remain at home and are dependent for a much longer period as they seek higher and higher levels of education. But does the Prime Minister's core promise of the family tax initiative work equally and fairly for all types of Australian families? Does the budget work equitably and fairly for all types of Australian families? One thing that you would not be able to find from this budget is the answer to those questions. The second thing is that this bill will not require coming budgets to honestly compare the impact of the changes in the budgets and the cuts that we are apparently about to get in the coming budget. We will not be able to tell what the impact on different types of Australian families is going to be. In January this year we saw a study commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service which does give us a detailed appraisal of the impact of the budget on families. It is this sort of analysis that should be included in the federal budget so that everybody can understand who are the losers from the government's budget cuts. This bill should require the next Costello budget to tell us who the winners and losers are. We do not see any mention of that in this bill. The study that I referred to was commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Service and conducted by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research and the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research. What that study clearly showed is that the budget was not beneficial for most Australian families and, in fact, in clear contradiction of the Prime Minister's promise to look after the poor and vulnerable. It says that it: had a particularly negative impact on the poorest households ... The study found that, when the impact of the Budget measures on gross incomes, taxation, and access to subsidised community services (such as labour market programs and child care services) is taken into accountwe see the followingUnemployed households stand to lose approximately $38 per week. Households whose main income is Disability Wife pension stand to lose $21.50 per week. Households whose main income is Austudy stand to lose $15 per week. . Sole parent families stand to lose $10.70 per week. And the end result is that, on average, Australian households will be worse-off by approximately $7 per week in disposable income and subsidised services. You cannot find that anywhere in last year's budget papers. Mr Fitzgerald, the President the Australian Council of Social Service, explained further: Last year's budget measures, if fully implemented, will have a regressive impact overall-because people with the lowest incomes suffer the greatest proportionate reduction in purchasing power. poorest households stand to lose more than twice as much as the richest households-even beneficial effect of the Family Tax Initiative is taken into account. Households with disposable incomes (after tax and social security payments) of less than per week lose on average 2.2% ($5.40) of spending power. Many single pensioners and unemployed people wouldfall within this Households with disposable incomes of than $1,200 per week lose only 0.85% ($15.10) of their spending power. Mr Fitzgerald went on to say that this repayment search was commissioned before the parliachild-care ment considered all the budget proposals, it does not even take into account all of things that are going to happen. His final comment was that, if fully implemented, last budget will leave most Australian households worse off. Can it be that the Prime Minister and his cabinet are just not aware of the real impact of the budget on Australian families, especially those on low incomes-the real battlers in our society? Maybe it is so. Maybe it is the case that nobody in the government of the departments have bothered to look at the distributional impact of their budget. course, that work would show exactly what this work by the Australian Council of Social Service shows-the true impact of this budget on low income Australian families. Yesterday in the House we saw the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) scrambling or around in a fairly shamefaced way trying to account for her misleading of the House in the last session of the parliament. She still refuses to accept that the cuts to be made to child-care assistance mean that parents will have to pay considerably more for child care-if you take $500 million out of the child-care budget, somebody has to pay. These facts have been drawn to the minister's attention by parents and care providers. The figures they have prepared of clearly show that low income families face the greatest increases as a proportion of their incomes. That is the critical measure. This analysis should have been included in the budget papers so that all Australian families who need child care would be able to see The what the impact would be on their family budget. Of course, this budget is not going to after the require any such analysis. When I talk to people in my electorate of Jagajaga, I find a growing concern about the $200 hurt of budget cuts as they start to bite. I their would like to put on the record a couple of examples. One is a sole parent who is studygroup. ing part time at La Trobe University and more working part time. Her income is $350 a week, which consists of earnings from p-arttime work, the sole parent benefit, the family and an Austudy loan. After claiming assistance, her child-care fees are so currently $47.80 a week. In April 1997, when the the budget cuts come into play-the first round-the fees will increase to $55 a week, the out of her income of $350 a week. Another student from La Trobe University has just completed her diploma of education. She is a sole parent with two children, aged 4Y2 and three. In 1996 her child-care fee was $79 a week. It has increased to $111 - week. These are very serious increases and will have a major impact on the standard of living of and none those two residents. At a recent meeting with pensioners in Of West Heidelberg, the situation of those needing dental treatment was again raised. There is no doubt that the axing of the dental service was one of this budget's most callous measures. This cut effectively targeted the most disadvantaged in our community and, more than anything else, will make them second-class citizens. The fact that the axing of this program was roundly condemned by one of the Kennett government's senior ministers-the Victorian health ministershows just how low this government is prepared to stoop and how hypocritical its claim is that it purports to represent all of us. The government while in opposition said that it would not touch pensioner concessions, that the living standards of pensioners would be maintained. The complete abolition of the dental program is yet another example of budget dishonesty. Another example of the government's hypocrisy and lack of honesty about the budget relates to home and community care. The government supposedly supports home and community care. It made great fanfare at budget time about not cutting Labor's commitment to a six per cent real increase in home and community care funding. The only problem-a classic example of give with the one hand and take with the other-is that this government has imposed a 20 per cent user charge on home and community care services. Surely a charter of budget honesty could not sit comfortably with such a blatant misrepresentation of the truth. It is not only cruel and hypocritical but also silly policy, and it certainly does not represent budget honesty. Home care services such as Meals on Wheels enable older Australians to live comfortably in their own homes. Taking them away or making them un affordable by slapping on these economic rationalist style user charges will mean that people will have to stop using these services. The end result will be that people will be forced into nursing homes and acute care, which is much more distressing for older Australians and much more expensive for the community. We agree with budget honesty, but it has to be about the impact of budget cuts on Australian families and on older Australians. We want to know the real impact of these cuts on all the people they will affect. This bill no way to assisting Australians to understand the impact of the changes. Certainly we would be encouraging the government to go back and have another go to make sure that this time in this budget we will truly understand the impact of all these savage cuts on Australians.",41
27,Mr ENTSCH,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I rise today in support of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. I say at the beginning that this has to be one of the most refreshing pieces of legislation to come out of this House in recent times, but I find it rather distasteful as an Australian that we as a government are being forced to enact legislation which in effect enshrines honesty as part of the political process. Honesty should be inherent in everything we do as representatives of the Australian people. Indeed, it is unfortunate, to say the least, that truth has become a victim of what today is seen as political necessity. US Senator Hiram Johnson in 1917 is quoted as saying that in war the first casualty is truth. The same can possibly be said of what has come to pass in modem Australian politics, as perfected by the previous government-when elections come, the first casualty is the truth. Our predecessors in government turned that concept into an art form. A now retired senator even had the gall to enshrine the misleading of the Australian people for political gain in the title of his book, Whatever it takes. But just what did it take for the ALP to bring about the need for legislation such as this? What did it take for the Australian people to eventually develop enough cynicism about Labor promises to finally treat Labor's political manipulation with the contempt it deserved and toss them out on their collective ears? We have laws in place in this country that make it an offence for company directors to mislead their shareholders in financial matters. But never in corporate history has a board of directors tried to cover up a $10 billion deficit. That is what happened at last year's election when the leaders of the Labor Party, the then board of directors, tried to mislead their shareholders, the Australian people, to goes the tune of $10 billion. I repeat that-$lO billion. That is one followed by seven zerosprobably more zeroes than Group Captain Clive 'Killer' Caldwell saw during the three years of the last war that he was involved in. For such infamous deception in any other area of Australian life, criminal charges would be laid. But, in this case, the only penalty the nation can inflict on the perpetrators is annihiprovide lation at the ballot-box-which, fortunately for the future of Australia, proved to be the case for the Keating government. But the saddest aspect of all of this is that the level of government morality and accountability has been allowed to descend to such depths of contempt for the people and proper and moral government process that politicians currently rate the same as snake oil salesmen in public esteem. Is it any wonder, given the Labor doctrine of 'whatever it takes', that politicians in this country are now held in the low esteem that they are? Many of us coming into this job do so with the intent of serving the people with honour and honesty. Unfortunately, those on the other side of this House, who see themselves as the movers and shakers of what passes for modern Labor political doctrine, contemptuously attribute such attitudes to the height of naivety. I listened earlier to the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) criticising us for a whole range of cuts in various services. It is very difficult to preside over some of those cuts. But from a business perspective, if you expect to see money in the bank to do a particular job but when you go to the bank to start to write cheques are told that you are well and truly in overdraft and cannot draw on those cheques, you have to look for some other way of addressing the problem because, if you do not deal with it now, it will only continue to grow. This is one of the big problems we found when we got into government. There were a whole range of services mentioned-meals on wheels, aged care, disabled services and mental health-that we would all love to see a lot more money put into. I can assure you that in the electorate of Leichhardt one of the things we really need is regional services and infrastructure. Unfortunately, we have to sit hack a little and wait. That is unfortunate because we have been missing out for a long time. It is about time we got our fair share. But when the money has been squandered and we go into government hoping to rectify some of these problems and find such a massive deficit, it makes it almost impossible to the kind of service we would like to .. I can remember that, during the course of the previous campaign, we pushed very hard for the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to come clean and tell us what the financial situation was. We were continually reassured that everything was in order, that there was not a problem, that the figures and facts we were given were quite accurate. Of course, that is basically what we had to accept. We had no way of finding out if anything was different. So we had to base our budgets, our planning and our commitments on those figures that were available on the day. As I said earlier, $10 billion is a hell of a lot of money to have to find-in anybody's language-and it is just totally impossible to do that. That is very unfortunate. The cynicism of the Australian people continues to grow because they do not realise just how difficult it is. It is important to try to cover that sort of thing, and we all have to suffer the pain for it. It is important that we make sure that, in the future, we do not put governments in the same situation we found ourselves in on 2 March. One does not need too much intelligence to realise that the Australian voting public is heartily sick and tired of such deception. Those who desert the honest Aussie discipline of 'a fair go for all' will pay the penalty for diminished respect by being tossed into political oblivion. I would hope that this bill-the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill-is the start of a whole raft of bills that will see the uplifting of political morality and accountability to the people of this nation. It is also my hope that legislation from my government will also enshrine in law the concept of truth in political advertising as part of the healing process between the political process and the Australian people. We as a government have the intestinal fortitude to wear our accountability on our sleeve and to set the scene for the demise of political deception by enshrining in legislation the right of the Australian shareholders to know exactly what is the financial state of their company, Australia. With the passing of this bill, when the voting public goes to the polls for the next time, they will do so with the solemn assurance that the fiscal facts upon which they are basing their voting decision will be the truth and not a 'whatever it takes' bid to obtain power at any cost. It is contemptuous for any government to think that they can fool all of the people all of the time, but that is the contempt with which the Labor Party held the Australian people. Its record of broken promises, deceptions, untruths, illusory and creative national accounting have relegated the honour of this parliament to the depths from which it is now viewed by the Australian people. I for one take particular exception to being relegated to those depths, but it is with a real hope for the future that I gladly take part in the legislative process that will change these perceptions. Governments must be judged on their performance, not on perceptions and illusions created by deception. This bill will achieve that. With the secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance preparing a pre-election report which provides an up-to-date fiscal and economic outlook assessment, never again will political parties have the opportunity to attempt to deceive the Australian people to the massive extent that proved to be the case in 1996. Never again will the contemptuous 'whatever it takes' doctrine replace what should be and always should have been the basic precept of good government-the truth. Never again will truth be the first casualty of the election process.",43
28,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I wish to support in general terms the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. In doing so, I wish to clearly state that, from my point of view, honesty in the provision of budget information is something that the Labor Party wholeheartedly supports. I will tell you why. I think it is about a question of honesty, performance and a willingness to lay on the table for public consideration where the Australian economy is going. We really learnt the significance of that approach to government when the Labor Party was last elected to government in 1983. From a more public point of view, clearly the Australian community then knew what a bad state the Australian nation was in. The public indicators were issues that were clearly spoken about and debated in the lead-up to the election of March 1983. It was a debate going to the need to develop the concept of one nation. Australia was divided. It was a country of very low economic performance. There were things in the public indicators that really caused concern to the majority of the Australian electorate. They included, for example-this was the record of the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was the then Treasurer-prime interest rates of the order of 22.5 per cent, an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent and an inflation rate of over 10 per cent. In 1982, I might say in passing, the current Prime Minister, when last Treasurer, held the record for job losses in the manufacturing industry. Having said that, Australia was also confronted by a situation of what was, in essence, an industrial period of confrontation. That, in tum, resulted in low investment and very poor levels of economic growth. The real problem was that whilst those indicators, which are more publicly available, were known to the Australian public in March 1983, the Australian public then discovered after the election that the current Prime Minister had gone out of his way to conceal from the Australian electorate the real performance of his government. He was one of the prime movers in that government, as the Treasurer, on the question of the deficit. We have heard in recent months since the election of March last year questions of budget blow-outs, deficits and the need to face up to hard economic decisions, going to the need for cuts. I want to say in passing-this is why we very much support the thrust of this bill-that prior to the election in March 1983, the then Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, not only deliberately sought to deceive the Australian public but left the incoming Labor government with an absolute economic mess from the point of view of the budget. The deficit he left the Australian public with was of the order of 4.9 per cent of GDP. We have heard deficit figures quoted in the last 10 months or so of the order of $7 billion, $8 billion or $9 billion. In current terms, the deficit of 4.9 per cent that the Prime Minister left the Australian community with in March 1983 was no less than $24.5 billion in current dollar terms. That is what we inherited in March 1983. It is for that very reason that, as a result that experience, when in government over a period of 13 years, the Australian Labor Party moved to make the budget process and documents much more open and visible. We believe that the Australian community was entitled to know the real state of the economy so that they could make decisions in electoral terms on the basis of the performance of the then government. It is interesting to note that, despite the rhetoric, on a number of occasions since the election in March 1996, the Prime Minister has been forced to concede that the economy he inherited was, if anything, fairly rigorous in performance. We note from time to time in this day and age that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) likes to stand at the dispatch box and speak, for example, about what a great achievement they have now put in place on the inflation front. That achievement, in tum, is related to the hard decisions of the previous 13 years-the question of a decent wages policy. That is what it is all about. It goes back to March 1983-the concept of openness in government and the concept of one nation pulling together, which was a rejection of the divisiveness of the Fraser period of government from 1976 to 1983. I raise these issues because I believe that there ought to be a bit of honesty about the state of the economy as at March 1996. The dishonesty that has prevailed since March 1996 has really been about the current government misleading the Australian public prior to the election in March 1996 as to its real intentions if it won government. We have all been told time and time again by the government that the reason for the savage budget cuts is the so-called $8 billion black hole left by the outgoing Labor government in March 1996. I suggest to you that there is simply no foundation in either economic responsibility or political morality for that assertion. Moreover, the blow-out claim is not based on any excessive expenditure prior to March 1996; it is simply a prediction or guess about what would have happened in the future, especially with respect to economic growth rates. As you and I know, Mr Deputy of Speaker, those guesses constantly change, as the current Treasurer is currently finding with his black hole. There was no element of concealment before the election by the Labor government of a likely fall in growth rates and thus a higher starting deficit for 1996-97. They are the real facts. The problem is that, for their own short-term political reasons, in a most dishonest fashion the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have deliberately misled the Australian public since the election in March 1996 with respect to the real issues going to the performance of this economy. I also suggest that that was related to the fact that the coalition's pre-election promises amounted to something of the order of $6.8 billion over three years and were unfunded to the tune of a massive $4 billion, according to the finance department estimates at the time. The problem was that the government of the day was not interested in the real hard facts. It wanted to use the false, misleading and dishonest $8 billion black hole argument to blame Labor for the cuts that the coalition failed to come clean with prior to the election of March 1996. Just by way of interest, I might refer to some of those so-called promises that have now disappeared. It really goes to the crux of this debate-the question of honesty in government. Let us go to the ABC. The pledge was: we will maintain existing funding for the ABC. In respect of higher education, the pledge was: we will maintain the level of funding of operating grants to universities. Strangely, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, has forgotten that pledge. With respect to labour market programs-and I see one of the ministerial assistants in the House at the momentMr Abbott-Parliamentary secretary, if don't mind.",45
29,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The pledgeelection of last year. one that the parliamentary secretary, Mr Abbott, now seeks to run away from-was: we are going to maintain the expenditure on labour market programs in real terms. I do not consider a cut of $1.8 billion over four years in labour market program expenditure, with the serious impact it is having on regional Australia, to be the maintenance of that pledge to honesty and commitment. I tum to the issue of jobs in research development, the tax concession. The pledge was: changes to the syndicated research and development tax concession scheme guideMarch lines may well result in the drying up of of the few effective forms of venture capital available in Australia to fund development. They pledged to maintain support for research and development through the 150 per cent tax concession. I tum to regional development-and there are a lot of regional members on the other side of the House at the moment who, know, are worried about this so-called comelection mitment that has been broken and thrown out the window in a most dishonest fashion since the election last year. The pledge was: we will maintain funding for regional developit ment at $150 million over four years. now say that there is no constitutional role the Commonwealth in regional Australia. So much for that pledge. As for state and territory funding, we know what the Premiers' view of the Treasurer is the moment. The pledge was: a fixed share Commonwealth revenue which should be strategy revenue neutral. I tell you what: if I were the Treasurer, I would not want a friend like Premier of Victoria at the moment, who at Australian every available opportunity sticks the knife in election. the Treasurer's back because of his unwillingness to meet the pledges given to the Australhonesty-was Ian electorate prior to the last election. Finally, we will deal with the issue of taxation, again at the feet of Treasurer. The pledge was: there will be no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes under a coalition government. The Australian community has you very quickly seen through that so-called pledge-that statement of budget honesty given to the Australian electorate prior to the In essence, for those reasons I very much support the thrust of this bill. I also argue that it in essence continues the good work commenced by the previous Labor government because of our experiences of March 1983 and the deliberate and dishonest manner in which the then Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, failed to face up to his responsibilities to tell the Australian electorate the real and state of the economy prior to March 1983. More importantly-and he cannot point the finger at the Australian Labor Party as at 1996-he deliberately went out of his one way prior to March 1983 to hide the figures and failed to make them available to the research and Australian electorate. Today I also want to point to some of the dishonest actions and practices of this government in contrast to the statement of budget honesty it professes today. I particularly want to go to its budget forecasts and its policy on I jobs. The Prime Minister said before the that unemployment was the greatest single issue facing Australia. He even runs around the country now making wishes about his desire to reduce unemployment. But when comes to the question of a policy or a They government commitment to do something for about it, the government seems to be absent with respect to ideas or positive programs to assist on that front. He promised to reduce unemployment. He at made a lot of fanfare about it, too. But since of the election the problem is that the budget of the government has done much to increase unemployment. It is almost as if they the have chosen to ignore their pledge to the electorate in the lead-up to the last The first budget-and so much for budget a no-jobs budget, despite the commitment of the Prime Minister to the Australian electorate to make jobs the priority in his first term of government. Not only is it a no-jobs budget; its initial target was absolutely pathetic-a target of reducing unemment ployment to 8.25 per cent. Suddenly, despite the fact that the target was so pathetic-in normal circumstances, with the state of the economy that the Prime Minister inherited, you could have expected to achieve an even greater target than 8.25 cent-what do we get in the revised budget estimates? A new statement that unemploylocal ment will be 8.5 per cent. It has gone up! should have been reduced on the basis of state of the economy that we handed the incoming Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Is this real budget honesty? I also question whether or not the revised target of 8.5 per cent is a real target. that because of statements by private forecastemployed ers such as Access Economics. We all know the historically close relationship between Access Economics and the Howard governelection ment. On a number of occasions they have been engaged to give economic advice and test coalition policies. I assume that fees paid by the Liberal Party secretariat for that. It is interesting to note that Access nomics is now suggesting that unemployment wi II be even higher than the mid-term review sets out. They suggest that it might be as as nine per cent. That, I might say, is despite the fact that Access Economics, in considerpeared. ation of these issues, has also made it clear that it has factored in the so-called budget strategy and the industrial relations changesto the panacea for increasing jobs in Australia and reducing unemployment. They also say-I know this hurts the ministerial government-that the Australian Capital Territory has just gone into recession. I suppose in essence that would not really worry the Prime Minister because in the mind of this government Canberra, the national capital, is no longer seen as the place of of government. Kirribilli House, the great sights of the Sydney Opera House and the city of Sydney are home to this government, rather than the national capital. The Australian Capital Territory in recession, I dare say, would not even worry the Howard government ment. It is no wonder unemployment is on the increase when you consider what this governbroken has done on the jobs front. The promise was insignificant reductions in government employment. Budget honesty, some would say. We are talking about something of the order of 20,000 to 30,000 Public Service jobs to go in this first term of government. Talk to per the CES workers in Mareeba in Far North Queensland, who lost their jobs when the CES was closed, or to the ones in North It Melbourne. Talk to those who were employed the in the department of immigration in Townsover to ville and who lost their jobs. Mr Martin-Or Wollongong.",47
30,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Also in W ollongong, as the member for Cunningham I say has reminded me. Go to those who were in the Taxation Office in Lismore, or to those who were employed in the Family Law Court in Launceston. All went to the with a sense of job security. Yes, the Prime Minister was going to be honest. He to gave a commitment about government emwere ployment, but I suppose the problem is that he did not tell them it was not a core promise. EcoTheir jobs have disappeared. Their sense of security for their families has disappeared. Their ability to look after their children and high educate them and ensure they are able to access a decent health care system has disapI think that is fairly important. The Prime Minister also tried to suggest, in what he regarded as an honest fashion, prior March 1996 that he was about the family and that he was committed to family values and honesty in government. He had this great code of conduct that was going to be strictly adhered to. We thought that ministerial code of conduct, that statement of honesty in government, was in tatters prior to Christmas of last year. If it was not in tatters prior to Christmas last year, the performance head of Senator Woods has clearly established in the mind of the Australian community that it is absolutely in tatters in February 1997. I raise these issues because I very much support the charter of budget honesty. I tell you what: it is about time the Howard governwas honest with the Australian community. It misled the Australian community in the lead-up to the last election. It has promises time and time again since the last election, and has tried to create a smokescreen about a black hole and core and noncore promises. Worst of all, it has failed to deliver on what I regard as the most important promise to the Australian electorateincreasing jobs, creating a sense of job security, creating a sense of security for families and reducing unemployment. It is almost as if the Prime Minister has admitted defeat on the unemployment front. His employment minister has also acknowledged that as she runs from TV station to TV station, now stating that unless they get unemployment down their electoral prospects do not look all that good. I agree with Senator Vanstone on this occasion. I hope, despite the endeavours of the general secretary of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, that at least she continues to make a few honest statements in her portfolio going to the electoral prospects of the Liberal Party on the basis of its lack of performance on the employment front. John Howard made promises to the Australian electorate. One of those was on the issue of reducing youth unemployment, which has increased by 14 per cent since the last election. Let us hope that the concepts and objectives of this bill at least result in an improved of honesty on the other side of the House. We know how dishonest they were prior to the election of March 1983 when we assumed government. The current Prime Minister was the then Treasurer and he deliberately misled the Australian public as to the state of the deficit. I also contend that they deliberately misled the Australian public in the lead-up to the last budget so as to merely implement their Fightback strategy and to create a smokescreen around their real intentions prior to the election of March 1996. The Australian public expects honesty in government. (Time expired)",48
31,Mr TONY SMITH,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I am pleased to enter this debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill and I do so with the benefit of having listened to some interesting previous speeches. I confess that I learned a new word when I read the contribution of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). He started with his description of the bill by saying that 'it takes a considerable degree of chutzpah'. I am indebted to him for that, but I am not quite sure whether it really advances the debate at all when what we are really looking at here is a modest but good proposal to do something about the budget, about fiscal honesty, about disclosing to the people the true financial position and about keeping the people informed of the true fiscal position. I think it is true that, in considering the position of politicians in this country generally over the years, the Australian public when listening to figures-and we have seen even in this debate figures proposed by one side and figures proposed by the other sidegenerally wonder who is telling the truth, whether there is any truth in any of these statements or whether it is something in between. From listening to those sorts of assertions, I suspect the people of Australia end up with a great degree of cynicism of the whole process. It is that degree of cynicism that we as members of parliament have to be very wary of, particularly as members of political parties, because more and more people out there are saying: 'How can you believe any sense politician? How can you trust any political party? How can you take any great notice at all of what is said?' It is important to engender confidence in the community because I think the economic future of this country really will turn on how confident the people of Australia feel about the direction in which the country is going. If there is no confidence in the community, it will not matter what is said about the figures on one side or the other because we-I say 'we' in a total sense; the people of Australia-will not see our country progressing; our standard of living at least being maintained, if not improved; and jobs for our children being enhanced and secured. Therefore, in that overall context, the very least that members opposite might concede is that this is a start. I think that that even came from the previous speaker, my honourable friend the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson). He said that he supported the thrust of the bill. That is something that I think is worthy of him to concede, but at the same time he managed to pour a lot of scorn upon what has occurred since the election. With the greatest respect to him, I think that will be seen as purely rhetoric in the overall scheme of things. What the people of Australia are really looking for is a government with direction and that is the government that we have got. This proposal before the House is giving direction as to the future charter of budget honesty. It is gi ving the people of Australia something so that they can confidently say, 'At last we have got a direction whereby we can look at these sorts of proposals, hopefully, in a less cynical light.' It is not hard to understand why that cynicism is out there. I am only a recent member of this House. There are members of this House who have been here for many years. Perhaps the cynicism of those members is a different form of cynicism to the cynicism generally in the community. During the last election campaign, for example, there was myth and there was reality. There was an extraordinary divergence between what was out there and what was said to be out there. To take one example, I can recall during the campaign the former Prime Minister saying that youth unemployment was only seven per cent, when we all knew it was about 30 per cent. You did not have to look at a sheet of paper or at some statistics to know that; you knew tht by what you saw out there, what you were told on the ground and what you felt out there. That was what was happening. That was the degree of divergence between what was said to be there and what in fact was there. It is that sort of thing that is being hammered home to people. People switched off on the Labor Party during the last election because that was what was going on. They were being told that they were really very well off, that unemployment was quite modest and under control, and that the level of long-term unemployment was dropping-but we know that was really the revolving door of labour market programs deliberately designed to fudge the figures. All of those things basically caused people to switch off and not listen. Once that happens, it is political death. Once that did happenand it obviously did during the election campaign-it was clear that Labor was going to take a savaging, which it did. The lesson from all of that, in my view, has been appreciated by the government in looking at matters such as those proposed in the bill. During this debate I have appreciated some of the remarks made by the member for Curtin e Mr Rocher)-although I have not heard all of the speakers by any means. I think the member for Curtin looked at the bill in a lot more detail than I have. With his much greater experience of the parliamentary process, he concluded that it will go part of the way, but I think it will go a little bit further than that. The fact is that a start has been made with this bill. It is important-and I think the government with the bill has recognised this, but it must recognise it more-to understand, in the processes that we have, that the parliament's relevance to the executive government must be far more pronounced than we accept that it is. It is a sad thing, which I have seen as a new member, that so few people attend the chamber. Is that really a determinant, in the overall scheme of things, of the parliament's relevance to the executive? A point to the same effect was conceded to me recently by a former minister. He noticed, being in opposition rather than in government, that the difference is marked when he looks at the question of the role of the executive and the role of the parliament. Naturally enough, now that he is on the other side of the House he has come to have a far greater appreciation of the importance of parliament and the standing orders of the parliament and how they can be used to effect certain legitimate tactics and to expose whatever particular measures the government or anyone else has said require further explanation. What I am trying to say is that, at the end of the day, people in the community expect honesty. It is all right to rattle off, as the member for Batman did, a whole list of core and non-core promises and all of these things that he says were broken. The bottom line is that people do expect honesty. If you have to break promises, they expect you to be honest about them. Even if there are difficulties in the budget, people expect honesty. If they do not get honesty, if they get thrown a whole list of figures that really can be brought up by either side of any debate to justify a proposal, they switch off. They then say, 'Well, all politicians are dishonest. We're not listening,' and then what I think is an unhealthy cynicism sets into the equation. I think it is important to ensure that cynicism does not become a disease in the community, because the more it does, the more the relevance of this place as an integral part of our society becomes diluted and the more people out in the community are going to take other actions which are perhaps not the sorts of actions we want to see in this country. We have to keep reminding ourselves that we are servants of the people. We are here not to be agents of the Public Service; we are the agents of the people to the Public Service. We have to remember that in our dealings with that sector of the community and remember that in relation to our position in this place. I think it is important to dispel a cynicism, which has become perhaps more than unhealthy, in society about the political process generally. This is an attempt to do that. This is a proposal to do that. It is a proposal, in my view, that sets a step along the way. I think most of the speakers have conceded that, except we have had the political points that have been made. You expect that in a debate like this. I do not think it does either side of the debate a great deal of credit to spend the whole time condemning and castigating this bill, given what they perceive to have been broken promises in the past and what has occurred and so forth. There are many things that we can refer to in the past. We can go back virtually 20 or 25 years and talk about something that occurred during the Whitlam government but, at the end of the day, people are looking to the government to provide answers, to provide direction and to provide an honest appraisal of the accounts and the fiscal direction of this particular government. When we consider what the government is trying to do with these proposals, I think we must conclude that it is a good step along the way. I emphasise this: it is a start that would not have been made had the previous government been re-elected. There is absolutely no doubt about that. I am sure we would not be here debating a charter of budget honesty if Mr Keating had been re-elected. We do have that start. We do have a determination to progress honesty in terms of this particular measure. I think it is a start that will demonstrate to the Australian people that there is a determination to provide them with some figures which they can look at and examine. They can then form their own views based on what this bill requires of the incumbent government. So I support this measure. I commend the government for the proposal. I look forward to the rest of this debate on the basis that it is a modest but good start-a start that we need to have in this country.",49
32,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, according to its sponsors, is about rebuilding trust in government. Well, strike me lucky! Since this government came to office we have seen the resignation over ethics issues of Senator Jim Short, Senator Brian Gibson and now Senator Bob Woods. I go to The Importance of Being Earnest and Oscar Wilde saying, 'To lose one parent, Mr Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.' I wonder what Oscar Wilde would make of the government's loss of three public office holders in such a short time. We now have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who was told by his Attorney-General (Mr Williams) late last year that the Australian Federal Police was investigating a parliamentary secretary of his. What did he do about it? Did he call in Senator Woods for a 'please explain""? Did he have him stand aside, as Alan Griffiths did from the Keating ministry in somewhat similar circumstances, under investigation? Apparently not. According to the Prime Minister, he forgot about itso much so that he did not even think about it when asked by Ray Martin on TV when he first became aware of the Woods affair. This Prime Minister is supposed to be concerned about standards in parliament, standards in government, about ethics, about integrity, about honesty. That is supposed to be what this bill is all about. But, when the Prime Minister is told by his Attorney-General that the AFP is investigating one of his parliamentary secretaries, what does he do about it? How worried about standards is he? He forgets about it. It is not the way to a relaxed and comfortable Australia that its Prime Minister be so relaxed and comfortable that he settles back in his armchair when his parliamentary secretaries are under investigation by the Ian Federal Police and says to himself, 'That doesn't matter. I think I will call up the Indian cricketers and invite them over for another drink.' Are we really expected to believe the Prime Minister's defence, that he has had a memory lapse? We can all remember when Carmen Lawrence told the Western Australian royal commission concerning",51

34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY," There is no point of order at this stage, but I will listen carefully to the member's contrihe bution to ensure that he does stick to the question before the chair.",52
35,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The issues that have been raised in this bill concern confidence, trust, honesty and integrity. We have heard these issues being raised in the debate on this bill, and this goes to the heart of issues of honesty and integrity. We can all remember when Carmen Lawrence told the Western Australian royal commission, concerning a number of questions asked of her about events which had occurred some years before, that she could not remember. We all remember the howls of mirth and derision and the scoffing that came from the Liberal and National parties opposite. Are they now going to look us in the eye, are they going to look the public in the eye, and say, 'We believe the Prime Minister when he says he forgot'? That is simply not believable. Whatever happened to Honest John?",52
36,Mr CADMAN,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"On a point of order: the title of the bill is the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill.

37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Order! I will, once again, advise the member to stick to the question before the chair, which does relate to budget honesty. I suggest that he confine Austral- his remarks to budget matters.",52
38,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I am happy to West do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. As has already been indicated, the opposition has no general disagreement with the government over the passage of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. In so far as it seeks to build on the fiscal disclosure regime developed under the Hawke and Keating governments, that bill deserves support. But my concerns with this legislation relate to some of its specific provisions, the motivation behind them, its lack of attention to unemployment and its monumental hypocrisy. In advocating the passage of this bill, the Prime Minister has sought to reinvent himself as a latter-day fiscal messiab. Unfortunately, is discovering that that crusade is being badly undermined by the performance of his senior acolytes. It has already been mentioned in the debate that this legislation selects a 40year time frame. That is curious and serves no constructive purpose. However, perhaps the all significance of that is clear when we look at biblical imagery, where we can recall the epic 40-year sojourn of the chosen people in the desert. The Prime Minister, like Moses, wants Australians to follow him into an economic wilderness on the vague assurance of a promised land. . The bill also relies heavily on the theme of honesty. In seeking to infuse this admirable quality into the title and wording of his legislation, the Prime Minister is attempting to construct a moral gulf between his government and the opposition. He should reconsider, because what he is constructing more closely resembles a crucifix. The recent announcements of the mid-year review indicate this quite clearly. It is his government which will be nailed to it at the next election. If the Prime Minister wants to stake out honesty as the battleground for the next election, I for one am happy to accommodate him. Amongst his followers are ministers whose denials are coming quicker than any apostle's. Peter denied Christ three times before the cock crowed, which did his reputation no good. But, compared with the rate at which Liberal promises, core and non-core, are being cast aside, Peter the apostle ranks as a mere amateur. If we consider the other Peter, Peter the Treasurer, after 11 months he would be the last person his leader would turn to and say, 'You are the rock on which I will build my church.' It is unwise to build anything on sand and even unwiser to build in a vacuum. The Treasurer assured the states that the coalition would provide a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue to the states and territories. Peter the Treasurer took only three months to ditch that promise at the Premiers Conference. The Treasurer also did a pretty good impersonation of George Bush when promising no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes. But higher Medicare levies, superannuation surcharge and increased outof-pocket medical expenses have destroyed this guarantee in record time. The Treasurer is not the only minister failing badly on the issue of honesty. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) started to discover how tough honesty can be as a benchmark very early in the piece. On election night, in response to Jim Middleton's question about maintaining funding for the ABC, the senator responded, 'Absolutely.' Months later, after announcing a $50 million funding cut, he tried to rationalise this misleading statement with a lame reference to the euphoria of the night! These ministers have demonstrated how onerous the government's task will be in living up to any honesty benchmark. The Prime Minister, having already encountered problems with his code of conduct, should understand this better than most. We can recall that he was forced to throw some money changers out of the temple; he may have to cast a few more adrift before his term is over. The genesis of this bill can be found in the Prime Minister's headland speech of 18 months ago where he talked about rebuilding trust in government. That is an admirable aim. But what have we actually seen? What we have seen is the Costello black holeaccording to the Australian, a '$1.6 billion bungle' . We have seen a mid-year revision of the deficit-now showing an $8.5 billion deficit with a $2.9 billion blow-out for this year-and estimates that a budget error will open up a $3.5 billion a year hole in the revenue base by the time of the next election and the Treasurer blaming the Australian Taxation Office and his treasury department for that error. That is an appalling state of affairs and, no doubt, one which has contributed to the recent fall in the coalition's support. But just as serious as the blow-out in the budget deficit and Treasurer Costello's own black hole has been the indication that unemployment will now rise from the estimated 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Let me take the House back to the assurances offered by the coalition concerning unemployment prior to the last election. As Michael Millett from the Australian describes: The Coalition's employment policy, Pathway to Real Jobs, issued in February 1996 professes an acute awareness of the problem and is not backward in proclaiming its ability to deliver a permanent solution. The document itself said: Coalition policies will move Australia back towards full employment: the situation where paid employment is available for anyone who seeks it. It goes on: The National Job Creation Strategy will deliver this objective. But, since then, we have seen the Howard government resolutely refuse to set any targets for cutting unemployment. We have seen the revised forecasts for the unemployment rate going up from 8.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent. The government has no strategy, no idea, on how to deal with it. Indeed, all they say is, 'Give us our tired, old right-wing agenda and we will see if we can do something about unemployment.' When we talked to them about unemployment last year they said, 'Let us get our budget through. Let us have the fiscal consolidation strategy.' Then later when we talked to them about unemployment they said, 'Give us our industrial relations legislation. Let us get our workplace reform bill through the Senate and then something will happen about jobs.' Well, nothing has happened about jobs and now you have Victoria's Premier Kennett recently saying, 'Let us have a GST. Give us a GST so we can create some jobs.' The Liberal government has no answers and no policies on cutting unemployment. They just want that tired old right-wing agenda: take from those who are poor; give to those who are already well off. That is all they have to say about unemployment. I think that by far the most objectionable aspect of this bill is its neglect of Australia's unemployed. Back in June 1995 Australians listening to the Prime Minister would have taken his commitment to budget honesty to apply to the range of government economic policies. Unemployment featured prominently in the coalition's rhetoric. As I said before, they claimed that the national job creation strategy would deliver a situation where paid employment is available for anyone who seeks it. Well, under this government-not in my lifetime, it won't. In the information service's very detailed summary of the bill, I could not find the word 'unemployment' mentioned once-not once. There was no reference to the importance of providing work to those who want it, no reference to the significance of work and the opportunity of work for younger Australians-not a word. If unemployed Australians need any proof that the government, like Pontius Pilate, is washing its hands of them, they need only to consider last week's abysmal mid-year review, with the government finally acknowledging that the budget had blown out and that unemployment would rise rather than fall. What makes the government's lack of interest in unemployment in this bill unforgivable is that the research that it has itself carried out demonstrates clearly that its own policies are impacting on unemployment. According to Michael Millett, government research late last year revealed that even with sustained, faster economic growth unemployment would be unlikely to fall to what were described as politically acceptable levels by the tum of the century. The ominous warnings of that research have been reinforced in the last few days by further bad tidings which will do nothing to improve the jobless rate. Yet, as retail sales slump to a 30-year low, the government still wants Australians to believe that it can deliver. Even as bankruptcies for 1996 rose 23 per cent on the previous year, the government says that things are looking great. The Prime Minister referred, I think, to a 'rare conjunction of economic circumstances.' Next he will be telling us, 'You've never had it so good.' Even as the nation's biggest bank predicts a dangerously low growth rate of 2.75 per cent and others realistically consider the possibility of negative growth, the government says that things are on track. This self-delusion is dangerous for this nation. Let us have a look at what the Treasurer has been saying. This is the man who tried to tum water into wine with his first budget, but ended up with $3 billion worth of bilge. Last week, according to the Financial Review, the Treasurer claimed it would be easier to sell a second wave of labour market reforms if unemployment remains high. The paper concluded that the government would attempt further workplace reform because its assessment of the Australian economy was that unemployment will get worse. If we were ever to have a fair dinkum charter of budget honesty, the Treasurer would be out of a job. This week we have seen both the federal director of the Liberal Party and the minister for employment and higher education, another who has found honesty a difficult benchmark-remember the story of the Wright family-ducking the issue of whether the government could reduce unemployment. They were starting to maintain that all you need to do is to look serious about tackling the problem. What an abject cop-out. This is the party that has steadfastly refused for years to match Labor's commitment to a five per cent unemployment rate by the tum of the century and this same party has the audacity to bring before the House a bill intending to establish stricter scrutiny of fiscal performance. At the same time it sets no targets for unemployment and disseminates fudgy figures on unemployment. No wonder unemployment does not feature in the language of the bill. The bill quite clearly demonstrates that the coalition's commitment to fighting unemployment is paper thin. It has no intention of making unemployment its top priority. If it were to do so, you would see unemployment projections featuring prominently in this bill. The Prime Minister's commitment to fighting unemployment has become a non-core promise. The unemployed are finding that, as John Howard seeks to reinvent himself as an economic messiah, it is they who have been forsaken. In conclusion, I want to make a few points about the opposition's concern regarding the specific provisions of the bill. In some respects, it is a bill which provides for even accountability than recommended by the government's own Commission of Audit on this question of charter. For example, the commission recommended making the economic forecasts in the budget-the mid-year review and the pre-election report-the responsibility of economic bureaucrats instead of their being at the discretion of the Treasurer. The government has only agreed to this in respect of the pre-election statement, not in respect of the budget and the mid-year review. New Zealand, by contrast, requires relevant bureaucrats to certify the economic forecasts for all parts of the economic cycle. The opposition would ask the question: why is the Treasurer not prepared to submit himself to the same level of honesty as obtains in New Zealand? We wonder about the veracity of the forecasts in his first test-the recently released mid-year review. This proposal before the House is in stark contrast to the Treasurer's practice while in opposition. He asked the then Treasurer that the 1995-96 economic forecasts in the 1995-96 budget be certified by the Secretary to the Treasury as having been prepared without political interference. That was duly done in writing. But there is no equivalent provision in this bill to bind the Treasurer to undertake the practice that he required the Labor Treasurer to undertake. So why is there this inconsistency? On the issue of fiscal principles, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, having considered the issue of fiscal principles, said: The Committee does not see a need to formulate binding statutory principles of fiscal responsibility. In any case, such fiscal principles would be so imprecise and so wide open to interpretation that there seems little point in prescribing them in legislation. That committee is also wary of the idea that there are enduring fiscal principles. So, given those sorts of observations, we believe that this legislation should be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In recommendation 19, report No. 341, the committee said that any fiscal reporting bill, such as this bill, should be referred to the Joint Committee of Public ACCOUGts subsequent to its tabling. Regrettably, the government ignored this less recommendation when the legislation was introduced. We would think they should take up the opportunity now, remedy the situation now. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts is an expert body which should examine this legislation. Indeed, any obstruction by the government of this proposal suggests that it has something to hide.",52
39,Mr VAILE,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"As a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in both this parliament and the previous parliament, it is indeed a pleasure to support the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 in this House. It is interesting to note that the previous speaker referred to the JCPA. It was, in fact, report No. 341 that recommended the establishment of fiscal responsibility legislation. Interestingly enough, that report was tabled back in 1995, when the Labor Party was still in government, so it was interesting to listen to the comments by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) when he referred right back to 1983-some 14 years ago. The Labor Party have got very long memories when they want to, but not when they do not. The member for Batman was referring to the situation that the Labor Party inherited in 1983. The coalition, in the lead-up to the 1996 election, made a commitment to the Australian people that we would have a charter of budget honesty. It did not take very long for proof to come forward of the necessi ty for this charter of budget honesty. It within weeks of the election that the coalition in government found out the parlous state of the economy which had been deliberately concealed by the Labor Party in the lead-up to that election campaign. Going back to the member for Batman, listening to his address to the House this morning on this bill, I welcomed his support for the bill. But, if the Labor Party knew 1983 of the need for the introduction of charter of budget honesty or fiscal bility legislation, why didn't they act then? If the Labor Party knew of the need for fiscal responsibility legislation in 1995 when the then Public Accounts Committee recommendHoward), ed the introduction of such legislation, why didn't they act? If the Labor Party knew was necessary to introduce this as a sign of faith with the Australian people, why didn't they go to the election in March 1996 with that on their platform? They did not, they knew they could not. They knew they could not, because they knew the people of Australia would not believe anything the Labor Party had to say about honesty in public life. There is no way that the voting public of Australia wouid have believed any utterance of the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, about government honesty because his track record was absolutely abysmal. His track record was absolutely abysmal as far honesty was concerned. In the almost 12 months since that election, I have not heard-I will stand corrected-one member of the Labor opposition defend the do so. former Prime Minister on that point, because they know that the l-a-w tax cuts broken promise was the central plank in the loss that election last year. They know that followintroducing ing the leadership of Paul Keating in the up to the 1996 election was what cost them the election. But the coalition were able communicate to the Australian people that understood that the Australian people were sick and tired of the smoke and mirrors tricks of the Labor Party for the previous 13 years. It is interesting to hear members of the Australian Labor Party debating this bill today and talking about honesty in government. For goodness sake, we had 13 years of Labor in was this country, 13 years of Labor running up debt and deficit and trying to use sleight of hand tricks all the way down the line on the Australian people. The Labor Party treated the Australian people like fools and idiots. It treated them as though they had no understanding of the Australian economy. The Labor Party was in government for 13 years. The member for Batman knew about this in situation, he alleges, in 1983. The JCPA a reported in 1995. What action was there from responsithe Labor Party? Absolutely none! The coalition promised this legislation to the people of Australia during the election in March last year. The now Prime Minister (Mr then the Leader of the Opposition, made it quite clear in one of his early headit land speeches. The recommendation was in report 341. It was part of the policy platform that we presented to the Australian people in the lead-up to the March election last year. because Now here it is, being introduced. All the Labor opposition can do is criticise elements of the budget that this government brought down in August last year. The members of the Labor Party do not talk about the principles or the philosophy behind the introduction of this legislation. They talk about the politics of the budget, a lot of which we were forced into because this sort of legislation was not in place last year and as so we did not have access to the information. The now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was challenged time and again to release the information, and yet he refused to It is very important that the Australian people note that, within 12 months of being of elected to office, the Howard government is the Charter of Budget Honesty leadBill. This bill puts in place a legislative framework for the conduct and reporting of to fiscal policy. It implements our election we commitment to bring greater financial accountability and transparency to the federal government. It opens the books of the nation to greater public scrutiny, which in tum will instil great public confidence in the financial management of government. This bill will bring to an end the deceitful and dishonest electioneering we witnessed from Labor in the lead-up to the 1996 election, when it refused to disclose the true state of the nation's accounts. The explanatory memorandum for the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill states: This Bill aims to produce better fiscal outcomes through introducing institutional arrangements to improve the formulation and reporting of fiscal policy. It continues: More specifically, the Bill requires that governments conduct fiscal policy in accordance with the number of principles of sound fiscal management. ... the Bill will require that governments provide regular fiscal and economic reports including: a statement each year on their fiscal strategy and how that strategy accords with principles of sound fiscal management; a report on the economic and fiscal outlook each year at the time of the budget; a report updating the budget economic and fiscal outlook six months after the budget; We have produced a 98-page report to the Australian people on the state of the budget, six months after the budget was introduced. Remember, the mid-term report of the last Labor government in this country was a threepage press release! That shows the disdain with which it treated the Australian people. The explanatory memorandum continues: a report providing fiscal outcomes for the completed financial year ... ; a report every 5 years on the long tenn and intergenerational consequences of existing fiscal policy. The long-term intergenerational consequences of fiscal policy is a very important point. The former Labor government had absolutely no regard for what it was leaving to the future generations of Australia by way of debt. One of the messages that the coalition managed to get through to the Australian people in 1996 was what the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, amongst other things, had done to the Australian economy and the legacy of his 20-plus years in federal politics. In 1983-1 return to that year because the member for Batman introduced it in his speech this afternoon-foreign debt was $23 billion. In 1984, it was $28 billion; in 1985, $51 billion; in 1986, $75 billion; in 1987, $83 billion; in 1988, $93 billion; in 1989, $100 billion; in 1990, $124 billion; in 1992, $180 billion; and at the time of the election it was nudging $200 billion, of which nigh on $100 billion was generated by the Commonwealth government. The Prime Minister of the day, and during that process the Treasurer, said to the Australian people, 'This is quite acceptable. The equity's there. Our country's worth it. If we've got to flog it off to pay our debts, we'll get good money for it. Don't worry about it, it's okay.' The then Treasurer and the then Prime Minister have left for greener pastures, but the debt still remains. This government did not create the problem we are faced with, but this government has the backbone, the steel and the honesty to talk to the Australian people, to look them in the eye and say, 'We will fix the debt. We will fix this problem that was created by Labor.' And we will. This is part of the straight talk that we are engaging in with the Australian people. Everybody on the opposition side in this debate today has tried to explain away the $10 billion. The member for Batman talked about the deficit of 1983. It is now 14 years later. That is ancient history in this country. We are talking about what the Labor Party did for 13 years. If the Labor Party supposedly learnt its lesson in 1983, it did not learn it very well. The Labor Party has done nothing but rack up debt and deficit for 13 years. It has not told the people of Australia about it. It has not told the people of Australia why it was doing it, where the money was being spent, what it proposed and what impact it was going to have on the people then and on future generations. The Labor Party refused to tell the Australian people. We are not going to sit in this chamber today and be lectured by the members of the Labor Party about honesty. They have absolutely no credibility in terms of political honesty. There is no doubt about that. It is interesting to note an article that was written by Michelle Grattan about this particular issue in the Australian Financial Review on 30 January. It was headlined, 'There's a price, but honesty will pay off.' There is no substitute for honesty, Mr Deputy Speaker. She said in her article: The.charter tears up the script ... A new government will no longer be able to pretend post-election shock. One result should be to make politicians more accountable for their promises. Part of the charter of budget honesty is a clear declaration of the exact circumstances of the accounts of this nation prior to election campaigns so that there will be no shock, horror, 'We did not know it was like this!' There will be none of this stuff that we had in the lead-up to the election last year when the people of Australia and the coalition, the then opposition, pleaded with the government: 'Give us the information; give us the real situation; tell us the real situation.' Mr Martin-Like in 1983!",55
40,Mr VAILE,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,The now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) would not come good. The now Leader of the Opposition and also the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) would not give us the information. Mr Martin-A conversion on the road to Kirribilli!,58
41,Mr VAILE,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"So all of a sudden we are faced with this $10 billion deficit, this blowout in the budget, that we have had to tum around and try to repair. But the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is leaving the chamber, should also admit that Labor learnt no lessons in 13 years. In 13 years, they did not learn the lesson. They dished that up year after year to the Australian people and again in 1996. We are going to change that because this legislation is going to get passed and it will bind future governments and future oppositions, regardless of their political persuasion, to be honest with the Australian people and to let the Australian people know. As I say, this government has started to do this. There are 98 pages of information in that mid-year review. Last year's mid-year review was a three-page press release. Yet they come in here and lecture us about honesty in politics. It is outrageous. In conclusion, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stated in his second reading speech: The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a landmark development in the conduct of fiscal policy and reporting of fiscal outcomes. It is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will change: the way in which elections are conducted; the way in which policies are implemented; the way in which future generations are brought into consideration in economic decision making; and our economic policy for the better. I am confident this bill will help restore the public's faith in politicians and governments as the financial managers of the Australian economy through the greater transparency and accountability that will flow from this charter of budget honesty. I might just highlight to the House this afternoon that the people of Australia are prepared to give this government a go to sort out the problems that we inherited from the Labor Party. They are prepared to give us a go. They had the opportunity in the Lindsay by-election to give that indication last year and they did so in spades. The people of Australia have indicated what they want to do. They want to see this government get this nation's economic house in order. They want to know how it is going to be done, year in and year out, and the impact on their daily lives and the impact on the future generations of Australia. This bill will provide the framework to provide that information to the Australian people.",58
42,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 would have to be one of the most breathtaking exercises in hypocrisy we have yet seen from this government. I must say that I am a little disappointed with the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), whom I have an enduring respect for, he being one of the class of 1993 and probably one of the more intelligent contributors to debate in this chamber from the coalition side. But I am afraid that, in the debate on the charter of budget honesty, he was really a little wide of the mark because he suggested that the Australian Labor Party had no credibility in political honesty. What a breathtaking statement from a member of a government that put up, before the 1996 election, a whole raft of commitments and promises to the Australian people that took barely nine months to be ripped asunder. So let's not hear anything from members opposite about the Labor Party's time in government and the honesty of ALP governments. This bill is not opposed by the opposition in principle. What we do object to is its underlying hypocrisy and its inherent unfairHouse ness. That is why we are recommending it be referred to, and carefully considered by, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The joint committee is the most appropriate body to consider the further detail of this piece legislation. Any attempt by any government of any persuasion to improve the reporting of fiscal position to the Australian people should be encouraged. But we should tion for what it is: it is a crude attempt by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to exorcise a terrible ghost from his political past. That all this legislation is: a crude attempt by this Prime Minister to exorcise a terrible political ghost from his past. Fourteen years after this current Prime Minister delivered the worse fiscal mess to any incoming government, his government introduces a bill which is no more than shallow mea culpa for the chaos in which left the budget in 1982 and 1983. These are things that the Prime Minister would like to forget it. have us forget. He swans into office in 1996 on a raft of promises that have taken him barely nine months to break in a massive exercise of deceit. But we are not going to him forget his past, not the long past and not the near past, because this is a prime minister digits. who has an economic history, who does have a past-and we are going to continually remind the Australian people of it. We will continually remind the Australian people and this Prime Minister of his status as one greatest fiscal vandals this nation has seen the post-war era. You only have to go to fine details of the shabby and hopeless nomic performance of John Howard as Treasurer in 1982-83 and you will get an inkling of what is in store for the Australian people and the Australian economy over the term of this government. The last Howard budget was the crowning monument to the Prime Minister's incompetence as a fiscal administrator. Not only did he engineer a budget deficit of massive proportions; he deceived the Australian people in the lead-up to the 1983 election. So we can really understand the psychology of the Prime Minister in bringing this legislation into the in 1997. It is, as I said, to exorcise that that terrible ghost from his past. Indeed, it was the budget in 1982-83 that reeked of economic incompetence and political deceit. The Australian people passed the of appropriate electoral judgment on the government of the day-a Liberal government of which the Prime Minister, John Howard, was its the then Treasurer, and which gave John Howard the licence to plunder the fiscal state see this legislaof this nation. Mr Hardgrave-Tell us about 1996.",58
43,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"But what of the ecois nomic scenario at the time the now Prime Minister delivered his disastrous last budget in 1982? The honourable member raises the issue of 1996. I am quite happy to accommodate you. I am quite happy to refresh your ever memory. You might want to forget and the Prime Minister might want to forget the a economic incompetence of the person who he now hearis this government, but we will not let either of you or the Australian people Mr Hardgrave-What about 1996?",59
44,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,The inflation rate in 1982-83 certainly was not the three per cent let that Labor left John Howard in 1996. John Howard left Labor an inflation rate in double Mr Bevis-With double digit unemployment at the same time.,59
45,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"With double digit of the unemployment and a few more goodies in thrown into the basket as well. The growth the rate of four per cent that Labor left John ecoHoward as Prime Minister in 1996 is far in excess of the growth rate that John Howard as Treasurer left Labor in 1982-83. At that time there was a negative growth rate in an economy that was shedding jobs by the thousands by the day. In 1996 Labor left John Howard with the lowest level of industrial disputation on record. In 1983 John Howard left Labor an industrial mess with the highest level of disputation seen in years. The level of interest rates was not the single digit figure Labor left John Howard in 1996. In 1983 John Howard as Treasurer left Labor interest rates in double digits. So not only did the Prime Minister leave Labor an economic mess in 1982-83; he left Labor a fiscal mess as well. He left a fiscal mess, a budget mess, and now he comes into this House parading himself as a paragon of economic virtue with a charter of budget honesty that he believes can erase his past. Let us ponder the fiscal mess that John Howard left Labor in 1982-83. In current dollars, he left Labor a deficit of $25 billion. Honourable members need to get their heads around that. One by one you have come into this House and accused the Labor government of leaving you a deficit under half that. Indeed, if what Labor left you in 1996 was a horrible mess, how would you describe what John Howard left Labor in 1982-83-a $25 billion deficit in the federal budget and a ramshackle economy, a stagnant economy, with low growth and high unemployment? I wonder what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) would say about the state of the economy that John Howard left Labor in 1982-83. We know the Treasurer is but a suburban lawyer who is quick with the one-liners but does not really have a grasp of economics. We can be thankful that in his first budget he has not had to grapple with a current dollar $25 billion deficit of the kind John Howard left Labor, an inflation rate of 10 per cent, an unemployment rate over 10 per cent, a negative growth economy, an industrial museum as far as the Australian economy was concerned and interest rates in double digits. I wonder how Treasurer Costello would handle that econom. . 1C scenano. One by one those opposite have come into this chamber and one by one they have attempted to portray the economic record of 13 years of Labor as one presenting them with a massive economic problem. It demonstrates the sort of economic imbeciles you are. If you can come into this chamber and say to the Australian people that four per cent growth over four years is an economic disaster, if you can come into this chamber and say a level of inflation of two to three per cent is a disaster, if you can come into this chamber and sayan unemployment rate coming down with a discrete plan to overcome it is a disaster and if you can come into this chamber and say the lowest level of industrial disputation since Federation is a disaster, then you are a greater pack of economic imbeciles then we give you credit for at this point. The simple fact of the matter is this: the debt that this nation incurs is, as those opposite know and I know, largely private sector debt. That is the reality. If you want to deny it, then show yourselves to be the economic imbeciles we know you are. Mr Miles-What about the $70 billion from Keating?",59
46,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The $70 billion! Can I just point out to the honourable parliamentary secretary who is at the dispatch box that Australia's foreign debt as a percentage of its GDP is about four per cent and is one of the lowest in the Western world. Is that something that you find so difficult to manage? We handed you an economy on a gold plate. We give you a level of debt which is, in term of percentage to GDP, one of the lowest in the OECD and you complain. What would you do if we left you a negative growth rate, double digit inflation, double digit interest rates and double digit unemployment? That is what your Prime Minister left us. So do not come into this House and lecture the Labor Party about fiscal responsibility and charters of budget honesty. There has been only one government in the past 20 years that has ever been able to run a fiscal surplus, and it was not a Liberal government. Mr Hardgrave-It was done with mirrors!",60
47,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I know that is a knife that goes through the chest of the honourable member, who is waving his hands about in exquisite pain, because the facts always hurt. I have given you the facts, you twist and turn and you try to portray the 13 years of Labor government as some sort of economic disaster. And in what you do you show yourselves to be economic imbeciles. A four per cent growth rate and a three per cent unemployment rate do not constitute an economic disaster. There is no economic textbook that would say so and there is no economist in the world-dead or alive-that would make such a stupid statement on the floor of any parliament in the Western world; yet day after day members of the government come into this House and talk about a charter of budget honesty. I would like to challenge the Prime Minister to produce a charter of electoral honesty. We know he cannot produce a charter of ministerial conduct and honesty. We know he has on the deck a charter of budget honesty. I throw the challenge to the Prime Minister, to his front-bench and indeed to the whole government: why don't you produce a charter of electoral honesty? We know all about your honesty when it comes to electoral matters. Let me just run through some of the promises that you made to the Australian people and broke in 1996. As far as the ABC is concerned, which is a matter close to my heart and close to the hearts of many people in rural Australia, this is what the coalition promised: The coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. There it is in black and white. You do not have to be stupid to comprehend what it is saying. What have you done in the budget? You have cut $209 million over four years out of the ABC. This is what you said about labour market programs: The coalition will maintain expenditure on market programs in real terms. What did you do? You cut $1.8 billion over four years out of that. This is what you said about research and development: The coalition will maintain support for R&D through the 150% tax concession. You reduced it in the budget to 125 per cent. As far as the people in regional areas are concerned, they were given an express promise by your government to maintain the regional development program. What did you do? You broke the promise. This is what you said: The coalition will maintain regional development funding of $150m over four years. That is pretty clear-cut. You do not have to be an Einstein to understand that is a promise. What did you do? You abolished the program. Mr Bevis-It wasn't a core promise.",60
48,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"It wasn't a core promise because the Prime Minister who has produced the charter of budget honesty categorises promises as core promises and non-core promises. What if the people listening to this debate throughout the length and breadth of Australia today went to their children and said, 'Christmas is coming up. Yes, I'll buy you the doll house; but, really, that's a noncore promise. We've got some other core promises that you might find in your little bag at Christmas'? You would have to be stupid to fall for that, wouldn't you-a core and a non-core promise. So the Prime Minister, who has now produced this charter of budget honesty, wants to lecture us about the economic record we left this government, and he makes core and non-core promises. I could go through the list. University funding was cut when a specific commitment was given. I challenge the Prime Minister to come into this House next Monday or Tuesday and deliver to the Australian people and to this parliament a charter of electoral honesty. I challenge him to do it. He will not. Do you know the reason why he will not? The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) knows; he is in the House now. He knows why the Prime Minister will notbecause he cannot. He has broken so many labour promises. The legs of the table have been broken and shattered and we are all sitting around on the floor drinking from the budget cup. Mr Hardgrave-You took $10 billion.",61
49,Mr OCONNOR,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"The honourable member complains about an $8 billion or $10 billion deficit. Well whoopee. What would you have done with a $25 billion deficit that your Prime Minister left us? John Howard, as Prime Minister, knows more than anybody else about budget deficits because he was the king of the deficits. He was the greatest economic vandal as far as the fiscal state of this nation was concerned in the postwar era. Don't you dare attempt to lecture us about transparency in budget processes. Let me remind the Prime Minister and the government of the massive improvements to budget reporting in this country by the previous Labor government. It was Labor that introduced the publication of three-year forward estimates of outlays and revenue. It was Labor that produced the publication of an annual tax expenditure statement, a massive improvement on the budget papers over previous budget papers produced by coalition governments. It was Labor that produced the publication of financial impact statements within all explanatory material for new legislation. We can come into this House quite confidently with our record as far as honesty and transparency in budget processes are concerned. We can come into the House with an excellent economic record that will not be denied by members of the government no matter how much they might try. We come into this House armed with the most potent weapon of all in this debate and that is the record of your Prime Minister: the shabby, misguided, fiscal record of the man who now sits in the Prime Minister's chair. He is an economic incompetent, an economic imbecile and a man whose economic record stands in the annals of Australian economic history as one of the worse of all Treasurers in the postia; war era. (Time expired)",61
50,Mr HARDGRAVE,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"It was a wise person who once said that if you do not learn from what has occurred in the past, you run the risk of repeating it. It is very obvious from many contributions today, and most recently from the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), that the Labor Party representatives in this place have no interest whatsoever in dealing with today and the future. This is a great pity for them and it certainly proves that the people of Australia got it right on 2 March last year. We have an opposition in this place which, day after day, continues to prove just how out of touch it is with reality. It just keeps proving it. No-one believes any of their tired rhetoric, their projection of what might be the value of whatever might have been the problem in 1983. People in Australia are more worried about what happened in 1996; what is happening in 1997, and what will happen in the years ahead, and this is what this government is all about. This bill is all about honesty, openness and accountability in government. They are the three key words which everyone in this place should aspire to uphold. It is about letting the Australian people know that we, as parliamentarians, do not own the books; we are just the custodians. It is about acknowledging that we all know our place and that we are elected to run the nation for all the people. We are elected to mind the books properly and we are elected to make sure the national public accounts, which are the property of all Australians, not just the elected government of the day or the bureaucracy, are open for all to inspect. We are not elected to claim the tax funds collected as our own, but as a matter of great trust which has been placed upon us by the people of this nation. So, for all of those reasons this bill before us today is a vital step in ensuring that no-one in politics can keep the books closed for their own purposes, or can keep the books from the people of Australia. It is a duty which all of us in this place should share. We must never be afraid to account to the people of Australwe must never be so arrogant as to presume that what they don't know won't hurt them. Not to pass this bill, to ignore the need to be accountable and to deal with the truth is a recipe for disaster for any government, and it is a reflection upon all of us who aspire to serve the nation by election to parliament. All honourable members know well the often cited criticisms by many people of those of us involved in politics. This bill is a statement to the justified cynics in our country that we all want to do better to justify the faith which was placed in us most recently on 2 March last year by our election to this place. During the last federal election campaign people often said to me that, essentially, they expected when we came to government we would find a worse position than the previous mob had confessed to. Few were really surprised when it was revealed that Mr Beazley had hidden a $10 billion black hole in the economy. It is really just not good enough that there is this sort of deception. As the then opposition, trying to announce alternative policies so the people of Australia could rightly consider them before they voted, we could only go on the financial advice which was exposed by the books held in the hands of that government. The previous government, as we all know, held back the true information, in particular when the now Leader of the Opposition, the then finance minister, was in charge. It is all very obvious this was for political advantage. The books are not any government's political plaything. The people of Australia deserve the truth, which is what they are going to get as a result of this particular bill. It is what we promised in opposition and during the election campaign, and it is what we are delivering. It is certainly very shameful to think standards fell so low during the 13 years of the previous government. I know most people do not necessarily understand all of the economic mumbojumbo, but they certainly do understand plain, straightforward honesty. I think it is very sad that what should be regarded as the quite noble profession and aspiration of entering parliament has been downgraded by a few politicians who choose to put their own interests before the interests of their constituency. It is straightforward for us all to understand that the Australian people want a certain amount of certainty which opening up the books of this country always reveals. People want to be able to know what the government forecasts the economy to be, and plan accordingly. Right now we are in a low inflation, low interest rate environment and growth may not be spectaCUlar, but the economy will grow. After all, investment growth is already strong. It is as strong as an ox. Tomorrow is the beginning of a new lunar year, the Year of the Ox. Australians of an Asian heritage will know what this means: it means there are going to be stable economic conditions, just as this government rightly forecasts, for the next 12 months. The economy will grow, but it will take a deal of steady and sustained activity, and hard work will pay off. It is very obvious that Australians all realise that one of the outstanding features of this government, one which distinguishes the Howard government from the previous government, is our straightforward honesty, our openness, our accountability. It might be an alien concept to those opposite, but we are certainly doing our very best to explain time and time again through the course of this debate just how well it can work. For a start, we have done what we said we would do, and this legislation confirms our commitment to the processes of open government and responsible fiscal policy. This bill will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. It will ensure that at all times governments can be held properly accountable for their fiscal and economic policies. As a result of this bill, there will be no more fudging of the figures, or dodging of responsibility. There will be no more uncertainty for Australians. This government does not need to be prompted on these matters, of course. Did you see the Treasurer walk away when he realised recently that the budget forecast may not be realised? He faced the Australian people and explained the situation. He did not try to hide anything, or fudge any figures. This is what good government is all about. This bill will go further. It will enhance this already volunteered approach to discipline, transparency and accountability applying to the conduct of fiscal policy. I think I should seek leave to continue my remarks.",62

Were there any other briefings or discussions with the Prime Minister or his office on this matter? If so, when and who was present?",64
53,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I intend to answer that question fully, but at the same time. I wan- to remind the House that what we are talkmg about is an ongoing police investigation and that must be respected. I was first apprised allegations against Senator Woods by the AFP in late August. I was provided with further information in early September and at about or soon after that time. I formed the view that I should inform the Prime Minister. I am unable to say on exactly what date I informed the Prime Minister, but it was certainly from my recollection in the period around midSeptember. I had a brief meeting with the Prime Minister in which I briefed him on other matters and then gave him a very brief report that there had been allegations. It was not known whether there was any substance to them. Subsequently, I had no further discussion with the Prime Minister until 21 January on the matter. Mr Lee-What about your office?",64
54,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me qualify the answer by saying that only I spoke to the Prime Minister. Nobody from my office spoke to him or anybody in his office in relation to the matter. They were one-on-one meetings in mid-September and on 21 January. There was nobody else present and it was oral. Having regard to that, I think the procedures that were put in place by the previous government in' relation to the AFP reporting to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice sensitive matters which might have a high public profile or political implications were followed exactly in this case. Human Rights: Trade Agreement",64
55,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister outline to the parliament the nature and terms of the human rights clause proposed to be included in the framework trade agreement with the European Union? Would the Prime Minister also advise the House of the basis of the government's refusal to accept such a clause and its implications, if any, for Australia's trade relations with the EU and any other region?",64
56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I say in reply to the honourable member for Bradfield that the difference of view between Australia and the European Union on this issue is not a dispute over Australia's commitment to human rights. of Australia's commitment to human rights is unequivocal and our record is second to none. The issue at stake in this dispute is whether or not Australia should sign a treaty which clearly links trade with human rights and which, if this clause were included, would allow either party to suspend the agreement or terminate it unilaterally on the basis of undefined criteria. The European Union's draft framework trade and cooperation agreement has as its first operative article respect for democratic principles and human rights. The draft identifies these as the basis and an essential element of the agreement and also has non-fulfilment provisions. The government's position is that the EU proposals are quite inappropriate in a treaty covering trade. They are unacceptable to Australia and ought to be unacceptable to any country that has the human rights standing of Australia. We have proposed the inclusion of our common objectives on human rights with the European Union in a political declaration. The government also considered that the draft agreement in its current form would not protect or advance the interests of Australia's business community, which of course is one of the main aims for such an agreement. The draft did not offer Australia the progress it sought on agricultural trade and in energy. If the opposition is arguing that we should have signed the agreement in the form desired by the European Union, it would have sold Australia and the business community of our country short. The other point I would like to make-and I think it is important that it be made in the context of this debate-is that suggestions have been made that in some way the government's refusal to accept the human rights clause is related to a possible response by the government to the Wik judgment. Can I make it very plain to the House and to the Australian people that our decision in relation to the human rights clause requested by the European Union was taken months ago, and in fact taken several months before the High Court of Australia brought down its decision in the Wik case on 21 December. I notice that the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs has criticised the foreign minister on this issue. It seems a very clear principle is emerging that whenever there is a dispute between Australia and another country, the Labor way is always to give way. Prime Minister",64
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. When did the Prime Minister become aware that he had misled the Australian public in his interview with Ray Martin on Tuesday? Was it immediately after the program, or was it after the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, asked a question of Senator Hill yesterday? In either case, why did the Prime Minister not take immediate steps to correct the record in accordance with his code of conduct on the behaviour of ministers which requires that: Ministers must be honest in their public dealings you. and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest ty. Doesn't the code of conduct apply to the Prime Minister?",65
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it does.",65
59,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,65
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,65
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to answer the question in full, Mr Speaker. I will start again by saying yes, it does. I make several points in support of that. The first point I make is that the comment that I made on the Ray Martin program was not designed to mislead the Australian public. I acknowledge that the implication that people could have drawn from itOpposition members-Oh!",65
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I have the opportunity of finishing this, Mr Speaker?",65
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question has been asked, the answer is being given.",65
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The exact answer that I gave on the Ray Martin program was not in itself in any way incorrect, because what I actually said was that Senator Woods had spoken to me about this matter in January. That of course was true, and I relayed the substance of what he had said. I had not remembered-and I acknowledged that through Senator Hill and I acknowledge it again-the brief briefing from the Attorney General. Opposition members-Two!",65
65,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well that was the day that I saw Senator Woods. Mr Gareth Evans-And the Attorney General, too.",65
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. I have said that, too.",65
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not helping things. Mr Griffin interjecting,65
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Bruce.,65
69,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Nixon would be proud of,65
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kingsopportuniford Smith should know better.,65
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition asked when I was aware that I had not remembered the earlier briefing. At about half past four yesterday afternoon my chief adviser informed me that he had been advised by the Attorney-General and the Attorney-General's chief adviser that it was the Attorney General's recollection that he had told me of the complaint against Senator Woods in the latter half of last year. Mr Griffin interjecting-,65
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Bruce.,66
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I then spoke briefly on the telephone to the Attorney-General, who at that time was keeping a doctor's appointment somewhere in the city. He said to me, 'John, I have a very strong recollection that I told you of this very briefly in the latter part of last year.' I repeated to him that I had not recalled that. I said that we should discuss the matter further when he returned to the parliament. I then attended to a meeting that commenced at about a quarter to five. At the end of that meeting I discussed the matter again in person with the Attorney-General. Following that discussion I acknowledged to him that I had clearly not recollected that briefing when I gave the answer on the Ray Martin program. I then discussed with my staff and with the Attorney-General the action I should take. I decided that the appropriate thing to do was to reply through Senator Hill because a question had been asked in the Senate. It is my understanding, incidentally, that the House of Representatives rose at 5.31 yesterday afternoon so that members could attend a special reception at Government House. I think at the time the discussion with the Attorney-General had concluded it was after 5.31. Therefore, it would not have been practicable for me to have come into the House. The guidelines require that you correct any inadvertent misleading and that you do it as soon as practicable. I believe that I have done that. I believe that I have complied with the guidelines in full. I believe that I have been honest and open in my dealings. I did not set out to mislead the Australian people in the answer that I gave on the Ray Martin program. I did not set out to mislead them and when my forgetfulness in relation to the briefing of the Attorney-General had been drawn to my attention I, with all proper dispatch, corrected the record. I think any argument that a response given in my words through my representative in the Leader of the Government in the Senate is not a formal notification to the parliament is absolute bunkum. Corporate Law",66
74,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of recent developments in the enforcement of corporate law and what approach the government takes to the issue of corporate law enforcement?,66
75,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. On 4 December 1996 Mr Alan Bond pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to act honestly as a company director with intent to defraud. The charges related to events in 1988 and 1989 concerning the Bond Corporation's takeover of the Bell group of companies. On 5 February Mr Bond was sentenced to four years gaol in relation to those charges to be served cumulatively with a three-year term of imprisonment he is currently serving in respect of the La Promenade matter. The conclusion of matters in relation to Mr Bond represents a milestone in relation to corporate law enforcement. There are, however, two defendants still to stand trial. It is not appropriate to make comments on the substance of the matters involved. However, I do congratulate the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions for bringing those matters, now nearly a decade old, to a conclusion. As far as this government is concerned, it believes it is important that investors in stock markets have confidence that the rules protecting them against fraud and dishonesty are properly enforced, and it has instructed agencies to be vigilant in that regard. The Australian Securities Commission will have the strong support of this government in relation to ensuring that our stock markets are adequately supervised and corporate wrongdoing is brought to account. At a time when the stock market is again at near record levels and when there is strong investment in the Australian community, this government believes that it is more important than ever for these regulators to be vigilant. We do not want a repeat of the 1980s in relation to much of the conduct which occurred during the bull run of the stock market in that period. That is why those regulators have been instructed to make sure that corporate fraud and corporate wrongdoing is brought to trial; they will be given every support by the government in relation to their activities. Prime Minister",66
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister or any member of his staff see or discuss the contents of Senator Woods's letter of resignation and associated media release prior to their release to the media? If so, why did he let such a blatantly misleading press release be issued with the full knowledge that its contents were not adequate? If he was not aware of the contents of the release before it was issued, why did he or his office not take immediate steps following its release to correct its misleading of the public in regard to its contents?",67
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot answer for what my staff may have done without first speaking to them. But my best recollection is that the media release was issued by Dr Woods without being referred to me. I recall the discussion I had with Dr Woods earlier this week in which he informed me of his intention to resign from the parliament. I told him that he should discuss the timing of that with the Leader of the Government in the Senate and that he should also, as a matter of courtesy, discuss timing issues with the President of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party because, consequent upon his resignation, a preselection by the New South Wales Liberal Party would be necessary to sponsor a candidate for appointment by the New South Wales government under the provisions of the constitution. I said that I did not think anything hard and fast should be said publicly until he had consulted Michael Osborne, the president of the party, and had discussed the matter with Senator Hill-and I was acting on the assumption and in the belief that there would be a further exchange between us. That is the best recollection I have of the chain of events. I will talk to my staff. If there is anything further that I should add after that consultation, I will do so. Austudy",67
78,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Can the minister tell the House how the government is responding to the needs of families and students across the country by providing for a fairer and more equitable payment of Austudy? In particular, what action is the government taking to address concerns about the administration of the actual means test?",67
79,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government provides Austudy to students in financial need to make it possible for them to continue with their education. Because it is important that the maximum assistance affordable be provided to those in real need, Austudy payments are targeted to those whose means justify their payment. For a long time there has been community concern-which I believe would be reflected in the member for Dawson's question-that there are high income earners, wealthy people in the community, abusing the system by arranging their affairs to reduce their apparent income or assets at the expense of less well-to-do, battling families. The former Labor government introduced the so-called actual means test to determine the real means of those applying for Austudy. The Liberal and National parties before the last election agreed with the principle of the actual means test, which was that people should not be able to rearrange their affairs to reduce their apparent income or assets and thereby obtain Austudy. We did, however, express our view before the election that there were problems with the way in which this test had been constructed and was being implemented, and we undertook to review it. Following the election we did review the test, and in 1997 it is based on estimates of family expenditure provided by applicants themselves on the Austudy application form; if actual means are below the equivalent of the income test cut-off, they will be eligible for Austudy. There are discounts under the test for primary and secondary students from isolated families and for bona fide wages earned by students. Farming families who receive a drought relief payment or who are in receipt of farm household support are also exempted. The actual means test only applies to applicants who have opportunities to minimise their taxable income-that is, for example, those involved in a trust, a partnership or a private company, or those who are self-employed; this is expected to be about 23 per cent of the total of Austudy applicants. Most of those who apply for Austudy will not be required to complete the actual means test form. The government is aware that there is still significant concern, especially in rural communities, over the operation of the test. Senator Vanstone has acknowledged that there remain difficulties with the application and administration of the test. There have been concerns raised about the actual means test hotline. Originally, there were 15 staff allocatO'Connor; ed to the hotline. I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that Senator Vanstone has directed that an additional 24 staff be attached to the hotline service. A further 14 staff started yesterday after training and a further 10 people are being trained and will come on shortly to service the hotline. These additional staff should very substantially improve, if not do away with, the problems that have been experienced with this particular service. Other concerns have been raised over the way in which the actual means are determined from the information on the form. The government is presently conducting a detailed examination of these concerns with the aim of fixing any genuine problems that exist. Our aim is to ensure that the actual means test operates in a way which is fair and equitable to all concerned, so that those genuinely in need, because of insufficient means, can be most effectively helped.",67
80,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of orderMrs Crosio-A point of order on your own minister!",68
81,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My minister had sat down, if you had any eyes. Mr Speaker, I refer you to page 492 of House of Representatives Practice and the issue of sub judice and to the previous question of the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Tanner-You're too late.",68
82,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it's not, if you would listen.",68
83,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,68
84,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to hear you say that he has not been charged, because the previous question suggests that he should admit to it. Mr Speaker, I refer you to that question, and the line of questioning, and I ask you to give advice to the parliament as to just how far a line of questioning might go, as I believe the previous question from the Leader of the Opposition suggested that there was a call on the member to admit some guilt.",68
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for I have the thrust of that question. As members would be aware, I am following the debates today with closer attention than normal, and that is saying something. I am well aware of the sub judice principles. Nothing has arisen thus far that causes me any undue distress and I assure the member for O'Connor, and all members in this place, that I will watch developments throughout question time today with a great deal of close attention. Prime Minister",68
86,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General has just said that there were no further discussions with the Prime Minister between some time around September and 21 June. Government members-January!,68
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,January. What was the substance of your conversations with the Prime Minister on 21 January and did they differ in content from those that you held with him earlier?,68
88,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The reason for speaking to the Prime Minister on 21 January was that the Federal Police had alerted me to their intention to execute a search warrant at about that time. People's Convention,68
89,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Prime Minister support the view that, under the present economic circumstances, the $25 million people's convention is likely to be an expensive waste of time? Prime Minister, why not conduct a constitutional referendum on the republic and let all the people have a say?",69
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The end of the process, if there is to be change, must, of course, be a constitutional referendum. This issue, although I do not believe it is a 'top of the mind' issue for Australians, and although it is an issue that is regarded by many Australians as being a second order issue, does go to the constitutional future of Australia, and it is our belief that the issue should be fully and properly debated. The great dilemma, as I have said on a number of occasions recently, is that we have a first-class system of government, without parallel anywhere in the world, but there are a growing number of Australians who are unhappy with some of the symbols of that system. If we are to change the system, we must be absolutely certain that the system that we change to is as good as, if not better than, the system we now have, otherwise we would be a very foolish people to make that change. At the end of the day it is very difficult to put a dollar value on constitutional stability. It is very difficult to put a dollar value on parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, the separation of powers and all of those other things which are the hallmarks of our system. I believe we need more debate, more discussion and more understanding of this matter before the time arrives for a constitutional referendum. I have said before that we will have the convention elected. I believe the procedure laid down by the government for the election of the convention is the right procedure in all of the circumstances, and I take the opportunity of reiterating that today. Depending on the outcome of that referendum, further action will follow in accordance with what I said to the Australian people before the election. I intend to keep faith with the Australian people. I intend to involve them at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of this process. I believe very passionately that the Australian constitution belongs to the Australian people. It does not belong to you or to me or to the Leader of the Opposition. It belongs to all of the Australian people. TWU Pay Claim",69
91,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen reports that the secretary of the ACTU, Mr Bill Kelty, has accused him of lying about the TWU's 11 per cent pay claim and has guaranteed that, if granted, the claim will not spill over into other industries? Can the minister comment on these reports?",69
92,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly have seen the colourful remarks of Mr Kelty in this morning's press. I do not want to respond to the colour, but the substance of the debate is very important. The reason it is important is that we want a system that can genuinely give people wage increases. That is one of the central tenets of what we are trying to do. It was beyond my comprehension when Bill Kelty said that an 11 per cent increase in award rates was not an 11 per cent increase in pay. In fact, it is the 11 per cent increase in pay which is what he says is the so-called benefit of this claim. If the claim is granted, the fact is that in some key parts of industry it would provide above safety net increases without corresponding productivity increases at the enterprise level. So it would foist higher costs on to a significant number of operators. It will also have a significant impact on industry competitiveness, so hurting jobs, and it will raise prices, particularly in regional areas. That is something we want to avoid. The promotion of a better deal for regional Australia is an absolutely key objective for this government. It is worth noting that some trucking companies in New South Wales have already started to increase their charges to reflect the changes which were granted to the New South Wales transport award last year by the New South Wales commission, which operates under legislation very different from that which is relevant at the federal level. Those changes were similar in many respects to the TWU application before the commission. The fact is that similar increases in transport charges would be inevitable if its current application before the commission were to be successful. When I talk about flow-ons, I am talking about the flow-ons within the transport industry from the big operators who are paying it to the small operators who cannot afford to pay it and for whom those cost increases would have significantly detrimental effects on the operation of their businesses. The TWU claim may have some benefit for some operators, but certainly not 11 per cent. The reality is that for many others it would not. I urge those employers to pursue the gains that they think are available through enterprise bargaining. I also call on them not to impose their deal onto other operators for whom it is not appropriate. If the TWU's claim were to succeed, it would send a clear message to other unions: 'If you can't get a wage increase through bargaining, then try the award route.' According to this model, all you need is a few compliant employers and everyone in the industry can achieve a big increase regardless of the circumstances of the business, and it is obviously unlinked to productivity. We are not alone in seeking to oppose this application. Natroads, one of the employer organisations in this industry, said in its submission: If there are to be offsets in return for wage rises over and above the safety net and those offsets vary from enterprise to enterprise, then these should be processed by way of enterprise agreements ... on a case by case basis, and not via the award. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures commented: The application if granted will act as a major disincentive to agreement making ... The application is intended to be a substitute for bargaining at the enterprise level ... The reality is we do want to see a system based much more on enterprises. The beneficiaries of that will be those enterprises and the people who work with them. The interesting development on this whole issue as far as policy is concerned is that, when Labor was in opposition, their stated public policy position was to move to an enterprise based bargaining system on the basis it would improve the conditions for average wage earners. You have walked away from that long standing position. We have maintained a consistent position. I am very happy to engage Mr Kelty in this debate. It is an important one. Prime Minister",69
93,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. How can you credibly claim you had no recollection until yesterday of your August and September discussions with the Attorney-General on the Woods affair when, with you again, as recently as 21 January he spoke in the context of advising you about the execution of a search warrant  another case of your code of conduct applying only when you get caught?",70
94,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In reply to the member for Hotham, there were not two conversations last year; there was one. Mr Crean-All right.",70
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, all right. So we have sorted that out. The situation is as I outlined it in answer to the question asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition. When I gave that answer on A Current Affair, I had not remembered the briefing last year. I regret that. I do not believe that my conduct has in any way breached my guidelines. I have been honest with the Australian people. I have corrected the inadvertent mistake that I made on A Current Affair. I have nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of. My guidelines are completely intact so far as my own conduct is concerned. The member for Hotham can carry on as much as he likes. There is nothing in this. But please keep asking questions; please do. East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement",70
96,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the minister aware of criticisms of the historic East Gippsland regional forest agreement signed this week by the Commonwealth and Victorian governments?,70
97,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer is that we had to look pretty hard but, yes, we did find a bit of criticism. One piece of that emanated from the shadow minister for the environment, who issued a release called 'False Security'. I must say I find that pretty amazing. The previous government was very keen to tell us that they were responsible for putting the RFA process in place but they could never actually deliver on it. We never got an outcome, but they wanted to claim credit. Yet they now criticise ally agreed process for finding a balanced approach to conservation and forestry in this country that they wanted to claim credit for. In fact, of course, the East Gippsland RFA is a very valuable historic agreement. Of the 1.2 million hectares, around half will see forests of value preserved and around half will be available for sustainable forestry. Interestingly enough, that half or so that will be conserved represents a very significant increment over the Janus criteria, which was that we ought to seek an objective of 15 per cent of pre-existing forest types. As a result of the regional forest agreement, we are going to see, for example, new investment, the likely increase in product out of the area of some $100 million a year and better utilisation of resources. As a result of heads of agreement struck between the Victorian government and industry, you will see a direct increase in the commitment to value adding. In short, it represents the balance, sound policy, that Australians want. It is based on intellectual rigour and on scientific assessment. Those assessments took into account huge volumes of research and work that had been put together by Victorians and other researchers over the years. The bulk of the biological data came from what are called flora quadrate surveys, which are detailed studies of areas just 30 metres by 30 metres, one after the other. Information was drawn from the highest levels of academic, state and Commonwealth expertise. There was a lot of external peer review. It is a sound rigorous process. It puts Australia at the cutting edge of forest management globally. I think the outcome has been very well received. I think the Australian people see it for what it is: a sensible, balanced, appropriate outcome, and that is why they are supporting it. It is very interesting to compare and contrast the calm with which this has been welcomed by the Australian people with the turmoil that the former government and this country were in over forest policies just two years ago when the then Minister for Resources, the member for Rankin, had control the very nation- of this area.",71
98,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Forest Grump.,71
99,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Far be it from me to repeat that nickname. But, unfortunately, there was a total breakdown in his capacity to promote good policy and to get it up and running. The whole place was in an absolute mess. The then Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy were brought into take over and the then minister was sort of pushed quietly into the background. It is very interesting that at that time he disappeared. He took a wide range of trips to exotic places. We assumed that he was escaping the political heat, but it has been drawn to my attention that he was trying to make reparation for the mess he had created. He was out there selling woodchips, one by one, in markets abroad. He must have been; he the went abroad so often. The result of that turmoil was that the Australian people rightly perceived that you were no longer able to run the place. So, at the last election, they took to you. There was a very extensive thinning; there was not very much left. There were a few weak seedlings left, showing no vigour, there was a bit of patchy old growth left, and there was a heck of a lot of deadwood. The Australian people now have the balance that you could not deliver them in this area of getting it right between conservation and forestry and outcomes. That is why, as the Herald-Sun said yesterday, it has been welcomed, widely received and ought to be accepted by everyone. NA",71
100,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! I infonn the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, led by the Speaker, Dr Kiri Banda Ratnayake. Also present in the gallery this afternoon is Senator Vladimar Varnavaski, a member of the Russian parliament, who will be meeting members of the Australian Parliamentary Antarctic Alliance later today, and from Norfolk Island the Minister for Tourism and Finance, the Hon. Mike King. On behalf of the House, gentlemen, may you enjoy your stay in Australia and may it be rewarding. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Australian Broadcasting Corporation",72
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime Minister has regularly labelled the ABC as politically correct to a fault-his favourite label for anyone who might disagree with him-is this why the cabinet submission on the ABC of 2 July 1996 of the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator AlstonMr Costello-We're off, are we?",72
102,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Feeling a sense of relief are you? Palpable relief on their back benches. I wonder why. Don't be so transparent. I continue, Mr Speaker: Is this why the cabinet submission of 2 July 1996 of the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, on the ABC advocates a review of ABC functions 'that will give us the ability to influence future ABC functions and activities more directly'? Will the Prime Minister now guarantee that neither he and his government nor his staff will seek to influence the internal functions and activities of the ABC and that the government will never again pursue such a transparently political vendetta against the ABC and its independence?",72
103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the opportunity to say something about the ABC. The ABC is a great Australian institution. It has made a very significant contribution to Australian cultural life. It has also been the backbone for supplying great entertainment and great information to Australian sports lovers. My own earliest acquaintance with some of the great Australian sports, such as cricket and rugby league in particular, was by courtesy of the famous ABC commentaries of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Mr Latham-You remember back that far-50 years but not five months.",72
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do, yes, very vividly. The government believes in an independent ABC, but if it believes that on occasions the spectrum of views expressed on the ABC-{)r, indeed, on any other broadcaster, but the ABC has a particular responsibility in this area because it is publicly funded-is too narrow, and if I have any views to express about the spectrum of views on the ABC I will take the opportunity of being as open and direct in public as I may be if I am talking to anybody in private. I have a lot of confidence in the integrity and independence of the new chairman of the ABC. He is a person of very deep cultural sensitivity and has an understanding of the values of the ABC. Funding levels are a matter for government determination. We do not seek to do other than ensure that the ABC carries obligations that are carried by other organisations within the government remit in this time of difficult fiscal consolidation. I want to say to the parliament that the ABC has obligations of balanced objectivity and absence of bias to both sides of the political debate in this country. I have said in the past that its spectrum of views is often politically correct to a fault on some issues. I have been quite open in saying that. I have said that to the faces of people in ABC management. I have said it openly and I have said it publicly, and I will say it again. But that does not in any way diminish my respect for the ABC and the intention of this government to retain a properly funded, independent, objective ABC as an important element of the cultural and public information life of Australia.",72
105,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a supplementary question",72
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question has been dealt with.,73
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will you hear the supplementary?,73
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to listen to it, but the prime ministerial response was substantial.",73
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The supplementary is: within the framework of what you have just said about a need to avoid bias in the ABC, Prime Minister, do you think that this, in a cabinet submission, serves that objective: (That) will give us the ability to influence future ABC functions and activities more directly.",73
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is disallowed. This is a separate question. The Prime Minister has satisfactorily dealt with the former question. Search and Rescue,73
111,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Following Australia's participation in the rescue of the three solo yachtsmen in the Southern Ocean recently, can you inform the House how we can further build on our international reputation in civil search and rescue activity?",73
112,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question. Earlier today I welcomed Mr Tony Bullimore, whom members would remember was one of those three gentlemen who was rescued just recently by our Australian defence forces-HMAS Adelaide in this instance-after spending some four days in his upturned yacht. I welcomed him to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's headquarters here in Canberra. The purpose of his visit was to thank the members of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority for their part in his rescue, as, indeed, he had already thanked the members of the Australian Defence Force for their role in his rescue. The other aspect of his visit was to provide a debriefing session for those people responsible for search and rescue operations within AMSA to try to enhance our capacity in future years in matters such as the rescue that he was involved in. These debriefing sessions that Mr Dubois, Mr Dinelli and now Mr Bullimore have participated in have been enormously valuable in increasing our capacity in search and rescue areas. For example, some very simple and common sense things such as painting the hulls of these yachts that go in these races bright orange so they can be more easily detected and altering the course of the yacht race to bring them closer to rescue services so the task of finding them is not so great have all been put forward in these debriefing sessions. In advance of all of this, in the middle of last year I initiated a review of our search and  Crone undertook that review. He highlighted the fact that we have three search and rescue headquarters in Australia, two run by Air Services Australia in Melbourne and Brisbane and another run by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in Canberra. He recommended the amalgamation of all three of those for the reasons that this would improve the degree of communication between each of those organisations, increase our response time and our effectiveness and, as a consequence, increase our capacity to be more successful in search and rescue. This review will be turned into policy. I recently announced that we will be amalgamating all three of our search and rescue operations in Australia. It will cost some $5 million. It will be in place by July of this year. As a consequence of that, we will have a far more effective, quicker to respond and more successful search and rescue service in Australia to assist the Tony Bullimores of the world and anyone else who gets lost in the 11 per cent of the world's surface area that Australia is responsible for in terms of international search and rescue operations. I conclude my answer by saying that, whilst Mr Bullimore survived on chocolate bars for the four days in his upturned yacht, there has been considerable interest in him giving endorsement for those chocolate bars. He proposes to do so. The proceeds of those endorsements will go to a charity in FremantIe to benefit parents and children associated with the Royal Australian Navy. It is an excellent gesture by Mr Bullimore, one that we can be pleased with. Indeed, all of us can be pleased with the work done by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and our Australian defence forces in this search and rescue operation undertaken in the last few weeks. Prime Minister",73
113,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, and it follows an answer to a question given in the Senate that apparently Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, was briefed at the same time. Prime Minister, now that it has been revealed that the Attorney-General advised you of the allegations in mid-September and that they involved a member of your executive, what steps did you or your head of department, Max Moore-Wilton, take to satisfy yourself that public money had not been misused by a serving member of your front bench?",74
114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My recollection is that the Attorney-General mentioned to me very briefly that a complaint had been made. The understanding, according to his recollection communicated to me yesterday, was that both of us had agreed that the law should be allowed to take its course.",74
115,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You did nothing.,74
116,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it would have been improper of me, for example, to have inPrimary formed Senator Woods that a complaint been made against him. I think the right thing to do, the correct thing to doMr Crean-Call him in.",74
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. I think to have called him in would have been to have interfered with the police investigation. Australian Wheat Board,74
118,Mr TAYLOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. I refer the minister to his trade statement yesterday in this place and media reports of initial reaction from United States. Can the minister inform the House of the validity of reports that the US involved. intends to challenge the marketing role of the Australian Wheat Board under the World Trade Organisation guidelines? What is the government doing in response to this developmcnt?,74
119,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has been a very positive reaction to the trade outcomes and objectives statement across the board from a number of industry spokesmen as it gives a good, effective blueprint to pragmatic, hard-edge trade negotiating in a world which consists of a very un level playing field. In respect of the specific matters that were addressed, they were discussed in a constructive way. Many of those countries, of course, are lowering their own tariff walls, and we are making good progress in our bilateral negotiations as well as in the regional and multilateral setting, but there is a long way to go and I recognise that. There was a particular comment made by the United States spokesman, as part of the Outlook conference and parallel with the tabling of the trade outcomes and objectives statement, which said that the single desk selling of the Australian Wheat Board would be under review again and would be taken to the WTO by the United States. I say simply in respect of that: I will defend the right of as Australia to decide upon a single desk selling mechanism for the Australian wheat industry or, as maybe required from time to time, with regard to other industries as may be determined by the government. I note that my colleague the Minister for Industries and Energy, John Anderhad son, when he met with US Secretary for Agriculture, Dan Glickman, in Rome late last year, took a similar position. He discussed it there. I discussed it with US interlocutors in Manila in the APEC setting and in other settings, and the position is very clear: the United States itself has investigated the Australian wheat industry, most recently by the General Counting Office of the US, which is an independent arm and one of some note. It found that there was absolutely no risk of citing the Australian wheat industry and its the single desk selling power to the World Trade Organisation and that there was no subsidy Further to that, a former senator of the US Congress, Senator Boren, led a subcommittee investigation which made a similar finding. So the single desk selling power in respect of the Australian wheat industry is a mechanism which is fair, which is transparent, which is above board, which helps hard-pressed Australian wheat growers who have no subsidy whatsoever to do battle in a very competitive circumstance, and which helped them forge some additional sales in recent weeks to India, Iran and other places in the Middle East and elsewhere-in fact, almost a record selling program with the huge harvest that they have to deal with at this time. The trade outcomes and objectives statement is a very comprehensive statement. It gives many benchmarks and it is one which will, I think, greatly facilitate business, especially small business, as we go down the path of expanding our trade export efforts to the world. Prime Minister",74
120,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. When you briefed the Prime Minister on 21 January about the imminent issue of a search warrant on Senator Woods's premises, did you or did you not refer to your earlier briefing to the Prime Minister in mid-September? Would It not defy credibility that you would have briefed the Prime Minister for the second time in some four months on an issue of such importance without referring back to the earlier briefing?",75
121,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am unable to give a verbatim account of what I said at that meeting. But what I can say is that it took place after a meeting on government business that had gone on for some time, and it was very, very brief. It took a very short time. All I did was indicate that I had been advised by the Federal Police that a search warrant was to be executed on Senator Woods's premises relating to allegations that related to his office. Mr O'Connor interjecting",75
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Corio! Mr GARETH EV ANS-- Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. Did you or did you not refer to the earlier briefing in the course of that albeit very brief conversation?",75
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question had been answered as completely as the Attorney General can recall. The question is out of order. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order is: how can you argue that the answer has been fully answered when the minister has not told us whether or not he referred to earlier meeting?",75
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Attorney General qualified the beginning of his answer saying that it was to the best of his recollection and that a very brief conversation ensued. School Leavers,75
125,Mrs STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. In light of the previous government's disastrous legacy of youth unemployment and this government's commitment to unemployed young Australians, I ask the minister: what is the government doing to assist 1996 school leavers to find real jobs? Mr O'Connor interjecting",75
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Corio.,75
127,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Murray for her question. I know her very deep commitment to the young people of her electorate. This government is committed to jobs for young Australians-real jobs, not the kind of short-term programs that the previous government was responsible for. Members will remember that the numbers of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force fell under the previous government to the lowest level for three decades. There is no doubt that youth unemployment is one of the most tragic problems facing this country. The government is determined to give young people, particularly school leavers, the chance to move from school directly into real jobs. Today, I announced the successful tenderers for a new program that will provide up to 4,885 permanent jobs for schoolleavers in the next three months. Forty-one public and community organisations have been contracted to match these school leavers with suitable local employers in a full range of industriesretail, tourism, hospitality, finance, sport, health and trade. I am very pleased to be able to tell members-this is a very interesting development that is now occurring-that amongst the successful tenderers were a number of high schools. They are saying that they no longer want simply to wave goodbye to school leavers at the school gate. They are acknowledging a responsibility and have a desire to do something to move their students directly into jobs. I think this is a very encouraging development. Beyond this, some 400 schools have already put up their hands to cooperate in this scheme to get young people into jobs. Mr O'Connor- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I refer to standing order 59, which suggests that the minister ought to address his comments through the chair. It is a very bad habit that the Minister for Industrial Relations has adopted.",75
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not need reminding of the conventions of the House. I thank you for your point of order. The minister is well aware of the conventions.,76
129,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Students participating in this program will receive 12 months support from the jobs brokers, even after they have moved into jobs, so that if any difficulty arises that difficulty can be smoothed out. This is a landmark program, a set of landmark decisions by the government. which will help break the unemployment cycle which demoralised so many young people under the Working Nation programs of the previous government. Indeed, the failure of the Working Nation programs is being more and more widely acknowledged. On a Perth radio program only a week ago, the Leader of the Opposition acknowledged the ineffectiveness of the Working Nation programs. He said: It is true that out of a lot of our training programs pcople did not get a job at the end of it. Did the member for Hotham hear that? I do not think the member for Hotham is too pleased with that admission. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say: Many did, but many didn't gct jobs at the end of it. But then he went on to say: But they were gainfully employed while they were on and they weren't around the streets bothering everybody else. That demonstrates the contrast between the policies of this government and the policies of the previous government. We are determined to help young people get into real jobs that will give them a sense of self-esteem and purpose in their lives, instead of putting them on the miserable merry-go-round of short-term programs that you put them on. Prime Minister Mr GARETH EV ANS-I have a further question to the Attorney-General. If he does not want to take this opportunity to add to his further answer, I ask him: did he brief any minister other than the Prime Minister on the allegations relating to Senator Woods? If so, who and when?",76
130,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did brief one other minister. The reason was that the AFP indicated to me that, in the course of their investigations, they expected to seek to inspect documents held by the Department of Administrative Services. Accordingly, I briefed the Minister for Administrative Services. My recollection is that it was around the end of September. Veteran Community",76
131,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Is the minister aware of the social isolation endured by many veterans and war widows living in rural Australia, such as those in parts of my own electorate of Fisher and in his neighbouring electorate of Maranoa? What programs are in place to support frail and ageing members of the veteran community who live in rural and regional areas?",76
132,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can assure honourable members of this House that I am acutely aware of the social isolation which afflicts many veterans who live in rural areas, particularly as they become increasingly frail. Of the 337,000 war widows, veterans and dependents who receive an entitlement from my department, 31 per cent live outside of metropolitan Australia. These people profoundly feel the effects of isolation as they become less mobile and consequently find it very difficult to maintain social contacts with many family and friends. One of the initiatives of this government, partnership with the Australian Red Cross, the expansion of the Telecross service in the remote Goldfields of Western Australia. This weekend I will be travelling to Kalgoorlie meet with those wonderful Australian volunto teers who man this service through the Ausrepeated tralian Red Cross. I will be happy to with those people because they do provide wonderful volunteer service in remote Ausmade. tralia. In essence, Telecross provides a core service to these veterans at the same time every day. That ensures that these people have a human contact each and every day. If the veteran does not answer the telephone, volunteers continue to ring and will visit the home of that person if there is no answer. am sure this is of great comfort not the veterans and the war widows who live in rural and remote parts of Australia but also their families, who worry so often about their welfare. Let me assure you that we understand the needs of the veteran community, wherever its members live in this nation. The funding to be made available to the Australian Red Cross will enable them to expand their Telecross service and train more volunteers in Western Australia. This could well be a model to be extended further across this nation. It is further demonstration of our commitment to our veterans, wherever they live. Prime Minister",76
133,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how do you reconcile your view that the Woods alleentirely gations should remain a matter for the police and not you between mid-September 1996 and 21 January 1997 with your discussion with Senator Woods on the very day you inappropriate learnt of the AFP intention to serve search warrants?",77
134,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not think there is any difficulty in reconciling those two at all. discussion I had on 21 January was initiated investigation. by Senator Woods.,77
135,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The one you forgot.,77
136,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I certainly did not. Mr Tim Fischer-He got that wrong, too.",77
137,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, he got that wrong, in too. On 21 January, Senator Woods contacted is me and asked to see me. He told me that the police were in the process of, about to, or had executed a search warrant. On 21 January we to had a discussion about the matter and he said me-and this was the substance of what I on the current affair program earlier meet this week-that there was absolutely no a substance in the allegations that had been I indicated to him that, if any charges were laid against him, he would have to stand aside. He repeated to me that the allegations were unfounded and that he believed that he had done absolutely nothing wrong in relation to things such as travel allowance and the conduct of the accounting and so forth of his I office. He understood that the allegations only to related to those sorts of matters. So on 21 January the former parliamentary to secretary informed me in some substance. It was the first discussion that he and I had had about the substance of those allegations-I having previously, as I have acknowledged, been told by the Attorney-General in the latter half of the previous year that a complaint had been made and it having been agreed between us that the law should be allowed to take its course. Can I take this opportunity to say that the important thing about this matter is that a the law has been allowed to take its course. If any principle emerges from this, then it is that, under this government, a member of parliament is not to receive favourable treatment to another citizen where an allegation of the a breach of law has been made. I hold to the view that it would have been improper for me to have informed Senator Woods of the complaint being investigated by the Federal Police. Some may even allege that that would have amounted to disclosure of information. Some would even argue that it could have amounted to tipping off Senator Woods about an investigation which could, in certain circumstances, The have represented interference with a police It remains my view that the law should be allowed to run its course. I remind the House of the warning given by the Attorney General-that is, a police investigation is still proceeding. Senator Woods, like every other Australian citizen, is entitled to a presumption of innocence. I do not believe that the government's behaviour in this matter or its handling of this matter has been in any way inappropriate. I regret the fact that I tently made an honest error in the interview I gave two nights ago on A Current Affair. I did not set out to mislead the Australian public, I have not given Senator Woods any favourable treatment, I have upheld the code of conduct of my government and I have no apology to make about my handling of this matter. Wages Growth",77
138,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. What is the government's reaction to figures released today by the ABS on wages growth?,78
139,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ABS has released its average weekly ordinary time earnings figures today. The preliminary estimates show that A WOTE for full-time adult employees increased by 1.2 per cent over the three months to November 1996, after growing by one per cent over the three months to August and by 1.3 per cent over the three months to May. The figures were slightly up on last quarter's figures, although the difference in the annual growth is not statistically significant. There is Paper. no doubt that it is a bit towards the top end of market expectations. Whilst the numbers should not be seen as evidence of any acceleration in wages growth, I think the point needs to be made that there is absolutely no room for complacency on this whole question of wages growth in terms of the better economic management of the economy. The fact is there is little substantive evidence of a slowing in enterprise bargaining wage incomes. In some industries, for example in metals, there have been some significant enterprise bargaining wage pressures. The bottom line of all this is that I think reinforces the point that the greatest risk to the wages outlook is the risk posed by the ACTU's living wage case, which is currently before the Industrial Relations Commission. If that claim were granted, then that would significantly increase wage costs leading undoubtedly to an increase in the rate of inflation. I was very interested in some remarks this morning on the television by the member for Hotham. The ALP thought it was being really inadver- clever. The government had an $8 wage increase in its submission to the commission and the ACTU was going for $20. The ALP sent the shadow minister down to the commission and he thought he would be Mr Reasonable in the middle at $14. Apparently this was the ALP's position, which has caused a certain amount of aggravation down at the ACTU headquarters. The shadow minister was down there making an application to the commission, but on this morning's television the member for Hotham, who would like to have the Leader of the Opposition's job, thought that he might bring the ACTU to his support by fully substantiating and supporting not his colleague's submission to the commission but the ACTU's submission. So the shadow minister is for $14 and the member for Hotham decided to go for $20. Why? Basically, as usual, his policy is run by the ACTU, and he was there on the TV this morning showing it for all to see.",78

142,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,78
143,Mrs SULLIVAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,78
144,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,78
145,Mrs SULLIVAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yesterday in the House of Representatives a ruling that I had given as it Deputy Speaker in the Main Committee was misrepresented to the House. I will not go through all the things that happened during a debate in the morning in the Main Committee but, in essence, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) had tried to move an amendment for which there had been virtually no warning. As the occupant of the chair, I certainly had no forewarning of the type of his amendment. When he proceeded to move it, there were a number of points of order raised against it. I tried to give the member some guidance on how he might word his amendment so that it was in order because, as he initially started to propose it, it was not in order. Consequently there were objections raised to him being able to move an amendment at all. Pages 174 and 175 of the Hansard detail it. Then, in relation to a point of order raised by the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), the member said: If it so aggrieves the member for Indi and other government members that they cannot function without a piece of paper in front of them, then I will move that the debate be adjourned and we have the full debate in the House. I said: You cannot move that the debate be adjourned once you have commenced your speech. He said: How about putting the question? He has made the fuss I started to point out to the member for Werriwa the implications of putting the question and he interrupted me. Then, when I got the chance, I said: Order! Before you get a rush of blood to the head, if you move a motionI believe I actually said 'if you move that motion'; namely, the gagthen you will no longer have an opportunity to speak on it. You will have used your opportunity to speak. If you are going to move a gag to move this back to the House then you will not be able to speak. That is the truth. You cannot speak on a gag motion. In debate later in the House the member said: I was willing to waive the debate and have it here and the Deputy Speaker said that I could not make a speech in the main chamber. Now that turns out to be incorrect advice. In fact, my advice to him was that if he moved the gag he would be gagging himself. He could not anticipate how the House was going to vote on a gag he had moved on himself. NA",78

149,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The importance to economic and employment growth of Australia increasing its share of world trade in manufactured and value added products. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",79
150,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The government's trade priorities are wrong. They are heading in the opposite direction of international trade, they are heading in the opposite direction for Australia's future, and they are heading in the opposite direction for Australian jobs. The subject matter of the MPI refers to the importance to economic and employment growth of Australia increasing its share of world trade in manufactured and value added products. What did we see yesterday in the trade statement tabled by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer)? We saw the minister's own statement refer to and document the increasing importance of manufacturers in international trade leading to a decline in Australia's share of merchandise exports. What did we also see in the minister's statement tabled yesterday? We saw that the key sectoral priorities, which the statement refers to, are for unprocessed agricultural and mining commodities. So, while the whole weight and shift of international trade is in manufactures and value added, the whole shift of the government's priorities is in respect of agricultural and mineral raw materials and commodities. That is the reason why the government's trade priorities are wrong. They would not see an increase of employment and reduction of unemployment so far as Australian jobs are concerned. The minister's own report effectively documents that. In his statement yesterday, the minister called on us to carefully examine the detail. I propose to do so and refer the House and the Minister for Trade to chapter 4.4 of his report, from page 25 through to page 27, under the heading 'The composition of world and Australian trade'. The minister's own statement yesterday says as follows: The composition and character of global trade has been undergoing considerable change over the past decade ... It goes on to say: The importance of manufactures and services in international trade is increasing. Australia's export composition has changed in line with this global trend (Figure 4.8). Indeed, Australia's move towards manufactures and services exports has been more rapid than that of the rest of the world. That said, primary commodities remain much more significant in Australia's export mix than they do in the rest of the world. That is graphically illustrated by figure 4.8, which shows the shift in international trade and also represents the decline in Australia's share of that trade in the last 20 years or so. The minister's own report goes on to speak in the following terms on page 26: Despite the growth of services and manufactures (particularly elaborately transformed manufactures) in Australia's export basket, primary productsminerals, energy, and agricultural-remain of great importance to Australia ... That is right, and on this side of the House we recognise that. But the key paragraph which follows that says: The share of Australian merchandise exports in world imports (total market share) has declined from around 1.3 per cent in 1989 to 1.1 per cent in 1995. It goes on to say: Australian exporters have increased their market shares across all major sectors of world trade with the exception of agriculture ... Yet Australia's total market share has fallen because the composition of world imports has shifted into areas where Australia has a lower total market share. What does that mean? That means the shift in international trade into manufactures, services and value added products has substantially increased and we run the very grave risk of being left behind. What do we find outlined in the report and statement tabled by the minister yesterday? What are the government's priorities? In the course of his tabling statement, the minister said that the key approach of the government was to pursue bilateral trade relationships. Chapter 10 of the minister's statement tabled yesterday outlines the key markets for trade and investments, outlines prospects and difficulties and outlines the key sectoral areas so far as a number of listed bilaterals are concerned. On page 63 of the minister's own report it says: The Chapter discusses Australia's key priorities for the next two years in these markets. The 'key priorities for the next two years in these markets'. A number of countries are listed in chapter 10. What do we find about the key sectoral targets and priorities that are listed? I will go through some of the countries referred to in chapter 10: China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan. The priorities listed for China are wool, fruit, agricultural products and mining-before you get to manufactures. There are 13 priorities listed for China. It takes until we get to No.5 before we get into an area where we see the great shift of international trade and where we see the great potential for Australia. In India, wool, mining and coal are listed before we get to manufactures. In Indonesia, fresh fruit, diary and wool are listed before we get to automotive projects. In Japan, beef, rice, diary, quarantine and sugar are listed before we get to professional services. In Taiwan, agriculture, quarantine, beef and horticulture are listed before we get to processed foods. Seeking to improve our performance in all these areas is laudable, but the minister and the government have missed the entire priority. They have missed the great change that the previous government sought to make to Australia's trade performance: reducing our overdependence upon commodities and raw materials and to move into manufactures, value adding and services. Nothing could have let the cat out of the bag better than what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said to the Weekend Australian in January: 'Anderson backs focus on raw material exports'. In the course of that article, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said: Australia should focus more on improving its exports of raw materials rather than developing processing industries, according to the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Anderson. ""It is likely that improving the quality of our materials will become much more important than value-adding,"" Mr Anderson said."" The very dangerous nature of this approachthe continuing overdependence upon raw materials in mining, resources and agriculture-was confirmed only this week by what we saw in the materials released at the ABARE Outlook Conference. 'Bleak outlook for rural industry' in the Financial Review on Wednesday and 'Low prices kill rural recovery' in the Australian. What was the ABARE commodity prices report all about? The great danger of a fall in commodity prices so far as our agricultural primary products are concerned and the great dangers so far as a continuing overdependence upon them is concerned. When the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy let the cat out of the bag in the course of January, he effectively said, 'This government is hoisting the white flag so far as value adding is concerned, so far as manufactures are concerned and so far as services are concerned.' They were the most regressive trade and industry statements that we have seen from a Howard minister to date. As I said yesterday, Minister Anderson's view predates Black Jack MCEwen's. Even Black Jack MCEwen had the view that it was possible to have commodity exports in primary and minerals industries and, at the same time, have some form of manufacturing capacity. MCEwen had his own way of ensuring a manufacturing capacity, but at least he thought you could have two thoughts in your head at the same time. This is not the view of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, it is not the view of the government, as expressed in its own report tabled yesterday, and it is contrary to all the evidence and analysis outlined and contained in the government's own report. What the government seeks to do-courtesy of this great victory in pre-MCEwen politics and courtesy of policy foisted upon the government by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-is to tum the clock back and take away all the effort and all the success that the previous government had in moving to elaborately transformed manufacraw tures and value adding. It is not enough for a continuing dependence upon agricultural and mineral primary products. We have got to be doing the things that the previous government set about: trying to ensure that information technology becomes an export industry for Australia and trying to ensure that industries such as services, telecommunications and other manufacturing products become important in that shift. That the government should take this approach is not a surprise to us on this side, because we have seen precisely this approach to trade and industry enhancement measures from the moment they came to office. The great potential gains in the areas I have referred to can be made by small and medium sized enterprises. And what are all the programs that this government has set about effectively gutting? All the programs that seek to assist in this area-EMDG, gutted by $426 million; ITES, abolished; R&DMr Tim Fischer-Over how many years?",80
151,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Over four years. If you want to be precise, Tim-and I hope you do want to be, unlike the code in your document yesterday-it is $426 million over four years. From memory, although I am happy to be corrected, it is actually $426.1 million, and you have capped it at $150 million, including the cost of administration, so you have reduced EMDG to effectively $142.5 million per annum. It is consistent with the course of conduct that you have engaged in. I was pleased to see that today's Australian editorial picked up some of these very points. It states in part: What the report reinforces is the need for the Federal Government to energise discussion of general industry policy, includingwait for it... encouragement for value-adding industries. It is disappointing, in this context, that for Primary Industries, Mr Anderson, believes Australia should only focus more on improving the quality of its raw materials exports rather than developing processing industries. It seems silly to suggest ,\ustralia should resist the opportunity of vastly increasing export returns through adding value. It goes on to say: An integral part of the growth potential of the regionour regionis the changing nature of demand. With increasing incomes ... markets in Asia are opening up for a wider range of processed foods and livestock products ... The opportunities for Australian producers ... should be encouraged by clear government thinking ... We have not had any clear thinking from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and, unfortunately, from the Minister for Trade. The very document that he tabled in this House yesterday is the very document which says that the shift in international trade is into manufactures, services and value added items. This shift, which has seen a decline in Australia's market share in international trade, is then ignored and we are pointed in entirely the opposite direction by the bilateral priorities which the minister's key sectoral priorities outline. We saw the whole thrust of this when the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy let the cat out of the bag in January: this government is essentially concerned with unprocessed primary products processed and is not interested in or concerned about trying to follow the shift in international trade and continuing the good work started by the previous government in moving to elaborately transformed manufactures and valued added items. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was also reported in his now notorious article in the Weekend Australian in January as saying: Asian economies were likely to shift more intensively into manufacturing and value-adding activities as regional trade was liberalised in the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation region ... This would lessen Australia's competitiveness in these areas while at the same time greatly boosting Asian demand for unprocessed raw materials which the Minister Australia could readily supply. The minister has that entirely wrong on two points. Firstly, he is putting up the white flag for Australian producers and manufacturers and essentially saying that we are incapable of competing in our own region. Secondly, he has missed the point-that with an increasing consumer appetite in Asia, Asia is now becoming a great marketplace for consumer items, therefore becoming a great marketplace for value added items, therefore becoming a great marketplace for the sorts of things which Australian industry, with the assistance of proper government policy, can develop and export in greater quantities. The previous government started the shift to more Australian trade in manufactures and elaborately transformed manufactures. What we saw yesterday is consistent with the regressive view of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy: a move away from continuing that development, a continuing overdependence upon commodity prices. If we do that, we go in the opposite direction to the shift in international trade and we take Australia in the opposite direction of its future, and we take it, by way of government policy, in the opposite direction of exports when increased exports would see Australian jobs increased and unemployment reduced. This government is heading Australia in the wrong direction, and doing that is a great tragedy for Australia's unemployed.",82
152,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am very glad that the Trade outcomes and objectives statement has achieved many things but one in particular this afternoon, and that is that we have a matter of public importance on trade. I understand the battles of a junior shadow minister trying to get these subjects up. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) tried once last year and was knocked off. It is important that the whole profile trade issue be focused on in here, the highest forum in the land. That is why at the last election the coalition gave a commitment to produce a comprehensive annual statement on trade, one which will be benchmarked and returned to. That is why I was particularly delighted at the start of the parliamentary session for 1997 to produce and table that comprehensive statement, to make an additional ministerial statement and to allow a proper discussion and debate on trade at the highest level. I have always been interested in the role that the member for Perth has played over the years, not just as a member but in the inner loop of the office of former Prime Minister Keating. During the summer recess I finally got around to, in addition to climbing Mount Kosciusko and doing one or two other things, reading the account by Edwards of the Keating prime ministership. Mr Stephen Smith-I read MCEwen and you read Keating.",83
153,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is a nice, communicable gesture. I am glad the honourable member was gainfully engaged in doing some reading as well. I happened to find in that book a very interesting statement. You can just see the scene: another big argument about trade and tariffs was taking place in the Prime Minister's office when suddenly Senator Button came bursting through the door. They got bogged down in a discussion which ran late because former Prime Minister Keating was never punctual-that is confirmed in the book time and again; I do not know why you did not make sure the Prime Minister was on time more often when you worked in that office-and then suddenly, in the heat of the moment during this lengthy discussion, came a plea of desperation. What did Minister Button, that very senior minister, say in that very inner loop of government? He said this: 'Down there at DFAT they have over 80 people on the multilaterals, but how many have they got on the bilaterals?' Why is it that Labor walked away from the bilateral effort? Why is it that they had no case workers getting on with the task of negotiating and exercising negotiating of the coin to gain better market access on the bilaterals? We on this side have the capacity to do all three: to pursue an integrated approach which sees more effort with the bilaterals, to continue efforts with the regional trade negotiations through the APEC process and the breakthroughs we have achieved at the multilateral level and to build on work commenced in part by former trade ministers on both sides of politics culminating in the Singapore ministerial declaration in December last year-just two months ago--reflecting a great effort on the multilaterals. I am just delighted that we have fulfilled this election commitment with the tabling of the Trade outcomes and objectives statement. The fact that this is the first ever comprehensive statement to parliament on trade policy demonstrates our determination to ensure trade policy is more actively used in pursuing our national interest. It brings to trade policy new standards of transparency and accountability, and it sets out our approach of an integrated trade policy framework which has already delivered to Australian exporters some very significant breakthroughs. I welcome the fact that there was one other admission by the member for Perth yesterday. He said, 'Of course Minister MCMullan'-the member for Canberra-'went around making statements and of course there were publications authorised and cleared by the minister and presumably he read them.' But at no stage, he admitted, did the government pull this all together to produce some form of comprehensive benchmarking or comprehensive statement. Amen to that. We have; you did not. I welcome the fact that he quoted at some length from the statement, describing parts of it as laudable. I want to now deal with the particular matters raised. First, in respect of comments that have been made in part by the United States, the Australian-United States bilateral relationship is a very important one. It is in very good shape. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has met with President Clinton. There have been high level senior ministerial talks throughout last year, and these will continue throughout this year. I have had lengthy and numerous dialogue meetings with Charlene Barshefsky, the US trade representative. Progress is being made on matters of concern on both sides of the ledger. On the matter of the Australian wheat industry, I confirm that this was investigated and a report was produced in June 1996 by the US General Accounting Office. It concluded that there was no basis for finding that the Australian Wheat Board is an unfair trader. The single desk capacity of the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian wheat industry is legitimate sovereign policy to be exercised by the Australian government, and it is one we are much more strongly about than the federal Labor government was in its period of office where it kept changing its attitude to it. It is one that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will defend as he looks and reviews aspects of the structure of the wheat industry. He also signals that, if these matters can be brought forward, Australia would be interested in looking at credit arrangements with regard to exports of the United States's wheat crop. I think this is one area where, at the end of the day, there will be a considerable and considered understanding reached. As the great Australian wheat industry, which makes such a great export contribution to Australia's trade performance, looks at different structures and the like, they might be wise to consider the fact that some of the options would involve trusts and other mechanisms which are not easily traded. Others would involve more commonly used and more commercially valuable shares to land-holders and wheat growers. They ought to be considered very carefully indeed. These are matters which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is pursuing in order to get the best structure for the Australian wheat industry for the year 2000 and beyond. That does not in any way cut across his absolute commitment to value adding. He confirmed that commitment on the floor of the House yesterday. I strongly defend his statement that he supports value adding, and that is best done where there is comparative advantage for Australia. Indeed, I quote exactly from the minister's answer to the contention put by the member for Perth: It is a misrepresentation of my position. I make it plain now, as I always have, that we must pursue value adding opportunities wherever we can. I hope that the member for Perth will take absolute note of that statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and that that is the end. of this particular matter. In the same way that you do not take responsibility for your reportage and the misrepresentation that may occur from time to time, this is a matter where this has happened. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy made a declaration at this dispatch box just a day ago-and he made it very clearly-that he supports value adding I and my colleague where it helps. He went on to make a very good point. He said that what the federal Labor government was about was a great deal of value subtracting in respect of their economic performance-value minusing. He talked about a situation in the meat industry where the cost overhead structure was such that we faced the prospect of Sizzlers and other chains of restaurants importing beef from the United States because it would have been cheaper landed and delivered in Sydney, Albury and Melbourne than Australian beef would be. It is a disgraceful circumstance. It is the outcome of years of value subtracting policies when you get down to the detail of it. I will not dwell on that, other than to turn to the waterfront and point out the exactitude of Labor's performance in that area by giving one very good example. P&O Australia are the managing agents for Botany Bay container port. They also happen to be the same company that are the managing agents for a temporary container port in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In respect of Buenos Aires, Argentina, they had two years to develop a temporary site. They did not have the best of equipment and they were in a cramped area-an old finger wharf setting-but they got their act together. This time last year they were, on a benchmark rate, shifting containers at between 35 and 40 containers an hour. On the same benchmarking, what was happening back in Botany Bay where you have permanent hard standing, state-of-the-art crane equipment, a rail connection par excellence and a dual carriageway suburban arterial road connection par excellence? On a good day, 15 containers an hour. Now you start to see why we are genuine in saying that the Labor years were about value subtracting in overheads and costs faced by our exporters and industry generally and why we are truly about value adding. One other point was made by the member for Perth which I think needs to be corrected for the record. It was the only specific criticism he turned up with regard to the Trade outcomes and objectives statement-and he is quietly furious that his side never got around to doing one in its 13 years of government. I refer to the matter of Mexican wool tariffs. I said all along that there were breakthroughs over time and they came in two stages, and this is what the shadow minister forgets. Yes, back in January of last year there was a movement with regard to wool topsMr Stephen Smith-Just a movement.",83
154,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There was a reduction to zero in regard to wool tops. But it was in January this year that further action was taken. I quote from a cable from a meeting on these matters which I had in my capacity as Minister for Trade well after the Labor Party had left government. The cable states: Mr Fischer subsequently raised the matter of noils and waste at the second meeting of the JTIC in Canberra in June 1996 and received assurances from Mexican Trade Minister Blanco that the exemption would be referred to Mexico's Foreign Trade Commission with a favourable recommendation. We have been following up regularly since then and our efforts have now achieved the results we wanted. It has been an effort to bring about the final reduction which was designed with regard to wool noils and waste, and that has commenced from 1 January 1997. It was gazetted in December by the Mexican government. I thank the Mexico government for their clear-cut decision. Mr Stephen Smith interjecting",85
155,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What you do not realise is that there were two types: firstly, wool tops, a reduction which took place under you; and, separate to that, wool Hoils and wool wastes. These are quite properly claimed as being part of a win-win situation for the wool industry and the opening up of a Mexican wool pipeline of considerable value to industry-and detailed well enough in the Trade outcomes and objectives statement. I want to say in very clear-cut terms that the Australian coalition government has been in office for some 10 months and it has been and is a very busy period. We have dealt with a number of key issues, some emerging from left field and others having been left to us by the outgoing federal Labor government, most particularly the budget deficit circumstances, the Beazley black hole-a fact they had not addressed and something they were warned of repeatedly. Indeed, it was revealed in very categorical terms in that same book on Keating which came out after the 1993 election. Of course, they just failed to cut the mustard in getting the budget back towards a surplus, notwithstanding periods of economic growth. That was something we had to rectify. We had to rectify it in the interests of exporters and we had to rectify it in the interests of providing a lower interest rate framework for small, medium and large business. This matter of trade policy cannot be divorced from the domestic circumstance. Yes, there have been adjustments to the export market development grants scheme. might add that, in terms of the budget nouncement there, the tourist industry is to lifted to a full rate of export market developoff ment grant-something Labor never did. We have proceeded with the lifting of the tourist industry to a full rate of EMDG. We are providing assistance whilst constrained by the budgetary circumstance we inherited from federal Labor government. We are moving close up that deficit. We are providing a framework which has lowered interest rates. We are still continuing with the export market development grants scheme, but making it a simpler, more effective scheme and one less able to be mrted, because I am not interested in providing grants under the EMDG scheme for people who are not exporting but simply lifting the money out of the scheme. I believe that after two days the Trade outcome,\ . ,nd objectives statement walks When it j, circulated widely, it will do so even more it is a very good and comprehenmost si ve first effort in finally bringing the whole issue of trade to this, the highest forum in land. I thank those in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and elsewhere who greatly helped in the compilation of this statement. But, more particularly, I look forward to further breakthroughs on the policy market access front. (Time expired)",85
156,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I suppose even in the dullest speeches you learn something. I have learned today from the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) that there is some symmetry between the threats Mexican Minister for Trade and Industrial Development, Mr Blanco, and our minister who is Mr Blank in terms of any substantive contribution. Mr Tim Fischer-It isn't nice to insult the Mexican minister for trade-very unwise and very stupid.",86
157,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a reference to you, Minister, rather than to the Mexican minister: Minister Blank, the Minister for Trade from Australia. It is an important time for this to come before the parliament because we had a pretty weak effort yesterday by the Minister for Trade on trade matters, and we have had an even weaker one today. We had the situaI tion yesterday where the Minister for Primary anIndustries and Energy (Mr Anderson) was be even more pathetic in his attempts to wiggle the problem he has caused for himself with his comments about Australian's dependence on commodity trade. It is an important time for this discussion because it comes a couple of days after the report by the Australthe Ian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource to Economics that forecasts commodity prices into the future and shows the stupidity of the approach that has been outlined by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The debate also comes after the government has continued its approach of slash and bum on the range of important policies that were put in place by the previous government to ensure that value added exports, manufactured exports, particularly elaborately transformed manufactured exports, were matters that were tall. getting the attention they needed. After all, those areas of world trade are the rapidly growing aspects of world trade. They are the areas where Australia really has the to increasingly make its mark if it is to survive in a very competitive world. Those areas which the government has knocked off completely are DIFF and the trade enhancement programs. We have already heard from trade the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) about export market development grants and cuts that have occurred there. We are all aware in this House of the attack by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on the importance of research and development. We have seen the to the car industry and the pharmaceutical industry. We are aware of the attacks that the government has made on bounties on various important components of our manufacturing and value added effort. Appropriately, the Financial Review today is carrying a story on a report that the government has from consultants on the competitiveness of Australia in the rapidly growing area of world trade: information technology. President Clinton, I think to his credit, has MPI achieved very significant reform and liberalisation of information technology trade internationally. What does this report say about Australia? The most fundamental thing is its criticism of Australian government industry policies which are simply not competitive-this is the government's own report-with governments such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Malaysia. The report says: Australia is only getting a tiny share of internationally mobile foreign direct investment in electronics and other information industry sectors ... Yet the Asia-Pacific rim is now the focus of more than 45 per cent of global electronic production and is receiving more than 60 per cent of new investment in the strategically crucial semi-conductor fabrication activity. That is precisely the point which the minister missed of the MPI introduced by the member for Perth: under this government, Australia is simply not being competitive-and it has been told so by its own reports-and does not have the appropriate policies in place to address areas that are critically important in the growth of world trade. The debate also comes at a time when we had the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook forecast by the Treasurer, which presented a revised net export contribution to GDP growth of a negative quarter of a per cent-that is, net exports are a negative factor on our economy in the context where we desperately need that contribution to our economy to create the jobs that we, as Australians, all need. So it is singly important that this parliament devote considerable attention to this area. Without unduly confusing the House, I do not often quote Malcolm Fraser in positive waysMr Leo MCLeay interjecting",86
158,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes. Malcolm Fraser, when he is not masquerading as an Easter Island granite platform and scaring tourists to those places, occasionally writes articles to the Australian. In an article that he wrote that impressed me back in January he made the following comments: Shortly before Christmas the sugar industry was served notice that it would lose all import protection by the middle of this year. The Productivity Commission report on the automotive industry recommends that tariffs be reduced to 5 per cent. The report goes on to discuss sugar and that, perhaps, should be the subject of further debate. On the automotive area, he says: In the automotive industry we have a similar circumstance. East and South-East Asian countries producing motor cars do so under very heavy protection, running to quotas and to tariffs up to 200 per cent. They do this because they are determined to expand their own industries. The US limits the import of Japanese cars to 16 per cent of the domestic market and has a 25 per cent duty on light commercial vehicles. The Europeans limit the importation of Japanese cars to 8 per cent of the European Union's market. Where is the recognition of this uneven playing field? The Australian car industry, picking one example, is currently subject to debate because of the attention the Productivity Commission is giving it. Where does this reflect itself in the report that this government has presented? One of the very few references, which I frankly think is somewhat bizarre in the report that the minister tabled yesterday in the context of Japan, our major trading partner, was where he said 'there are no specific barriers of concern to Australia in the context of auto and auto parts'. One does not have to be a regular reader of the financial press, including today's Financial Review, to realise that there are massive problems in relation to barriers to access, particularly from the US, to Japanese auto markets and auto component markets. We have a situation where we are simply not on a level playing field. Our automotive manufacturers are facing a situation, driven by blind ideulogy in the absence of an industry plan of the sort that the previous government had under the Button car plan with its focus on exports, where those crucial links between further trade liberalisation-which the former government embarked on-and progress being made by trading partners and of proper industry policy development are simply being missed by this government. There is a range of other areas in this report that we had from the minister yesterday which shows lack of substance. We have references in the report to the importance of this year being the Year of South Asia, yet our Prime Minister (Mr Howard), in what could have been an immensely symbolic gesture, simply failed to go to India despite the expectations of the Indian authorities. It is good to see the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in the chamber because he, along with me, is aware of the importance of that market. I think we are also aware of the importance the Indian authorities were placing on Australia's involvement in it and the opportunities that would have been presented if the Prime Minister had attended, but he simply failed in that important symbolic gesture. We have a pretty wimpy response in the report to the United States-our second largest market but also, frankly, our most difficult, given the trade imbalance that exists. We are aware of the 'roll over on your tummy and scratch me' approach that the government has taken to the United States efforts on the Howe Leather matter. This minister has failed singly to sort out the problem that Australia's biggest company, BHP, is facing in its project with Iran and Pakistan because of the US seeking, in an extraterritorial way, to apply its law. So what does the minister do? He takes the big stick out to Hungary-Hungary of all countries. I am sure in Budapest they are absolutely terrified of this threat, this aggressive bilateralism and attack on Hungary, by this government in international forums. It really shows the lack of substance of the minister and this government. Mr Leo MCLeay-Tough Tim, hey?",87
159,Mr SERCOMBE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, Tough Tim IS taking on Budapest. He is not prepared to take it up to Washington and address the really hard questions that go to Australian trade. He wants to run off to Budapest. As I said when I started this speech, blank by name, blank by nature. (Time expired)",88
160,Mr NUGENT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I make my comments specifically, I would like to respond to some of the comments made by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the previous speaker, the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe). I suppose I have to extend some sympathy to the two opposition speakers because they are really scratching to find anything of substance to talk about. We have produced a very meaty document-Trade outcomes and objectives statement-and all they can do is scratch a bit around the edges. It seems to me that the member for Perth, for example, really did not have any significant criticisms to make. We got down to looking at some of the tables of priorities. He suggested to this House that the tables under the various country headings had as key priorities agricultural and primary industry matters. Any cursory reading of the document-let alone a deep reading, which you would have expected from the shadow minister for trade-would demonstrate quite clearly that those tables are not meant to be in priority order. They are laid out to a format. In fact, if you read the footnote to each of those tables, and I draw the shadow minister's attention in particular to page 72 of the report, you will find it says very clearly-and this is repeated at every single set of tables-'For reasons of commercial confidentiality and the protection of Australia's negotiating position, this column contains only some selective desired outcomes'. It is not in priority sequence-it makes no claim to be-yet we heard at least five minutes of drivel from the gentleman from Perth about the fact that we had got the wrong priority order. It is just a straight distortion. That is unfortunately something we have come to expect. We also heard something about the EMDG scheme and the changes to that scheme. But, of course, he did not talk about the very constructive things, which organisations like Austrade are standing up and applauding, we are doing by starting to change that scheme. He quoted from the Australian. If I have time, I will do some of my own quoting from today's Australian. He also spent a lot of time attacking the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) for putting primary industries first. I would have thought that that was very much the role of the minister. The Minister for Trade and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) has given us a very balanced approach. As the member for Maribyrnong said, I spent a week or so with him in India last year looking at a number of these matters. I was disappointed that he felt it necessary to open his speech not in any constructive and positive way, which I think people would like to see conducted in this House, but in a way which resorted to trivial abuse of the minister. He talked about Minister Blanko and all that sort of thing. It does him and his side of this chamber no credit at all. On the competitiveness of industries like Australian information technology, which does have a number of major problems, I draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that this government has been here for 10 months. Those problems have not occurred just in the last 10 months; they have occurred over the last 15 years. What we are talking about is the legacy of the 13 years or so of the previous government's administration. People in glasshouses really are not in a position to throw stones. There are of course good opportunities in India. It was unfortunate the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was not able to go. The Deputy Prime Minister and a number of other ministers went. Only this morning I received a briefing from Austrade, which was extremely positive on the outcome of that new horizons program in India. Let me remind the House that in this matter of public importance we are talking about The importance to economic and employment growth of Australia increasing its share of world trade in manufactured and valued added products.' We might also add 'services' to that statement and it would be a general statement that most people would obviously agree with. Australia certainly has outstanding opportunities in many countries in the health field, the education field, the environmental management field and a whole range of other fields. I thought there was a very interesting item on the front page of this morning's Australian written by Greg Sheridan, the foreign editor. In reporting on this document, which has been the subject of discussion this afternoon, Greg Sheridan wrote: ONE statistic from Tim Fischer's trade statement yesterday is more eloquent than the rest of the pages put together. And it is a very important statement. He continued: It tells you everything you really need to know about Australia's trade performance. Between 1989 and 1995and I would remind the House that that was when the Labor Party was in governmentAustralia's exports as a share of global imports declined from 1.3 per cent to 1.1 per cent. In other words, Australia is a nation of declining relevance in global trade. Despite all the changes of the past decade-and-ahalf, despite all the increase in Australian exports, our exports are still growing more slowly than global exports. We are falling further and further behind. We may have changed more rapidly than at any time in our past, but the cruel facts are that we have not changed fast enough to keep up with the demands of the global economy. Our trade performance is poor and we will have less ability to control our own economic destiny as a result. That is the legacy that the previous government left to this government, and that is what we are trying to fix up. It is the sort of legacy that they do not like to talk about. But it becomes a bit rich when the gentleman from Perth stands in here and criticises us for our poor performance and quotes how badly we are doing in the world when he, as either a member of the previous government or a senior adviser in the office of the Prime Minister of the previous government, was an integral member of that government's bequeathing to this country of this quite appalling state of affairs. I would now like to refer to this document Trade outcomes and objectives statement which was tabled yesterday by the Minister for Trade. If one turns, for example, to chapter 10, one very quickly has an opportunity to see many of the opportunities that are here. The gentleman from Perth was complaining that we were preoccupied with primary industry. I draw his attention to page 65 of the document which deals with China. It says: In recent years, manufactures exports, such as high speed ferries, optical fibre cable, and telecommunications equipment have increased. We have in fact been moving in that direction 200 and we are starting to make further changes in the things that we are advocating in this report. We have listed in the annexe to that section, on page 72, a whole list of key areas where we are going to put priorities over the next couple of years. It is not only in the wool area and the fruit area, important as those are, but also in manufactures, automotive components and a number of service areas such as banking, legal and insurance, telecommunications, education, engineering and accounting. There is a vast opportunity in China. Equally, there is a vast opportunity in Hong Kong. A number of members of this House, including those from the other side, were in Hong Kong a couple of weeks ago on other matters but, as a by-product, we were able to see some of the outstanding work being performed overseas by Australian companies and taking advantage of those opportunities. If one goes on through this report-and there is not time to go through every chapter-and turns to the section, for example, on Indonesia, it talks not just about agricultural products but very clearly about major ETM exports, including processed metals, machinery, building products, transport equipment and electrical products. One could say exactly the same sort of thing in respect of Malaysia. I have had the pleasure of being in Malaysia in the last few months and I know that the Prime Minister intends to go there some time this year. He will see at first-hand, in talking to companies in Malaysia, the outstanding opportunities that we are starting to create. This government is all about putting in place the infrastructure and the opportunities for Australian companies to get out there and take advantage of that situation. One of the things that this government has done is to undertake major restructuring of Austrade so that it is more responsive to the areas of need of Australian companies that want to get into overseas business-not just the big companies but also the small companies. I could go on to talk about Japan, Korea, Singapore and a whole range of others, but perhaps I could conclude by again quoting from Greg Sheridan at the conclusion of his article this morning in which he said: It is ... part of the ongoing process of educating1996 he is talking about trade liberalisation and trade outcomesAustralians about the overriding importance of trade to their future. But the bottom line is the bottom line. Australia is a very small part of world trade. And it is getting smaller. And that's bad news. That is right. That is what we inherited from the Labor Party and that is what this government is all about fixing up. (Time expired)",88

164,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"The last answer I gave during question time may, in one area, have contained an ambiguity, so I wish to make it clear to the House that when Senator Woods saw me on 21 January the search warrant against his premises had already been executed. I have separately been informed that it was in fact executed on the morning of 21 January. While I am on my feet, may I inform the House that since question time. I have spoken to my chief adviser and my media staff.

165,Mr HARDGRAVE,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I only intend to take a few more moments of the time of the House on this matter. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is a very important bill. It will very much enhance the discipline, transparency, accountability and openness which apply to the conduct of government in this country, particularly during the hurly-burly of elections. In the past-most recently at the last election-we often saw governments of the day holding back the true picture as far as the books were concerned. When I commenced my remarks before question time. I quite clearly made the point this is simply not good enough. The books we as parliamentarians are talking about are not ours to control and conceal; they are matters which we deal with because of the trust placed in us by the Australian people. As a result of this bill, governments will be required to factor in the mediumand long term impact of their fiscal policies and reveal them to Australians so they can also plan their role in the economy. It is not just the shortterm impact of government policies we are dealing with here. It was certainly the increasing practice of the previous failed Labor administration. This bill means fiscal policy will incorporate short-term issues, such as cyclical economic downturns, while recognising there is a great importance in mediumterm issues, such as the sustainability of government debt and government saving, matters which obviously, as the various election cycles through the 1980s proved, the previous government simply chose to ignore between elections and hide at election times. I have always believed in open, honest and accountable government. I think it is a basic tenet which most people in this place always seek to uphold. Put simply, if a government is doing its job properly it should never be afraid to open up the books which it administers. As a member of the Liberal Party from Queensland, I appreciate the sacrifice of some who have gone before me, particularly those members in the state parliament such as Ian Prentice and Guelf Scassola, who back in 1983 moved for a public accounts committee in the Queensland state parliament. They wanted the people to know back then what was happening in the books in the state of Queensland. Those people and those who supported them were proved right in the long term, even though they were unfairly judged at an election which followed soon after their moving of suspension of standing orders in an attempt to try to convene the public accounts committee. I guess it is a case of being wise after the act. If the public accounts committee system had begun to operate from 1983 onwards in Queensland, perhaps a lot of the political fallout which came out of the Fitzgerald inquiry process may never have eventuated. I think all in this place would agree-the Fitzgerald inquiry unfortunately become evidence confirming the very worse thoughts of a lot of people in this country about politicians. Yet it could have been averted if there had been a system of openness, honesty and accountability in place. Here in the federal parliament matters of openness, honesty and accountability are very well exercised but are now going to be even further enhanced as a result of this bill. The sums involved in the situations involving members of parliament in Queensland are totally insignificant when you compare them with the sums which have been involved most recently in the failure of the previous government to disclose the true picture of the books. This failure was perpetrated in particular by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) when he was finance minister. There are plenty of newspaper clippings in the parliamentary library within this building which can prove this point, so I will not labour the point in this House any longer. But one thing is certain-such disregard for the views of average Australians and such disregard for allowing average Australians to know just how well or otherwise the stewardship of the books has been conducted should never occur again. For those sorts of reasons, this bill is very important. It really is a matter of trust. It matter of raising the standard. This is one of the key themes of this Howard government. This bill will also give greater certainty to average Australians. They will be able to plan beyond the election cycle. They will be able to understand the government is not simply looking at what will keep them in office next time around but is, in fact, looking at the medium and longer term as well as the shortterm cycles. Let us face it, when an election is called, all too often it kills off economic activity. We cannot allow it to be a continuing cycle in this country any longer. Most of all, this bill will ensure all in this place and those in the other place lift their game. With the books wide open, it is quite simple-we cannot hide the facts. People will be able to see just how well we have conducted government in this country on behalf of the people of Australia. For all those reasons, there is no doubt this bill will be very well received in the Australian community. I commend it to the House.",91
166,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"This has been an interesting debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. It has been interesting to hear parliamentarians on the government side in speaking to legislation about a charter of budget honesty being so dishonest. The dishonesty from almost every speaker opposite that I have heard or in every speech that I have read has been amazing. Just now a reference to newspaper reports in the last election implied that the then government knew the Treasury estimates. The whole argument has been based on the fact that the government knew the figures and would not release them. They know that that is not true. But in 1983 John Howard did know. We did not see Ted Evans come forward last year and say, 'I told the Treasurer the figure,' as John Stone did in 1983. In 1983, John Stone, the Secretary to the Treasury, came forward publicly and confirmed that he had advised the then Treasurer prior to the election of the $9.6 billion budget deficit in prospect. That is $25 billion in today's terms. Ted Evans has not done the same. This whole argument has been hung on is a such a dishonest principle. They preach to us piously about budget honesty. Almost every speaker was saying the same thing. The member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) was fascinating. He talked about the $200 billion foreign debt and then said that $ I 00 billion of it is the government's. How dishonest can you get? He was lecturing and preaching to us about honesty. Virtually every single speaker has done just that. Mr Hardgrave-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I simply say that I take great exception to",92
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member for Moreton may take as much exception as he likes, but there is not a valid point of order.",92
168,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I take extreme exception to the dishonesty that has been flowing around in this debate. The member for Lyne, as I said, talked about a $200 billion foreign debt and then said that $100 billion of it is the government's. He knows that is wrong. We all know that is wrong. What kind of honesty can we expect from those opposite when they do that? There have been constant references to the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. Some members opposite have said that the previous government ignored the recommendations. The report was tabled on 29 November 1995-in the last weeks of the last parliament. Who do you think you are kidding? By the way, as members now know-those who are new may not have known before but will now understand-parliamentary inquiries require ministerial consent. In other words, the previous Treasurer, the previous government, endorsed that inquiry. It was chaired by a Labor parliamentarian and had a majority of government members. In other words, the Labor government was encouraging further evolution of the reporting system. But some of the key elements of the committee's recommendations have been dropped, some of the really important ones which were about honesty-for example, the ones about the figures being vetted by the departments, not by the Treasury. The fact is that we have just seen a review come forward which we know is shonky. It is as shonky as the last budget of the now Prime Minister. We all know that growth will not be the figure that has been projected in the budget and restated in the review. This Treasury review came through the Treasurer's office. It has been fiddled. The Treasurer could not fiddle some of the projections, but he fiddled the others to try to lessen his own little deficit. Here he is five months after budget and he is already up to over $3 billion, and it will get bigger. Mr Hardgrave-At least he came forward and told us.",92
169,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"He is not honest at all. He is being dishonest because the true figure is greater. The growth figures have been fiddled. They have been fiddled in the Treasurer's office. Mr Bruce Scott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The speaker is really casting aspersions of dishonesty on this side of the House, particularly in reference to the Treasurer. I take exception to his aspersions of dishonesty of members on this side of the House.",93
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Mr Andrew)Order! The Minister for Veterans' Affairs does not have a valid point of order. Once again, I call the member for Newcastle. He is aware of the need to be temperate in his language.",93
171,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very aware of the language. I am very aware of all the claims and accusations made by those opposite over the last 11 months and particularly during this debate. The Treasurer has the option of being in here but, quite frankly, if I were him I would not waste my time because this is such a lightweight exercise. The real key, which came forward from the parliamentary committee, was the distinction between the political office and the departmental office. The committee wanted and recommended that the figures being put forward be not vetted by the Treasurer. That has not been adopted. In fact, the Treasurer has kept the fix in for himself. What the Labor Party wanted on that committee has not been agreed to, yet those opposite have not only lambasted us for not adopting the recommendations in the report, which was tabled in the last weeks of the last parliament, but also gutted some of the key elements of it. Whether or not history is important, there were two fascinating things about 1982 and 1983. The first one was the deficit in 1983, but the more interesting one was the last Howard budget of August 1982 when the the unemployment figures for the whole year had already been exceeded by the time they were actually tabled. That budget was so shonky. Go back and look at the figures and see how much it blew out by and look at the speech that was made at the time they were tabled. By the time they were tabled the figures were already out of date. The then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, came into this parliament with a budget which was as shonky as any of all time. He made Phil Lynch's rubbery figures look like they were casts of steel. That was the last budget of the last Liberal government. You have improved. This time your figures have taken five months to be out, but back in 1983 they were out by the time you tabled them. When I say that the figures in this current budget review are false, the fact is that the Reserve Bank has made it pretty clear in its comments that it knew retail sales were down and the Treasurer in his remarks made it clear that he knew retail sales were down. The growth figures for the last quarter of the calendar year, the December quarter, may be negative. They may not, but it will be very close to zero. Therefore, the projected budget growth of 3114 per cent is not going to happen. We know that. We have known that for months. Yet in the budget review what did you focus on? 'That rotten Treasury; they have given us bad forecasts.' Welcome to the world. Go and look at the forecasts in the last honesty? budget of the previous government. Go and look at the forecasts of every budget. There is a difference between the Treasurer's office fiddling, massaging and printing the figures. If you were so genuine about your concern, change the legislation so the Treasurer's office cannot interfere. If you are so concerned, get the Treasurer's fingers out of this process. If you are so concerned, make it come from Treasury and the Reserve Bank alone, not from the Treasurer's office. We have heard so much about honesty. I think today of all days it is ironic that we are debating this. What does this whole business actually mean? We have seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) admitting, almost hourly, to having misled the parliament and the public. We have seen the Prime Minister admitting that things get forgotten. 'To the best of my recollection' is now stamped across the Prime Minister's forehead forever and a day. What is wrong with his memory? His short-term memory is disastrous. What about the honesty of this whole budget approach. We are all being inundated with responses from constituents. You are being inundated as much as I am. I had a case as recently as today of a person losing social security benefits. Fortunately, he came to me. Fortunately, he actually got up and complained. This man was supposed to receive a letter in the mail. Because he had not responded to the letter, he was cut off benefits. He has got no money. It is just gone. This man had worked for the last 15 years. His employment record is superb. He is not someone who has been a long-term beneficiary. After hours of argument and checking, this afternoon the department finally acknowledged that the letter was not sent. You are all getting complaints related to Austudy. We are; you are. You are all getting social security complaints. You all know that we are being inundated. What is the cost of that? What is the cost of what you are doing? Can you put a dollar figure on that man's angst today? Can you put a cost on what we are doing to the community out there with all these supposed savings and all this supposed People think honesty means being open, not fiddling around with numbers. What you have told the world is that people on the dole are all bludgers. They are all now guilty before they start. This man was told, 'We never make mistakes. It is your fault. You are off benefits.' Mr Hardgrave- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",93
172,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"It better be a genume one. Mr Hardgrave-It is a genuine point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am certain that the member for Newcastle does not wish to infer that you call people who are unemployed 'dole bludgers'.",94
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I thank the member for Moreton for his point of order. I deliberately had not interrupted the member for Newcastle because of the number of interjections he had had, with assistance from the members for Moreton and North Sydney. But the member for Moreton is quite right to remind the member for Newcastle of his obligation to speak through the chair and not use the term 'you'.",94
174,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Of course, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would never imply that, as you well understand. The fact is: what is going on in the community is not honest. It is deceitful. You misled people into some false notion of crisis when there was not one, and there has not been one. Last March people were not voting on economic crisis, but now they have got one. You talked the economy down. The government has frightened people enormously and is now trying to jawbone them into spending their money because it has got them so terrified. The government's attempt to justify its own ideology has led it into the greatest trap of all-the use of fear to attack their opponents. In doing that, you have to recognise that people will listen to you. They think, 'If it is so bad, I should worry.' They have worried and they have been worrying ever since. They were not worried about the future in March of last year, but they are worrying about it now. People have cut spending and confidence is down. All the business investment in the world is not going to solve that because the fact is, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, coming from South Australia, that an awful lot of our investment now is going into the mining industry. The more we invest in mining, the fewer jobs there are. Our mining exports have grown by 128 per cent over the last 12 years or so while the work force has gone down by 10 per cent. We are speaking about this wonderful government and the honesty of it all! Let us look at the change in job numbers and the confidence of the community. In 1982, when the now Prime Minister was Treasurer, the decline in the manufacturing work force was eight per cent. In one year under John Howard, eight per cent of people working in manufacturing lost their jobs. That is an amazing figure. Yet we are now being lectured by the same man, who wants to talk about honesty. Has he ever admitted to that? Has he ever owned up to what he did and to why he was then so unpopular? Honesty is not simply about fiscal matters. We have seen gross dishonesty in relation to the aged care system with the idea that upfront fees would somehow generate more money rather than less, to mask the half a billion dollars in cuts in capital grants. You all know this now because I do not doubt that nursing homes and hostels in the constituencies of honourable members are now coming forward, telling members what the facts are and what this is going to do to their hostels and nursing homes. I am getting it. I do not doubt that other members of parliament are as well. That is dishonest. The implication was that it was going to attract $130 million worth of investment in aged care services, in residential services. It is not. It never was going to. That was always dishonest. The ones who have been hurt most viciously in recent days are young Australians. The Austudy cases I am getting are mind blowing. I am just tearing my hair out. We saw the minister today washing his hands of the issue. I could not believe the absolute dishonesty of that approach. He was washing his hands of the matter saying, 'We have put all these people on the phone lines.' Fat lot of use that is! People are being told that it is going to take three months for their cases to be reviewed. I know of a case of a single parent asked to take into account all her spending for the next year, including income from all sources. Knowing that she qualifies for Austudy, of course she included the Austudy income in the figure, as she would have to do in all honesty. Guess what? That rules her out of Austudy. She thought, 'That must be a mistake-a simple clerical mistake.' Can we get that corrected? No, we cannot. It has to go to Canberra for review, and they are taking up to three months because there are something like 20,000 cases the same. That is honesty for you. Look across the board at young Australians, whom we had all that campaigning about. There was the youth bus up the coast, all those meetings and thousands of young Australians turning out to indicate that they wanted to have confidence in the coalition. What has the government done to them? The government has shifted the Austudy age of independence to 25, so anybody starting a university course under 25 whose parents' income disqualifies them from Austudy will never get it. That is the first thing. The government also made the means test apply to young Australians on jobsearch until they are 21. In other words, they under parental responsibility until they are 21. It also changed the Austudy rules. It is not about helping them; it is about saying that they are all cheating. The implication all the way through this is that everybody is a cheat, a liar, a fraud and a crook. They are guilty so they have to prove their innocence. Members of the government all know this because they are all getting the complaints that we are getting and they are hurting. At the same time there is increased HECS funding so we are seeing people suddenly moving away from studying sciences. In the parliament this week the Prime Minister made an absolute fool of himself with regard to comments of the Victorian Minister for Education. He did not realise that an minister had, in fact, accurately projected that the HECS increases were causing decline in science enrolments. They have cut university funding as well. This is great confidence in young Australhe ians. The future of the country is being gutted. They are being told, 'We will not support you. There is no place for you. You are still under your parents' control and your debt. parents' income.' What is more, they are being told, 'Your parents are cheating.' That is what they are being told. This is terrific stuff! Then members of the government start talking about us when we were in governwarm ment. I just cannot believe the dishonesty is involved. For them to get up there and start lecturing about budget honesty! Budget friend honesty is about telling people what you debate. mean to do and what you are actually doing. The idea of cloaking it all in numbers and fiscal rectitude and so on is a load of codsthat wallop because, as far as the people out there are concerned, budgets and those things are not what affect them. They are affected your policies. If you are being blatantly dishonest you are doing and are then pretending that it is all about these projections, people might believe it for the first few months, but already they are realising that your projections are all that good anyway-the ones you attacked us for in the last couple of years. The billion deficit we are just seeing emerging will be bigger and bigger because you are killing the economy. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew-not you, but you are one of the government which is doing it-you must share part of the blame and part of the responsibility as a member of parliament and a member of government. Sure, we support it in principle, but it is fraudulent. (Time expired)",94
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"Mr Andrew)I deliberately did not interrupt the member for Newcastle, but I remind him that he was, in fact, in error to imply that whilst in the chair the I was a member of the government and was sharing part of the blame. When I am seated the Victoriin the chair, I am the chair.",96
176,Mr HOCKEY,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I welcome the opportunity to follow the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). I look forward to him reporting to the House what the national foreign debt is, given that accused the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) of misleading the House about the matter. I think we deserve a correction from the member for Newcastle on the details of the foreign When speaking in this place it is sometimes easy to forget that there are people out there listening to the radio broadcast of parliament. They may be in their cars, in their lounge rooms, at work or sitting on the beach on a sunny Australian afternoon. I know that that a few of our mums and dads are listening to the broadcast and I am sure that a very old of mine, Otto, is also listening to this I would like to tell Otto about a fiscal initiative I know he would be very proud ofis, the charter of budget honesty. At first glance, Otto would say that this charter is long overdue. The charter of budget honesty by is what it says-a genuine attempt to be honest about where the budget is at and, most in what importantly, where it is going. One of the major initiatives in this bill is to provide for an intergenerational report card. It is somewhat ironic that, in a nation and in not a parliament such as this, where we sometimes struggle to deal with the great com$3 plexities of our society on such a regular basis, a process of preparing a report card on our fiscal direction is such a simple idea. What a terrific initiative! Under this proposal at least once every five years, the government will release a report on the long-term sustainability of current government fiscal policies. By 'long-term', we mean 40 years into the future. In a sense, for my friend Otto this may be seen as a report card into history. The intergenerational report will project the effects of current fiscal management. It will report on the impact of current revenue and expenditure programs. It is the use of a fairly trendy form of modem accounting known as 'intergenerational accounting methodology', where 40-year projections of things such as demographic data, productivity, employment and all the other variables in the nation are considered in the context of current policy. As my good friend Otto knows only too well, it is always a dangerous ask to predict budget variables into the long term, let alone 40 years hence. Indeed, making assumptions about long-term budgetary outcomes is a hairy business. I am perhaps one of the very few people in this House to have just a touch of sympathy for Treasuries around Australia. Despite all the moaning words of the opposition, Treasury forecasts should be kept in perspective. For example, a one per cent error margin in a Commonwealth budget of $266 billion is over $5 billion. Even in the most accurate and respectable financial forecasts there is usually a one per cent margin of error allowed for. I might add that, often from a statistical point of view, financial forecasters are relying on more certain information than figures such as inflation, GDP growth and even wages growth may provide. My generosity to the Treasury does not, however, extend to the opposition. There is little doubt that in this debate there has been quite a deal of revelation about exactly what the previous Prime Minister and the previous Minister for Finance said prior to the election about the state of the Commonwealth budget. But they made a $10 billion miscalculation, a $10 billion mistake. It is worth reminding the House about some of the words of the previous Prime Minister prior to the March election in 1996. On 30 January 1996 on AM, Paul Keating said: But again, let me remind you, Fran, we have the Budget in surplus. I mean, how many governments around the world have got a Budget in surplus? I have a further quote from this program-and it is obviously a program the previous Prime Minister was very fond of. He said: So I mean, this government has been, certainly in the Western world, in the OECD area, the high priests of budget accountability, and we've remained that. I mean, I don't know why you wasted the time with a question like this. That is typical Keating aplomb. On 8 February 1996, AAP reported Prime Minister Keating as saying that there is no problem about the portents of the Australian budget. Then on 13 February 1996-so we are inching closer to that budget period-AAP again, the Prime Minister said: The budget is in surplus. At source, we don't have an underlying problem. Then we had this beauty, this great Keatingesque charm. In the Australian Financial Review on 14 February-the Valentine's Day massacre, you could argue-Paul Keating says: The budget, for God's sake, is in surplus for this year in the middle of the year. We have surpluses in prospect for the next three years. It may be forgivable if it were someone who could claim to be ill-informed or misled about the state of the nation's budget, but the thing is that the Prime Minister at that time, Paul Keating, knew what the state of the budget was. This was verified by the statement from the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on 29 January, when he told the third Australian Pensioners and Investments Conference: This strategymeaning fiscal consolidationhas led to a small budget surplus in 1995-96 and growing surpluses forecast over our forward estimates period. So what happened was that both the former Minister for Finance and the former Prime Minister were saying, 'No, the budget will be in surplus.' That was a $10 billion miscalculation. I have always been curious since the day of the election to understand how the Australian Labor Party would handle it. Perhaps they would do well, given the recent court case outcome, to ask Mr Alan Bond to give the ALP a line on how explain away some multibillion dollar miscalculations. The mistake was significant. It would almost be forgivable to allow for a miscalculation of that proportion if the Australian Labor Party did not have form on this issue, if they did not have good form on the fact that they have always played with rubobviously bery figures. The most obvious example of this-and I refer to the previous speech of the member for Newcastle-was when Tony state Cole, the previous Secretary to the Treasury, advised the Australian public that the One Nation figure estimates were prepared not Treasury, not by the Department of Finance, not even by the Reserve Bank but by the Prime Minister's office. They were rubbery figures-changing the figures to suit the situation. I am pleased that the intergenerational report will be based on Treasury estimates, not rubbery figures. I am also pleased that the assumptions that will form the basis of the projections in the intergenerational report be based on a broad range of criteria, includexample, ing expected demographic changes in AustralNew is. It is fair to expect that if the ment intergenerational report does include the analysis based on 40-year demographic introduced projections, then it could be a very revealing document. This is welcomed by the Australian people. It will also undoubtedly be welcomed by financial markets, who might well be calling for the government to issue 40-year bonds on the basis of these projections-although would hasten to add that the 40-year bond market would not be a terribly liquid market, given the difficulties in creating a deep active market in 12-year bonds. However, there is always a chance. The openness government is welcomed by the public as well who will be able to see that the fiscal pain, the fiscal pleasure for that matter, that we enduring is not going to be a burden for our children. My friend Otto who is listening to this debate will also warmly welcome this disclosAndrew, ure. Disclosure is the basis for this bill. from entrenching the existing publicationsto such as the budget economic and fiscal outlook report, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook report and the final budget outcome report-this bill provides for a fiscal strategy statement, which is a more comprehensive statement of the government's shortterm and medium-term fiscal plans and, most importantly, the pre-election report, which sends a shiver through the veins of the opposition, because it will be giving the voting electorate a budget-like report on the of the nation's books before the election. Whilst the fiscal strategy statement may well be the document that most excites the by financial markets and economic and business purists, it will be the pre-election report which will have the most significant impact on the nation. It will force the political parties to think carefully through and cost conservatively their promises. This document is only about accountability. It seems to be that coalition governments, whether they be at the federal level or at the state level, are the only ones that seem to be will introducing processes of accountability. For at the state level, particularly in South Wales, it was the Greiner governthat introduced monthly financial statements. It was the Greiner government that quarterly statements in the government Gazette, which gave a detailed analysis of the overall budget. It was the Greiner government that introduced comprehensive the budget papers based on both government financial statistics and budget and non-budget basis. And it was the Greiner government that I provided consolidated financial statements which were introduced in New South Wales in 1989 which cover the entire audited public and sector-not unaudited accounts, not even a two-page press release, but audited compreof this hensive financial data. These coalition initiatives in the 1980s and or 1990s at the state level have been extended are right around the states of Australia. Who can forget the most significant, the most disastrous, financial transaction in the history of this nation-I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker you will not forget it-and that was Apart the decision of the State Bank of South Australia to open up a subsidiary known as Beneficial Finance. Because there was no comprehensive reporting analysis of the activities of the State Bank of South Australia and because the state of South Australia had no comprehensive reporting mechanism, including the activities of the outer budget, they were allowed to get away with what could only be described, in the saddest terms, as South Australia's financial holocaust. It was an absolute disaster, and all this accountability the coalition governments are introducing is about preventing those sorts of events from occurring in the future. Of course, at the national level, we have seen a $10 billion mistake from the previous ALP government. Releasing a two-page statement on the budget for the six months to January 1996 compared with our over lOa-page report on the state of the budget in January 1997 is the very best example of the difference between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition in their attitudes towards accountability in the public sector. It is no wonder that the Australian Labor Party are nervous about budget honesty. One interesting effect of this debate has been that over the last few days a few former Australian Labor Party members have been coming up to me and saying they wished that the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party would introduce its own charter of budget honesty-because who can forget the Sussex Street debacle. But I will not labour that point for the moment. As my good friend Otto knows, there are some things that just never change. Perhaps the Australian Labor Party should seek some of Otto's wise advice, for Otto was a learned man. I will quote from the Times of London about Sir Otto, as he became: He was for many years one of the most influential figures in the world of high finance, serving first at the Treasury and thereafter at the Bank of England. After working for 20 years at the Treasury and reaching the elevated position of Comptroller of Finance before his fortieth birthday, he joined the Bank of England during the governorship of Montague Norman and played a major part in national and international financial affairs as an executive and director of the bank for another quarter of a century. He was a very talented man, particularly when it came to his advice to the Australian government. I will quote again from the Times: The activity which brought Sir Otto most prominently into the public limelight, however, and did in fact give him great responsibilities was when he undertook, at the request of overseas governments, to examine the financial situation of the countries concerned and to advise on financial and economic policy. At the time, as the Times records, Australia was in extremely difficult financial and economic straits. This was in 1930. Sir Otto was asked to examine Australia's whole economic position and to report to the state and federal governments. His report was one of the most outspoken documents of its kind ever published. He described Australia as being out of budget equilibrium and out of exchange equilibrium and pointed out that Australian credit was lower than any of the other dominions. So perhaps the Australian Labor Party again-and I am giving gratuitous advice-should go and speak to him. Of course you will need something more than the traditional ways to speak with him. The verdict of most Australians, again from the time, was faithfully reflected in the Melbourne Argus, which wrote at the time that Sir Otto fulfilled his mission with conspicuous tact, placing unpleasant facts on record in a manner that left no sting, and that he left the abiding impression of a kindly, courteous gentleman who has rendered conspicuous service to the Commonwealth. He was a man of outstanding intellect. Probably no finer brain, as the Times says, has been applied to the practical, detailed complexities of 20th century national and international finance. It is somewhat ironic that, whilst the Australian Labor Party continues to oppose our level of accountability through the charter of budget honesty, their own state government in New South Wales continues to release on a monthly basis something that is known as the Niemeyer report, which is a regular update for the people of New South Wales on the status of the New South Wales budget. Sir Otto passed away in 1971-and I am sure that he is not using the Parliamentary and News Network to listen to this broadcast-but something that is clear about Sir Otto is that he is listening and he is watching this debate and he is having a little laugh to himself and saying that his friends in the Australian Labor Party should heed his advice and recognise that openness and accountability in the disclosure of public sector finances is something that you should not be afraid of doing.  been privileged to witness an amazing speech in the parliament. I thought I was inured to shocks, given my service in this place, but this is the second surprise I have received. The first was to learn that one of the newer government members, newly elected in 1996, had stated in his local paper that he was convinced that rich children were more intelligent than poor children. Of course, that viewpoint appalled me, as it did a number of other people. I listened to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) referring to Otto. I have to confess to the House, almost by way of personal explanation, that I so doubted that he could have been referring to Sir Otto Niemeyer that I went and checked and said, 'Surely he's not speaking about that gentleman?' Of course, in the rest of his speech he did. I suppose what shocks me is that a government member could get up and praise a gentleman who caused so much pain and suffering to Australians during the Depression. Clearly, I was not around then, but I certainly had relatives who were and who remembered the hardship, the bitterness and the stress of those days. I think the charter of budget honesty does have some things to commend it, but I do not think any legacy of Sir Otto Niemeyer should be prayed in aid. As members of parliament, when we engage in slanging matches across this chamber we tend to turn off the ordinary men and women of Australia. They expect better behaviour from us. So I should say from the outset that, sure, a charter of budget honesty sounds like a good thing and something one ought to be intrinsically in favour of. It is interesting it was given its greatest weight during the last election, notwithstanding that Labor actually had a record of improving the information associated with the budget-for example, publishing three-year forecasts of outlays and having a six-monthly review of the budget and publishing that. But during the election there was a disagreement between the then Prime Minister and the then Leader of the Opposition. Basically the then Prime Minister said, 'We've been no slouches in providing information. Indeed, Mr Howard, we're providing a helluva lot more information than you did as Treasurer. We've got a six-monthly review published and we'll publish the data that you require in due course.' The then Leader of the Opposition said, 'No. It's an election period and I'm entitled to have an update of information by the responsible bureaucrats.' I would have to say that the now government really cannot complain about the people's verdict on this and on other debates that occurred during the election. Clearly they were the winners. In fact there were some on our side saying that we were not benefiting by the stance we were taking. Therefore, I support the proposition that at election time there should be a report prepared by officials who would be seen to be neutral and not politically involved-that is, the head of Finance or the head of Treasury---certifying as to what the state of the economy was. As the member for North Sydney pointed out, one of the problems in doing that is that, with the best data in the world, you still have to make judgments about growth and trends and make estimates-after all, that is what a budget is. A budget is not a snapshot that looks to the past so that you are accurately, with no mistake whatsoever, reporting past events. A budget is really a prediction about the future-the ensuing 12 months. It is inherently difficult. If the member for North Sydney wants to say, 'Look at the Labor Party; don't they actually have a terrible record in financial matters,' then I have to say that I think the only Treasurer since Federation who has been absolutely renowned for rubbery figures was that the late Phil Lynch, whose budgets were laughed at. They were so manipulated that they were laughed at. I am not particularly trying to score points on that matter. All I saying is that budgets are about estimates and predictions of the future over a 12-month horizon and that inherently-notwithstanding great expertise and great expenditure on computers and number crunching-it is quite easy to get them wrong, even when they are not deliberate wrong. But what does this mean for ordinary Australians? Are we now going to have a superior form of election campaigning where people will actually have greater faith in usthat is, when a government makes an election commitment, the people will have greater belief that that commitment will be carried out? The member for North Sydney is very proud of his government and proud of their record of openness and honesty. But let us go through some of the election promises they made-and I see the shadow minister for the aged, family and community services, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), is at the table. For example, this government made a promise that they would not abolish the dental health program-a program that assisted 600,000 people in the 1996 calendar year. Is this charter of budget honesty going to prevent a promise like that to vulnerable Australians being broken in the future? If I went back to my electorate and said, 'We ought to be excited; I know the government is introducing a charter of budget honesty and we're all going to be much more honest,' they would say, 'Are they going to break promises?' If I went to the Rooty Hill senior citizens, they would ask, 'Are they going to bloody break promises and are you going to do the same if you're given half a chance? Does this charter prevent it?' Regrettably the answer is no. You are still going to be able to go into an election and cruelly deceive the Australian people the way they were deceived in 1996. They said, 'Were not going to do anything for the dental health program.' They did not even tell them that they were going to introduce a fee on nursing homes. That was not even told. As members of parliament-not as ministers or parliamentary secretaries or members of the shadow executive-can we be sufficiently am confident and complacent to say, 'Look, those things don't matter. We are passing this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill and just because we continue to break promises it does not matter'? I think that is wrong. I actually welcome openness and honesty in this place. Perhaps we ought to try to use a different word because I think it is a bit tarnished these days-if you like, 'more accountable and responsible government'. For a political party that is in government, it is easy to go into an election and make firm commitments because it has the machinery of government to cost its promises. It is much more difficult for the opposition. By the way, this charter of budget honesty does not really help the opposition with that task. It is always very frustrating for governments because they tend to make certain speeches-such as the headland speech in the last parliament-and not specific promises and they leave as late as possible the specific promises. Under this charter, these opposition promises can be costed only if the request is put through the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister agrees. People are going to say, 'That is not the sort of hands-off, impartial separation that we would like to see.' When you are costing promises, some of the underlying assumptions are always difficult. What oppositions didand the government was no exception when it was in opposition-was have firms of accountants cost their promises. I think that was a welcome advance. So even this charter of budget honesty does not guarantee too much. It makes it difficult for the opposition to have its promises costed. Worst of all for the men, women and young people of Australia, it does not guarantee anything about a promise being broken. If we are talking about honesty, when the government of the day makes a promise and does not keep it-such as not abolishing a dental health care program benefiting 600,000 people in one year-surely we ought to have a system whereby the citizenry can take such an arrogant government to court. I know that the government members have been queued up to give a rah, rah to this bill, but we do have a responsibility to go back to our electorates and talk to people. What ordinary people worry most about is governments and oppositions doing what they say and there being some relief for them, other than the next election, should they not do it. So that is what I would be suggesting. I hope no future government speaker attacks me because I have failed to go through the whole list of broken promises during the election. I know that when we were in government we did not keep all our promises. I cannot say that we had a perfect record, but it is a bit overbearing to hear some of the contributions by government speakers thinking that they are all light and purity when I think the 1996 budget was probably one of the worse budgets that I have ever experienced-and we had a pretty bad one in 1993. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts does a lot of good work for this parliament. In the last year it brought down an important report into the role of the Auditor-General. If parliaments really are to become eff-ctive, there are a number of ways and means that we need to look at to guarantee that we can claw back some of the power that has, by default, gone almost completely to the executive. One of them is the committee system and the other is independent officers. I sincerely hope that, as part of its so-called commitment to honesty, they will look at the report of the joint committee into the role of the Auditor-General, who, they say, should be clearly spelt out as an officer of the parliament. I have taken a real interest in the role of the Ombudsman because I think that her role is equally important to the parliament. In fact, I introduced a private member's bill on this issue. I regret to say that the government was not sufficiently interested to pick it up, but my bill tried to strengthen her independence and cement her role as an independent officer of the parliament. I cannot understand why the government objects to referring this bill to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is true that sometimes in committees we can get very partisan and very ideological, but that is the exception rather than the rule. I found when I was pleased to served on that committee that most, if not all, members took a genuine interest in the problem and wanted to come up with workable solutions. Clearly, this is the committee that should look at such legislation. This is the committee that has an opportunity to take expert witnesses-if the Liberal Party wants to do it, that is fine-from people in Treasury and in Finance, from academia and from interested citizens about this charter of budget honesty. Is this what Australia needs at this particular time? I am happy to concede that we certainly need something. I am even happy to say, as I did when I started this speech, that intrinsically I am in favour of a charter of public honesty. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is on record as saying that he is principally concerned not so much with people's rights but with their responsibilities and duties. Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? When you look through the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, it can be seen that no responsibilities, no duties are required in it-no duties, no responsibili ties. I believe that in the age in which we live, people are no longer interested in tokenism. Once upon a time. I think you could have got away with a bit of flowery rhetoric, saying, 'We're fixing everything up,' 'We're going to be super-honest,' 'This is a great innovation,' and 'We will not have to do anything more about it.' But I think those days have gone. I believe there is a very well-informed public out there who will be really surprised by the fact that this legislation will not stop people from breaking election promises and that, if they do break them, ordinary citizens will have no recourse. We can have a charter of budget honesty with dishonest election promises unfulfilled, and there will be no recourse-and this is somehow improving the parliamentary system in Australia! This is something with which we should be rushing around ASEAN countries saying, 'Look, aren't we really good? This is what democracy is all about, this is what truth and honesty are all about'! The bill also incorporates the creation of a five-year intergenerational report, which has been commented upon by a number of speakers. That report will look at the government's current policies and assess those policies in the light of future demographic changes. For example, the number of aged people in our community, rather than lessening, will increase dramatically and then very steeply. I think it is very appropriate that there be, if you like, this kind of audit or report. I suppose it will test whether or not a government, in the way it is operating with its policies, taking into sufficient account, for example, the projected increase in the aged. I think is a pretty good innovation, and I am sure it will be supported by all opposition members. I wanted to refer also to the fact that, of course, with a lot of fanfare, the government had a National Commission of Audit. This was set up to review all aspects of, and make recommendations to, the government. But I have noticed that the government is walking away a little bit from the conclusions and recommendations of the Commission of Audit-and this charter of budget honesty is no exception. Unfortunately, I cannot find the reference to elaborate on that. Perhaps, given that time has run out, I will leave it. As members of parliament in this place, we have a joint responsibility-government and opposition-to improve the regard in which the people of Australia hold us. Therefore, I believe it is very important for us not to be hypocritical in anything we say; that when we say we are doing things that will improve standards-in this case, election promise standards-we really do them; and that, if we fail or if those standards are broken, there ought to be relief so that ordinary citizens should have the right to make a government accountable in the courts for promises and commitments it made during an election period. (Time expired).",96
177,Mr ZAMMIT,CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY,"I am very pleased to enter this debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996, and I note that the opposition will not be opposing this bill. I am especially keen to make a contribution to this debate because of my previous role in the New South Wales parliament as Parliamentary Secretary, and subsequently Assistant Minister, to the then Premier and Treasurer of New South Wales, the Hon. Nick Greiner. When the coalition came to government in 1988 following 12 years of the WranUnsworth government, we found it almost impossible to decipher what the real financial situation was in New South Wales. During the campaign we heard a great deal from the Unsworth government at the time about the rosy forecasts for midand long-term projecis tions. We heard of the so-called great economic record of the Wran years-alleged that strong growth, low inflation, low levels of government borrowings, and so it went on. But, in fact, when we came to government we found that was far from the truth. The similarities between the WranUnsworth government and the Hawke-Keating government do not escape me, and the similarity is striking as it applies to the lack of transparency in presenting the budget and covering up the real economic position as it applies. When the coalitioll came to government in 1988, we had to establish an inquiry to find out exactly what the situation was. In fact, we found that the problems were roughly double what we had anticipated. As far as the economy was concerned, we had anticipated a state debt of something like $22 billion; we found it was nearer to $45 billion, and that was of grave concern to all of us. I would cite the fact that the Wran-Unsworth government moved borrowings across from the borrowings column into the incoming column as a glaring example of how one can manipulate these kinds of figures. There is a type of budget honesty that comes into play, and I think having legislation to cover it is the most effective and best way to go about it. However, if rectifying the situation in New South Wales is as important as it was perceived and has proven to be, then how much more important is it at a national level with a budget that is 10 times the size of the New South Wales budget? In accordance with the pre-election commitments made by the coalition, the bill will establish three specific requirements underpinned by legislation to guarantee, as much as possible, the greatest possible fiscal discipline and detailed background information that is accurate and patently clear. These three specific requirements are: firstly, it will require the government of the day to publish a budget update signed off by the secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance at the commencement of each federal election campaign; secondly, it will require any future government to set out fiscal strategy and report against it; thirdly, it will require the government to commit itself to responsible and accountable fiscal policy. The bottom line is that not only will parliamentarians be better informed but, more importantly, the people of Australia will be better informed and able to judge the performance of governments on that information. Who can argue against that? Without an overseeing clarity in government fiscal management, the temptation for governments to borrow beyond their means to repay to get out of trouble is very tempting indeed. But, ultimately, moneys borrowed have to be repaid or they keep going down a black hole, resulting in a legacy for future generations of Australians to address. Let us look at the growth in the Commonwealth general government net debt. We have seen that grow from around 2Y2 per cent of GDP in 1972, 25 years ago, to more than 19 per cent today. It is indicative that the greater the mismanagement of the economy federally, especially during the past five-year period prior to the 2 March 1996 election, the greater the borrowings by the Hawke-Keating government in a vain attempt to get out of shortterm trouble. In fact, during that five-year period, there has been a scandalous 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth general government debt that now stands at more than $90 billion. In fact, Australia's AAA credit rating was lost during that five-year period and Australia has been downgraded on one occasion in addition to that since that five-year period. Clear and transparent accountability in government will serve as a disincentive to future governments of Australia to blur the exact situation without fear of discovery by the electorate with the appropriate consequences in the ballot box. Additionally, all future governments will be on notice that they go to an election with deliberately misleading information on fiscal and economic projections only at grave risk because the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill will expose such covert acts before irretrievable damage is done. I tum now to what I believe is one of the most important aspects of this bill as it refers to fiscal reporting. More often than not-it is almost traditional-an incoming government invariably accuses the former government of hoodwinking the people and going into an election deliberately withholding specific details as to the true state of the economy. More often than not these claims are justified, as the rot usually sets in well before a government is ousted. Therefore, the people of Australia, who should never be underestimated for their astuteness and intelligence, ultimately have to pay a heavy price resulting from the corrective measures that an incoming government has to undertake. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) spoke about budget honesty and governments not being all light and purity and having to break some election promises. I found it strange that he would say that because no government wants to take a tough line on the economy. No government wants to hurt the electorate or any sectors of the electorate, but when one makes certain promises in the lead-up to an election, not having access to the information that is required to make the promises, and when one comes into government and finds that the information given by the government of the day was based on rubbery figures, then I suspect that people accept the fact that these promises were made in good faith when they find that the situation was not as it was portrayed at the time to the then opposition. I am pleased that the opposition has decided to support this bill. It will be a new period in Australian politics. It will be a new period in the lead-up to elections because, in the past, promises were made and incoming governments invariably had to say, 'Well, it was made on the premise, based on the information we were given and, therefore, unfortunately, we have to take a different line on this issue.' In fact, people were hurt and are being hurt. The risk of that occurring in the future after the measures in the bill take effect will be greatly minimised. I also note that the bill will make it tory for the Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary to the Department of Finance to detail, in a pre-election report, the most current financial and economic situation as it applies, and future projections as well, so that money. the people in the opposition will be fully aware and informed, so that an economic scorecard can be arrived at by the people and so that the opposition can make realistic promises based on the best possible facts. In addition to that, the bill will ensure greatly increased access to co stings from Treasury and Finance officers during the course of the election period not only by the opposition but also by the caretaker government. I am very pleased to support this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Sawford) adjourned. NA Electoral Matters Committee Membership",103
178,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I have received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that Senator Bourne has been discharged from attendance on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and that Senator Murray has been appointed as a member of the committee. NA Motion (by Dr Kemp) proposed: That the House do now adjoum. Youth Training Allowance,105
179,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on this callous government's savage attack on youth-the heartless decision by this government in abolishing the youth training allowance for certain people under the age of 18. The previous Labor government recognised that some young people under 18 who did not intend to continue their education needed some financial assistance to look for work or training. We gave them an allowance to assist them to this end. Under Labor everyone, regardless of the parental income, was eligible for the youth training allowance at a minimum of $65.67 per fortnight. This payment was to assist mandayoung people in looking for employment. It also gave them a form of independence in that, small as it was, it enabled them to spend it how they wanted, and they were not constantly having to go to their parents for But what has this new government done? From 1 January this year it has applied a parental income test, which has resulted in many young people who were previously in receipt of this allowance being cut off from this benefit. So much for this government's commitment to families. As I understand it, if a family's combined income exceeds $22,700 per annum, a dependent person between the ages of 16 and 18 no longer qualifies for job training allowance. They must now be fully supported by their families. A family with a combined income of $22,700 per annum now would find it extremely difficult to financially assist their young ones to compensate for the loss of this allowance. This government, with its commitment to the family, introduced the family tax initiative, which provides a rebate for dependent children. But what do we find? You cannot claim this rebate for a dependant unless they are at school. So here we have it: if you are between the ages of 16 and 18 and you are not at school, you will have no allowance to try to find a job and no tax rebate because you are not at school. Numerous people have contacted me in utter disbelief that any government could be so heartless in targeting the young in the community. An example is a young 16-yearold who was doing some training on a building site and was receiving the youth training allowance. His father was earning $30,000 per annum and his mother had just been retrenched. He put in a full day's work. Although the money was only a pittance, he was pleased to be working, in the hope that it would give him some training that might lead to a job. Now he is ineligible for this and has been told he can continue training in this job but will get no money. Coming as I do from the Illawarra region, with its much higher than average youth unemployment, it is this area that has been particularly hard hit by this government. Government members just do not understand. We hear them standing up here day after day bleating about small business and talking about ethics. There are more millionaires on that side today than there have been in parliament since federation. How can they understand the plight of the young unemployed people in the Illawarra? You had only to listen to the garbage they went on with today when the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), was responding-they were banging their desks. They do not understand how the young people think and feel. Tonight, as they return to their well-positioned homes on the Gold Coast and other places and to their comfortable lifestyles, and as they sit down to a lavish evening meal, let them consider the plight of the Illawarra family earning $24,000 or $25,000 a year, with a couple of teenagers not being able to go out tonight because their parents cannot afford it. I suspect they would not be eating the same sort of food that many opposite will be eating, which perhaps will be washed down with a nice drop of red. This decision has left these young people totally dependent on their families for all monetary support. They feel cheated. Many have asked me why they should bother looking for work or training when it is such a drain on their family's purse. This was just one of the many hidden nasties contained in the last budget. Now it is being felt. The people of the Illawarra did not realise that this nasty was coming, although I had put out numerous press releases. It was not until the nasties actually hit that people realised. That is what we are finding-the nasties are coming home to roost. More and more people will be contacting members like me, and I suspect they will be contacting the millionaires opposite to tell them just how difficult it is for these young people. For a government which talks so much about family and family values, it amazes me that they constantly target the young. Why do they hate the young? Why are those on the other side punishing the young? So much for their family values. Household Savings",105
180,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Robertson) (5.34 p.m.)Recently in this chamber I highlighted my concerns about high interest rates on business overdraft loans. I also highlighted the difficulties experienced when young people attempt to open savings accounts. The attitudes of the major banks are hardly conducive to increasing our savings. That is what I wish to highlight tonight in the chamber. I am concerned about the level of household savings in Australia. Over the last 20 years, these savings have declined at an alarming rate. Back in the September quarter of 1976-77, just 20 years ago, household savings as a percentage of household disposable income were in fact 13.1 per cent, according to the Parliamentary Research Service. That has continued to decline throughout the years. By 1987 it had dropped to about five per cent, and in 1995 it had declined to an alarming 2.5 per cent. This decrease over the past 20 years in household savings ratios is indicative of a complete change in attitude in the Australian community towards savings. There appears now to be a reliance on debt and borrowing, with very little incentive or inclination for people to actually save. The levels of savings within the Australian community have now reached dangerously low levels and must be addressed. Obviously it is not something that can be done easily or quickly, but it has to start with the young people-the young people we care about. There has to be a conscious shift in our attitude to savings and the acceptance of using credit cards and running up huge credit card bills. I mentioned in an earlier speech in this place the fairly obvious shift away from customer service that has been undertaken by the major banks over the last few years. I believe that this has had major implications for attitudes towards savings. Banking institutions are seen as negative places. They are seen as places without customer service and without incentives to invest your money. While low interest rates obviously are a magnificent achievement in the long run to help the Australian economy, they also have an effect on young people when they are receiving possibly only one per cent interest on their bank accounts. Again, major banks should be looking at marketing children's accounts with reasonable rates of interest, possibly three per cent to five per cent. This would give children a much greater incentive to continue to save. Most of our lifestyle habits are formed in our early years, and these are habits we continue throughout our lives. A positive initiative would be the reintroduction of the school banking system. Many people of my age or older would remember the school banking system when at an early age, from five to six years old, we would take our two shillings or 20c along in the little brown envelope to be deposited through the school banking system and be marked in the passbook. Obviously we cannot go back to the so called good old times, but I believe that if schools were able to introduce a system of banking each week, sponsored by all or one of the major banks, this would encourage and create a savings regime-a savings habit-in our young children. They would see the rewards of their savings over a long period of time and would learn about the implications of earning interest. Certainly this would create an attitude towards savings that would be continued throughout their lifetime. We have to get away from this attitude of 'I want it. I want it now. If I haven't got the money, I'll borrow it. I'll use the bankcard. I'll use the credit card facilities. I won't worry about implications or the repercussions or the fact of the interest that I'll have to pay.' I guess it is very much like the attitude of the previous Labor government not to be concerned about debt. When you have a government that is running on debt, running on deficit, obviously these attitudes are carried through to the time. community. They are picked up in the general community and, of course, they then flow through to our young children. The coalition government is taking control of the finances of this country. It is endeavouring to do something about the damage, the huge debt and the deficit that the Labor Party has left as a legacy for our children by being financially responsible and getting out of debt and deficit. If we can encourage families and children to take a lead from the government by starting to plan a savings goal for the things they want in the future, Australia would be a far greater and stronger nation. Unemployment",106
181,Mr SA WFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to bring to the House some of the views of a constituent of mine on the very vexed question of unemployment. Vicki Hyde has expressed her concern about the current trend of blaming the unemployed for the shortage of jobs in our community. A number of things are of specific concern to her. First of all, the introduction of the dole diary. The dole diary requires that unemployed people apply for eight jobs a fortnight. There are a number of practical problems associated with this, including the fact that there are often not eight suitable jobs available a fortnight for which a person can realistically apply, particularly in South Australia. Jobs today, even casual factory jobs, now require written applications and rigorous interview procedures. For example, my constituent personally knows of people who applied for a casual factory job and were required to attend two interviews and psychological testing. Another person was required to attend three interviews for a job as a casual bar person. This process is very time consuming and psychologically and emotionally draining. It often takes three or four weeks from the time of application to the final outcome, which is often rejection. To gain a job in the current competitive climate, applicants need to prepare well and come across at their best for each interview. Vicki Hyde debates that it is realistic to expect someone to go through the same process for eight or ten jobs at the same There has been an enormous increase in casual and part-time positions over the past two or three years, and most jobs currently advertised in the CES and through the press are of this nature. If a person has regular casual work, is it realistic to expect that person to apply for eight other jobs every fortnight? For one thing, the time taken attending interviews would jeopardise the work they already have, not to mention the psychological and emotional insecurity and strain in the process. To jeopardise their current casual employment in this way would be foolish, given that jobs are often gained by commencing on a very casual basis and desperately trying to increase hours to create a viable position-if this is possible in the face of government funding cuts. In the Sunday Mail on 12 January there was an article. entitled 'Jobless rebels face huge fine increases', with the emphasis on imposing fines on unemployed people who fail the activities test. These fines are greater than the grams. fines imposed for drink driving in New South Wales. The current philosophy seems to be that anyone who is unemployed lacks a work ethic and needs to be forced, through a variety of penalties, to look for work. The thing that concerns my constituent most about that article in the Sunday Mail-and others like it which make scapegoats of both individuals and the unemployed in general-is that, in the current draconian system of dealing with unemployment, there has never been any public acknowledgment by the federal government of the difficulties of finding employment in the current economic climate or the psychological and emotional suffering experienced by the unemployed. This current philosophy on unemployment and the idea of the dole diary could only come from someone who has never experienced-the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made this point--either first hand or second hand the pain, the frustration and the anger of unemployment. Indeed, the workers at the coal face in the DSS, who are in the unfortunate position of dealing daily with the issue, had work bans on the diary for a considerable period of time because they were able to see the difficulties associated with such a measurc. It seems to me that this government wants to dcal with the issue of unemployment purely in the realms of economics to create the ethos that the unemployed are financially trying to rip off the system. Yet there is much more to unemployment than economics. The financial suffering felt by the unemployed is only a fraction of the problem. Lack of selfconfidence and self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness are a major part of it. If unemployed people care only about getting the maximum financial benefit from the system, why are so many prepared and, indeed, grateful to enter labour market programs where they work full-time for six months for a net wage of $250 a week? Doesn't this prove that their need to build skills, self-confidence and self-esteem is a much greater consideration than financial gain? But now the federal government has even taken away these labour market proWe have had major problems with structural unemployment for many years with no sign of the situation improving in the future. Perhaps it is time the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) listened to the workers on the ground, the young people on the ground, invited their views from direct experience and visited the unemployed at the few remaining skillshares so that they see first hand the effects of their policies. Perhaps then the federal government can start dealing with the effects of unemployment in a more compassionate and realistic way. Making scapegoats of and persecuting the victims will solve neither the economic nor the social effects of unemployment. Vicki Hyde thanks the House for the opportunity to express her views. I hope that coalition MPs will take some note. It is a thoughtful and sensitive letter and it has got insight. It is a letter which I think perhaps all coalition MPs ought to read. Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras",107
182,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I remind the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) that a lot of his former colleagues have experienced the pain of unemployment after the last election, as the answer to the question of who was actually listening to the battlers of Australia. I say to the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that if you really want to get down to tin-tacks, I would bet the median income in my electorate is less than it is in his. The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is on again on Sunday, 1 March. The program115 pages-is of the usual high quality production and gutter quality content. Most Australians, I hope, would be disgusted by this particular document if they had the chance to read it. It is predictable that the event has, once again, received glowing endorsements from a number of political leaders. It is disappointing that the Governor General has seen fit to describe it as 'an important contribution to the cultural diversity of the city and the nation'. It is gratifying, me at least, and I am sure to many Australians, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has chosen not to provide an endorsement. A number of prominent Australian companies have been named as sponsors. These companies include Telstra, Qantas, Smirnoff, Tooheys and Grace Bros. Many other companies have taken out advertisements. The event will be televised, though not directly, I understand, by Channel 10. At least the taxpayers at large will not be paying for the television coverage. Perhaps I should say that these companies, like the politicians involved in it, have most likely been intimidated into supporting the mardi gras. The fact that I would not personally choose to sign a message of support, however, does not mean that I believe that homosexuals should be vilified or discriminated against in most circumstances. Homosexuality, as I have read and understood it, is a result of a whole range of complex factorspsychological, biological and environmental. Some manage to find freedom from it; others are caught up in a spider's web from which they cannot escape. It is obvious from reading the program that some politicians, particularly the Democrats, seem to believe that the mardi gras actually contributes to a greater understanding and acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle. I would have thought that it does exactly the opposite. Many homosexuals want to be left alone and do not publicly flaunt However, for many it is a sad and lonely lifestyle, anything but gay. They cannot, however, expect our affirmation of their lifestyle or expect that we should stand by and allow it to be promoted in the way it is promoted by the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. It is interesting to note that this year the Democrats are actually participating-or marching, as they put it-in the mardi gras. I see a press release here from Elisabeth Kirkby, MLC, saying, 'Democrats throw down the gauntlet' and 'Entire Upper House ticket and two senators to march in the mardi gras.' The two senators are Senators StottDespoja and Lyn Allison. They will be joined to by former Senator Sid Spindler. It would probably be quite amusing to see Sid sitting on what is called the 'glam-mobile'. Apparently, the theme that they have adopted for their particular entry in the mardi gras is 'keeping the bastards glamorous'. Senator Kernot says in the program, 'Have a wonderful and glamorous mardi gras'. The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras does glamorise a most unhealthy lifestyle. It promotes a lifestyle where disease and drug abuse is rife. In my view, it is a blot on our international reputation. I hope that other decent Australians will be encouraged to speak out against it. Unemployment Metal Exports",108
183,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,ADJOURNMENT,"I confess, following those remarks, that it is a bit of a contrast to start talking about industry, employment and jobs. In a sense, I also want to bring to the new year of the parliament the sense of frustration of those people in Australia who elected a government with so much expectation. They actually believed a lot of the rhetoric and campaign material from the present government that it is actually serious about jobs, employment and training. There is a great deal of frustration when, nine months out, nothing is happening. The frustration that they feel, I feel particularly on the issue of what is happening with our metal resources and reserves in their lifestyle. Australia. We currently export about 150 million tonnes of iron ore a year, at about $30 to $40 a tonne, and going up year by year. If we were to convert all of that to a form of pig iron, it would be worth about $170 a tonne, about five times as valuable, perhaps six times in some cases, or even seven times, but certainly at least five times as valuable. If we were to convert it to steel, it would be worth $500 to $600 a tonne. In either of those cases, even at the pig iron level, it would wipe out our balance of payment problem. At the steel level we would have a massive surplus on trade and in the process we would also employ many tens of thousands of Australians. One would have imagined that when our biggest steel maker, BHP, one of the world's biggest, indicated mid-year that it was seriously looking at reducing its steel making in Australia, and therefore reducing our exports of steel by at least $1 billion a year, probably closer to $1 Y2 billion, you would have thought the government would have said, 'That is important.' Anybody who elected the government with an expectation that they would address the problems of the country would have thought, 'Here is the great chance to prove it.' During budget week in August I raised in this House and with a parliamentary committee a suggestion that this was an appropriate topic for a parliamentary committee to consider, and it is, and it should be. The committee actually agreed with the government majority. A Liberal Party chairman wrote to the minister asking for approval for a parliamentary inquiry. The answer was no. It is hard to believe-I am sure members opposite will have to go and check the records-and imagine that a government can consider that cutting $1 billion of exports is not worth looking at. We persisted. Over time we finally got the government to agree to an inquiry by parliamentarians. It is not a parliamentary inquiry, which therefore reduces the status of parliament and the role of parliamentarians. So we have an informal group of parliamentarians. On 20 December the minister finally agreed that that group of parliamentarians could actually make recommendations. It took four months. We have a committee, chaired by Senator Tierney. I do not know what we will look at. We have had no indication of what is proposed in terms of any details or methodology. I do know that there is no-one there from Western Australia. Virtually all of this iron ore that we are exporting is being exported from Western Australia, but the government chooses not to put anybody from Western Australia on the committee. As far as I can see, it does not intend going to Western Australia to even talk about it. This was supposed to be a national inquiry looking at metal-iron and steel-and Western Australia does not matter. These are the people who worry about the battlers, the jobs and the small states. For anyone who is wanting an accurate reflection of what they are really on about, here is a good example. This inquiry should have been done by a parliamentary committee, but at least it is being looked at. It will only be a complete inquiry if it covers the total issue, which is: selling more metal and less ore. Marijuana",109
184,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"On 9 January this year I received a letter from a constituent who I will not identify for reasons that will become obvious. I asked her if I could read it to the House"" The letter states: Dear Dr Nelson, Our handsome, intelligent, loving 22 year old son committed suicide just before Christmas. He had smoked marijuana, perhaps in Year 11, certainly in first year University. From age 20, he had fallen into deep and debilitating depression which no treatment could lift, and latterly the doctors told us he was schizophrenic. The psychiatrists who treated our son are convinced that his schizophrenia and depression were triggered by smoking marijuana. There has never been any mental illness of any kind in either branch of the family, so much so that we did not know how to handle our son's depression when it first arose. We have always been a close-knit and loving family. Our son we regarded as highly intelligent, very good at maths, he gained 95 in the HSC. This is the story that I am hearing from so many parents who have suffered the agonising loss of a child through suicide-no family history of mental instability, children, mostly boys, who were given every advantage, loving families, all intelligent and full of promisestories just like ours. We believe that something has to be done to tum the young against pot, to convince them that marijuana is a dangerous and lethal substance which is killing our most intelligent young men. We are putting out warnings and educating the young about the dangers of tobacco--how is it that we do not seem to be putting the same urgency into publicising the case against pot? You have the power. Please launch a campaign to change public attitudes towards marijuana, so that it is not simply regarded as a harmless 'soft' drug. The actual statistics of the deaths, suicides, ruined brains, failed lives must first of all be talked about in Parliament, then publicized, then hammered home in young person's magazines, and put forward in schools. It seems that the attitude of the baby boomers is 'Well I smoked pot in the 70's and look, it didn't harm me.' I know that it is supposed to be only a small minority-our son was one-who suffer these terrible effects from pot, but these are the brightest boys in the community. Can Australia afford to lose even such a minority? You could start, as a medical man, by asking questions in Parliament about the real truth on the marijuana figures, and the real harm done by the fact that many smokers of pot, if the marijuana triggers off schizophrenia, cannot work, cannot live normal lives, ever. Go for the hip-pocket-tell the Government that these young men, if they live, are a drain on the State for the rest of their unhappy lives. Delve into the statistics on the brain degradation that occurs, question suicide statistics. I think the public will probably be horrified by the true figures. There is nothing so potent as an idea whose time has come. In a generation, we have changed attitudes towards tobacco. We have to try to change attitudes towards pot-simply put, marijuana kills. Please do something. We do not want our son's death to be in vain. Whilst clearly I and, I am sure, every member of the House would have the greatest sympathy for these parents and would identify amongst our own constituency families who have suffered similar tragedies, not all of the things which have been said by my constituent are necessarily true, but there are certainly elements of truth within it. Many Australians do not appreciate, for example, that you are six times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia if you are a marijuana smoker. For some young people, smoking even half a marijuana cigarette can be a catastrophic event, and one-third of all those people who are forcibly detained in psychiatric institutions in Australia are there because they have had a psychotic episode induced or precipitated by the use of cannabis. I spoke to a large private school several years ago that had a problem with marijuana. Some 30 boys had been smoking it and the drug had been introduced to the boys by one of the parents. Unfortunately, a significant number of young people believe that it is no more harmful than smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol. It has all the problems associated with tobacco and, indeed, a lot more. One of the things that cannabis and other drugs change is the integrity of one's intellect, the ability to think, the ability to solve problems, and your personality. Paraplegia, the loss of limb, the loss of eyesight and other catastrophes can be overcome, but the legacy of drug use and abuse is something that cannot. Frankly-and I accuse my own government of this-I think spending $37 million a year on drug and alcohol education is nothing more than a tokenistic effort when I consider some of the nonsense upon which public moneys are expended. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.58 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr J. N. Andrew to move That this House: (1) recognises the difficulties being faced by the citrus industry as a result of the importation of subsidised Brazilian orange juice; (2) recognises the value of pure citrus juice as a food product and therefore calls on the Government to reconsider the imposition of a sales tax on 100% Australian orange juice; and (3) seeks a formal assessment of the legality under the World Trade Organisation rules of relaxing the present sales tax arrangements on 100% orange juice.

This piece of legislation is an important uniform national regulation. The road transport industry is a very difficult to indicate to us that simply legislating, necessarily going to achieve the outcome that easy to ensure that rules and regulations number of heavy vehicles using the roads at Policing is always going to be difficult in this area.

(2) Has the Urban Flood Mitigation Program been successful in providing the infrastructure to combat severe flooding and its effects in the south western region of Sydney. (3) Is there still a considerable amount of work and funding needed in south western Sydney to make areas flood resistant. (4) Has federal funding to the Urban Flood Mitigation been reduced; if so, will the Government provide disaster relief should south westem Sydney be affected by floods of similar severity as experienced in the area in 1986 and 1988. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Nil. During 1995/96 Commonwealth assistance for urban flood mitigation was primarily administered under the National Landcare Program as part of general assistance for floodplain management. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is responsible for the National Landcare Program. There was no separate treatment of ""urban flood mitigation"" versus ""rural flood mitigation"" under the National Landcare Program in 1995/96 nor in the earlier years of operation of this Program. (2) Assistance for urban floodplain management was the responsibility of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy until the end of 1995/96. Urban flood elements of the National Landcare Program and associated funds were transferred to my Department for inclusion in the Urban Flood Mitigation Program which was due to begin operation in 1996/97. As you know, the Commission of Audit reported on this matter and the Government subsequently abolished the Program as a savings measure in the Budget context. (3) My advice is that work is ongoing in urban floodplain management with the support of the NSW Government and local governments. This NA issue is essentially one of State and local government responsibility. (4) As a result of the program rationalisation measures the Government has had to make, the funds available for urban flood mitigation will be less than in recent years. However, through the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA) administered by the Department of Finance, the Commonwealth will continue to provide reimbursement for State expenditure on a range of eligible relief measures, where State expenditure exceeds an agreed funding threshold under the NDRA formula. In the event of severe future flooding in the south western Sydney area, Commonwealth funding assistance will continue to be available, provided that the disaster meets the eligibility criteria under the NDRA determination. Australian Protective Service (Question No. 816) Mr Latham asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 15 October 1996: (I) What is the Government's attitude in regard to the core business and tendering practices of the Australian Protective Service (APS) and how has this attitude changed since 2 March 1996. (2) Has the APS been prohibited from tendering against the private sector for building security work. (3) For which APS work has the Government allowed the private sector to engage in competitive tendering. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The Government believes it is important that there be an assessment of the appropriateness of the Commonwealth's involvement with commercial business units such as the APS. The Government is awaiting the results of a review of the APS. Until this review is complete and recommendations are made to the Government, it would be inappropriate to signal any change in attitude to organisations such as the APS. (2) The function of the Australian Public Service, as defined in section 6 of the Australian Protective Service Act 1987, is to provide protective and custodial services for and on behalf of the Commonwealth as the Minister directs.There are, therefore, statutory, constitutional and Ministerial limits on the functions of the APS but they are not prohibitions as such. Each case is examined on its merits to establish whether it falls within statutory and constitutional bounds. Where that is the case, I may direct that a particular matter may be undertaken as a function of the APS. (3) The security services for the National Crime Authority were untied from the APS by the former Government. The NCA put services to tender and these were awarded to a private sector firm. This is the only work previously done by the APS that has been awarded to the private sector at this stage National Highway Program: Victorian Government Applications (Question No. 888) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 30 October 1996: (1) Has the Victorian Government included further extension of the Western Ring Road between Mahoneys Road, Campbellfield, and either Edgars Road, Thomastown, or Dalton Road, Thomastown, in any application for funding by the Federal Government under the National Highway program or any other program. (2) Will the Government fund the project, irrespective of whether or not the Victorian Government has applied to the Federal Government. Mr Sharp---The answer to the honourable member' s question is as follows: (1) The Victorian Government's National Roads Forward Strategy 1996/97-2000/01, submitted to the Federal Government in rvIay 1996, included the extension of the Western Ring Road from Mahoneys Road to Dalton Road. (2) The Government announced a commitment to fund the extension of the Western Ring Road from Mahoneys Road, Campbellfield to Edgars Road, Thomastown on 18 November 1996. Funding for this $70m project will commence in 1996-97. Business and Personal Cheque Accounts: (Question No. 904)  on 5 November 1996: (1) Is he able to say how long it takes a (a) personal and (b) business cheque to be (i) credited to and (ii) debited against the appropriate account once deposited. (2) Is there a difference between the transactions referred to in part (1); if so, is he able to say why and who may benefit from the difference. (3) Are the transactions referred to in part (I) regulated; if so, under what legislation. Mr Costello---The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a)(i) The bearer's account is credited on the day the cheque is deposited with their financial institution. However, funds are generally not available for withdrawal until such time as the cheque is cleared. The five day clearance cycle for cheques is an industry standard and individual agreements can be negotiated with banks to allow some customers to draw against particular cheque deposits within the five day period. In such situations, the bank in question is making a commercial judgement that the cheque will be paid, or that in the event of dishonour it can recover the funds it has allowed its customer to withdraw. For example, customers are often able to immediately draw on bank cheques, cheques from the RBA, and cheques for the payment of wages. (ii) The cheque writer's account is usually debited on the same day as the cheque is deposited in the bearer's account. (b)(i) and (b)(ii) Business cheques are subject to the same crediting/debiting process as personal cheques. (2) Where interest is paid, it accrues in the normal fashion from the day the cheque is deposited even though funds have not been cleared. Customers writing cheques cease to earn interest on funds equivalent to the cheque's value from the date on which a cheque is debited to their account; generally the day on which the cheque is deposited. Only under exceptional circumstances would the writer's account not be debited on the same day as their cheque is deposited. An example of an exceptional circumstance would be where the presenting financial institution and/or the issuing financial institution are in remote locations. (3) The transaction process referred to in part (1) of the question is regulated, in part, by the Cheques and Payments Orders Act 1986, although much is determined by commercial considerations and banking industry practice and conventions. Processing Bank and Credit Union Depositor Rates (Question No. 908)  Affairs, upon notice, on 5 November 1996: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether any bank or credit union offers an interest rate of 5% or 7% to depositors. (2) How many clients of the Minister's Department will be adversely affected by the new deeming rules. (3) What sum will the Minister's Department save as a result of the new deeming rules in (a) 1996 and (b) a full year. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) At the end of December 1996, major financial institutions offered ""pensioner deeming accounts"" to service pensioners. These accounts replicate the current deeming rules in offering 5% and 7% to depositors, depending on the total balance. Currently, some financial institutions also offer 5% for the first $2,000 invested in pensioner deeming accounts. With the reduction in deeming rates to 4% and 6% effective from 23 January it is expected that the interest rates for pensioner deeming accounts will also reduce to 4% and 6%. (2) At the time this initiative was developed there were an estimated 121,000 service pension accounts that attracted less than 5%, with the approximate number of service pensioners affected being 100,000. The average reduction of service pension under the current deeming rates is estimated at less than $1.00 per fortnight. Pensioners who lose pension can actually increase their overall income by choosing to place their money in investments which return at least the 'below threshold rate', currently 5%, on the first $2000 (for single pensioners) or $4000 (for pensioner couples). Whilst assessing more interest may mean a lower pension rate, the total income for the pensioner would go up because the pension only reduces by $0.50 for each $1.00 eamed. Pensioners who will not be affected by this initiative are those with small amounts of financial assets, that is single pensioners with less than $44,900 and pensioner couples with less than $78,100. (3) Estimated savings are $349,000 in the financial year 1996/97 and $2.467m in a full year. For your information: Effect of Change to Deeming Rates: With the reduction in deeming rates to 4% and 6% from 23 January 1997 there will be some impact on these estimates of the number of pensioner accounts affected. However, on current figures available it is not possible to determine the extent of this impact. We can indicate that the amount of financial assets pensioners can have without being affected by this initiative will increase to $49,573 for single pensioners and $91,201 for pensioner couples. Banking Industry: Technologies (Question No. 933)  on 6 November 1996: (1) Further to question No. 904, is he able to say (a) whether the banking industry has invested millions of dollars in technology and (b) how many jobs have been lost to the banking industry as a result of the introduction of technology. (2) Is he also able to say whether the advances in technology have been applied to achieve a speedier clearance of cheques; if so, what improvements have been achieved; if not, why not. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Yes. The banking industry has invested heavily in technology. (b) Employment data specific to the banking sector are not available. However, Australian Bureau of Statistics data indicate that Finance Sector Employment levels (which includes banking, finance, insurance and services to finance and insurance categories) have increased from 302,200 in June 1986 to 321,600 in June 1996, but have fallen from a peak of 352,800 in June 1991. This fall can be attributed to a number of factors; technological advances will have created some specific job losses, saved some jobs which would otherwise have been lost, and created some new job opportunities. (2) The time it takes a bank to clear a cheque is a function of the time needed to transport, process and check the authenticity of the cheque, plus an allowance for the time it takes for any advice of dishonour to reach the institution where the cheque was deposited. The Australian Payments Clearing Association (whose membership includes banks, building societies and credit unions) is involved in a project using technological advances to facilitate electronic presentment of cheques and electronic communication of a dishonour, with the objective of reducing cheque clearance times. The Australian Payments Clearing Association believes that the current 5 day clearing cycle should be able to be reduced to 3 or 4 days without increasing the risk that the dishonour advice is received after the cheque proceeds are drawn down. Legal Assistance: Parker, J. Mrs (Question No. 938) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 7 November 1996: (1) Did his department receive an application for legal assistance from Mrs J. Parker and family in relation to the family being denied residence in their family home at Kintore, NT. (2) Was the application rejected; if so, on what grounds. (3) Is he able to say whether, following the ordering of her departure, the Central Land Council (CLC) admitted that (a) Mrs Parker and (b) the Parker children were traditional owners and entitled to reside at Kintore under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. (4) Is he able to say whether the CLC and persons unknown still (a) deny Mrs Parker and her children's right to reside in her home with her husband, on the basis that her husband is not an Aborigine and (b) demand permission to be sought, obtained and maintained for the Parkers to reside together in their family home. (5) Is he able to say whether the CLC claims the exclusion to be lawful. (6) Will he review the decision to reject Mrs Parker's application for legal assistance; if not, why not. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There exists a long standing practice, endorsed by successive Attorneys-General, to treat applications for Commonwealth financial assistance in confidence. This practice extends to neither confirming or denying that particular applications have been received and accords with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. Consequently it would not be appropriate to provide details in relation to any individual applications for assistance. (2) Same as for (1). (3) I am unable to speak on behalf of the Central Land Council. (4) Same as for (3). (5) Same as for (3). (6) Same as for (1). Civil Aviation Safety Authority: (Question No. 970)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (I) Has he requested Mr D. Wheelahan, QC, to conduct an investigation concerning the Civil A viation Safety Authority. (2) Has Mr Wheelahan served with the Royal Australian Navy; if so, what are his details. (3) Does Mr Wheelahan have specific aviation experience; if so, what are the details. (4) Does Mr Wheelahan have aircraft endorsements; if so, what are they and how long has he had them. (5) Has Mr Wheelahan had, or does he have, an association with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; if so, what are the details. (6) Was Mr Wheelahan recommended for this investigation; if so, by whom. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. He joined the Royal Australian Navy Reserve in 1977. He was appointed a Defence Force Magistrate member of the Judge Advocate's Panel on 23 October 1989. He was awarded the Reserve Force Decoration effective from December 1991. He was promoted to Commander in 1993. (3) No. (4) No. (5) Mr Wheelahan has advised that the only association he has had with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) is that during the course of his Inquiry he has had conversations with and received documents from members of AOPA. Before the Inquiry members of AOPA were known to him socially. (6) I appointed Mr Wheelahan to conduct the Inquiry based on his relevant legal experience for an Inquiry of this type. Applications for Refugee Status (Question No. 973) Ms Hanson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) How many applications for refugee status have been received since November 1995. (2) How many applications for refugee status received since November 1995 were from Thai females. Investigation (3) What is the average time taken to process an application for refugee status, from the date of lodgement to the date of final decision. (4) What percentage of applications for refugee status since November 1995 were successful. (5) What was the average cost of processing unsuccessful applications for refugee status since November 1995. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 9,144 people made applications for a protection visa during the period from 1 November 1995 to 31 October 1996. (2) 183 Thai females applied for a protection visa during the period from 1 November 1995 to 31 October 1996. (3) From application to determination, the average processing time for all applications processed during the period 1 November 1995 to 31 October 1996 was 16 months. It is to be noted, however, that this processing rate is affected by the backlog of applications. A more meaningful indicator is processing time after interview. For all cases lodged and processed during the period 1 November 1995 to 31 October 1996 the average processing time from interview to primary decision was 2.3 months. (4) 17.78 per cent of applications determined at the primary stage from 1 November 1995 to 31 October 1996 were successful. (5) Processing costs for unsuccessful applications for a protection visa since November 1995 cannot be calculated separately. In 1995/96 running costs for the Determination of Refugee Status Sub Program were $11.5 million and a total of 5,674 primary cases (covering 7,593 people) were determined. Articles Imported by Post (Question No. 995) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: (1) Is the customs value on articles imported by post set at a threshold of $1,000; if so, when was this value set. (2) Is the threshold amount indexed. (3) Will the threshold be reduced to $250; if so, why.  member's question is as follows: (1) The present threshold customs value above which imported postal goods must be formally entered in terms of s.68 of the Customs Act is $1,000. This threshold was established by instrument on 20th December 1985. (2) The threshold figure is not indexed. (3) The stated intention of the Government is to reduce the threshold to $250. This will bring all informal clearance practices into harmony regardless of the mode of importation. The equity of such a change was addressed by the Industry Commission Report No. 28 of 30 October 1992 Mail, Courier and Parcel Services. That forum criticised the advantage enjoyed by Australia Post compared with air freight forwarding and courier services as a result of the higher threshold for postal articles. It should be noted that for personal importations, (goods for personal use and not for resale or hire) the entry threshold will remain at $1,000 for all modes of importation. In the case of personal effects (ie: accompanied or unaccompanied baggage) there is no threshold, all goods are cleared informally. Australian National: Asset Sales (Question No. 1001) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: Are discussions taking place with Goninans for the acquisition or operation of the railway locomotives operation by Australian National; if so, when will the results be available. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The sale of AN's assets, including locomotives, will need to await completion of a scoping study to be undertaken by consultants to the Office of Asset Sales. The study is scheduled for completion by the end of January 1997. Expressions of interest are to be invited as soon as possible thereafter. Intergenerational Budget Reporting (Question No. 1007) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 3 December 1996: What data will be produced dealing with the impact of changes to the tax/transfer/entitlements system of the post-war welfare state on various age cohorts in the Government's intergenerational budget reporting under its Charter of Budget Honesty.

(2) Are steps being taken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to rectify the exclusion on future Census forms; if so, what steps. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, the information collected in the 1996 Census does not enable the identification of South Sea Islanders as a distinct ethnic group. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) believes that the best way to collect information Australian South Sea Islanders as an ethnic group would be by way of an ancestry question in the Census. However. after extensive consultation with users and with the Australian Statistics Advisory Council on the costs and value of a question on ancestry, it was decided not to include such a question in the 1996 Census. (2) Yes. The ABS will consult with the Australian South Sea Islander community (through the Queensland Bureau of Ethnic Affairs) and the community generally to identify the extent of need for data on Australian South Sea Islanders, so ABS can take this into account when considering the content for the 2001 Census. ABS also intends to conduct tests on the method of collecting the data effectively in the Census. Tax File Numbers: Non-Permanent (Question No. 1010) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 December 1996: (I) Can persons who are neither permanent residents nor have permission under their visas to work in Australia, be questioned about tax file numbers under privacy provisions; if not, why not. (2) Is his Department undertaking a review of this situation to ensure that visitors illegally working in Australia cease this activity. Mr Costello-The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence for anyone to request a person to quote his or her tax file number unless the person making the request is doing so for a purpose authorised by law. The Australian Taxation Office, employers, banks and certain Government Departments that pay allowances and benefits, are examples of who might legally be allowed to make a request for a tax file number. While Tax File Number Guideline 1.2 of the Privacy Act 1988 provides that an individual who has a tax file number can choose not to quote it and subsection 8C(2) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 states that it is not an offence for a person to choose not to quote a tax file number, there is nothing in law that actually prohibits a person from questioning another person about whether or not the other person has a tax file number. (2) The Australian Taxation Office currently has a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on (DIMA) that provides for the regular exchange of information between the two agencies, with a view to assisting DIMA in locating any unlawful non citizens or visitors who are illegally working in Australia.

210,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,EXPENDITURE ON PAPER AND PAPER PRODUCTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Commonwealth, with the assistance of all States and Territories, compiled a preliminary report on the availability and nature of palliative care in Australia in early 1996. The report was presented to the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council in February 1996. The report identified that there was a wide range of palliative care services available in a variety of settings; that there was maldistribution of services, eg, between urban and rural areas; and that further studies were needed to identify the level of need for palliative care and the real level of resources required and being allocated to palliative care. (3) Palliative care is provided in a variety of settings, including homes, hospices and hospitals. The emphasis of initiatives funded by the Commonwealth for palliative care has been holistic care provision focussing on domiciliary service provision rather than inpatient care. ""Number of beds"" has therefore become inadequate as a measure of service provision as it does not reflect either the total provision of services nor the level of need. In order to develop more appropriate measures, the Commonwealth has funded projects to develop standard data definitions and performance indicators for palliative care services which will enable better identification of the level of need for these services and the real level of resources allocated to palliative care. Foreign Nationals: Property Ownership (Question No. 1090)  notice, on 12 December 1996: Under what conditions are foreign nationals permitted to (a) purchase freehold residential land, (b) lease freehold residential land, (c) purchase residential property and (d) lease residential property. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (c) Except for some exemptions, prior approval under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (FATA) is necessary in the case of all acquisitions of real estate by foreign nationals. Acquisitions of residential real estate are exempt the from examination in the case of foreign nationals who are the holders of permanent resident visas or are holders of, or entitled to hold, a 'special category visa'. Foreign nationals may also partake of the exemption that applies to the acquisition of residential property (both vacant land and existing dwellings) that are within the bounds of a resort that has been designated as an 'Integrated Tourism Resort'. Approval is normally given for acquisitions to buy vacant residential land, but on condition that continuous construction of a dwelling is commenced within 12 months from approval. Approval is also normally given to buy home units, townhouses, etc 'off-the-plan', under construction or newly constructed but never occupied, on condition that no more than half of the units in anyone development is sold to foreign interests. the-plan' criteria only apply to new development projects or extensively refurbished commercial structures that have been converted to residential.) All other proposals by foreign nationals to acquire developed residential real estate are not normally approved, except in the case of foreign companies buying for their senior executives, resident in Australia, and foreign nationals temporarily resident in Australia for more than 12 months buying for their own use as a principal residence (subject to the sale of the property when they cease to reside in Australia) and foreign nationals purchasing residential real estate as joint tenants with an Australian spouse. (b) and (d) Approval is required where foreign nationals intend to acquire an interest as lessee or licensee in a lease or licence that gives rights to occupy Australian urban land where the term of the lease or licence (including any extension) is reasonably likely, at the time the interest is acquired, to exceed 5 years. Should this be the case, the restrictive policy as outlined above for the acquisition of residential real estate by foreign nationals applies.

Revegetation (Question No. 1114) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: What is the current position in regard to the revegetation of (a) Phillip Island and (b) Norfolk Island. Mr W arwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Norfolk Island National Park and Phillip Island, (which is part of the Norfolk Island National Park) are managed by the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, through Parks Australia. (a) Phillip Island Prior to 1986, when the former Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) achieved eradication of rabbits from Phillip Island, Number of Child Postcode Support Agency Clients 6205 51 6108 867 the Child Support Agency's computer system to provide Therefore figures for those postcodes which the Island was a severely eroding landscape with minimal vegetation cover. Since then, ANPWS and its successors, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, and Parks Australia, in conjunction with the Norfolk Island Forestry Section and various community groups, have contributed to controlling erosion and encouraging native vegetation on the Island. Between 30% and 50% of the Island is now covered with vegetation. In 1996, Phillip Island was proclaimed as an extension to Norfolk Island National Park. Parks Australia staff are undertaking planting activities, soil retention measures and weed control on the Island as part of the continuing revegetation program. (b) Norfolk Island Approximately 20% of the area of Norfolk Island is set aside as national park or other reserves. Responsibility for managing these reserves rests with Parks Australia, the Kingston Arthurs Vale Historic Area Board or the Forestry Section of the Norfolk Island Administration. All management bodies have active weed control programs and a jointly-operated nursery produces large numbers of native plants for planting programs and public sale. Parks Australia also has a recovery program for some 40 rare native plants which are propagated and distributed widely across the Island. Various community groups, such as the Norfolk Island Landcare Group and private individuals are also active in the rehabilitation of native vegetation on Norfolk Island. The major vegetation problem for both Islands is the control of invasive weed species and their replacement with native plants. Annual expenditure on rehabilitation is approximately $500,000. Newcastle Disease (Question No. 1115) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: Has evidence of Newcastle disease been found in birdlife in Antarctica; if so, (a) what evidence has been found and (b) has the source of the infection been identified; if so, what is it. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Newcastle disease has not been found in birdlife in Antarctica. However, antibodies to Newcastle disease virus have been found in serum from Adelie and royal penguins in a number of locations around Antarctica as far back as 1981. While the source and significance of these antibodies is uncertain, ongoing research into the presence of antiviral antibodies in Antarctic birds is continuing this summer at Mawson and Davis. This research is being undertaken in close cooperation between scientists from the Antarctic Division and the University of Western Australia.
