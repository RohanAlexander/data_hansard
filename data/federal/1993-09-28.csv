1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA Wine: Taxation",11
2,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will be aware that, on the AM program today, Senator MCMullan cast doubt on the all or nothing budget strategy which the Treasurer clearly enunciated last week by saying that it was up for discussion whether the wine tax was 'so important that we will pull the House down for it'. Will the Treasurer now confirm that the government is prepared to abandon its total linkage approach in the interests of delivering the Prime Minister's personal income tax cuts?",11
3,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What right have you got to ask these questions? You are going to vote against it. Mr Downer-You will back off, then?",11
4,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You could not lie straight in bed.,11
5,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister might cease interjecting across the chamber.,11
6,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was quite enjoying the banter. I did not want to interrupt the Prime Minister; I thought he was doing quite well. It ill becomes the opposition to come in here and talk about what the government's attitude is to the opposition's wrecking tactics. If the opposition is remotely concerned about when these tax cuts are paid, and indeed whether these tax cuts are paid, the solution lies in hands; all it has to do is pass the bills-as it responsibly should do. In relation to the wine tax, I have made the point on many occasions that this matter is something which will obviously be looked at once the Senate has made its decision on it. But even if the Senate were to reject the wine tax, as I have said before, that is not the end of the government's options. The government has many options to ensure that taxation on wine should be fairer and should more equally relate to the taxation which applies to other alcoholic beverages. As far as the industry is concerned, we have had discussions with it. We are still prepared to talk with the industry at a time which suits it. Fiscal Policy",11
7,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the concern in the Australian rural community about the stability of fiscal policy? Can he assure us that the government will do all it can to eliminate these cpncerns?,11
8,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, indeed, aware of these concerns and I share them. Australia has been recognised as doing well internationally-the most recent example being the International Olympic Committee's endorsement of Australia. But more generally, wherever one goes, whether it be to the United States or to Europe, the changes which have been made in Australia and the successes of the country are being understood.,.....but they are not being supported at home, particularly by the federal opposition. There is a concern, in rural Australia about the stability of fiscal",11

10,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Mr Thckey-He does not speak for everyone.,11
11,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, do I get protection against this? .",11
12,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,11
13,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, there is a concern in rural Australia about the stability of fiscal policy, about the exchange rate and about interest rates. To demonstrate that, I its quote the President of the National Farmers Federation, who has made clear what he thinks of the tactics of the federal opposition in relation to fiscal policy. He said: Dr Hewson and his advisers prefer to play the politics of nailing the government rather than show leadership and propose a solution. I find that attitude tremendously sad and disillusioning. This is the leader of the National Farmers Federation speaking. He went on to say: I know that people in regional· Australia would rather see a constructive opposition than one solely intent on destruction. Let me repeat that: I know that people in regional Australia would rather see a constructive opposition than one solely intent on destruction. This is not an organisation affiliated with the Labor Party; this is a body which has generally supported the conservative side of politics. This is a person who was elected to lead the national farmers organisation in this country. On the issue of the budget-the true issue of national importance- Mr Blight's loyalties are to the prosperity and success of Australia. Earlier this month, he told a meeting in Adelaide that the opposition's position on the budget bills was 'preposterous'.",11
14,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think it is standing order 70 which deals with interjections and says that when a person is on his feet he is entitled to be heard in silence. The honourable member for O'Connor has made up to 15 interjections to this point in time. He had a record of 11 0 a few days ago and I would. hate to see him break it.",12
15,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,":- Mr Speaker, I rise on the point of order. It passes very strange to observers of this House and participants in this House that the Leader of the House should seek to complain about some mild murmurs on this side of the House, particularly when we have such a fragile parliamentary performer as the Prime Minister on his feet.",12
16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You may resume your seat, and. the honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat until I have ruled on these points of order. . ..",12
17,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,":-- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.·",12
18,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. . Mr TUCKEY - But I have a point of order.,12
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat. MrTuckey-He ought to know that 75 is the standing order.,12
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said on a number of occasions in this place, the literal interpretation of the standing orders would place a prohibition on members doing anything other than taking their place in this chamber and not saying a word. If we· are going to have noise meters or anything else to measure interjections in this place, as some might suggest, that would make a farce of the place. Having said that, ministers, including the Prime Minister, are entitled to be heard in silence. I request that honourable members on both sides of the House pay due deference to ministers when they are responding to questions.",12
21,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In Adelaide, Mr Blight told a meeting that the opposition's position on the budget bills. was 'preposterous'. He said: Their position now is to oppose the indirect tax increases in the budget but support the. personal tax cuts. It's not constructive .. It's not responsible. It's not politically al'tute. He went on to say: If that position, heaven forbid, were put into practice, the deficit would blowout and interest rates inevitably would riseMr Bruce Scott-You would not know about it.",12
22,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for ·Maranoa.,12
23,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He said: ... interest rates inevitably would rise, growth would be kicke4 in the guts and more people would be out of a job. This is the President of the National Farmers , Federation speaking. He went on to say: ... hardly a platform which will win votes and promote them to government. He went on to say: .Thank goodness the opposition's position hasn't got a snowball's chance in hell of getting up. They won't have the numbers in the Senate because the Democrats have already done their deal with Mr Dawkins, and the. Greens are now cutting their own deal. So what has. the oppositioll accomplished? Absolutely nothing-nothing for the people who supported them at the last election and whose support they need if they are to win the next one. The great danger· from their position is that we could end up with a higher deficit without much change to planned increases in indirect tax. Not tremendously smart tactics the way I see it. Me Blight does not stop with the honourable member for Wentworth. He goes on to talk about the Leader of the National Party. He says: Tim Fischer had better start understanding what this budget means to rural Australia. It is absolutely irresponsible to support the tax cuts on moral grounds, and then believe that opposing indirect taxes is suddenly moral. Certainly we are opposed to the indirect taxes, but isn't the moral issue about promoting a view that is economically responsible? Here we have one of the leading spokespersons for rural Australia-indeed, for conservative Australia-standing up to the tactics of the Leader of the Opposition. Mr L1oyd- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point of order is that the leader of the NFF is not supporting the government. He is asking us just to oppose",12
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,13
25,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite squirm when they hear it. Mr Blight says: I know that people in regional Australia would rather see a constructive opposition than one solely intent on destruction. That is what this Leader of the Opposition Is about. He is doing what no other Leader of the Opposition has ever done; he says he will use his numbers in the Senate to not pass the government's financial legislation. This is a matter of simple observation. This Leader of the Opposition is standing up the passage of the government of the day's financiallegislation in the Senate. In doing that, he is breaking all of the key conventions of the passage of budgets in Australian politics. That is the key point. This person is deciding to break the conventions by trying to stand up the government's budget from the House of Representatives in the Senate. It is that tactic which is called into question by the leader of the National Farmers Federation when he says that it is not constructive and is solely intent on destruction. He goes on to say: It is not constructive, it is not not politically astute. Let us understand exactly what the Leader of the Opposition is trying to do. He is trying to rewrite the rule books of Australian political life. He is trying to establish as the convention that an opposition in the Senate has the right to refuse, for just nasty political reasons-not for any other reasons-the passage of the government's budget. This is at a time when the government made its position very clear. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On the point of relevance, the Prime Minister's answer is incomplete because it is not referring to 1981 when he voted against the Fraser government's taxation proposals.",13
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,13
27,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One thing is quite clear. I said that in the event that the now federal opposition became the government this government in opposition would pass the money bills of the then government in the Senate. I made it quite clear that a Labor opposition would give support to the money bills of a coalition government in the House of Representatives in line with the conventions. But what we have got here is convention breaking. What we have got here is wrecking. What we have got here is the nasty kind of damage being done to the fabric of our parliamentary processes and our economy by what Mr Blight says is simply a policy solely intent upon destruction. So let it be understood, if by no other basis than by observation, that this Leader of the Opposition, because of spite at having lost the hist election, has decided that what he wishes to now do is to break the convention of Australian politics and not pass the financial legislation of the government through the Senate. And, in so doing, he is calling into question fiscal policy in this country. He has already seen the impact upon the exchange rate, and here Mr Blight is talking about the potential for interest rates. He refers to the other potential-that is, conservative Australia telling the Leader of the Opposition what is right, what is expected of him and what he responsible and it is should do. Budget 1993-94",13
28,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer, and turns to the opinions of one of his own on the budget. I refer the Treasurer",13
29,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,13
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the National Party will get to his question. Those on my right will cease interjecting.,14
31,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is only a young bloke; give him a go.,14
32,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development is not helping.",14
33,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Treasurer to the regular newspaper column of his colleague the honourable member for Hunter-here it is, 'Hunter Electorate' by Eric Fitzgibbon-published on 15 September last in which he said: It took a backbench revolt and an insistence on a consultative process to bring about a recasting this year's Budget ... I am not short of loyalty, but I was embarrassed trying to sell the original Budget to my electorate while arguing in Canberra to destroy the politically stupid parts. Does the Treasurer agree with the honourable member for Hunter or does he regard him as disloyal?",14
34,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have never missed one of Eric's columns; I read them avidly. But I must say that on this occasion he did err.,14
35,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Treasurer inform the House of the administrative arrangements required for Australian workers to receive in their pay packets the income tax cuts with immediate effect from 15 November? Has the Treasurer received advice on the effects of the tax cuts on consumer demand over the Christmas period?,14
36,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. He is drawing attention to the fact that, prior to the actual payment of the tax cuts into the pockets of Australian working men and women, the Taxation Office must make certain administrative arrangements with employers who can give effect to those changed rates in those pay packets. New rates ofPAYE tax instalment deductions must be prescribed. New tax instalment schedules must be printed. The tax instalment schedules must be distributed to employers, and employers will then require time to modify their payroll systems. This process cannot begin until such time as the bill has passed the parliament and received royal assent. There is then a three-week delay from that period before the effect of the tax changes can be reflected within the pay packets of Australian working men and women. It is the government's intention to ensure that those tax cuts are paid from the pay period closest to 15 November. This is because we believe it is important to have those tax cuts in the pockets of Australian taxpayers prior to the Christmas period. It is also part of providing a stimulus to the economy and a benefit to middle Australia. On the advice of the Commissioner of of Taxation, this means that the bills would have to be passed through the Senate by 21 October. Of course, any action on the part of the Liberals in delaying that passage beyond the 21st would lead to a delay in those tax cuts being reflected in the pay packets of taxpayers. One must ask: what do the Liberals have against those people who are the target beneficiaries of the tax cuts? Some Liberals even seem to oppose the very idea of providing the tax cuts, and all of them seem to be entirely nonchalant about the idea that these Tax Cuts payments should be delayed. A typical taxpaying Australian, a stenographer secretary currently on a weekly income of $520 would benefit in the course of this financial year by $159. The amount that secretary would receive before Christmas would be $32. A bus driver on $610 a week would expect to receive $55 before Christmas, a nurse would receive $91 and a motor mechanic would receive $34. Imagine how handy it would be for those people to have a benefit in the form of a tax cut so that they could make their purchases prior to Christmas. Yet it is the opposition tactic to find whatever delaying mechanism it can-whether some trumped-up legal argument, reference to a Senate committee or some other trumped-up argument-to deny these ordinary, average, working men and women in Australia the tax cuts which are due to them. The point is that the Senate and the Liberals will bear the responsibility for any delays which occur in this regard. If any of these tax cuts are not received before Christmas and not taken into account in the PAYE schedules, those taxpayers will have to wait until July next year to receive the benefit of those tax cuts by way of a refund on their tax assessment. The coalition carries a heavy responsibility for the kinds of Christmas tidings that ordinary Australians are likely to have this year. Wholesale Sales Tax",14
37,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. In the report released yesterday, entitled 'Australia: Your Business Location in Asia', it was revealed that the government encouraged Cathay Pacific to move a key telecommunications hub and data centre to Australia by waiving sales tax. Given that in the mark 1,2 and 3 versions of the 1993-94 budget the government is increasing wholesale sales taxes on business inputs, why does the Treasurer not do for Australian business a fraction of what he was prepared to do for Cathay Pacific, and abandon those tax increases?",15
38,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would not do so because it would be irresponsible to do so. Unlike the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Barker does not have access to the immediate advice of the honourable member for Bennelong, but he should ask the honourable member what he did in his last two budgets. He put up wholesale sales tax rates, not by one per cent but by 2112 per cent, in two years running. For two years running he put up the WST rates-and, of course, the Senate passed them.",15
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And you opposed it. Mr Downer-You did.,15
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Mayo!,15
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You voted against it. Mr SPEAKER'""-Order!",15
42,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Special Minister of State mentioned yesterday what we are doing to encourage foreign companies to estl;lblish regional headquarters in Australia. If those opposite are interested in some dispassionate opinions about this budget, I refer them to what Heinz Fesser from the Deutsche Bank said. He said, 'The economic fundamentals are better",15
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There are plenty of quotes since then.,15
44,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have dozens of them here.,15
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Have you read the Economist lately?,15
46,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Johnny, you did not actually ask the question.",15
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong! The Treasurer will cease responding to interjections.,15
48,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why do you not be quiet and let me answer 11m's question? The honourable member for Barker wants to know,15
49,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Economist is good reading.,15
50,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why do you not read the back? Read the economic forecast on the back.,15
51,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. It is becoming somewhat habitual in this place, it would seem, for people to start waving around pieces of papers or magazines.",15

56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Look at the Prime Minister first.,15
57,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong!,15
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes.,15
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was about to say, if honourable members continue waving around pieces of paper, magazines or cards, perhaps it will be time to start waving arourid a few red cards in this place. I call the Treasurer.",15
60,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Leader of the Opposition looks inside the back cover of that magazine, he will find that Australia is the fastest growing economy in the OECD, and it has about the lowest rate of inflation in the OECD. So why does he not start reading the bits that really matter rather than some scuttlebutt? Mr Fesser says that the economic fundamentals are better in Australia than in the US. Mr Thursby from Baring Asset Management says that there is nothing in the budget to perturb investors. Charles Jackson from Warburg Asset Management says: There is a reasonable degree of confidence in Australian government. In other words, the international commentators who provide advice to foreign investors are saying that this is a good budget, it is a budget that is good for Australia, and they would say to honourable members opposite that it is a budget that they should pass. Olympic Games",15
61,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Given Sydney's success in winning the bid to host the year 2000 Olympics, in which most events will be held at HOJ1lebush Bay, can the minister explain to the House the federal government's role in preparing our team for the games? What benefits will flow from the games to Australian sports in general?",16
62,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday in the House the Prime Minister congratulated all the people who had been involved in the bid for the Olympic Games, and I would like to reinforce that. Today it has been announced that the Paralympics also will be held in Sydney. I am sure that I could extend the best wishes of everyone in this House to the paralympic committee which, with the support of the Sydney 2000 bid, has put forward a successful bid. Both these bids have had the support of all levels of government. They have built on the bids from Melbourne and also from Brisbane. One of the main reasons for the success of our Olympic bid was undoubtedly international recognition of us as a successful sporting nation. We now have more world champions in more sports than ever before. This was a very high quality technical bid, based on the interests of the athletes, to provide a clean environment for them to perform at their maximum capacity. So, in the next seven years, the test for all of us-all governments, communities and sporting organisations-is to build on that success to produce not only the best and the most successful team ever but also to produce the fittest and the healthiest society. It is. essential that we realise that, though Sydney is the host city, these games are for the all Australians and for all Australian sport. We must provide an Australian team, not just a Sydney team. Our challenge is to win more gold medals than we did in Melbourne. As the host nation, we will be competing in events that we have never qualified in before. We must do well in those events. To do well, we need the support of everyone, including every honourable member in this House. Mr Nehl- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145-that of relevance. The question specifically asked was: what will the federal government's contribution be to the holding of the 2000 Olympics? So far the only contribution has been blabber. Can we get some facts out of this minister?",16
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The minister is entirely relevant.,16
64,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought that the honourable member would appreciate the congratulations of this House being extended to the Australian Paralympic Federation. What will the government be doing? First, we must have a national effort. All state governments must be involved, so I will be writing today to all my state colleagues proposing a mechanism to ensure national coordination. We will also be working with the Australian Olympic Committee, and I will be meeting with John Coates, the President of the committee, on Thursday of this week. We are currently providing about $80 million a year in sport and we have done that over the last five years, so we are building on a very strong base. But we have to work with the national sporting groups and the Olympic Committee to ensure that they have a strong foundation and that our base on which to build our elite athletes is firm. Over this year in particular we will be giving $25 million directly to Olympic sports. By the year 2000 this will total some $200 million, and one would expect funding to increase as we get closer. The government has already contributed $5 million to the Olympic bid, tnaking it one of the biggest contributors to the bid, and we have already committed $150 million to the New South Wales government to help with the development of the games facilities. The interest expected in this will be enormous, not just in the year 2000 but in the build-up, and I think all Australians will benefit from that. For example, last week we had calls from members of the Japanese Olympic Committee wanting to come to Australia to look at our facilities. So there will be a lot of interest and a lot of benefits outside of the direct benefits to sport. The centre of our activities has to be the Australian Sports Commission, the elite bodies around this nation in each of the states and the Australian Institute of Sport. However, if we are going to provide this challenge to win these gold medals, we have. to build our base in sport. We have to enhance - port­ ing participation and development in this nation, and we have to start withour school children. That will be one of our great challenges. We cannot produce top class olympic athletes while we continue this trend to get rid of sport in schools. State governments in particular have' to keep that in mind. Sport has to continue in our schools, especially in Queensland but also in every other state in this nation. We must win more gold medals at the Olympics in the year 2000, but we also need to build our base and, therefore, lead to a fitter and healthier society in the year 2000. Tax Cuts",16
65,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer and is on behalf of average Australians.,17
66,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjectingMrKeating-That is not true.,17
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat.,17
68,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know that the Prime Minister gets excited about what average Australians are concerned about.,17
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will get to his question.,17
70,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why should Australians be denied personal tax cuts by a government which originally promised them without increasing other taxes but which now says those cuts cannot be delivered without a massive new tax slug? Mr DAWKINS...,.... The Leader of the Opposition can wriggle around on this particular pin but the point is that whether these tax cuts are paid between now and Christmas or indeed during this financial year is entirely in his hands. Why does he not do the decent thing and pass the bill? South Africa",17
71,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government's assessment of the situation in South Africa? What is the government doing to assist the transition to democracy in that country? . Mr BILNEY-I thank the honourable member for his question. It comes particularly appositely from him as the Chairman of the Australian Parliamentarians Against Apartheid group in this parliament. I acknowledge the personal interest he has taken in this question over the years, including visiting that sad country. Amongst the very momentous events that have taken place in recent days-in Russia, in the Middle East and in Monaco-not the least momentous has been the passage through the parliament in South Africa of legislation on the tran-itional executive council which took place on 23 September. The result of that legislation means that for the first time representatives of all the communities in South. Africa will be able to participate in national government institutions. Of course, that is not the end of the matter. Nelson Mandela observed in his speech to the United Nations the other day that South Africa is not out of the woods yet, and that is partly because some of the political parties continue to boycott the negotiations for the democratic parliament. The government hopes that those parties will return quickly to those multilateral talks so that the proposed timing for the democratic elections in South AfricaApril 1994-can be met. We in the government are also concerned at the continuing high levels of violence in South Africa. We believe much of that is deliberately orchestratdifficult ed in order to undennine the multiparty constitutional negotiations which are currently under way. The honourable member for Throsby also asked what the Australian government is doing .to assist the process of transition to non-racial democracy in South Africa. Austnilia has supported the role of the interrlational community in observing the situation in South Africa as agreed by the United Nations Security Council in UN Security Council resolution 772 of 17 August last year. In accordance with that mandate, Australia has participated in the Commonwealth observer mission to South Africa...:....COMSA-whose aim is to work with the committee set· up under the national peace accord to try· to achieve an end to violence. The third phase of COMSA's operation began in the middle of August and, amongst other issues, it is looking at the implications of violence for the elections scheduled in April next year.. We have a direct participant in those observations, Mr Tim Glanville, a senior officer of the Australian Electoral Commission. We are also discussing with .other members of the Commonwealth possible Commonwealth involvement in observing the elections in South Africa in April 1994 and assisting with their conduct, as indeed we did in Zimbabwe in years past. On· 17 December I also announced that Australia will assist South Africa through our aid program, through modifying and redesigning our special assistance program for South Africa in order to address the new political circumstances in South Africa. That package of aid will comprise around $7 million this year, and will include the use of Australian expertise in key areas such. as the electoral process, economic policy and planning, media training, civil service and. constitutional and local government refonn. We have already let contracts through AIDAB of almost $1 million for media democratisation and television journalist training in South Africa. The black colllIhunity has suffered for many years under the oppression of apartheid and it will need all the assistance it can get from the international community through that transition from apartheid to democracy. The Australian government remains, as it has always been, committed to helping with that task. Olympic Games",17

78,Mrs KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the honourable member to an interview this morning conducted with John· Howard and Mr John Coates, the President of the Australian Olympic Committee. Mr Coates said: Well, in so far as the flag is concerned, I would hope that there would be a new flag by 1996 in Atlanta.",19
79,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services to claims that confidence in the housing market is shaky. Could the minister please advise the House whether these claims are correct? Could he also inform the House of current and projected demands for housing in Australia and the government's response to these demands?",19
80,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Newcastle for his question. It gives me the opportunity to reflect on the opposition's approach to policy. Following the release yesterday of some HIA numbers in relation to the activity of volume builders, which showed a slight downturn, the shadow minister, the honourable member for Forrest in his press release said: Sighs of a fall in new home sales, revealed in the HIA's latest industry survey, show a continued upswing in housing activity is far from being thing. There is a sign, some numbers are out, and imm-diately the honourable member for Forrest needs to let the Australian people know that, as he says, as a result of a lack of confidence in the budget, we are due for a downturn in housing activity. The honourable member for Forrest apparently does not know that the Government's official forecast, the IPC, predicts that there will be a decline from 161,000 starts last year to 150,000 starts in the course of this year. Effectively, in terms of the official forecast,we have some expectation of a decline. The surprising thing is that the housing industry, in a sense, is refusing to go the way of the forecast this year and high levels of activity are continuing in the housing industry. When I was in Newcastle recently my attention was drawn to the fact that the city of Newcastle in recent years has had the first increase in population in many decades. 1 was interested to inquire about some of the reasons for that increase in the population of that more mature city. 1 was told it was due in part to the innovative housing options in the city, including medium density housing, shop tops and regulatory reform to enable the industry to respond quickly to consumer Housing demand. This trend is emerging in capital cities around Australia and, indeed, reflects the Government's policy to provide greater choice for Australians and housing-choices that enable the Australian population to meet their needs and preferences-and the changing lifestyles of people. For example, at the tum of the century nearly half of the population will be over the age of 45 and only 20 per cent of household income units will consist of a traditional family, two adults and two children. Almost 50 per cent of household income units will be single people or childless couples over the age of 35. It is an extraordinary statistic to suggest that half the household units in Australia will be one or two person households and that 20 per cent of households in this country, just after the tum of the century, will have children within them. That suggests a very big demoa sure graphic change. The housing industry clearly needs to respond to that change. It is of no moment at all that the honourable member for Forrest should grab at a small s-atistic, of no long-term significance, in order to tear away in confidence, to tear away at the housing industry in this country and show no capacity at all to reflect on a long-term trend which is extremely important in housing the Australian population. The government's policy is to encourage much greater choice in housing in this country and to look to ensure that affordability, which is the strongest it has been for eight years, continues and that housing interest rates remain low. They are now at the lowest level they have been for several decades. Rather than there being some early sign of some downturn, there is one set of statistics. If we look at the overall picture that is emerging, we see that it shows the housing industry in good shape, a trend towards medium density housing and a range of housing types which at the moment are the growing edge, the cutting edge, in the housing industry in this country.  have them in boxes.",19
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Forrest.,20
82,Mr HOWK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the major reasons there is a continuing high level of activity is that, on the part of the industry, we get a capacity to read the market and the opportunities that are in the market, in line with our forecast broadly and in line with the need for a strong industry. We do not get an opportunistic approach, which we see from the honourable member for' Forrest. He is not interested in facts or policy, he is interested only in disrupting the government, being as negative as possible and essentially making no contribution to the country. Those opposite do not believe in Australia; they just beiieve in coming in here and pursuing destructive tactics. Banking: South Australia",20
83,Mr STEELE HALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Treasurer aware that, despite the South Australian government's action in splitting the failed State Bank into a good bank and a bad bank, the two results together for last year resulted in a substantial loss? Is he aware that, despite this loss, the South Australian government extracted from the good bank over $300 million in returned profit, returned capital and .several other charges? Is the Reserve Bank closely monitoring the South Australian government's management of the good bank and the bad bank? Is the Treasurer kept informed of that management? Is he aware of the quality of the operation of the bank?",20
84,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In recent times, the states have all agreed that their banks-to the extent that they still have them-should be subject to the Opposition members-Ha, hal",20
85,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We actually believe that they should sell them and I thought those opposite did, too. To the extent that there !lre still state banks like the State Bank of New South Wales, the R&I Bank in Western Australia and so on, those banks, by reasol1 of a voluntary arrangement whicl;t has b-en entered into between the states which own those banks, are now subject to the supervision of the Reserve Bank. However, as a regular matter of advice, I do not receive information from the Reserve Bank on the monitoring or general purview of these banks or any of the banks. These are matters which are properly in the hands of the Reserve Bank; properly matters for the Governor to be concerned about. If there are any particular matters which the honourable member would wish me to pursue with the Governor, I would be perfectly happy to convey his request to the Governor and the Governor can reply directly to him. .

88,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave- Mr Speaker, I wish to inform the House of the outcome of my visit to the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Monaco between 11 and 24 September. During the visit, I dealt with a number of issues which will have a profound bearing on Australia's trading interests and future prosperity, on our national identity, and on how we and others see our place in the world. These are all big questions, and it is important that we get them right. At a time of great fluidity in international affairs, we now face fundamental questions about the structure of the world trading system. The opportunity to secure a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round is now close at hand, but the outcome is far from assured. The APEC forum, which Australia has done so much to bring forward, is now poised to develop into a valuable framework for promoting trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States Congress will soon decide whether or not to approve the North American free trade agreement with far-reaching repercussions either way on the US trade policy stance. At this pivotal moment in the international trading environment, it is important that Australians are fully aware of the impact that decisions about future trade structures will have on our interests. Mr Speaker, at stake is nothing less than the future prosperity of our country. At stake is our capacity to provide employment for the next generation of Australians. More than ever before Australia is on its own internationally, fending for itself in a competitive and challenging international environment. papers: But we are seen internationally as a modem society with many assets to help us make our way successfully in the world. Our recent achievements in fostering a tolerant and diverse multicultural society, and in executing a series of major reforms of the Australian economy, highlight our capacity to chartge and to play an increasing role in regional and international affairs. These subjects were the main thrust of my discussions in each of the capitals I visited. Mr Speaker, I visited Washington at a time when Australia's most pressing interests coincide with much that is prominent on the American agenda. The future of the Uruguay Round, the development of APEC and the creation of NAFfAare all matters to which President Clinton, his administration and the Congress are giving high priority. It was a very useful time to be able to put Australia's view and to represent our interests on these issues. Given the enormous stakes involved, it was important to be able to discuss with the United States administration and Congress what sort of policy and institutional framework will best maintain and strengthen the highly valuable economic linkages which now operate between east Asia, Oceania and North America. So strong have these linkages between North America and the western Pacific become over the last decade that today there is a higher degree of trade integration among the f 5 members of APEC than there is among the members of the European Community, or among the three North American economies, or among the east Asian economies considered separately. While the United States market remains vitally important for most east Asian economies, I found a growing awareness in the administration and in Congress that east Asia has also become an increasingly important market for United States exports. Indeed, less than a decade ago, more than one-third of western Pacific exports went to the United States. Today, the proportion is less than quarter. But, over the same period, the proportion of US exports which go to the western Pacific has risen to well over one-quarter, on a par with those to the NAFfA partners and well ahead of exports to the European Community. Since the mid-1980s, the trend rate of growth of US exports to the western Pacific has been three times the rate of growth of western Pacific exports to the United States. This rapid trade growth in the region and the prosperity it produces would be gravely threatened, in my view, if in coming decades North America and the western Pacific went separate ways in trade and strategic alignments. I am glad to be able to report that the Clinton administration is as convinced of the importance of the east Asia region as we ourselves have become. I had very productive discussions in Washington with President Clinton, Secretary of State Christopher, Defense Secretary Aspin, US Trade Representative Kantor, Treasury Secretary Bentsen, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Woolsey, and senior congressional leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitchell, Senate Minority Leader Dole and Speaker of the House of Representatives Foley. My meeting with President Clinton was exceptionally useful. I was impressed by the vigour, imagination and resolve with which he is going about the task of rebuilding American competitiveness and American society. We reaffirmed in our meeting the continuing vitality and relevance of Australia's bilateral relationship with the United States. spite the great changes in the world brought about by the end of the Cold War, fundamental Australian interests continue to be engaged in our relationship with the United States-in our defence alliance, in the mutually beneficial processes of policy consultation we enjoy on a wide range of issues, and in our strong commercial ties. Despite our bilateral access problemswhich I discussed with Ambassador Kantor and congressional leaders-the US market remains Australia's second biggest. Furthermore, the United States is the largest source one- of foreign investment in Australia and the most important destination for Australian investment abroad. . Mr Speaker, my meeting with the President produced three important results. First, we agreed to work closely together for a successful outcome of the informal APEC leaders meeting in Seattle in November. This historic meeting, involving leaders of the key Asia Pacific economies-the fastest growing area of the world-will help define an Asia-Pacific economic community and give political authority and weight to APEC. The President noted Australia's vital contribution to the development of APEC. I was impressed by the President's commitment to the Asia-Pacific economic community, and by the unanimity with which he, his cabinet and the congressional leadership in both houses and both parties expressed their conviction that the United States should assign a higher priority to its trading relations with the western Pacific. Secondly, we agreed that it was very important to world growth and jobs to achieve a successful and balanced outcome to the Uruguay Round by the 15 December deadline for fast-track approval by Congress, and that any move by the European Community to reopen the Blair House accord on agriculture would seriously jeopardise the whole round. The United States has pressed hard in favour of freer trade during seven long years of the GATT negotiations. It has been a policy stance of great value to Australia. But I was convinced by my discusDesions in Washington that 15 December is a real deadline for Congress, and that, if we cannot achieve an acceptable package by then, Congress as well as the administration will turn their attention away from global solutions to trade problems and towards more regional approaches. Thirdly, the President and Ambassador Kantor recognised Australia's concern about the damage that t.he export enhancement program, EEP, subsidies cause our grain exports, and said they would make every effort to minimise the effect on Australia's interests. They noted the administration's decision to stay out of the Indonesian market as a bona fide of their sincerity in this regard. They explained that the EEP was aimed at counteracting European subsidies, and that the only fully effective way to reduce the impact on Australia's grain exports was to conclude the Uruguay Round as soon as possible. Mr Speaker, in New York I addressed a meeting of the Asia Society and had a meeting with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali. I told the Secretary-General that Australia welcomed the new possibilities for the work of the United Nations which have arisen with the disappearance of Cold War constraints. I said that, as a foundation member of the United Nations, Australia is fully committed to the ideals of the charter and wants to see those ideals prosper. I noted that Australia was committed to peacekeeping, with arol1nd 600 Australians serving in Cambodia, Somalia and in other operations around the globe. We were also a substantial financial contributor to the United Nations, paying in full and on time. I told the Secretary-General that Australia would continue to contribute resources and ideas to the organisation. The most recent example of this contribution is Senator Evans's document 'The United Nations: cooperating for peace', examining peacekeeping and conflict resolution, which is being launched in New York this week. I also' made it clear to the Secretary-General, however, that the United Nations Organisation itself had to make sure it was operating as efficiently and effectively as it couldespecially in its administration and in its peacekeeping operations-if it was to maintain the international support needed to fulfil its great potential. Mr Speaker, my visit to the United Kingdom, the first by an Australian Prime Minster since 1987, provided an opportunity to help reinforce and reshape this old and still very valuable relationship. I had a long and productive meeting in London with Prime Minister Major. World trade issues were again the main theme of my discussions. I told Prime Minister Major how much Australia appreciated the very constructive and positive role Britain has played within the EC, and more widely, in pushing the cause of freer world markets and the multinational trading system. We both underlined the importance of a successful and balanced outcome to the Uruguay Round for jobs and growth. We agreed that 15 December is a real deadline for the Uruguay Round. We also discussed the strong and growing economic ties between Britain and Australia. Britain is Australia's fourth largest trading partner, and our eighth largest export market. It is the second largest source of foreign investment in Australia. In tum, we are the fourth largest foreign investor in the UK, ranking above Japan. Prime Minister Major and I agreed that there was much to build on and to develop in this area. We noted that an important Australia-UK trade and investment conference, to be held in Melbourne in January next year, will help to maintain the impetus for growth in our commercial relationship. Mr Speaker, I also spoke to Prime Minister Major about Australia's constitutional arrangements. I said publicly in London that it is not because our affections for Britain are reduced or the friendship between us frailer, or our respect and admiration for the institutions Britain has bequeathed us in any way diminished, that Australia is considering the option of becoming a republic. And I also said that our friendship for Britain would be all the stronger for our becoming a republic, as any friendship is stronger for being more mature. Mr Major-Prime Minister of a Conservative British Government-and Mr Hurd, his Foreign Secretary who was on a parallel visit to Australia, both made publicly and privately clear that the matter of Australia's constitutional arrangements is one for the government, people and parliament of Australia and the Queen of Australia. They both assert, quite correctly, that the modern, mature relationship between Britain and Australia will remain quite unaffected by our moves to become a republic. Mr Speaker, I was received by-Her Majesty the Queen at Balmoral Castle on 18 September. In accordance with long standing convention, the discussion between us must remain confidential. But I am able to say I explained to Her Majesty that, notwithstanding the deep respect and warm affection felt towards her by the Australian people, there was a growing feeling in Australia that constitutional changes should be made to allow the appointment of an Australian head of state. I outlined to Her Majesty the various steps that would be involved in such a process, including the need for a referendum to approve constitutional amendments. I said the Australian government's view was that, if approved by the Australian people at a referendum, it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of federation in 2001. I told Her Majesty that, in such a situation, Australia would remain a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and that the Australian people would warmly welcome visits to Australia by Her Majesty as head of the Commonwealth and as the Queen of the United Kingdom. Her Majesty authorised me to say that she would, of course, act on the advice of her Australian ministers, as she always has, and on any decision made by the Australian people. The issues involved in the creation of a Federal Republic of Australia are complex. They require thoughtful and informed debate. But as a result of my discussions in Britain it is clear that, whatever the outcome of the debate in Australia, whatever the form of constitutional arrangements on which the Australian people finally decide, both Her Majesty and the British government regard these arrangements, properly, as entirely matters to be decided by the Australian people themselves. And it is also clear that the results of any constitutional changes are not seen as a threat-and will not threatenthe warmth of the relationship between Australia and Britain, or the personal respect and affection in which Her Majesty is held. It is my government's firm intention to ensure that, throughout the period that Australians are debating new constitutional arrangements, our existing links with the monarchy are maintained and exercised with dignity and respect. In that regard, I am pleased to announce that I discussed with Her Majesty an invitation I· have extended to the Prince of Wales to visit Australia early in 1994 following proposals by several state governments. The invitation has been accepted. His Royal Highness will arrive in Sydney on 25 January, and visit, in addition to New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland. My visit to Ireland enabled me to mark the very important contribution which Ireland has made to the cultural, social and political development of this country. The people-topeople links between us are still strong and vigorous. In Dublin I had the honour of addressing the Dail, and I had extensive discussions with the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, and leaders of the other Irish political parties. My discussions focused again on the outcome for the Uruguay Round, on which Ireland has been orie of the European countries most resistant to change in the area of agriculture. I put the view forcefully to Irish political leaders, and to business people at a dinner hosted by the Irish-Australian Business Association, that Ireland, with its growing industrial exports, will be best served by ensuring that we get an acceptable outcome to the Uruguay Round. That in turn depended, I said, on the integrity of the Blair House accord on agriculture being fully maintained. I also made the point that, although our trade is growing, the warmth of people-topeople relations between Australia and Ireland is not matched by our commercial links. I said I hoped that companies in each country would increasingly use the other as a base to develop links into Asia and Europe respectively. The warmth displayed by the Irish people tow-rds me as head of the govetnment of Australia was quite profound. In aU parts of the country I visited, there was a spontaneous expression of warm welcome and good wishes towards Australia and the Australian people. It is quite a phenom-non that the cultural and emotional links between Australia and this small country in Europe exist as strongly as they do. It is something Australians should value and continue to nurture. On my way from Ireland to Monaco for the Sydney Olympic bid, I stopped for several hours in France and visited Villers-Bretonneux, the site of the memorial to the 46,000 Australians-18,OOO without a known gravewho died· on the Western Front during the First World War. Like all who have visited the military graveyards of France, I was reminded of the courage and devotion of those young Australians who fought and died in that terrible war and the huge loss this nation suffered on the French battlefields. I was also reminded that the tragedy of which they were victims arose, in large part, from the selfish and narrow nationalism which has so often scarred this century. We have the opportunity, as the century ends, to do things better, to create broader, more inclusive economic structures which will generate new growth and new jobs around the globe by maximising trading opportunities for all countries. If the international community fails in its efforts to resolve the Uruguay Round by mid-Decemb-r, there are other options available· but, as all those I spoke to on my visit agreed, they are not such good options The International Olympic Committee's decision to award the Olympic Games for the year 2000 to Sydney was a wonderful outcome for this country. The Olympics are bound to be a marvellous moment in the life of the city and the nation: a celebration of ternational youth and sport in a young country with extraordinary sporting traditions. All of Australia's attractions will be on show to billions of people around the world as we approach the centenary of the Commonwealth's creation. The Olympics can also be a defining moment in our history-in the 100th year of our nationhood, a brilliant opportunity to celebrate our achievements and define our place in the region and the world. The Olympics will generate economic growth and jobs well beyond Sydney itself. The IOC's decision was a tribute to all those who worked so hard to put together an outstanding bid. My wife and I were delighted to participate in the bid's presentation to the IOC, and were gratified that the government was able to indicate its material support for the bid. It is a tribute to the breadth of support for the games among the Australian communitydemonstrated so memorably by the tens of thousands of people who showed their enthusiasm in Sydney on Friday morning. In a wider sense, the IOC's decision is also a tribute to the society we have created hereits social equity, cultural diversity and tolerance, and its sophistication and efficiency. Sydney's approach was set apart from others by its technical excellence and by its commitment to the athletes themselves and to the ideals of the Olympic movement.· All the people involved in the bid deserve the warmest congratulations and thanks of this House. More than that, they deserve the continuing support of all Australians-government, business and the community-in the seven years of hard work that still lie ahead of us. I can say on behalf of the Commonwealth Government that they will have that support. I began by saying that my visit to the United· States and Europe took place at a time of great consequence for the world economy - a time when new patterns are being created, and when great decisions are being formed. Within the next 12 weeks alone we will have the first meeting of the leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Community, we shall enjoy success or suffer failure in the Uruguay inRound, and we will have, by the year's end, a surer sense of whether recovery can take hold in Europe and Japan, and strengthen in the United States. It is a decisive time in world economic affairs and it comes as Australia is achieving greater international recognition. Sydney's Olympic win reflects this most dramatically, but it is also reflected in Mr Clinton's generous praise of Australia's role in forging APEC, and in the respect accorded to Australia's views in the Uruguay Round as the leader of the Cairns group of fair agriculture traders. There is a responsibility on all of us to recognise that we are in a bigger game-a game with bigger prizes but with new and tougher rules. The world is offering us great opportunities, but to take advantage of them we must continue to be flexible and competitive at home. We must continue to seek national cohesion and strength. We cannot seize the opportunities the world offers us if we cannot agree on the fundamental instrument of national economic policy, the budget. We cannot seize those opportunities if we cannot reach a satisfactory and enduring agreement on the implementation of the High Court's decision to recognise a form of Aboriginal title and we cannot seize those opportunities if our workplace relations are not free to evolve towards outcomes based on bargaining. To seize those opportunities we need to renew our commitment to change and our commitment to the reforms necessary to meet the imperatives of the new global order. It will help us in this regard if we recognise the success of the changes we have already made; how well we are doing in the world, how much more competitive we have made ourselves, how much the chances which now present themselves are only chances because of the changes we have made and how we have made them while also making Australia a tolerant, sophisti<;:ated and progressive society with few equals in the world-and how much better we can make it if we put aside sectional interest and parochialism and work together as a nation. I present the following paper: . Prime Minister: Overseas Visit-Ministerial Statement, 28 September 1993. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceedof ing 30 minutes.",21
89,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Any visit by an Australian Prime Minister to the United States and to Europe is an important event. We on this side of the House welcome the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has met with President Clinton and senior members of the American administration. We also welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has met with the Prime Ministers of Britain and Ireland and with Her Majesty the Queen. No doubt, as the Prime Minister has indicated in his statement to the House today, a wide range of bilateral and international issues were addressed in these meetings. We on this side of the House share a bipartisan view on many of the issues that were raised, particularly the French intransigence on the Uruguay Round and the future possibilities for APEC. But as with whatever the Prime Minister does, he has claimed too much in relation to these international meetings. The time has come· to put some' perspective and some realism into what the Prime Minister and others are claiming about the so-called success of the Prime Minister's overseas trip. It is time to see some delusions of grandeur for what they are; it is time to take off the rosetinted glasses; it is time to cut through the journalistic hype; and it is time to examine exactly how Australia's national interests were advanced by.the Prime Minister's trip. The fact is this overseas visit by the Prime Minister was marked by some serious errors of judgment. First, there was some deliberate overselling of the significance of particular meetings and so-called guarantees given to the Prime Minister on particular issues. Second, there was a lack of clear strategic purpose about the objectives of many of the Prime Minister's discussions. Third, there was quite unjustified presumptuousness on the part of the Prime Minister in relation to the issue of an Australian republic. Finally, there was a preference to score cheap political points on the issue of European trade policies rather than to confront the issues directly with the European leaders involved. I will take this opportunity to address each these points in further detail in relation to the countries that the Prime Minister visited during his recent trip. Let me begin with his visit to the United States. The Prime Minister's visit to the United States provided him with an important opportunity to exchange views on key international issues-such as the future of the Uruguay Round, the prospects for APEC, the chall.enges facing UN peacekeeping and many more. No doubt some valuable exchanges of view took place and we on this side of the House certainly do not seek to diminish them. Furthennore, it is important that the Australian Prime Minister and the American President meet, and we appreciate the welcome that the American administration extended to our Prime Minister. But the visit was flawed by a number of factors. It began with a significant misjudgment. The Prime Minister's decision to decline to attend the historic signing of the peace agreement between the PLO and Israel was simply inexplicable. This dramatic development in the Middle East peace process is fundamentally important for international peace and security. It is also very important in tenns of Australia's interests. The Prime Minister's advisers were apparently deeply divided over whether or not he should attend. In the end, the Prime Minister decided not to do so for reasons that are quite inadequate. He claimed that he wanted to have talks with the US trade representative and the Treasury secretary; but these talks could surely have been rescheduled, just as most of the Prime Minister's other appointments in Washington were rescheduled. The Prime Minister said he did not attend the ceremony because Australia had not been directly involved in the peace process; but that did not stop hundreds of highly influential members of the American, Arab and Israeli communities from attending. Whatever the reason, the Prime Minister decided to tum his back on a truly historic occasion in which Australia had an important interest and which was attended by a very influential group of international leaders. It was a fundamental misjudgment· on the part of the Prime Minister. One particular feature of the Prime Minister's visit to Washington was its lack of any clear strategic purpose. Let me give the House three clear examples of how the Prime Minister's objectives waxed and waned as every day passed. First, the Prime Minister made it clear at the outset of his visit. that he inclination to take up with President Clinton particular policy issues, such as the export enhancement program and its effect on Australia. He said that he preferred discussions what he called 'big mainframe issues', such as GATT. He made it clear that taking up the concern of Australian fanners was a matter for others to do with their US counterparts and not for him to do with President Clinton.",26
90,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I did. That is wrong.,27
91,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am getting to exactly what the Prime Minister did; he backflipped. The response by the opposition and other critics in Australia to this statement of intent by the Prime Minister was swift in its condemnation. No-one could understand why an Australian Prime Minister could not do both; that is, to address the big issues of international trade and to put Australia's case directlyon the damage being inflicted on Australian fanners by American agricultural policy. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) rightly commented that the Prime Minister had given up before he had even started. Others simply could not understand how or why an Australian Prime Minister could choose not to raise the major irritant in Australia's bilateral relationship directly with the American J;>resident. What was the Prime Minister's response to all this criticism back here at home? It was, of course, his usual backflip. Under pressure, the agricultural subsidy issue was raised in discussions between the Prime Minister and President Clinton. We welcome that fact, but we regret that it occurred only after the Prime Minister's original intention to bypass the issue had been so vigorously and publicly criticised here in Australia. A second example of the lack of strategic purpose in the Prime Minister's visit can be found in his inept and ill-considered advice to the US administration to adopt a softer approach on the issue of human rights in Asia; The Prime Minister was apparently convinced that a hardening of the American position on human rights issues in China and Indonesia could jeopardise the future of the APEC process. The immediate response in Australia had no was criticism-from the opposition, the president of the ALP, various other members of the Labor Party, Amnesty International and other human rights groups and various editorion as in Australian newspapers. What was the Prime Minister's response? The usual backflip, together with an insistence that everyone else had again misunderstood him. The fact is that there was no misunderstanding. The Prime Minister had simply backflipped yet again in an attempt to cover his own tracks. Only 24 hours after he had had his spokesman briefing the media, to the effect that he had told senior administration figures that human rights should not be allowed to spoil trade negotiations, the Prime Minister was insisting that US foreign policy was in fact properly baIimced between concerns over human rights and the pursuit of commercial interests. The Prime Minister's intervention was inept and ill advised for many J:'easons. He showed absolutely no understanding of the subtle strategy of carrot and stick needed to encourage international. respect for basic standards of human rights. He showed no understanding of the well-established American political tra.dition in support of human rights and, in particular, of the commitment to human rights and to democracy that is fundamental to the Clinton administration's vision of a new Pacific community. The Prime Minister showed no understanding that political flexibility and economic growth are not mutually exclusive and that the defence of internationally accepted standardsof human rights can be pursued at the same time as a dynamic commercial relationship. The Prime Minister simply failed to understand that pandering after popularity anywhere on this basis will win no lasting respect from anyone. Finally, the Prime Minister has failed to recognise that the record of Australian governments over the past 10 years on the issue of human rights has been both confused and inconsistent and provides absolutely no basis for lecturing countries such .as the United States. President Clinton put the American position very clearly. He made it quite clear that he could see nothing wrong with the way the United States had handled its human rights concerns. He said that the strong US position on human rights had not undermined its commercial and political relationships with countries that were making an honest effort to deal' with the United States. He conCluded: The United States does have a very strong position on human rights and I think we should. By now the Prime Minister was looking faintly ridiculous on the issue of human rights, and even he must have been regretting his decision to give the United States some coaching 9n this whole matter. The interventionof the Prime Minister into this complex area of foreign policy was not clearly thought through. It exposed its shallow and selfserving quality and it forced the Prime Minister to back off and to go quiet on what had been an unfortunate and damaging series ' of comments. A third example of the Prime Minister's lack of strategic purpose on his overseas trip lay in the views he expressed on the North American free trade agreement-NAFTA. Just over a year ago, when it suited his domestic political purposes to do so, the Prime Minister was happy to go around the country deriding and condemning NAFTA. Honourable members will recall that when the Prime Minister went to Japan, for example, he made a deliberate point of setting up a phoney choice between Australian trade with the United States and Australian trade with Japan. He set up another phoney choice between NAFTA and APEC. None of these phoney choices derived from realities about international trade; it was just the Prime Minister playing out his own domestic political game on the international stage. It should come as no surprise to anyone, therefore, that it now suits the Prime Minister to take an entirely different approach to the issue of NAFTA. Overcome by his environment in Washington where three former Presidents, as well as President Clinton, were pushing for congressional approval of NAFTA, the Prime Minister's new position is that NAFTA is the key to saving the US from protectionism. He now says NAFTA and APEC are consistent and mutually supportive. This flip-flop is represented by the Prime Minister as some kind of dramatic new trade strategy for Australia in a world where the Uruguay Round is under threat. The fact is that there is absolutely nothing new in anything that the Prime Minister has suddenly discovered about international trade. We on this side of the House have been telling the government for years that it has been putting excessive faith in multilateral solutions to international trade problems that confront Australia. We have been telling it that bilateral and regional issues were ignored for too long, and we have been telling it that NAFfA offered opportunities for Australia and not the massive dangers with which the Prime Minister tried to scare Australians in the course of last year. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister has now changed his view of NAFfA and that his political stunt in Japan last year has now been exposed for exactly what it was. I am also pleased that his views about NAFfA are now much more in accord with what we have been saying about it in the last year. The real danger in what the Prime Minister was saying in Washington about international trade is· that he is now trying to set up a new kind of saviour. He is trying to make regional trade initiatives like APEC into some kind of panacea for all of Australia's economic problems. The fact is that APEC alone will not solve our economic problems. Our economic problems demand that we take the necessary decisions to put our own economic house in order, and only then will we be in a position to take advantage of the trade opportunities that might be presented by APEC. Furthermore, the Prime Minister speaks of APEC as though there is general agreement in the region about what it should be and how it should be advanced. The fact is that there is no such consensus in either the United States or the wider Asia-Pacific region. I have recently had discussions about the future of APEC with the new Japanese government and with Thai political leaders. The common theme of their comments was that Asian views of the role of APEC are very divergent: some see it as a vehicle for regional trade liberalisation; some see it as a means for keeping America involved in the region; some see it as a threat to ASEAN's interests; and others see it as little more than a forum in which to exchange views and are opposed to quantitative trade liberalisation objectives. there is a need to view anything that the Prime Minister has to say about APEC through a prism of realism. APEC, of course, is important. It is important that it becomes a means of genuine regional trade liberalisation, but it is not a panacea for Australia's economic problems and it is quite uncertain as to how it will proceed, given the significant differences of view that exist in the region at present. The major selling point which the Prime Minister has used in relation to his American visit has been his so-called special personal relationship that he claims to have established with President Clinton. Let me be very clear that we on our side of this House believe that it is very important for an American President and an Australian Prime Minister to have a good working and personal relationship. This has existed for many years. Most Australian Prime Ministers from the time of John Curtin on have enjoyed a special rapport with their American counterparts, and if an outcome of the Prime Minister's recent visit is that this kind of rapport is to continue then of course we welcome it. But, as with APEC, a dose of realism is needed when we look at what the Prime Minister has to say about the personal relationship he now claims with the President. First, there is only so much that any personal relationship between Australian and American leaders can achieve. The Congress has its own capacity for action in the United States, particularly in relation to issues like agricultural subsidies. Bob Hawke had a special personal relationship with George Bush, but that did not stop the export enhancement program from inflicting significant damage on Australian farmers. Second, it is important not to misrepresent what are the normal courtesies and politeness of American political life, and not to read special meaning into them for partisan political purposes. Quite frankly, it becomes somewhat absurd when the Prime Minister's office starts reading special significance into the strength of handshakes or looks in the eye. Third, despite the obvious goodwill of President Clinton, it is not the first time that an Australian Prime Minister has received So such an assurance from an American President to do all that he could to ensure that Australian trading interests were not harmed by American policies. This is not the dramatic kind of breakthrough the Prime Minister is claiming, nor is it significantly different similar assurances given to previous Prime Ministers by previous American Presidents. But the Prime Minister has decided to elevate it into something that it is not on the back of what he claims to be a special personal relationship. , The comments of President Clinton, into which the Prime Minister is reading so much, were to the effect that the United States will do all that it can to avoid using EEP, the export enhancement program, in ways that will damage Australia's trade interests. But it is quite unclear how EEP in any form will not harm Australian farmers. Even if American assurances not to extend EEP further into Australia's traditional markets are in fact honoured to the letter, the depressing effect EEP on commodity prices will still impact directly oli Australian farmers. We on this side of the House appreciate President Clinton's expression of goodwill, but we are dubious about the Prime Minister's overselling of it and we will hold the Prime Minister to account for the gloss that he has put on it. Finally, in relation to the Prime Minister's American visit, may I just note the unfortunate precedent that he has set in relation to comments on domestic political issues in Australia. Bob Hawke took a principled stand on this issue: he simply refused to comment. The current Prime Minister takes a different approach-what I would describe as a coward's approach. He comments on domestic political issues when he thinks he can score a point, but he hides behind convention in refusing to comment when he is in trouble. In a question and answer session following his Asia Society speech in New York, the Prime Minister chose to deliberately misrepresent the opposition's policy and strategy in response to his government's disastrous budget. This was a totally inappropriate action from an Australian Prime Minister while overseas. By the way, what he said was totally wrong. I was travelling in Japan and Thailand at the time that the Prime Minister was in America. I had the opportunity to criticise the government for its failed budget and its general incompetence over recent months but from I refused to do so because of established conventions. The Prime Minister should adopt the same approach or else he will be inviting us to play by his new rules, which will be to the detriment of Australia's international interests. From the United States, the Prime Minister went to Britain where he met the Prime Minister and the Queen. When in Britain, the Prime Minister made two totally indefensible assertions on the republican issue. Firstly, he asserted that the Australian people wanted a republic. In a speech at Australia House the Prime Minister said: It is not because the machinery is broken that we wish to change it. It is because a great many Australians-in all likelihood, a majority of Ausof tralians-believe the machinery is no longer most appropriate. The fact is that there is simply no evidence for that assertion· because there is no community consensus on any alternative to current constitutional arrangements. Secondly, the Prime Minister reported that he had told the Queen that he would make Australia a republic by the year 2001 even though he has not told anyone in Australia what kind of republic and what kind of constitutional changes he wants to make. This is presumptuousness of an arrogant and dangerous kind. We have made it clear for many months that, if the Prime Minister wants to change the Australian constitution that has worked extraordinarily well, he must argue a case for change and he has so far totally failed to do so. He presumes that the only debate is over the kind of republican change that is needed, whereas the real debate that he should be focusing on is whether Australians want any republican change at all-and that is far from clear. The Prime Minister was totally wrong to present the republican issue to the Queen in the way he did because his whole presentation was built on a phoney assumption about what the Australian people will ultimately. decide. He was also totally wrong to claim, as he did in his statement here in the House today, that as a result of his discussions in Britain it had become clear that Her Majesty and the British government regarded Australia's constitutional arrangements as matters to be decided by the Australian people. That fact has nothing to do with the Prime Minister's visit. It is a constitutional reality that Her Majesty and the British government properly pointed to. That is all it is. In Ireland, the Prime Minister had an opportunity to make European agricultural subsidies, which are strongly supported by the Irish government, the focus of his visit. But instead, he preferred sentimentality, personal indulgence and a good deal of rewriting of Australian history as the focus of his Irish visit. The Prime Minister told the Irish parliament about the virtues of republicanism for Australia. He said: . . . a republic might acknowledge values of a people who have been willing to imagine something better, willing to confront the need to change, to make their way on a new frontier ... But what the Prime Minister has to tell Austra,lians is how a republic will give them something better. He has to tell them how it will be. a brave new frontier. The Prime Minister has done none of these things because he knows that such rhetoric is absolute tripe. It has got no basis of support in the Australian community and to try to convince the Irish parliament or anyone else that it does is totally wrong. The Prime Minister went even further on Irish television by saying that he was a republican because he was a Catholic. This stirring of the old sectarian fires that went out long ago in Australia was totally uncalled for and totally ridiculous, but then again this Prime Minister is the most divisive Prime Minister we have ever had in our history, and sees political advantage in community division. The Prime Minister's visit to VillersBrettoneux was obviously a very emotional experience, as it is to every Australian who visits the region. Two days before, I had visited the area of the Western Front battlefields, met with the local mayors and laid a wreath at the Villers-Brettoneux Memorial.",27
92,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,You are always following me around; why don - t you do your own itinerary?,31
93,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I was two days ahead of the Prime Minister. It ranks with my visit to Gallipoli for the 75th anniversary as one of the most moving experiences of my life. Those rows of crosses marking the graves of Australians are a reminder of extraordinary Australian sacrifice and extraordinary Australian valour. I have to say, however, that I was very disappointed that the Prime Minister chose such an occasion to link the sacrifices of Australians 75 years ago with current French agricultural policies. In my view, a visit to the Western Front battlefields is a time for reflection, for gratitude and for remembrance. Making a visit to Villers-Brettoneux or other memorials in the region the occasion for trying to score a political point demeaned the and enshrine the occasion . All of us are opposed to French agricultural policies but, if the Prime Minister felt so strongly about the issue, he should have gone to Paris and confronted President Mitterrand on the issue directly. Attacking a local French politician at Villers-Brettoneux was a very poor substitute. As yesterday's editorial in the West Australian put it, the Prime Minister 'undervalues the lives of young Australians if he believes they can be used as a bargaining chip'. The Prime Minister ought to listen to that. He undervalues the lives of young Australians if he thinks that they can be used as a bargaining chip. The final leg of the Prime Minister's overseas visit was to join the Australian Olympic delegation, as I did, to support the Sydney bid for the 2000 Olympics. The outcome of the bid is· now well known and a matter of pride to all Australians. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all those in New South Wales, led by Premier John Fahey, and all those around Australia who worked so hard to make the Sydney bid a success. The buildup and result in Monaco were a memorable experience and a great result for Sydney, for our nation and for all Australians. The success in Monaco was due to the highly successful nature of the bid and to the obvious community support-including, importantly, bipartisan political supportwhich it enjoyed throughout Australia. It provides a great opportunity for Australians to start believing in themselves again. It shows how we really can take on the best in the world and win. But I have to say that the Prime Minister was unfortunately quick to inject a sour note of political opportunism. Within hours of the result, he was talking about its implications for Australian 'independence', that wonderful word, which is his phoney code for republicanism. On the Prime Minister's return to Australia, as soon as he got off the plane, he dashed off to a television interview to tell Australians how he would use the Olympic decision to accelerate his republican ambitions. The Prime Minister is playing a very dangerous game by linking politics with sport. Australians love their sport, but they do not like politics intruding into sport. The Prime Minister's ham-fisted attempt to politicise Sydney's Olympic success is totally inappropriate and totally unacceptable. It is nothing more than divisive. We saw part of his hidden agenda revealed in this parliament when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) stood up and said that the Olympics ought to be used to change the flag by 1996. Is that the Prime Minister's policy? Is it his policy to change the flag by 1996 and to use the Olympics for that purpose? We on this side of the House know that Sydney, and Australia, will stage a magnificent Olympics, and we look forward to a bipartisan political approach in support of that goal. But, above all, we hope that Australians can enjoy these Olympic games free from the Prime Minister's hang-ups and obsessions. The sooner he forgets trying to use the Olympics to push his own republican barrow, the better it will be for all Australians. The Prime Minister said that Australia would not make the most of its opportunities in the world and of the opportunity to host the Olympic games if Australians did not sign on to his republican agenda, pass his budget, agree to his Mabo solution or toe his line on industrial relations. This is a totally ridiculous argument. Australia will not realise its great potential in the world until he shows some leadership and some government in Australia; until his government is prepared to act in the national interest-to put our economic house in order, to reduce our record unemployment and record foreign debt, to make our export industries internationally competitive, to restore incentive, dynamism and genuine fairness in our society, and to focus on the creation of Australian wealth rather than the distribution of what is now a shrinking wealth. Only when we have a government that is generally committed to these objectives will Australia assume its rightful place in the region and in the world. Debate (on motion by Mr Howe) adjourned. NA",31
94,Mr BEAZLEY,HOUSE MONITORING SERVICE,"I move: That the House authorises the extension of the provision of the House monitoring service television coverage of proceedings of the House and its committees to government departments and others, as may be determined by the Speaker, on such terms and conditions as stipulated by the S'peaker.

99,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I move: That standing order 48A, Adjournment of the House, and standing order 103, 11 o'clock rule, be suspended for all sittings up to and including Thursday, 28 October 1993. Reference Honourable members will see from the Notice Paper that a very substantial number of bills are to be introduced into this House over the next couple of days. By the end of this week, some 60 bills will have to be debated before we reach the opposition's imposed deadline of 28 October. As we are trying to put through about 60 bills in a few sitting weeks, we will have to work longer hours and also operate under the guillotine. This proposition is a continuation of the things which have had to be done in this place since the opposition in the Senate-for reasons that we on this side of the House find unfathomabledetermined that, unless we introduced legislatidn by the end of this week and unless we passed it out of this place by the end of next month, the Senate would not consider itself in a position, unless given a very good reason, to consider further legislation during this year. This proposition on the opposition's part imposes burdens on two groups of people. It imposes a very substantial burden on members of the opposition in this place, because it obliges the government to massively speed up its legislation and to ensure that the House concentrates on no other matters. The second group of people that it massively imposes a burden on is the parliamentary draftsmen. In circumstances of limited time, mistakes will always be made in drafting--ven with the best will in the world. Drafting is a complex exercise and, even with stacks of time, mistakes will be made. In circumstances where time is short, mistakes will be made in greater profusion. This does not impose any burden at all on the government of the day. It means, as far as we are concerned, that this House operates like clockwork. We have a perfect excuse to consider allowing no censure motions or matters of public importance. We are left in a situation where this House becomes a quiet, broad green meadow on which we may safely graze. It is an act of utter political stupidity for an opposition to put this set of propositions in place. Having put it in place, there are consequences which the government has to impose. Some of those consequences will be seen as we guillotine some legislation, and more will be guillotined subsequently. Some of it can be seen now because, in order to give any decent consideration to this legislation, the parliament will have to suspend the 11 o'clock rule and we will have to sit later at night.",33
100,Mr HQWARD,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Briefly, in response to the Leader of the. House (Mr Beazley), the opposition does not agree with the government's motion. It is total humbug for the Leader of the House to say that he is suspending the 11 o'clock rule because of the Senate motion concerning the deadline for the introduction of legislation. He speaks as though he has perfectly clean hands. He knows that in the past he has suspended the 11 0' clo.ck rule whenever his parliamentary program has got into a mess. I will have more to say about the motives of this government and the handling of the affairs of the House when we inevitably debate the next motion about the guillotining of the tax bills. ·i will Gallus, C.

NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",34
101,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I move: TIult, in relation to the proceedings on the following Bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the' House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect.of all the Bills: Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993; Taxation (Deficit Redu'?tion) Bill (No.2) 1993; Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3) 1993; Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993; . Sales Tax (Excise) (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993; Sales Tax (In Sit- Pools) (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993; Sal- Tax (Oeneral) (Deficit' Reduction) Bill 1993; and Sales Tax Assessment Amendment (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This motion brings forward eight taxation bills that. have been considered before in this House at some length and passed through this House. So the requirement to give them the detailed attention that initially applied when they were in their original legislative form no longer applies. Therefore, the House can safely adopt this guillotine. Mr Rocher-You guillotined this the first time",35
102,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The propositions for a quick passage are made necessary by a couple of facts-not just the fact that it has been considered here before. Any delay in these bills getting to the Senate for their due consideration by the Senate places at risk their passage through the Senate and, ultimately, the benefits that will be delivered to the Australian taxpayers as a result. If these taxation measures are not effectively adopted by about 21 October, it will not be possible for the PAYE taxation deductions to take place on schedule. There has to be a delay of some three weeks following the passage of the bills for that to occur. New tax instalment schedules must be printed, the tax instalment schedules must then be distributed to employers, and employers will require time to modify their payroll systems. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) Orders has received advice from the taxation commissioner that a minimum of three weeks is required for the process. One week is required for printing and distribution of the new schedules to employers, and a further two weeks is required for employers to put in place their modified ,payroll systems. The very considerable savings that will be made by the average taxpayer as a result of the passage of the biIIs will, if the tax cuts are paid by 15 November, provide a massive fiscal dividend to middle income Australia. It . will put some $1.5 billion in their hands. At least $300 million of that is due before Christmas. Some people receive their January holiday pay before Christmas. If the opposition delays the passage of these bills and prevents workers getting their tax cuts before Christmas, that will be $300 million less in people's pockets for their Christmas shopping. These tax cuts are aimed right at the position of middle. income Australia-ordinary working Australians who, over the years, have basically carried the burden of the taxatiQn system in this country. If these bills were not carried, in the 7 112 months from November a stenographer or secretary .on $520 per week would lose about $160; a school teacher on $690 per week would lose $378; and a nurse on $710 per week would lose $455. Theseare important and significant tax cuts for middle income Australia. The opposition threatens these tax cuts in many different ways, and it will pay a price with those taxpayers when that is properly recognised. The proposition here means that these bills will be available for the Senate after about 9.30 or 10 o'clock tonight, if honourable members take a look at the timing arrangements. Again, the necessity forguillo-' tining this legislation does not just arise from the circumstances that I alluded to concerning the activities of the taxation commissioner, it is also a product of the way in which the affairs of this House must be conducted between now and 28 October. This guillotine, and the others that will be subsequently moved over the next few weeks, is a direct outcome of that situation. As I mentioned at the outset, this House has had an opportunity to debate all these measures at some length. The requirement now is to get these bills into the other place, and get them out of there as quickly as possible. Honourable members will do the taxpayers of this country a very considerable favour by passing them out of this place as quickly as possible.",35
103,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The opposition oppo-es the motion that has been put forward by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and it does sq for a number of very substantial reasons. The parliament faces a legislative log jam. The Leader of the House is beginning to bemoan the pre""Christmas fate of workers, but their particular situation direct product of the budget and the politic\ll and financia.l mishandling of the present goverrunent. The argument involves a very simple proposition, and it is very important that House and the Australian public understand it. Six months ago this country had a federal election. On one side, the coalition went to the Australian public. We laid out for people· to· see what we would do if we were elected. We said what we would do in relation to the tax system. We said what we would do in relation to the expenditure side of the budget. In particular, we proposed the introduction of a broad based indirect tax-a goods and services tax. We were honest enough to say that, if we want to cut personal income tax by several billion dollars, we have got to get money from somewhere. By contrast, during that election campaign the government said to people, 'You can have the goodies without any of the pain'. I am very interested that the Leader of the House is talking about Christmas, because what the Labor Party did in the la-t election campaign was equivalent to saying, 'You can spend up big at Christmas and buy all the presents you want to buy without getting the Bankcard bill in January or February'. The government said, . 'You can have your personal tax cuts. We will not have to put up your indirect tax. We will not have to cut your expenditure. We will not have to do any of those things'. We knew then-as we know now-that that was a lie; it was wrong and it was deceptive. Of course it was!. Now the government is to facing reality. Having been re-elected on the basis of that deception, it now faces this enormous problem of trying to explain to the Australian people-and to those who are articulating their interest, namely the opposition, the Australian Democrats and others in the Senate. The government should not run away with theinsane delusion that what the opposition is doing in the Senat-. is not popular with the .Australian people. Every measure that has been taken so far-some as recently as a few days ago-suggests that over 70 per cent of the Australian· people want the Senate to take action to change the is a budget. An enormous number of people who voted for the government only six months ago must be included in that 70 per cent. The reaSon people want the budget changed is that they resent like crazy the fact that they were this misled and deceived' only six months ago. That is why over 70 per cent of them are cheering and applauding the opposition in tile Senate for blocking certain measures in this budget. Do not let there be any doubt about that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) can carry on as much as they like, but the Australian public support our stand in opposing the tax increases that they were not told about six months ago. That is· the issue that is involved in this whole debate. It has nothing to do with Senate the obstruction. It has nothing to do with the . resolution that was brought down about the timing of the introduction of bills. It has everything to do with the fact that just six months ago we had an election: we told the truth and the people on the other side of the j House did not. The government did not tell the truth. It did riot tell the Australian people that income tax cannot be cut without getting the money from somewhere. Now the government is asking that the 'somewhere' be certain indirect tax increases. Because people do not like it, the government is in a jam, and the government is going to stay in a jam until it faces the reality that what it is trying to is perpetuate an enormous fraud on the Australian people. What is the response of this unbelievably arrogant and divisive Prime Minister? His response is to try to say that the opposition is breaking the conventions of this parliament. We had the Prime Minister carrying on today about the breaking of conventions. He said that it was the convention of this parliament that the sorts of bills that are now being voted against in the Senate by the opposition-and by others-are the sorts of bills that ought to be passed as a matter of convention by the Senate. That was not the view of the Prime Minister in April 1982 after his party had been victorious in a by-election at a time the former government was in power when he said it ought to use the numbers it then had in the Senate to try to throw out the government and bring on an early election. It was not the view that he and his then leader expressed back in 1981 when they voted against certain sales tax increases, variations and changes that were contained in the second last budget of the Fraser government. There was no convention then that the Senate should not block or vote against a taxation bill-no convention at all! It has long been the view of the Australian Labor Party, until today, that no such convention in relation to the behaviour of the Senate concerning money bills has ever existed. I want to read some comments that were made by one of the great icons of the Australian Labor Party-a status, I must say, that I always found very difficult to understand but I will not dwell on that-the late Senator Lionel Murphy, who was a Labor Attorney General and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate prior to the election of the Whitlam government. We are dealing with a budget. We are not dealing with supply or appropriation bills. We are dealing fairly and squarely with taxation bills in a budget-nothing more and nothing less. On the behaviour of the Senate on taxation bills in a budget, the late Lionel Murphy said: do For what we conceive to be simple but adequate reasons, the Oppositionthat was the then Labor oppositionwill oppose these measures. In doing this the Opposition is pursuing a tradition which is well established, but in view of some doubt recently cast on it in this chamber, perhaps I should restate the position. The Senate is entitled and expected to exercise resolutely but with discretion its power to refuse its concurrence to any financial measure, including a tax Bill. They are not the words of the member for Bennelong or the words of the current Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson); they are the words of the late Senator Lionel Murphy, .a Labor Attorney-General, spoken more than 20 years ago when he was stating the attitude of the Labor Party towards the role and the power of the Senate. In that speech he was stating the obvious: the power of the Senate to do what the Senate is now doing is totally unambiguous. Any pathetic, mealy-mouthed attempt by the Prime Minister to suggest that the opposition is behaving in breach of convention is absolutely without foundation. Lionel Murphy went on to say: There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. Taking the words of the late senator, there is every reason for us to vote against these particular measures. The reason is that the Australian public were deceived into voting for the government because the government never told them it was going to jack up their sales tax. The government never told the public that it was going to try to knock off their accumulated holiday pay. The government never told the public that it was going to put up the wine tax. Worse still, the government told the public that none of those things were necessary. The government said that the public could have the tax cuts without any pain-they could have the Christmas presents without the January Bankcard bill. But, in relation to the opposition, the government said, 'If you vote for the Liberals, you might get the tax cuts but you will have to pay for them in one form or another '. We were honest; the government was not. And that is why it is in a jam. It has nothing to do with Senate obstruction. It has nothing to do with the breach of convention-there is no convention. If there is a convention, the convention is that the Senate has a right to use its constitutional power, and that is all we are doing- All of this humbug from the Leader of the House and all of this high-blown rhetoric from the Prime Minister at question time about conventions and all of these other things falls miserably to the ground. Returning to the late Lionel Murphy,he said: The Australian Labor Party has acted consistently in accordance with'the traditionthis is Lionel - urphy, not John Howardthat we will oppose in the Senate any tax or money Bill or other financial measure whenever necessary to carTy out our principles and policies. We are carrying out both a principle and a policy. Our principle is that a government ought to tell the truth at election time. I think that is a very sound principle, and it is a principle that will haunt the government until the next election. The government has another think coming if it thinks it can lightly throw off, laugh off, the fraud that it practised on the Australian people. Likewise, if it thinks a few empty, bellowing phrases from its fast fading leader will put out of the minds of the Australian people the fraud that the government perpetrated on them six months ago, it has another think coming. Over the last couple of months the government's leader has suffered a quantum fall I have not observed previously in the respect the Australian people hold for their leader. His disapproval rating a few weeks ago reached the levels of his predecessor's approval rating in 1984. I have never known a political leader to have a disapproval rating as high as 75 per cent. It is unprecedented. I will tell the House why that has happened. It has everything to do with the fact that the Australian people know they were lied to and conned by the government's leader and by all government members because they were implicated in it. That is why we have a problem now. It has nothing to do with the perversity of the opposition. It has everything to do with the perversity of the government, the dishonesty of the government. At question time, the Prime Minister tried to draw a parallel-this really took the cake, even for him-with his declaration before the election that if the opposition won the election he would not vote against the GST in the Senate. He said that it was the same as that which the opposition is now presented with. Of course it is not. The big difference is that we told the public about the GST. But the Prime Minister never told the public about the tax increas- that we are now voting against. The Prime Minister has tried to suggest that there is an analogy. There is no' analogy at all. The Prime Minister made that declaration as a political stratagem. He was entitled to take that stratagem, but he did at least state a sound principle. He said that, if a party goes to an election on the basis of a particular policy, comes clean with the electorate and gets elected on a mandate to introduce that policy, it has a right to have the policy voted through the parliament. I agreed with him then; he was absolutely right. For once it was an impeccable statement of principle by the Prime Minister. But the exact reverse has happened with the government. It went to the public saying the people could have personal tax cuts without having to pay for them-'You can have the presents without the Bankcard bill'-which is the exact opposite of what we were proposing. We came clean; the government did not. We were honest; the government was not. We took the Australian public into our confidence; the government did not. The government deserves'to be mistrusted by the Australian public. We may not have received the support of the Australian public, but I believe that over the longer haul we will win their respect because we were prepared to take them into our confidence. The Australian people do not like being deceived; they can spot a humbug a mile off. The esteem in which the government's leader is held has plummeted over the past few weeks, because the Australian public believe they have as a Prime Minister a humbug and a man who deceived his way into office. That is why the government has a mess on its hands; it has nothing to do with the behaviour of the opposition. That is why we will oppose this and that is why the government is now making an absolute mockery of the proceedings of this parliament.",36
104,Mr GEAR,URGENT LEGISLATION,"How wounded the opposition is when it comes here having lost the unlosable election and tries to rewrite history. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would have people believe that the government went around telling lies during the election campaign when in actual fact he knows that is not true. In September last year the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) stood right here and said that he would restore the balance of taxation to its more traditional levels. The opposition's political skills were not good enough to exploit a statement like that. The simple fact is that during the whole federal election campaign the GST was not only centre stage but the entire stage. What we were talking about was the silly sort of policy that it was going to try to inflict Australian people-with no consultation. There was not even consultation with the front-bench or the backbench. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in a party room meeting, dumped this great big monster on them and said, 'Go and sell it'.",39
105,Dr HEWSON,URGENT LEGISLATION,"You were there, were you?",39
106,Mr GEAR,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I was outside. I saw those opposite come out of the room with glazed eyes and glossy brochures about this wonderful GST that they were to sell. There would be a 15 per cent tax on everything that moved - and everything that did not. When the Australian people had a chance to pass judgment on whom they believed was telling the truth and who was putting up policies that they did not want, they passed that judgment. That is why those opposite are still sitting on that side. They are trying to rewrite history saying, 'We told the truth and the government lied'. No-one believes that, apart from the opposition backbench. Not many backbench members believe it either, because they are not here. The simple fact is, John, that you can say it-the. honourable member for Bennelong can say it-for as long and as loudly and wherever you want, but no-one believes you.",39
107,Mr SLIPPER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The Assistant Treasurer has been in the House for a long time and knows that one ought not to refer to other members other than with a description of their electorates. He referred to the Leader of the Opposition by his Christian name of John.",39
108,Mr SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,The point of order is upheld. The Assistant Treasurer responded immediately and did just that-he referred to the honourable member for Bennelong.,39
109,Mr GEAR,URGENT LEGISLATION,"-':Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was getting a little excited. People would think, from the way the opposition is going on, that we are the highest taxing country in the world, but we are the lowest taxing country in the OECD. The Treasurer was saying last year that the total percentage of tax revenue to GDP was slipping. We said we would bring it back to more traditional levels. That is being done in this budget. We told the on the truth. Those opposite did not expect us, during the last election campaign, to start talking about the sorts of measures that might be in this budget, did they? What measures would the Leader of the Opposition bring in? For every dollar we said we would take from outlays, those opposite were going to take five. But did they tell people where they would make the cuts? They fudged it. The reason we are having this debate today is that we have moved to suspend standing and sessional orders to declare bills urgent so that we can get them through the House of Representatives tonight. We have already debated these measures and we are going to make sure that they get into the Senate in time for them to be passed. We had a debate some time ago when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) moved a motion to denigrate the Senate's actions-actions advised by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). The Prime Minister pointed out that the Senate in the last session had spent only 48 per cent of its time debating bills. Having passed that motion that imposes discipline on the House of Representatives, the Senate sat for about three weeks with bills on the Notice Paper and did not pass one. If the Senate is going to act in this way it is only right and proper that the House of Representatives, having fully discussed these bills, should pass them tonight. That is what the motion before us proposes. Let me state four major promises that we made at the last election. The first was that we would lower the company tax rate from 39c to 33c in the dollar. That. was a major election promise-and we have kept it. As we speak, the company tax rate is 33 per cent. The opposition was going to put it up to 42 per cent. The second promise was that we would lower the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That is implicit in the measures contained in the budget proposals we are putting through this parliament tonight. The third measure on which, during the election campaign, we said we would deliver was personal tax cuts. Once again, that is contained in this budget. We are bringing forward the first round of tax cuts by about 7 112 months and pushing out the second lot of tax cuts probably until about 1998. Once again, the promise was kept. The fourth major promise that we made during the campaignand which we have kept-is not to introduce a GST. There is no way that anyone reading these budget proposals could say that anything we have proposed is at all like a GST. We know that when the people had the chance to pass judgment on a goods and services tax they said no. We have heard a lot of humbug from the honourable member for Bennelong, who is trying to rewrite history by saying we lied in the election campaign. I have heard him say it outside this place; but it is not true. We made and kept promises. In this year's budget we made sure that we pUQlished, with the budget papers, a list of commitments that we had made during the election campaign. The measures and times the measures would be funded and implemented were listed in that publication. So, far from running away from 'lies' told at election time, we have published every commitment we made. All those commitments have been kept. Let us talk about the Senate. The honourable member for Bennelong mentioned the words of a former senator, but I will talk about the words of a present senator. I refer to Cheryl Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats and a senator for Queensland. When she was asked today about the way the Senate was conducting itself in trying to hold up the government's budget, she said: But, I think there's a fine line when you would have to say the Senate's behaving responsibly or not and I think we're close to that. She is talking about the delaying tactics of the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia in the Senate. They are trying to make sure that they delay this budget. I cannot understand why they would want to do that, when the business community and other sectors of the community are looking for stability from government. What is their ambition? Are they trying to make sure that we do not get a budget passed this year? If they are, let them own up to it. It is all sour grapes from losing the last election. They are into revenge on the Australian people-making sure that people are punished by not letting the budget go through the House. We are trying to make sure that the conventions that have always been part of this House are upheld. Those conventions, in terms of the budget, are that, when announcements are made on budget night and measures are outlined, they take effect from budget night. It is customary to make sales tax increases effective from midnight on budget night in order to stop supply and demand bottlenecks and chaos in the marketplace. It has always been accepted here that when the Treasurer-of whichever government is in power-delivers the budget and tax changes are made, those changes take effect from budget night. We are seeing an opposition trying to destroy a government budget. We have not seen these sorts of actions since 1974 or 1975. A properly elected government with a proper budget, which has received endorsement from money markets here and overseas as a responsible budget, has the Liberals and Nationals in the Senate trying to destroy it. It is only those parties that ever use their numbers in the Senate in this way. The Prime Minister rightly pointed out at question time that he gave a commitment during the last election campaign that, should we become the opposition after that election, we would pass the money bills proposed by a Liberal government. But there has been no such commitment by, the destroyers on the other side. They are doing everything they can to stop the government from getting the budget through. It is not as if the tax increases are profound. The wine tax would be 50c on a $10 bottle of wine. The wholesale sales tax, when fully implemented, would put $7 on a $750 television set. But when we talk about tax, we do not think as often as we should about what those taxes do. I have been in parliament for about 10'12 years. I have never had anyone who receives social security benefits, or any organisation assisted by government, say to me, that the 'government is giving too much and that we should take some back.' In actual fact, what I get, is exactly the opposite. The simple fact is, that the calls for government in 1993 are that it becomes more involved in community activities by way of expenditure through the different programs that it has. Therefore, if the government were to fund all of the demands that are placed on it, taxes would have to rise because the only way that governments get their income is through taxes and exCise. So when we are talking about passing these budget bills, we are referring to funding social security benefits. We are talking about funding universities and schools. We are talking about funding the health system and all of those activities that government involves itself in quite properly. There is no country in the world that does more with less. There is no country in the world that, for such a low take of tax, provides benefits to its citizens. I we should think about those things when the Leader of the Opposition commands his senators in the other place to stop the government's budget, because it is only by passing these bills that the goveriunent can undertake the sorts of activities that the Australian population has a right to expect I have noticed that the opposition, since it has come back here, is absolutely stunned that it lost the unlosable election. But opposition members lost it all by themselves-they try to rewrite history by saying that the government lied at the election campaign when they know that that is patently false-when they put up their silly proposals. The Leader of the Opposition could not even understand how the GST would work. When he was asked simple questions on the John Laws Show and on television, he could not explain the GST. He should have a look at the simple fact which is: the rea!'ion the opposition lost the last election was that it did not have the right policies. It did not have policieS that appealed to people out there in Australia. That is why it lost the election; it was not because of anything this government did. As I said before, the government kept all of its election promises. It even published a book to make sure that everybody in Australia who took an interest in these things could look up the budget papers and find out where the commitment was given and where it was funded. In conclusion, the' government supports the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) for all of the proper reasons.",39
110,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (4.32 p.m.)One might wonder why the government has even bothered to introduce these particular guillotine measures when one looks at the speakers list. It has managed to find only one of its own side who is prepared to defend this legislation, and that person is the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott). There are nine speakers listed from the opposition, and I assure the House there would have been many more. It is not surprising that we heard at question time the published remarks of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) that he think was too embarrassed to go out and sell the' government's budget measures. It is not surprising that only one government member has nominated to participate in this debate. Of course, they all go bashing on the door of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and say, 'Listen, we want more time for this. It is clearly available', because the government has only about 33 bills on the Notice Paper anyway. Of course, the opposition has offered government members as much time as they need to debate those bills. We have said time and time again",41
111,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,There are only 33 bills?,41
112,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,That is all I can find on the Notice Paper. MrGear-How many do you want?,41
113,Mr TUCKEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"That is not that many bills, considering'the amount of time some of those will take.' But there are some other aspects that really and truly need some consideration. The first of those is to ask' ourselves why we are back here guillotining legislation that has already been guillotined through this place once. The simple answer is that this government tried to impose a trick on the parliament because it thought it would gain some juvenile political advantage by being able to strut around the place and say, 'It is that nasty coalition that has caused you to lose your tax cuts? Notwithstanding, as I will point out shortly, that people will not lose their tax cuts, whatever happens to all the bills that are subject to this guillotine. They will have them slightly deferred, yes, but they will not lose them. They will get about three times as much. The simple fact is that the government gives us some lessons about certain government advisers telling it that its juvenile proposal-which was done for the wrong reasons and just for a little bit of politicswas in fact constitutional. I remind the House that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), who no doubt dreamed this up, announced some time ago that he was going to do some legal training at Macquarie University. I do not know how far he got, but I can tell honourable members that if he got past the first meeting he should be able to understand what section 55 of the constitution says. I will read it to the House. It states: Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. The more important bit of that same section states: Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs or of excise, shall 'deal with subject of taxation only; . . . It goes o- to state: ... but laws imposing duties of customs shall deal with duties of customs only, and laws i-posing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only. How much legal training would one need to interpret the words 'shall deal with one subject of taxation only'? One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar. One does not have to be highly trained in the legal fraternity to understand what that means. Government members can go and slither this way and they can slither that way, but the simple fact is that the constitution requires that. There was no need-as there is no need now-to test those few words in the High Court at cost to the taxpayer. They are simple; they are understandable. Today, once again, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) set out to preach to us on conventions but they 'are also the conventions of this place and, as such, what difference would it have made? In the first place, had the government wanted to try the device that it is coming up with in this particular example in these bills, it could have said what was stated by the Assistant Treasurer (Mf Gear) in his second reading speech on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3) which deals with personal taxation. He stated: This bill will not come into operation until the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993, and the five sales tax bi\ls in this package receive the royal assent. That has put the parliament on notice. That gives government members their juvenile day in court where they can try, as they have so unsuccessfully tried so far, to lay the blame on the coalition for any removal of personal tax cuts. Of course, we have tested the community and, might I add, the Prime Minister was up there preaching to us today about the views of NFF President Graham Blight. I have received Mr Blight's correspondence. He wants the opposition to oppose the income tax cuts as well as everything else. The Prime Minister did not bother to inform the parliament about that. That is what Mr Blight is whingeing about. He says Australians should one not have personal tax cuts to lower the deficit, but he is as adamant that these particular indirect taxes-which the government uses to pay for those personal tax cuts-should not be imposed on his members because he knows the devastating effect that that will have on their costs. So all the government had to do in the first place to avoid the pain and suffering it has gone through,'and the waste of time which it complains about in bringing this legislation back in this form for another guillotine in this place, was abide by the conventions, abide by the constitution and bring in its bills in this fashion. I think it is also worth noting that, in the second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer when dealing with the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3), which has been guillotined, he also refers to a paragraph under the heading 'Personal.taxcuts', which states: The· amendments contained in the bill will change the timing for the commencement of the two-stage reduction in the tax rates announced One Nation on 26 February 1992. That completely destroys the argument that people are going to lose their tax cuts. The Assistant Treasurer says that this fundamental bill will not be brought into effect.· There must be ·thousands of taxpayers out there saying, 'Hear, hear!' - including Mr Blight in one way-because they do not want his new tax cuts. They want the old ones. They want the One Nation ones-the l-a-w ones. Because we will not support this bill in the areas that we have already indicated, the government is saying that it will deliver Australia's taxpayers three times the tax cuts. Taxpayers are not losing anything. They are waiting a little longer, but the dividends are huge. The government cannot get out of it. This is what we are on about. This is what the government is suggesting will happen in this bill. In its very juvenile fashion, the government primarily tried to fudge the issue by up this single bill. I wonder how much government members giggled as they came to this conclusion. They must have sat around and said, 'We'll get them'. The Prime Minister ran this argument day after day in the last sitting period, but he was laughed out of the room. He is not winning this time. People not silly; the press gallery are not silly. know that if the government does not get Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3) through it is stude with One Nation. The Assistant Treasurer was telling us about the promises of One Nation. Let us recall what they were. They were promises in black and white before the election; they were l-a-w. Those promises were massive tax cuts in two tranches funded by economic growthgrowth rates which were laughed at but which the Prime Minister stood behind, guaranteeing to the Australian people that he would deliver massive tax cuts at the election. He did not say that the tax cuts would be funded by the most debilitating form of taxation for Australia's economic growth through direct taxes on fuel and on other goods that flow into the economic chain, and on the cost of competitiveness. The Assistant Treasurer told us about the in other promises that the Prime Minister has made. I am reminded that he put out a letter saying that the GST would be a reduction in stake money when he knew that it would be an increase. These issues do not need to be guillotined and, more importantly, we should not be told that they will be linked together. The funniest thing of all is that the government is still threatening the opposition with this balloon full of helium. It is threatening the opposition, the Greens and the Australian Democrats that if they do not pass its measures the Australian people will get three times as big tax cuts. I think they might accept that threat. We will not pass the govemlnent's measures as they relate to the indirect tax system because they were not ever mentioned to the people. The government made it clear, at least by inference, that it opposed additional indirect taxes. All of its advertisements were against increased costs to the general combringing munity, yet they have occurred. Government members. tetl us how much money people will have at Christmas if this bill is passed. By Christmas they might be getting refunds from wholesalers for the wine tax that they have paid, because I can guaran, tee the minister that the Senate-the Greens are in particular-will not support the governThey ment's wine tax. There are very good reasons for that, including the high level of environmental and green philosophy that exists in the small wine growing areas, particularly in Western Australia. The government knows it and, of course; its constituents have made it very clear. Another major area of green constituency is to be found in kids getting into leaded motor cars in student car parks in all our universities. I have a funny feeling that they will make that very clear. What the government is saying' in this legislation will not happen. It will not get wine tax and 1 do not think it will get the others. Why make the personal tax cuts a condition when it knows that? It has got the message, and that is that. There are other aspects of this proposal before us. The Treasurer was moralising about all these issues yesterday. The Prime Minister added today that we should be the responsible opposition and help the government out of its troubles. We are the responsible opposition because we are putting forward a' simple principle'. That simple principle is that the government should keep its election promises. The fundamental policy of the Labor Party in the last election was One Nation-tax cuts through economic growth. We would be delighted if it could deliver on that, but it does not seem to know how. The big issue of the next three years will be the ability of this government and this Prime Minister to deliver on anything. We watched him today again laboriously going through his speech. We can allow him twice as long to deliver a written speech as most other leaders around the world that 1I have observed. He struggles wi,th the words and' to comprehend what he is reading-and he is supposed to be running the country! It is outrageous. He cannot take a written brieffrom his officials. They all Q-ve to come in and spell it out thim. He cannot administer or plan the country properly. He gets these fancy ideas which last about two minutes becaus- he cannot progrthem in his mind. It appears that he either denies those on his front bench who hav- that ability the opportunity to do so or he fails to consult them. Maybe they are as bad as he is. This is evidenced by what we see today. If he cannot run the parliament, he cannot run the country. For the Prime Minister to suggest that this is some sort of ambush and that the Senate has changed its rules means that he is just too arrogant. When Senator Chamarette brought this motion to the government's attention in May,having announced it in the Senate, the government just put it aside. It did not take any care. because it thought it could sweet-talk her out of it, as it has with the Democrats in its the past. Of course, Senator Chamarette understood her responsibilities and she put the case very clearly. While the Prime Minister was moralising today about what people should do and about the conventions, 1 was reminded that I saw him on television when he was in Ireland. He raised a real cheer and a laugh when he sllid to those people, 'I think I'm more popular here in Ireland than I am in Australia'. 1 can say to you, Mr 'Speaker, considering your concerns, that that is the only true thing he has said in a long time. That is absoltltely true. He has no popularity left in this place. The simple fact is that he has no popularity because he is not believed any more. The Prime' Minister is not believed any more because he went to the election with a very clear and positive solution for the people that he could fix all of the economic problems of Australia without raising taxes and could give personal tax cuts. He will give those tax cuts through one piece of legislation or the other, guillotined or not, and will not be allowed to impose those other taxes that will so damage our economy and so damage people in their normal living arrangements and cost of living. Those are the issues today. We do not need to put these bills through in a short period because they have no support from the government anyway. Government members do not want to support these bills. They know the bills are wrong and they feel that they have been let down. During the conference with the Treasurer one member of the goverrunent said, 'We trusted you, Mr Dawkins. We trusted you before the election, but you have let us down'. 1 did not hear anyboc:lY deny that when 1 raised it on the last occasion. (TIme expired)",42
114,Mr SHARP,URGENT LEGISLATION,"This completes the trifecta of a government in crisis. Just a few weeks ago the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), who is sitting opposite, introduced a, motion into the House to deny the opposition the opportunity to run the matter of public importance debate each day, traditionally the most important debate of the day which has been run every day for the nearly nine years that I have been in this parliament. However, that was not to be the case with this government. It could not stand a little heat in the kitchen and, as a result, knocked off the opposition's ability to run matter of public importance debate. At the same time, it moved a motion which denied the opposition the right to censure one of the ministers of the government .or the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or to suspend standing orders to have a debate about some issue of the day that was of concern to the opposition. Those two motions were moved in this House a few weeks ago. Those motions were bad enough for those who are interested in democracy and want to see the right of free speech practised in this parliament, yet today the Leader of the House came in and denied members of this parliament the opportunity to speak on controversial bills that are the subject of debate right across the land and the front-page stories dominating our news at the present time. The motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House is designed to stifle that debate, to deny members of both sides of the House the opportunity to raise their concerns, as is their democratic right. So we have haq three bills come into this place in the last few weeks, which would prove to any objective observer that this is a government in crisis, a government that is running away from the issues of the day. It is not prepared to face up to the reality of what it has created through.its own mismanagement and incompetence-and there is plenty of that. As the polls would indicate at the present time, the height of incompetence, the height of mismanagement, was the budget that was delivered on 17 August here in this House. That budget is the most unpopular budget the country has seen in recent memory. It is worth noting that it is that budget which has put so much pressure on the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and so much pressure on the government. It is also worth remembering that the former Treasurer of this land, the honourable member for Werdwa (Mr Kerin), was sacked by the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Hawke, for bringing down a bad and unpopular budget. Yet, according to all the surveys and polls that have been done, the budget that was the brought down by the current Treasurer is far more unpopular than the one brought down by the honourable member for Werriwa when he was Treasurer. ' If it was good enough for Bob Hawke to sack the honourable member for Werriwa for bringing down a budget that was considerably more popular than the one brought down here in this House on 17 August, then it is good enough for this Prime Minister to sack the Treasurer that we have today. Yet I do not think we will have the opportunity to debate that in this parliament when this government wants to guillotine debate on these bills that are coming forward. This government has a contempt for the are parliament. It is led by the Prime Minister who, it is commonly known by all in this House, has complete and utter contempt for the parliament. He was the person who came in here several years ago and said, 'The only reason we have a question time'-which people would say is the highlight of our democratic process-'is the good grace and generosity of the executive of the government'. In other words, he was saying, 'If I don't want to give you question time, you won't have it'. That type of arrogance is typical of this government, and it is that arrogance which has led us into having this guillotine debate today. It has also led us into having the debate on removing the opposition's right to have an MPI and to be able to move for the suspension of standing orders. This Prime Minister treats with scant regard our whole democratic process. He would be far better suited to operate in a one-party political system where he was the dictator and everybody was on his side, with no opposition. That is the type of person that we have running this country. Yet it is fascinating that, in the last few days since Sydney was successful in obtaining the Olympics for the year 2000, people have said that one of the great features about Australia is its vigorous and open democracy where people have their rights to freedom of association and freedom of speech. Yet here today in this House we have this government, which is still trying to ride in on the crest the wave of popularity created by Sydney's successful bid for the Olympics, doing away with one of the most central features of a parliamentary democracy; one of the things that make this country the great country that it is. We have a government that goes around saying that it acts in the interests of all Australians. If it does, why has it moved this guillotine motion, and why has it moved those other motions which deny the opposition the ability to debate important matters in this parliament on behalf of Australians? Whether the government likes it or not, a large number of Australians voted for us-40odd per cent of Australians voted for the Liberal and National parties. Those 40-odd per cent of Australians deserve the right to have their concerns expressed here in this parliament. This bill denies those 40-odd per cent of Australians their right to have their views expressed by members on this side of the House. If I were not a member of this parliament but understood what has been going on in this place over the last few weeks, I would be very concerned indeed.that my country, which is as great as it is because of its democratic process, is having that democratic process slowly eroded by the arrogance and mismanagement of the government that sits opposite us today. Of course, the government is running away from the debate. That is what this ,bill is all about, and that is what the previous motions were all about. The government is running away from the debate because of the problems it faces. The problems of the budget marks 1, 2 and 3 are fairly well known by most Australians. But the government has a number of crises on its hands-for example, industrial relations. The problems this government is having with its partner in government, the ACTU, and the trade union movement generally are now becoming a major concern. The Prime Minister is being asked to step into override the ineptitude of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) who has brought his government into a situation with the trade union movement that has not been seen in the of nearly 11 years thatthis government has been in power. For the first time we are now seeing a direct breakdown in relations between the ACTU and the government. This is one of the pillars that this government has built itself on over the last 10lh years. It is a crisis that is a major problem for the government,- a crisis that we will not have the opportunity to debate in the manner that we ought to. There are other matters of great concern, such as unemployment. About 11 per cent of Australians are unemployed. There are nearly one million Australians unemployed today. Surely they deserve to have their concerns expressed properly in this parliament; but, due to the sheer arrogance of this government, that is not to be so. Whether it is on that issue or issues facing rural Australians whom I represent, all of those people are not being given the right to have their views expressed. Whilst the government is saying, 'You still have question time and the normal few minutes we give you for debate on particular legislation to raise your concerns', it is worth pointing out that I have been a member of this House for nine years-as indeed have you, Mr SPEAKER - and we are 'now getting fewer questions being asked by the opposition than in my memory. When I first came here in December 1984 we used 'to get nine or 10 questions from the opposition every day during question time. Today, we had six and yesterday we had six. The fortnight before we had three and four a day. Once again this government is determined to cut off debate at a time when it is in crisis. When asked questions by the opposition, ministers do not answer them. When an honourable member asks a question about the weather, he will get an answer about the football. Instead of it taking a minute to give the answer, ministers take seven, eight or 10 minutes to make an attempt at an answer. Once again, question time has become a farce, as this whole parliamentary process is rapidly becoming a farce because this government is doing its best to filibuster, to waste time and to deny the opposition the right to speak about those things that are of concern. There are many things that concern Australians that should be raised in this parliament. The budget itself will hit ordinary Australians and poor Australians hardest of all. It is fascinating to note that, whilst this government claims to represent the Labor Party and the working men and women of Australia, as a result of the budget the cost of a $60,000 luxury car will come down by a couple of thousand dollars, yet the cost of a Holden Commodore will go up by a couple of hundred dollars. The cost of leaded fuel will ultimately go up by 7c a litre. Who are the people who drive leaded cars? Of course, it is the poorest people in our society who drive cars that use leaded fuel-students, pensioners, old people. All sorts of people who have low incomes do not have new cars, yet this government will hit those people the hardest. In the process the government is hitting rural people even harder. Rural people depend very much on the cost of fuel and the cost of transport in order to eke out a living in this country. The net result of this government's actions in the budget is to make the cost of transport considerably greater. As a result of increasing the cost of transport through putting up the tax on fuel and the sales tax on trucks, $3 will be added to the average cost of an average supermarket trolley of goods each week. That is the net result ·of whatthis government has done in the budget. It is no wonder that the government is doing its very best to cut off debate in this place. If Australians are concerned about their democratic process, as I know they are, if they are concerned to see good government in Australia, and if they are concerned to see governments which do things wrong brought to account, then they would say, 'Hear, hear', when the opposition says that it will oppose this motion moved by the Leader of the House, which is designed to cut off debate, because all Australians value very highly the right to have their views expressed through the democratic process. The government is denying us that right. Just like question time, MPls and motions to suspend standing orders to debate important issues, the motion before the House today deserves to be rejected by all Australians because, ultimately, we lose the things that are most precious to the people of Australiaour democratic right and freedom to express views in our parliamentary democracy. I, like other opposition members who have spoken before me, will be voting - gainst the motion on the basis that we believe that, if a government has got itself into a crisis, then that crisis ought to be debated, views put forward and the elements of that crisis put on the table fot everyone to see so that the people of Australia can at least be satisfied that their democratic process is working, even if the government is not working for their best interests. Like those on this side of the House, I strongly oppose this motion as I have opposed the other motions that knocked off MPls and knocked off our right to suspend standing orders, which ultimately goes to the heart of our democratic process: our right to speak in this parliament.",44
115,Mr SLIPPER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Any civilised society operates upon certain laws and rules which ought to be observed by people who participate in that society. This parliament, tltis House, also has rules: it has standing orders. Unfortunately, quite often those standing orders are breached. I think it is fairly tragic when, a mere six months after the 13 March election, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) marches into this place yet again to move a motion which will curtail debate. A total of 147 people were elected from the six states and territories of Australia and were sent to this place to· represent their constituents. At the election, the government set forth a policy which it has continued to breach from the time of the election to the present. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) had legal advice at his disposal to indicate that he was not able to deal with some of his budget measures in the way that he chose. Yet, despite that advice, the Treasurer ignored it. He brought an unconstitutional bill into this place and proceeded to heap abuse onto the shoulders of the lawyers who advised that the Treasurer's course of action was against the constitution.. We need proper debate in this place. As I said, 147 representatives of the Australian people have been sent to the Commonwealth House of Representatives. The government brings in legislation which breaches many of its campaign and other promises. It is only right and proper that the government can be held accountable in debate for its broken promises. Legislation in this parliament affects the rights and responsibilities of citizens. Surveys indicate that politicians in Australia have a very low image-probably as low as the approval rating of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We should do what we can to boost that image and restore faith in this institution. Unforturiately, over the 10 years of Labor rule the repute'in which people hold this parliament has become ever lower. I was motivated to speak because of the comments of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). He said that it was a convention that Treasurers stand up in the House and announce that taxes will go up as from midnight on the day that those tax increases are announced. For better or worse, that has been the practice in recent times. We have all had complaints from constituents who claim that taxes ought not to rise prior to legislation becoming law. The fact that the government is unable to guarantee passage in both houses gives credence to the concerns expressed by many constituents. The Treasurer stood at the dispatch box not long ago and announced tax hikes. In the circumstances it is inappropriate for those tax increases to take effect retrospectively from the date of the announcement as it was quite clear that the parliament was not going to support the government's proposals. Honourable members have only to look at the Australian constitution to be aware that there are three components in this place: the Crown-despite what the Prime Minister seeks to do to it-the House of Representatives and the Senate. If a government is unable to get its legislation through both houses, then clearly that legislation is not going to become law. It is highly immoral to implement tax increases when the government cannot guarantee passage of the legislation. The government's budget strategy is totally in tatters. It seeks to tax by stealth and deception. Is it any wonder that the Australian people, in ever increasing numbers, refuse to accept the promises and the actions of the government. The government is on the ropes. We have a Prime Minister who is an international embarrassment and who breaches every convention. when he goes abroad. He talks about domestic matters when overseas. He is a total disgrace. The government is in trouble over many issues. The papers report the difficulty that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is having with the unions who intend to ride roughshod over the rights, responsibilities and activities of ordinary Australians. The unions have cracked the whip and the Prime Minister is now involving himself in that debate to relieve the Minister for Industrial Relations from his predicament. The guillotine is constal1tly' preventing discussion on important matters. On Mabo the Prime Minister has raised the expectations of Aborigines to a level which is not able to be achieved. The Prime Minister's legislation is unacceptable to the Australian community; it is unacceptable to everyone. The republican agenda is embarrassing Australia. The Prime Minister is wrongly endeavouring to link the republican debate to the Sydney Olympics. As I have said, the budget is in tatters. All of this points to a government which is in dire trouble, a government which is endeavouring to run from the parliament, a government which is endeavouring to prevent debate. My colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who spoke before me, pointed out that this is not the first time that the government has stopped us from talking about the important issues of the day. As he said, this is the third element in the trifecta. At a time when a million Australians are out of work, I think it is tragic that the government is endeavouring to close down the parliament. .This parliament sits for a very short time each year. I think the Westminster parliament sits 170 days on average, yet up to August 1993 this House had sat for only about 10 days in eight months. When the Prime Minister said that question time existed as a courtesy from the executive, he indicated his total contempt for the conventions of parliament. We have subsequently seen his contempt for many other conventions. .. The Austra-Ian people are sick and tired of this government. This is the government of the true deceivers, who have conned the true believers. In my electorate of Fisher, as across the nation, we have many people. Who could be described as battlers. Unemployment is high and many people are hurt by the policies of this government. Every day I receive phone calls from people who say that they have voted Labor all their lives, but they are not voting Labor any more because this government is no longer a government of the people; this is no longer a government of the battler. In fact someone pointed out to me recently that Chifley and Curtin would tum in their graves if they saw the policies of this government and the impact of those policies on ordinary Australians. Mr. Evans-The light has, gone out.",47
116,Mr SLIPPER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"If the light was ever there it has certainly gone out. At the next election, whenever it is held, the government's term will be extinguished . .The parliament should sit more to enable greater opportunities for debate. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs suggested this in its recent report. The problem is that this government is riding roughshod over the rights of ordinary Australians by refusing to indicate respect for the institutions which they hold dear. This government has the worse record of any government since Federation for introducing the guillotine. Matters being guillotined are matters of great moment; matters affecting the rights and financial responsibilities of Australians; and matters which ought to be debated to their fullest extent. I ask the government to reconsider imposing the guillotine-it is not too late to change its mind. I realise, of course, that the Leader of the House does not always think up these manoeuvres. Indeed, unlike some of his colleagues, he probably likes to have proper debate. This government displays an absolute contempt for convention in refusing to allow proper debate. I ask at this very late stage that the Leader of the House reconsider his proposals and that he allow a proper and full debate on the matters before the House.",49
117,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"in reply-I do not want to delay the House for any length of time because we do not want to curtail further the debate which will occur on these matters as there are some pieces of legislation to be introduced before that can finally take place. There are one or two points that the opposition put forward that require an answer. In a couple of minutes I will answer them. First, the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) repeated this furphy that the Liberals go on with-that'the Australian public was lied to during the election campaign by virtue of the fact that small adjustments have been made to petrol taxes and sales taxes. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) made several facts amply clear,as did the Prime Minister (Mr Keatirig) several times after that. He said that, as far as the government was concerned, it would maintain the current levels of taxation; that we believed that, having achieved a position where we were the lowest taxed country in the OECO, we do not have to keep breaking our own record; and that we would sustain 'that position, but that' we would maintain levels of taxation which, as a percentage of GOP, have fallen from around 30 per cent when We came into office to around 231f2 per cent. At the time that he made that promise we were anticipating about 241/2 per cent of GOP. What the particular taxation measures do is to restore the figure to that level of taxation, which still leaves us the lowest taxed country in the OECO. The fact that the opposition was never able to exploit that politically is not the fault of this government. Nor is it the fault of this government that that statement was made and that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) did not then go out and thump the table and demand to know how the government of the day was going to keep that promise or keep to that particular mark. He did not ask what taxes the government was going to raise or what tax cuts it was not going to put through. The fact that those opposite did not, day, in, day out-like any halfway decent opposition-go through those propositions with us is not our fault. Mr Ronaldson-You did it all through the election campaign. . Mr BEAZLEY-That is the problem of the opposition. The fact is that the Australian public had the point stated to them. The fact that the opposition was unable to use that fact politically is too bad. - r Ronaldson-They were conned.",49
118,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"They were not conned. When the government of the day gets up and says that it will sustain the current level of taxation, and the taxation that is predicted in the out years. is actually falling, the public clearly knows that at any point, of time a government is going to adjust taxation levels irrespective of anything that is said during election campaigns. The opposition has got itself locked into that mad framework that it got locked into with the GST, saying that a government should layout in detail for the public every single jot and tittle of what it is going to do for the entire parliamentary term with taxation measures, expenditure measures and anything else and, if it deviates an inch from that-no matter what the consequences for the economy-it is somehow a liar and deceitful. Of course, that is a, political nonsense. The opposition is locked into that framework. It was not able to take advantage of the fact that the government turned itself broadside on as far as that particular proposition was concerned. The fact that the opposition could not exploit that is its fault. It is not entitled to punish the public by persisting with it. I want to raise another point in answer to what the Manager of.Opposition business said. I must say that, when he stands up on his high horse and denounces this side of the House in relation to whether or not we uphold election promises, he of course should recollect himself as the famous Treasurer in the fistful of dollars scam in the election campaigns of the late 1970s. Unfortunately for him, a few of us around here have a memory of that. Whether he thinks that that is an appropriate way or not, and whether those opposite think that what they laid out for the Australian public was every jot and tittle of what it was they proposed to do, the fact is that they did not do SO on that occasion. There were still massive holes in their expenditure cuts which they would have had to bring in legislation to remedy, and which they would have expected the Senate"":""""its having been elected-to subsequently pass for them. Another point is that, irrespective of whether the opposition did layout everything in the com;se of that eJection campaign, the Leader of the Opposition has said persistently since, in giving members of the opposition reassurance that he will not again lead them into circumstances where all the normal criteria for an opposition victory are in place but they lose, that he will not put them through that again. He has made it clear to opposition members in their party rooms, in their party political enclaves, and to the electorate in various radio interviews, that he will not be frank with the Australian public, in his terms, in an election campaign and will not present detailed policies. What does he expect? Because he has said that he is not going to present detailed policies, does he expect that if we on this side of the House become the opposition we should nevertheless pass his budgets? Does he expect, if he has not produced detailed policies, that we will say in the Senate, 'Beauty, you haven't presented detailed policies so we'll just let this through.'? He has invited us to judge him by alleged standards that he puts in., ' Mr Itonaldson-,-What about 1981? You will not talk about it.",50
119,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I am going to. We now have this situation where the opposition comes in here and talks about a governing process that it thinks it has a mandate for. In fact, what it has produced is a situation where government becomes more and more impossible in this country. There are two circumstances different from 1981 that those opposite need to think about. There is no sense in just going through argy-bargy. We might as well have a sensible discussion about where politics is going from this point on. The fact is that, since we introduced the changes which brought about, among other things, proportional representation-which came in in 1949 and put as a likely outcome in election campaigns that governments would, from time to time, find it hard to control the Senate-and we increased the size of the Senate and the House of Representatives in the mid-1980s, we in fact created a situation where it is almost invariably going to be the case that a government will do little better than secure half the Senate and, under the Senate rules, that is not sufficient for passage ,of legislation. It will be only accidentime. tal circumstances which will produce a result different from that. That would apply to a government that polled 55 per cent of the vote in the preceding election. So, whatever circumstances applied prior to that, we are not going to get ourselves into a situation .from this ,point on where that will be the case. ' I want to get back to the circumstances of 1981. The fact is that $130 million worth of taxation revenue was taken out of the budget-$130 million. The propositions that were put forward by the Treasurer at that time involved two tranches over two years. The bulk of those propositions got through-they got through in the second year as well-in circumstances where the then opposition believed itself not to be in a position to bring about a defeat of government legislation in the Senate. The then opposition took the point in the Senate that it would take full advantage of an opportunity to vote against a piece of legislation which was going to be passed. We will find plenty of statements on record of Labor Party spokesmen in opposition saying that they ought to have stood this or that up. The fact is that since 1975-when we realised the consequences of that sort of action-we have talked up a hell of a storm, but we have not done anything. We have enough common sense to recognise that the country cannot be run that way. Mr Ronaldson-Look at the percentage of the revenue raised in 1981 compared to now. Look at the percentage.",50
120,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"It is $130 million as oppolled to $3 billion. 1 will tell the opposition something else that is a result of this: it has rewritten the ground (Ules. We might as well get something out of these sorts of debates instead of the normal argy-bargy, which we get from both sides of the Houseat least we hope people might read these debates in the Hansard. The opposition has created a very different situation in this country that is melding with those other changes in our legislative arrangementsparticularly that change which has produced a situation where a majority party will never get control of the Senate for all practical purposes, and certainly not for any length of But the opposition has now, created a situation where there will be, from this point on, two budgets presented. This will occur almost inv!lriably after elections, when governments will introduce their most unpopular budgets. The opposition has now created a situation where- ' Mr Ronaldson-You brought it upon yourself.",51
121,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I am not even remotely interested in that heckling comment that we brought it upon ourselves. The opposition has brought it upon the parliament. 1 will go through this because 1 think this is something that the opposition needs to consider. Whilst it is true that we have very considerable disagreements .from time to time with the Democrats and' the Greens-who look like being pretty firmly ensconced as the crossbench parties-we have more in common with them ideologically than the opposition does. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) says in this place that the opposition will win the next election. We have heard that before the last five elections; it is wearing a bit thin. Let us suppose that the opposition does win that particular poll. It will find itself in a position where it has legitimised the American situation of having a couple of budgets: the budget that the administration wants and can get through in the parliamentary processes that it absolutely controls, and ,the budget from those who feel they have their own mandate-who may control the Senate; after all, senators are all elected and not appointed-to decide what they will bring forward. We are a small country awash in the global economy. We cannot afford the instability which that process creates, and which the opposition has produced. Even if the oppos-­ tion changes its vote and passes all thIS legislation, or refuses to vote in the Senate, whatever, the unfortunate thing is that it will have set a precedent in its handling of the legislation which will play merry hell with the long-term survival of this country. ' Let me get back to this point about election undertakings. The fact that the opposition does not rub the eleCtorate's nose in what we say are our election promises does not mean that we are breaking our election promises. The opposition was incapable of getting through the flack of its GST and presenting in the public mind the fact that if a government says it will maintain the current level - f taxation as a percentage of GOP, yet Its forward estimates on revenue suggest that the revenue will fall, then logically that government will raise revenue somewhere down the line. If in the coursee of an election campaign opposition members are incapable of gett-ng that point of view through to the AustralIan people, then they should not come in here and tell us that we lied to them. The fact that that point is not salient and that they have not ha? their noses rubbed in it does not mean that It has not been presented. I suppose when the opposition is proposing something as spectacular as a GST, to give the opposition its due it is hard to get across any other point on tax-tion measures. But do not come in here and call into account the government's bona fides when we made all of that absolutely clear when we brought these measures forward: Mr Atkinson-No new taxes.",51
122,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,Is there a new tax in the budget? Mr Atkinson-What do you think an increase is?,52
123,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Which' one? None. There are no new taxes in the budget. It is absolute nonsense. The opposition can find none that it can point to. So do not come up with that sort of claptrap. The honourable member for Isaacs (MrAtkinson) could always get a few people believing that for a period, but they will not believe it ultimately. Mr Ronaldson-Have a look at the polls and see who is believing whom.",52
124,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Public opinion polls will or go up and down. We have been behind in.the public opinion polls' for the bulk. of the Hme in every one - f the last three parlIa-ents ..We are again-bIg deal! When electIon tIme , comes around and Australians sit down and make judgments about who can responsibly administer the affairs of the nation, they will not pass favourable judgment on a partyt-at spends its tim- creati?g may-em and al.ten-g the way in which busmess will be donem this parliament for time immemorial. As I have said before on these' matters, the opposition will rue the day it undertook this action . .I hope the opposition rues it later rather than sooner because it will rue it the most if it ever gets back onto this side of the chamber-and that will be a very long time from now. If the opposition ever gets i?to t-at position, it wi-l rue that tons. In the sIlly Clfcumstance that It has allowed to emerge, it will not be capable of introducing any unpopular measure. , Mr Evans-Have an election in Swan.",52

127,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Northern Territory-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (5.43 p.m.)-I move: PAIRS That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with the 1993-94 budget decisions and other decisions made by the government in respect of higher education. This bill provides over $4.6 billion for higher education in 1996, including some $500 million to be provided by the government through the BEeS trust account.. As well, the bill provides for funds that are additional to those already legislated for. These additional funds total over $50 million in 1993, over $270 million in 1994 and over $320 million in 1995. Measures put forward in the bill will also generate additional revenues of $126 million in 1994, $186 million in 1995 and $130 million in 1996. The government has framed the measures covered in this bill to meet the need for enhanced efficiencies in higher education funding. These measures will also advance national goals relating to access, equity, diversity and quality in the system. The bill's provisions include amendments to the contributions made by certain categories of students under the higher education contribution scheme-HECS. The changes require students who have already had access to undergraduate, professional and postgraduate opportunities to contribute, in general, twice the standard rate of HECS from January 1994 should they enrol in a second undergraduate course. The level of government subsidy will also be reduced for students at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels who have already undertaken the required number of equivalent full-time student units to complete a course of study, plus a further allowance of half a standard student load. Except in special circumstances, these students will be liable for 1.5 times standard rate of HECS for additional study undertaken for that course. The reasons for these changes are very simple. Every student who takes or is allowed by his or her university to take longer than necessary to complete or do a second undergraduate degree is excluding a school leaver or another person from attending university at all. Other measures put forward in this bill modify repayment arrangements for HECS. From July 1994, repayment rates will be lifted from the present two, three and four per cent levels to three, four and five per cent respectively. Concurrently with this change, income thresholds for repayment of the HECS debt will be re-aligned with actual average weekly earnings. In addition, from July 1994 HECS repayments will be made on a PAYE and provisional tax basis. The HECS amendments in this bill are both equitable and realistic. The measures relating to the amount of contributions stress that as many Australians as possible should have access to higher education and that those who do have the chance to participate should contribute to the cost of that experience in the fairest way possible. These amendments acknowledge that in a climate of budgetary restraint the opportunities of newcomers to the system, including recent schoolleavers, have to be protected and that our students need to think very carefully about their study options. The amendments complement other initiatives which the government is undertaking, in the context of its educational profile negotiations with institutions, to restore opportunities for those new to higher education, especially recent school leavers. All the HECS measures introduced in this bill will reduce Commonwealth government outlays to higher education and hence the public sector financial burden. HECS is not a tax. It is a deferred repayment loans system. As such, it is in the first instance a government outlay and any reduction in student contributions requires greater government expenditure. Income received through HECS is directly linked to the Commonwealth's ability to provide additional student places. In the the same way as HECS has already provided opportunities for more Australians to participate in higher education, the HECS measures in this bill are essential for the government to meet its ongoing commitment to. increased access. The provisions relating to income thresholds and the rates at which the HECS debt is repaid shorten the repayment period-from 15 to nine years for the typical graduatewithout increasing the actual cost to students. These measures also recognise that Commonwealth funding of the massive growth in higher education since 1989 has substantially exceeded HECS revenue. For example, income from HECS last year, including up-front payments, voluntary repayments and payments against HECS debt assessments by the Australian Taxation Office amounted to about $195 million. This was less than 5 per cent of the total Commonwealth 1992 outlay on higher education of $4.3 billion, which was $274 million above the level of funding provided in 1991. Outstanding HECS debts currently total in excess of $2 billion. Under another measure introduced in this bill, students undertaking at least 75 per cent of a full-time study load through the. new open learning initiative, OLI, will have access to a deferred payment facility similar to HECS. The OLI is already extending opportunities for a significant number of Australians who would otherwise find it difficult to participate in higher education by virtue of work commitments or other circumstances. Provision already exists for the government to fund the development of a decentralised network to support open learning students. A deferred payment facility will further help these Australians by making it easier for them to make the required contribution to the costs involved in their education. Additional growth in higher education for 1994 and 1995 has already been announced. This bill further expands opportunities for access in 1995 and 1996 with its provisions concerning any spare capacity which institutions may have. The bill's amendments in respect of research and postgraduate education funding reflect the government's policy of encouraging the higher education sector to maintain and strengthen its quality of provision and higher international standing. The government will continue the research infrastructure program beyond 1994 at an enhanced level, providing $56.4 million in 1995 and $60 million from 1996 with total infrastructure program funding amounting to $176.4 million over the 1995-97 triennium. From January 1994, the government will integrate the Australian postgraduate research awards, the Australian postgraduate course awards andHECS exemption scholarships into a single Australian postgraduate awards scheme. There will be 20,700 of these new awards available in 1994, rising to 25,500 in 1997, an increase that will help expand participation in postgraduate education and thereby assist Australia to enhance its competitive edge in higher education and research. These measures will complement the further deregulation of postgraduate provision, allowing universities to build a postgraduate fee paying market. Universities will be free to innovate, for example, by using Commonwealth postgraduate load to subsidise feepaying students. The government's commitment to increasing the efficiency, flexibility and productivity of the higher education labour market is reflected in its support for the introduction of workplace bargaining. A national framework agreement for agency bargaining is imminent which the government will support. This bill provides for on-going supplementation to be made available to universities for funding economic adjustments consistent with the Australian Public Service arrangements which provide 1.4 per cent followed by 1.5 per cent twelve months later. The arrangements cover both academic and general staff. In addition, the government will offer to each institution an advance of funds for a sector-wide productivity related salary increase of up to two per cent for both academic and general staff. This would be conditional on there being agreement as regards a broad range of productivity related measures. There will be no on-going supplementation provided by the government for productivity related salary increases. The bill seeks to consolidate amounts at present specified separately in the legislation for quality, research, equity, the national priority (reserve) fund and advanced engineering centres. The distribution of funds across these programs is determined three years in advance but allocations to universities for most of these programs are made annually. This unnecessarily inhibits the capacity of government and higher education institutions to respond to needs that emerge over the course of a triennium. While this bill proposes the consolidation of funding, the specific purposes for which grants can be made will remain unaltered and programs will not be administratively affected. While the total level of available funding will continue to be legislated three years in advance, allocations will be decided annually and announced in the yeady higher education funding report. The value of this measure lies in the increased fle:cibility it will accord to recurrent funding arrangements. This will in turn assist universities and the Commonwealth to achieve their objectives with greater efficiency. In summary, the measures put forward in this bill are part of the government's overall strategy for· enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the higher education sector. These measures seek to expand opportunities for Australians while recognising that' there are limits to the contribution available from the taxpayer. They aim, in addition, to stimulate Australia 1s diverse higher. education sector to maximise its capacity for providing a high quality product that meets the needs of its students and the nation as a whole. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion ,by Mr Ronaldson) adjounied.

128,Mr CREAN,DOMESTIC MEAT PREMISES,"Hotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (5.52 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to provide for a per premises charge to be levied on domestic meat establishments in those states and territories where the Commonwealth's meat inspection agency, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, is responsible for inspecting domestic meat. Since the bill is the first part of a package of legislation to be introduced, I want to spend some time on the context, objectives and impacts of the whole package before returning to the details of this particular bill. The House will also see that the Senate's imposed deadlines for the passage of legislation through this House impacts on the package of measures and the timing of their introduction. In the 1993 budget, the government announced a major program of reform of AQIS to reduce its cost to Australian industry while retaining the integrity of Australia's inspection functions. I want to make it clear that AQIS fulfils an. essential role in protecting Australia against the importation of exotic pests and diseases and inspecting food for safety and overseas country requirements. This role must continue, but I believe it can be done more efficiently at lower cost to Australia:n industry. The program of reform of AQIS, which is designed to give the organisation a much stronger business orientation, has three major elements. First,' AQIS will be reflecting the government's intention to actively encourage Australian industry to take more responsibility for quality assurance from production, through processing and distribution, to consumption. Industry will benefit from quality assurance by adopting modem technology and processing systems giving much better' control of their products. Second, to improve the efficiency of service a delivery to' industry and to cap and reduce inspection costs, AQIS will be restructured over the next three to four years with a projected decline of 650 Commonwealth and 100 state AQIS personnel via retrenchments on a voluntary basis wherever possible. To place this in perspective, AQIS currently employs around 2,000 Commonwealth and 600 state permanent staff. Third, a package of new charging legislation will be introduced to provide for a uniform, three-tiered charging regime for AQIS services. To implement this new charging regime across all AQIS services to export, import and domeStic industries, a considerable package of new legislation is expected to be introduced to the House of Representatives late in the budget session with passage through the Senate in the autumn session. With the exception of the meat industry, implementation of the new. three-tiered charge regime across the industries' AQIS services will be on or after 1 July 1994. Introduction of the the--tiered charging regime is essential if charge:, are to be acceptable and equitable across all users whether their inspection services are based on quality assurance methods or traditional end point inspection. The three tiers of the new charge structure comprise: first tier, a fixed annual charge per premises at which activity is conducted; second tier, a throughput or volume charge on relevant products; third tier, a charge per inspector per unit of time, or a charge per inspection. The third tier inspection· charge aims to recover the variable costs of AQIS field inspection activities. The first· and second tier charges between them aim. to recover the balance of AQIS chargeable costs which tend by their nature to be fixed in the short to medium term. The three-tiered charging regime allows for· the separation and identification of AQIS field and other costs. It contrasts sharply with present AQIS charges, the bulk of which are set on an average, per inspector per unit of time basis. The objectives of the three-tiered approach to the pricing of AQIS services are efficiency, equity, consistency, transparency and simplicity. To meet the efficie-cy objective, economic theory suggests that the marginal cost of addi-ional inspection resources equates with the price industry pays to deploy them as it will with third tier charges. For equity, the three-tiered cost recovery regime provides a fairer allocation of the costs to be recovered from firms participating in the industry particularly when quality assurance methods become more widespread. AQIS costs will be measured and applied consistently across industries with the application of the three-tiered regime which is based on common princil?les. As a public monopoly providing regulatory services, AQIS needs to be able to justify its pricing policies to its clients. It also needs make its costs and recoveries visible to them. Taken together these imply transparency and simplicity to which the three-tiered charging regime contributes. However, due to the shortness of time made available by the Senate for the drafting and introduction of budget bills and to ensure that the government's reform plans for the domestic and export meat industries and their associated charging structures are introduced progressively from 1 January 1994 as planned, I am currently introducing two bills for passage of both the House and the Senate in the budget sittings relating solely to the domestic and export meat industry charging arrangements. As I stated initially, the purpose of the bill before us is to provide for a first tier, per premises charge to be levied on domestic meat establishments. The second bill, whose introduction will follow immediately, makes consequential changes to the name and coverage of the collection act. Other changes to domestic and export meat charges, including an export meat premises charge to be made on 1 January 1994, can be made by amending the relevant subordinate legislation of other acts. The second tier,· throughput charge for export and domestic meat, is not proposed for introduction until 1 July 1994, so its imposition has been included in the full package of AQIS charging legislation due to be introduced late in these budget sittings. I want to tum now to the financial impact of the three-tiered charge regime and the other changes proposed on the meat industry. The estimated revenues are all expressed in today's dollars and using accrual accounting concepts. In 1994-95, the first full year of the three-tiered charging system, AQIS revenue from the domestic and export meat industry is expected to be around $78.2 million, which will include a maximum of $13.2 million in premises charges. This compares with meat inspection revenue of $80.6 million in both 1992-93 and 1993-94, Revenue is expected to fall in subsequent years, reaching $70.5 million in 1996-97. When the premises charges are introduced to on 1 January 1994, the annual cost of meat inspection staff is expected to fall from a base rate of $69,169 to $65,164. The base rate is expected to fall further to $59,164 on 1 July 1994. This will honour the government's dual pledges not to increase the costs of inspection staff and to reduce the total costs of inspection services by AQIS to the meat industry by $10 million over the next four years. Revenue from first tier premises charges on domestic meat establishments is estimated by AQIS to total $1.1 million in 1993-94 and $2.2 million in 1994'-95, the first full year of its operation. As previously explained, the revenue collected from the premises charge will be offset by a reduction in the revenue from the third tier inspection charge. This bill and the foreshadowed amendment bill are part of major and worthwhile reforms to AQIS and the charging regime for its services .. The reform of AQIS charging regimes will be completed when I introduce a full package of legislation late in the budget sittings. I commend the bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned.

129,Mr CREAN,EXPORT INSPECTION CHARGES,"Rotham-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (5.02 p.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the following Acts: the Export Inspection Charges Collection Act 1985, the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985, the Export Inspection (Establishment Regulation Charges) Act 1985 and the Export (Service Charge) Act 1985. As I stated earlier today when I delivered the se,cond reading speech on the Domestic; Meat Premises Charge Bill 1993, this amendment bill and the earlier bill allow for the implementation of a three-tiered charging regime for the meat inspection services of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection 'Service. I refer honourable members to my earlier second reading speech on the context of the government's reforms of AQIS, including the three-tiered charging arrangements-of which this bill forms a part. It is the government's intention to seek the leave of the Rouse to have a concurrent debate on the two bills. I will now provide a summary for honourable members of the effect of the amendments. The short title of the Export Inspection Charges Collection Act 1985 will be amended to read Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Act 1985. It also amends this collection act to authorise the collection of the domestic meat premises charge which is to be imposed by the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill 1993. The bill ;llso amends the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985, the Export Inspection (Export Registration Charge) Act 1985 and the - Export Inspection (Service Charge) Act 1985 to refer to the new title of the collection act. The bill has no direct financial implications. I commend the bill to, honourable members and I present the explanatory - emorandum. Debate (on rnotion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned. NA (TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES) BILL 1993 First Reading  first time. "" Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (5.05 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 derives from the banking policy statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 18 June 1993, and relates to the government's decision to liberalise foreign bank entry, announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the One Nation statement. The Banking Act 1959 has already been amended by the Banking Legislation Amendment Act 1992, which received the royal assent on 21 December 1992, to give effect to the government's decision in One Nation to liberalise foreign bank entry. Those amendments enable foreign banks, whether they have been operating in Australia or not, to apply for a banking authority under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959; and permit foreign banks, which are authorised under the Banking Act, to operate as banks in the form of a branch. ' The purpose of the current bill is to facilitate the transfer of certain assets and liabilities from foreign bank subsidiaries 'in Australia to new branches. These subsidiaries will have been in existence prior to 18 June 1993 and may be either authorised banks under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959, or money market corporations registered under the Financial Corporations Act 1974-or any subsidiaries of those bodies which ar- registered under the Financial Corporations Act' 1974. In a limited number of cases the transfer may be between a pre-existing subsidiary and a new authorised bank subsidiary. To be eligible to transfer assets and liabilities under the proposed legislation, foreign banks will have, from the commencement of the legislation, three years within which to apply for a banking authority, and up to six years to effect the transfer. The proposed legislation will minimise administrative procedures, and waive the payment of both Commonwealth and state transfer fees and charges. Without these changes foreign banks would be inhibited from responding to the government's policy decision to encourage increased effective competition and efficiency in the Australian financial sector. The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 will facilitate the establishment of branch operations in Australia by ensuring that foreign banks currently operating an authorised bank subsidiary or money mC;lrket corporation are not disadvantaged compared with new foreign bank entrants when establishing branch bankillg operations in Australia. The bill also makes a number of changes to the income tax law to ensure that the tax consequences that would normally' arise· on the transfer of business from foreign bank subsidiaries to branches are deferred, and that double taxation and double deductions do not arise. To do this, the bill places the branch in the same position as the subsidiary would have been in had its assets and liabilities not been transferred. This treatment will extend to all assets and liabilities transferred under this legislation, including debts owing to the subsidiary that are transferred to the branch and are subsequently written off as bad. Also, any interest paid on borrowings transferred to the branch, which would have been exempt from interest withholding tax under section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 if paid by .the subsid1ary, will be exempt under the same provision. \ !' ' To further assist the smooth transition from subsidiary to branch banking, the subsidiaries of foreign banks will be able tq transfer existing tax losses to branches of the banks. In this way; the ability to claim deductions for past tax losses will not be disturbed by the transition to branch banking. The government believes that these changes will bring competitive gains and efficiencies to the banking sector; greater flexibility in the provision of finance; and cost advantages to Australian clients. The measures contained in the bill should also further improve the international competitiveness of the Australian financial system. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion' by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned. . CUSTOMS AND EXCISE NA 1993 First Reading·  first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (6.10p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is part of a package of bills introducing the following measures. Firstly, there will be amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act' 1901 to amend the diesel' fuel rebate scheme to restrain the escalating costs of that scheme by: establishing a time limit of three years after the purchase of fuel, for claims for rebate; introducing an annual adjustment of the rebate rates because of indexation of the duty rates applying to diesel fuel. This is considered to be an improvement to the previous system which adjusted the rates of rebate twice yearly-in February and August-but then averaged out these increases through the use of a six-monthly moving average. It is considered that the proposed improvement will, in addition to restraining costs under scheme, simplify its administration; and finally, imposing an administration charge of one per cent of the value of the rebate payable to claimants. Secondly, there will be amendments to the Excise Act 1901, together with amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to address revenue loss due to the practice of brewing beer with the aid of commercial facilities in unlicensed premises, known as microbreweries and, in particular, to ensure that beer produced at microbreweries is subject both to customs control and to duties of excise. While the excise revenue loss is relatively minor at present, overseas experience indicates the potential for substantial revenue erosion. Thirdly, there will be amendments to the Excise Act 1901, together with amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to address substantial revenue loss through the substitution of excise free or low duty products for petroleum fuels. Resolution of this issue involves ensuring· certain blended petroleum products and crude oil or condensate delivered for use otherwise than as refinery feedstock are excisable products, and that the excise duty payable on the blend, the crude oil or condensate will be payable at a rate equal to either the diesel rate or the leaded petrol rate, depending upon the composition of the petroleum product. Fourthly, there will be amendments to the Excise Act 1901 to provide that, where either blended petroleum products or crude oil are duty paid at the rate applicable to diesel fuel and where the products are for use in an eligible manner for the purposes of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, then a rebate of duty under that scheme is payable. Finally, amendments to the Excise Act 1901 will allow payments to certain producers of naphtha from oil shale where certain conditions have been met. These payments are intended to encourage the demonstration of new oil shale processing technologies, recognising that full-scale commercial development needs to take place on its economic merits. Financial impact statement Amendments to the diesel fuel rebate the scheme, other than the imposition of an administration charge-the amendments to the DFRS are expected to result in the following savings: $3.9 milliop. in financial year 199394; $15.8 million in financial year 1994-95; and $16.9 million in financial year 1995-96. Amendments in respect of microbreweriesthe amendments to ensure that beer produced with the assistance of commercial facilities and equipment is subject to both customs control and excise duty is expected to generate revenue as follows: $109,000 in financial year 1993-94; and $200,000 in financial year 1994-95. Amendments in respect of petroleum substitution-the amendments addressing the problems associated with the blending of petroleum products is expected to generate revenue as follows:. $14 million in financial year 1993-94; $19.5 million in financial year 199495; and $19.5 million in financial year 199596. Amendments in respect of certain naphtha producers-the payments to certain naphtha producers are not expected to have any financial impact before the 1996-97 financial year because of the fact that production using the new process is unlikely to commence before that period. I commend the bill to the House and present its accompanying explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned. DIESEL FUEL (EXCISE DUTY REBATE) ADMINISTRATION CHARGE BILL 1993 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (6.15 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is one of a package of bills proposing amen:dments to the diesel· fuel rebate scheme to address the escalating costs of that scheme. Together with the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, it addresses those escalating costs by proposing the following measures: the imposition of an administration charge of one per cent of the value of the rebate payable to claimants; adjusting the rebate rate for indexation only once a year; and establishing a time limit of three years the purchase of fuel for claims for rebate. This particular bill deals with the first of those points: that is, the imposition of an administration charge on certain applications for rebate of excise duty paid in respect of diesel fuel. As with the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993, the charge is based upon the government's intention to recoup the costs of administering the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Approximately $1,000 million is anticipated to be rebat.ed under the diesel fuel rebate scheme in 1993-94. The cost of administering the scheme is anticipated to be approximately $11 million, which is slightly in excess of one per cent of the amount rebated. Financial impact statement This bill, together with the Diesel Fuel (Customs Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993, is anticipated to result in the following additional revenue collections: $5 million in the financial year 1993-94; $11.7 million in the financial year 1994-95; and $12.6 millionin the financial year 199596. 1 commend the bill to the House and present its accompanying explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned. DIESEL FUEL (CUSTOMS DUTY REBATE) ADMINISTRATION CHARGE BILL 1993 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (6.18 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is one of a package of bills proposing amendments to the diesel fuel rebate scheme to address the escalating costs of that scheme. Together with the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993 and the Customs and Excise Legislation after Amendment Bill 1993, it addresses those escalating costs by proposing the following measures: the imposition of an administration charge of one per cent of the value of the rebate payable to claimants; adjusting the rebate rate for indexation only once a year; and establishing a time limit of three years after the purchase of fuel for claims for rebate. This particular bill deals with the first of those points: that is, the imposition of an administration charge on certain applications for rebate of customs duty paid in respect of diesel fuel. The charge is based upon the government's intention to recoup the costs of administering the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Approximately $1,000 million is anticipated to be rebated under the diesel fuel rebate scheme in 1993-94. The. cost of administering the scheme is anticipated to be approximately $11 million, which is slightly in excess of one per cent of the amount rebated. Financial impact statement This bill, together with the Diesel Fuel (Excise Duty Rebate) Administration Charge Bill 1993, is anticipated to result in the following additional revenue collections: $5 million in the financial year 1993-94; $11. 7 million in the financial year 1994-95; and $12.6 million in the financial year 1995-96. I commend the bill to the House and present its accompanying. explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion' by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned. NA (No.2) 1993 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  tary to the Minister for Defence) (6.20 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, together with the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, is part of a package of bills which introduce a number of measures as already outlined in the second reading speech for the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. In particular, this bill proposes amendments to enSure that beer produced using commercial facilities in unlicensed premises customs control and to duties of excise and to ensure that certain blended petroleum products and crude oil or condensate delivered for use otherwise than as refinery feed stock are excisable products and that excise duty will be paid on the blend, the crude oil or condensate at a rate equal to either the diesel rate or the leaded petrol rate, depending upon the composition of the petroleum product. In addition, this bill also proposes amendments which will remove the excise exemption on gasoline and mineral turpentine produced from shale mined in Australia, which is a consequence of the new arrangements to provide payments to certain producers of naphtha derived from oil shale, as I have previously outlined in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. Financial impact statement The financial impact for the first two measures is outlined in the financial impact statement in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. The third measure has no financial impact. I commend the bill to the House and present its accompanying explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned.

130,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NATIONAL HEATH AMENDMENT,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (6.22 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 to Complement amendments made last year to the nursing home benefit payments scheme by the National Health Amendment Act 1992. This bill is related to the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 and should be read in conjuncis subject to tion with that bill. The National Health Amendment Act 1992 was enacted to address inequities in the recovery of unspent Commonwealth nursing home benefit when a nursing home is sold. These problems flowed from a quirk in the legislation which meant that amounts of unspent benefit were not legally characterised as debts to the Commonwealth. Where a nursing home proprietor accrued a liability and sold the nursing home, that vendor could not be pursued for the 'money after the sale. The purchaser became liable for that 'amount. Whilst the Commonwealth nevertheless had a statutory duty to recover such amounts, they could be recovered only via an offset or ongoing negative fee loading to the approved daily nursing home fee and, by extension, the amount of Commonwealth benefit payable each month. This sometimes resulted in the purchaser acquiring a home subject to a liability accrued by a former proprietor. Although the industry was well aware of these arrangements and usually made appropriate provisions in contracts of sale, problems still occurred. The National Health Amendment Act 1992 addressed this situation by providing that amounts of unspent benefit were characterised as debts recoverable from the vendor on sale. n contained a number of key measures to support its purpose, including a requirement for vendors to give 90 days notice of a sale. This period of notice enables the vendor's claims for Commonwealth benefit, books and records t() be examined so that, prior to completion of the sale, a fair estimate of any overpayment can be made. However, these changes only apply prospectively, applying to benefits paid after the commencement of the National Health Amendment Act 1992 on 1 July 1993. Benefits paid prior to the commencement of that act are not s'ubject to its provisions and the pre""existing system of recovery by fee loading continues to apply in respect of benefits paid up to 30 June 1993. The two bills tabled forconsideration in the current sittings together allow for the debt recovery measures to extend prior to 1 July 1993. The Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 imposes a charge on the vendor of a nursing home on sale equal to the amount of any benefit unspent by the nursing home up to 30 June 1993. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 sets out the administrative arrangements for the collection and recovery of such amounts from the vendor on sale of a nursing home. This latter bill also provides that where the Commonwealth holds moneys in trust for the benefit of the vendor pending completion of an investigation of the nursing home accounts, and on completion it is found that money is repayable to the vendor, the Commonwealth is liable to pay interest at commercial ra-es on the amount repayable. These measures complement those in the National Health Amendment Act 1992. They provide, effectively, that amounts of unspent b""nefit paid prior to the recent prospective amendments are recoverable from the vendor as debts on sale. The National Health Amendment Act 1992 received the support of both the nursing home industry and the coalition, as expressed in this House by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and in the Senate by Senators Newman and Patterson. Those who spoke did, however, express a·concem, shared by the industry and the government alike, that there was a need for those measures to be applied prior to 1 July 1993. The National Health Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 addresses that need by complementing the National Health Amendment Act 1992 to augment the protection already given to the rights of purchasers of homes, provide a more equitable system and enable the Commonwealth to recover unspent moneys in a more timely manner. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned.

BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL Consideration resumed from 27 September. Second Reading  tary to the Mi-ister for Defence) (6.29 p.m.) - I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993 proposes amendments to the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989 which implement the government's election commitment announced by the Prime Minister (Mr - eating) on 24 February 1993 to extend the shipbuilding bounty in line with general manufacturing tariffs so that it is progressively reduced from the current 10 per cent. to five per cent by July 1996. The proposed amendments replace the existing bounty rates with the new rates for the period 1993-94 to 1996-97. The proposed new rates correspond with the tariff reductions set down in the government's statement 'Building a Competitive Australia' of 12 March 1991. Rather than the more rapid phase down and termination of the bounty by 1 July 1995 set down in the current act, the new rates proposed are nine per cent for 1993-94, eight per cent for 1994-95, seven per cent for 1995-96 and five per cent. for 1996-97. The government's decision on bounty rates was made after consultation between the government and the Australian Shipbuilders Association. Furthedssues raised by the association relating to the administration of the scheme, including the provisions to apply at the end of the scheme and the future of the scheme beyond July 1997, will also be considered by this government. The shipbuilding industry has changed from a dying industry in the 1970s when the industry was characterised by industrial unrest, high levels of government support and traditional production of conventional ships for what was then a declining world market to one of Australia's manufacturing successes. Now Australian builders are leading their competitors in the fast ferry sector and luxury yachts, but the rest of the world is catching up fast. Substantial progress toward becoming a 1993 viable, export orientated manufacturing sector has been made despite the reducing levels of bounty. Now the industry is a multimillion dollar export earner specialising in innovative products for niche markets. Some are already recognised as world leaders due to their approach to design and product techriology. Shipbuilders now are concentrating on vessels such as passenger and vehicular ferries, luxury motor yachts, offshore supply vessels, tugs and small trading vessels. The government recognises the problems that could result from premature phasing out of assistance and proposes to extend the bounty in line with general manufacturing tariffs. The more gradual reduction in the bounty rate will sustain the competitive gains made by the industry. The period of the new bounty regime promises years of strong export growth coupled with increased employment as the industry gears up to meet international competition. To maintain a leading position builders have to continue to produce world-beating designs and technology in new sectors. This will present major challenges in re-equipping to build bigger ships, in financing larger orders and in funding bigger operations generally. Given their success so far, we believe shipbuilders deserve at least the same support from government that other Australian manufacturers get while they tackle these challenges. Financial impact statement The measures contained in this bill are expected to result in a net cost to outlays as follows: $6.6 million in financial year 1993-94, $6 million in financial year 199.4-95, $16.2 million in financial year 1995-96, and $15 n:tillion in financial year 1996-97. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned.

132,Mr DOWNER,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"These bills will be known in history as the Treasurer resignation bills or maybe even the Dawkins resignation bills. It was over these bills at press conference last week that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) flagged his private desire to resign from the position of Treasurer because of the lack of support in.his own caucus and indeed in the cabinet for his budget and for his budget strategy. Both of those things have been little short of a: catastrophe for the Australian Labor Party, for the re-elected Labor government, for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and above all for the Treasurer. These bills have proved necessary because the government's budget strategy involved something that we so often get from the Australian Labor Party:' an attempt to make short cuts. Basically what the government proposed in the original omnibus tax bill was to lump together a whole series of tax increases-a betrayal bill it is sometimes being called-in order to try to spook the Senate into supporting all,of them rather than trying to amend the bill and oppose some aspects of the legislation. The genesis of this strategy was a view that the Treasurer had, and no doubt the Prime Minister as well, that since the omnibus bill was a bill imposing tax it could not be amended by the Senate and therefore, the go- ' ' vernment would be able to push through. what would have to be not only the most deceitful but also some of the most regressive taxation measures known in Australian political history. Not long after the government unveiled the original omnibus bill, it realised that it could not continue to maintain the argument that the bill could not be amended. If it maintained that argument, then it would be conceding, in effect, that the bill would be unconstitutional because it imposed more than one tax measure. , The government then said, 'We are sticking with this omnibus tax bill. It is constitutional. it is a fundamental part'-honourable members should remember that-'of the government's budget strategy. We are not going to waiver, we are going to stand by this omnibus tax bill, but you can try to amend it if you like'. That was the first albeit rather minor backdown. As a result of legal advice the coalition his received that the bill not orily imposed a tax but also imposed several taxes, the coalition argued that the omnibus tax bill was unconstitutional. If the bill were passed,' then it would be subject to challenge in the High Court and, as a resu-t of that, the government would have to go back to the drawing board with its budget. So the coalition referred the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. One of the more interesting developments in this parliament since the last federal election was the way the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee responded to that bill. ' Given the history of the way the Labor Party works, one would think that Labor Party members on that Senate committee would simply put a tick in the box marked 'Labor' and make sure that they supported the position of the Treasurer: that the bill was perfect1y constitutional, which was beyond any reasonable doubt, and that it should be supported by the parliament. But, to their everlasting credit, Labor members of the committee joined the coalition members in arguing that the bill introduced by the government raised a very serious risk of it being unconstiincrease tutional. The judgment by the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee undid this element of the Treasurer's budget strategy. That committee-in particular Labor members of the committee-humiliated the Tr-surer to such an extent that he turned on his own caucus, turned on Labor members of the Senate committee, denounced them, and started speculating on his own resignation. Given that the Treasurer had argued for five solid weeks in the face of all the legal evidence that could be mustered that the omnibus tax bill was constitutional and then found at the end of those five weeks that even the Labor Party senators were not prepared to support that proposition, he should have done the honourable thing: he should have taken his own advice and resigned from the position of Treasurer of Australia because of the instability and the uncertainty that. he had created in this country through not only the budget measures introduced in his budget but also the way he - ctically tried to handle that budget. The children of that particular omnibus tax bill are these eight bills which are before the House' tonight. I believe it is very important when we consider all of the budget shenanigans of the Labor Party to understand one simple thing: this is the Keating strategy. Do honourable members .remember the Treasurer's immortal words which he refused to deny when given the opportunity during question time yesterday? He said, 'I am prepared to be the bunny for Keating'. Indeed he was. The great Keating strategy is to promise massive tax cuts which would not have to be funded by increases in indirect taxes. He said, 'We caq give you massive tax cuts and you will never get a GST to fund them. We ;will never increase indirect taxes-. All of those promises, followed by an election victory based on those promises, left the government and Mr Dawkins with an unholy mess. They could not fund the income tax cuts without resorting to either indirect tax increases or spending cuts. They had to do one or the other. The proposition that had been put at the election that the government could increase spending, that it would not indirect taxes and that it would provide income tax cuts turned out to be just what opposition members pointed out was the case at the time of the .last election - little short of a fraud. In the end the Treasurer was left to pick up the pieces of this mess. He produced a budget which was a betrayal of the Australian electorate not only by increasing indirect taxes-1 think it is very important that people rememberthis-but also by increasing the revenue from indirect taxes to the extent that revenue in 1996-97 from sales taxes, payroll taxes and fuel excise-all the taxes the coalition was going to abolish and replace with a GSTwould be the equivalent of the revenue by that year that the Commonwealth would have obtained from the GST. I think that is a very cruel and a very sad irony. It underlines the way' that the Labor Party, in particular the Prime Minister, simply betrayed the Australian electorate at the last election. They will never forgive him for that. The bills before the House are therefore broken up versions of that original omnibus tax bill-the bill of betrayal-and they therefore incotporate many aspects of that betrayal. These bills are also highly aggressive in their impact. The increases in sales tax are borne disproportionately by low income Australians. The rich can happily bear and pay what constitutes a 10 per cent-one percentage point-increase in sales tax on something like toothpaste. The people who have done very well in the last 10 years under a Labor government-the richest 10 per cent of 'the population who have got massively richercan easily pay that. But what about low income Australians? The 10 percent of Australians on the lowest incomes in the last decade have seen their incomes decline by 10 per cent in the last 10 years. These are the people who have to bear the brunt of the burden of the increases in' sales tax; the increase in sales tax on wine, if they are wine drinkers; and, indirectly, the increases in taxes such as fringe benefits tax which business simply passes on in the form of higher prices. These measures are highly regressive. The government stands condemned for introducing measures which are so regressive. For the Labor Party to have spent the last 101 years since it was founded rushing around Australia trying to convince people that the Labor Party is the party of the battler and to have come to this parliament with this bunch of bills which are a penalty on low income Australians is one of the cruellest ironies of all. These bills are also job destroying bills. We have. one million unemployed people in Australia. One would think that in this chamber there would be an overwhelming priority to do things to create jobs for those people. One would think that was a logical and overwhelming priority; But is it in these bills? To take the example of the wine industry, these bills increase the tax burden on that export oriented, job creating industry by 55 per cent. How many morejobs will we create in the wine industry if we whack up taxes by 55 per cent? How many more jobs will we create in industry in general in this q>untry if we whack up sales taxes which are-at least in their initial stage-taxes on business, increasing the costs of running businesses and, in tum, making it more expensive for businesses to employ people? How many more export orders will we get in this country, and therefore jobs from exports, by increasing tax on exports? That is what these bills before the House tonight do. The bills are a betrayal; the bills are sive in their effect. They are disproportionately damaging to low income Australians. The bills are job destroying. According to the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures, these bills, plus the fuel excise which is in separate legislation, will basically destroy around 50,000 jobs in this country. I put it. to the House that, if the government had announced before the last election that this package of bills would be introduced were Labor to be re-elected, Labor would have lost the election by a landslide. Why did it not have the decency, the honour and the integrity to tell Australians that this was what it planned· to do after the election? I think that. will perhaps rest as one of the strongest and saddest indictments of the Keating government. In any case, the budget process, as members are well aware and as these bills illustrate only too clearly, has been little more than a shambles. As a result of that, in relation to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the 'following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the - ouse: (1) c()ndemns the Government for including in this Bill a measure which subjects the accrued leave entitlements of Australian workers to retrospective increases in taxation; (2) calls on the Government to abandon its proposal to impose a retrospective increase in taxation on accrued lea'{e lump sums; and (3) is of the opinion that the proposals in the Bill ought to have been put forward as four separate Bills: one dealing with Fringe Benefits Tax, a second dealing with the taxation of accrued leave lump sums, a third dealing with the taxation of Credit Unions, and a fourth dealing with the Medicare threshold"". The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993, which is the only one I can move an amendment to in the context of the way the Labor Party has structured this debate, incorporates a whole range of different measures and imposes a whole range of different taxes. Very soon the coalition will be releasing legal opinion establishing that this bill is regresunconstitutional. In the Senate we will be once again referring this bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I see no reason whatsoever why the parliament. should support a bill which is of doubtful constitutionality. Indeed, in our view, it is unconstitutional. The' government should break this bill up into its component parts so that the question of whether it is constitutional or not may be put beyonq any reasonable doubt. If the government were prepared to do that in relation to this bill.and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2) 1993, then that whole. spectre of a High Court challenge hanging over the budget would simply disappear. Having withdrawn the omnibus tax bill, why the Treasurer has moved to introduce the first two bills in this package of bills which have all the same constitutional faults as the original omnibus tax bill is· beyond me. Why the government would want to do that, I simply cannot understand. If the government is responsible, why not try to make matters simple, clear and beyond controversy? That is what it should do. As I mentioned in my amendment, it should also delete the retrospective elements of the leave tax increase. I urge the government to do that. We shall be moving that amendment in another place where we will actually be allowed to move the amendment more formally. I hope it succeeds in that place. In relation to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3) 1993, we will not have the opportunity to mqve the amendment in. the chamber tonight because of the way the Labor Party has constructed this debate. We regard that as completely undemocratic. The fact is that we will in another place be moving an amendment to break the linkage between the change to the income tax cuts schedules and the passage of the sates tax bills which are part of this package. If the government is committed to changing the schedule for the income tax cuts-it is committed to providing income tax cuts by Christmas-why on earth would it make it difficult for the parliament to approve income tax cuts by Christmas? On this side of the House, we want people to get income tax cuts by Christmas. On this side of the House, we want to make sure the parliament can easily provide those income tax cuts. The government is insincere in its claim that it wants to provide income tax cuts by Ch'ristmas. The way the government is drafting legislation,and the way it has drafted this bill, makes it more difficult-not easierfor the parliament to provide income tax cuts to Australians for Christmas. We will have the amendment incorporated in Hansard here, but we will be moving the amendment in another place to destroy the link between the .passage of this bill, the implementation of these measures and the passage of the sales tax bills. In relation to the sales tax bills, I reiterate the view that we have argued since 19 August this year that we will not be supporting the increases in the sales tax. Again, as we will not be able to move that amendment here today, we will just have to incorporate it in Hansard. We will not be supporting the increase in the sales tax and we will not be supporting the 55 per cent increase in tax on the wine industry. We will be standing in opposition to those things. In doing so, the coalition, and the coalition alone, will be standing up for Australians. There are a lot of political parties nowadays in the parliament of Australia: the Liberal and National parties, the Labor Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats. There is also Senator Harradine. The unequivocal support for the people of Australia comes from the Liberal and National parties. We are the parties opposing the increase in the wine tax, the increase in the sales tax, the retrospective imposition of a higher tax on annual leave and increases in fuel excise. We stand alone in our public opposition to those things. If the government wants a quick passage for its budget-the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say they do-it can do two or three simple things. First, it can break up the two bills in this package which are clearly unconstitutional so that their constitutionality is put . beyond doubt. Secondly, it can recognise that the vast majority of Australians, including the coalition, is opposed to increases in sales tax, ftiel excise and wine tax and the retrospective tax on annual leave. It can delete those measures and still increase spending but reduce the growth in government spending in order to finance the 1112 per cent of revenue that would be affected by those measures being deleted from the budget. If the government takes those common sense steps, its budget will sail through the parliament. Stability will be restored to financial markets, confidence of some kind will be restored to business and, as a country, we will know where we are going as far as the budget is concerned. The debate about. the budget .will be completed tonight or tomorrow if the Prime Minister and the Treasurer take up the challenge that I issue to them tonight. If they make those changes to the budget, we will very happily allow all of the measures to pass through. Both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are going around Australia arguing that coalition members are opposing - he. budget, saying that we are vandals and wreckers and standing in the way of the Labor Party's budget. I want Australians to know-and this will not come as a surprise to them-that the Prime Minister, when he says that, is· not telling the truth. We are not opposing the budget. We' are not trying to block supply. We are simply saying that we will not support in the parliament Ilh per cent of the government's total revenue measures. We will not vote for Ph per cent of the government's reVenue measures, but if it accepts the common sense approach and abandons those silly, regressive, damaging and dishonest measures this budget' will sail through. I believe that that is the obvious and common sense thing for the government to do. Opposition members will not sit quietly on this side of the House and have the Prime Minister in particular, day after day- claiming that we are wrecking his dear, beloved budget or that we are standing in the way of tax cuts by Christmas. 'Tax cuts by Christmas' is the new Labor Party line. Government members do not tell people about the tax increases by Christmas. They do not tell people about the increases in sales tax and fuel excise, the on wine, the retrospective tax on lump sums. They do not tell people that they have abandoned $5 billion worth of income tax cuts. Government members do not tell people any of that, but say that the coalition is standing in the way of tax cuts by Christmas. Opposition members are standing in the way of no such thing. Australians will be guaranteed their tax cuts by Christmas if the Prime Minister and the Treasurer simply have the decency to abandon the most regressive of their proposals, which are incorporated in legislation, as' well as the increase in fuel excise, and if they have the decency to break the link in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3) 1993 between the passage of the worse of these sales tax measures and the income tax cuts. I am sorry that those on this side of the House will not have more time to debate these bills. The previous tax omnibus bill was also guillotined through the parliament and we had very little opportunity to say much about that. I am sorry that we will not be able to move our amendments in this chamber. It just shows how Rafferty'S rules apply here because the Labor Party has complete control of the numbers in the House. But we will move our amendments in the Senate, and I am confident that they will be carried.",66

134,Mr ELLIOTT,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Parramatta) (8.25 p.m.)From listening to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) 'speak in the debate on these taxa_tion bills tonight, we get the impression that opposition members are not going to be obstructionist, that they are all clear in their hearts as they desperately want people to get their tax cuts by Christmas, and they will do everything possible to enable that to occur. Of course, nothing could be further from the - truth. As the honourable member for Mayo well knows, ever since the election in March that the opposition did not believe it could lose it has set out on a course of obtax struction: The opposition has set out to do everything it can to jeopardise economic recovery in Australia, and has basically been determined to create as much uncertainty as possible in the economy and amongst investors in the international community. To this extent, the opposition has used the numbers situation in the Senate to try to advance that cause. Nothing that has been said by the honourable member for Mayo tonight alters that basic fact. Indeed, we even have the suggestion that we are going to go this through another Senate committee referral process in the hope the opposition might be able to continue to delay the implementation of the government's budget measures and, by direct implication, therefore jeopardise the tax cuts that Australians have due to them on 15 November. Unless these deficit reduction measures are passed tonight and then passed by the Senate, the Australian Taxation Office has made it clear that it cannot take the steps to implement the personal tax cut arrangements that are due on 15 November. The tax office has made clear that the administrative arrangements need to be settled by no later than 21 October if the tax cuts are to be forthcoming in the middle of November. No amount of humbug by the opposition can alter those basic tenets. This brings us to the basic point of what these measures are designed to achieve. Why is it important to have a deficit reduction package as part of the 1993 budget, and how crucial is it to economic recovery, economic stability and economic growth? If one looks around the world, it is evident that it is important for Australia to be able to outline a comprehensive deficit reduction plan in the medium term so as to ensure businesses and investors from here and abroad can be confident about Australia's economic position. All around the world, countries are trying to grapple with the deficit problem and how deficits can be brought back into line. There was a major debate in the United States Congress about a package that reduces its deficit to something over three per cent of gross domestic product, and they regard three per cent as a significant achievement. In Australia, by adopting a range of measures in this particular budget, we have a strategy to reduce our deficit to 1.1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That is very important. Why is it very important? The answer is that it provides scope over time to encourage further private sector investment in Australia and therefore sustain the economic recovery so vital to the creation of jobs. They are the issues that really matter. For the honourable member for Mayo, as the shadow Treasurer, to say, 'We will pass the tax cuts, but we do not want to deal with the revenue measures that are contained in the budget', is grossly irresponsible. It goes back to the sort of thing we saw delivered from the opposition in the lead-up to the election and in its performance in government. Indeed, it is a reflection of its policies today. Opposition members no longer believe in the GST, we are told. We do not really know what they believe in any more. There has been no articulation by the honourable member for Mayo of what they believe in any way, shape or form. We do know that opposition members have tried their level best to ensure that a comprehensive deficit reduction plan, as outlined by the government, cannot be put into effect. That view cannot be sustained. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) are perfectly responsible in maintaining that the opposition, by adopting this tactic of obstruction and delay, is only jeopardising the economic recovery, the economic certainty of financial markets and also the budget stability that is needed over the next three to four years. It is worth noting as well what the benefits of getting that deficit reduction plan mean. They mean that the economic growth of 2.6 per cent we have now-the fastest in the OECD-can be sustained. They mean that the short-term stimulus from public sector spending outlined in this budget will gradually be taken up in further years by private sector investment. They mean that we can maintain the low inflationary setting that has been created by the government. They mean that we can maintain the low interest rate regime that applies, and they will give encouragement to economic recovery as well. The alternative to that is to say that it does not matter what happens to interest rates; it does not matter what happens to inflation. Basically, that seems to be where the opposition is coming from on this issue today, and that is clearly unacceptable. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has already pointed out that if there is not some certainty about the budget process then eventually the Reserve Bank could be forced to take action in relation to interest rates. Already, the dollar has lost ground against international currencies because of that uncertainty. Over the last couple of weeks, I was part of a .parliamentary delegation to Germany. In Germany, where there is significant intereSt in trade with Australia, people were talking about this issue: what was going to happen to the budget; :what was the Senate doing; what was the rationale behind it all. There is international concern about a process where it is not clear what sort of policy the opposition actually has. Even more importantly, there is a concern that the signal going out internationally might create doubts in the minds of potential investors or currency markets. That is what we are dealing with here. This is not some political game.of a partisan nature that enables the opposition to refer anything it likes to a Senate committee and then seek further references each time matters go back to the Senate. This is a time to decide whether or not the national interest counts. It is a time for us to decide whether or not economic recovery really. matters. If it does, and if we are genuine about wanting to get both growth and jobs, then getting the budget package passed is important. It should be a priority, not just for the government of the day but for the parliament of the day, if it is genuinely concerned about Australia's future. That is what we are dealing with in the package of bills that has come back before us tonight. The government has formulated a number of important responses to the findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. First of all, it has rejected the notion that the original package, the omnibus bill, was unconstitutional. That has not been tested. The only place where that can be tested is in the High Court. No-one else has the authority to pass judgment on that issue. The government has announced that it is prepared to put forward a test case bill that can be referred to the High Court for adjudication if that is the course that people want to follow. That is not because the government has had any advice to suggest that that is the case; it is a recognition of what the Senate committee has said and to allay those concerns. It does not alter the basic tenet on which the bills before us tonight are based. The opposition is trying to undo the 1993 budget process by adopting a course of action which would inevitably create a situation where people are denied tax cuts-tax cuts that are important because they are part of the ongoing economic stimulus to the economy. Alternatively, the opposition is simply out to create mayhem for mayhem's sake. Neither of those situations constitutes legitimate action on the part of an opposition in a federal parliament-not for a party claiming to have any degree of responsibility in its approach. It is important to recognise that, overall, Australia compares very favourably to other countries as far as taxation is concerned. In the course of the last four or five years, there have been gradual changes to income tax arrangements to bring them into line and make them more competitive with other countries. The government has also fulfilled its commitment to reducing the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Amongst other things, we have introduced dividend imputation. All these measures were designed to make us more internationally competitive. With the opening up of the Australian economy, those measures created more certainty and more opportunities to establish us as an international trading nation. When we talk to people around the world about the issues that matter to a trading nation, they point to things such as stability, a degree of predictability about the political process, and not having this sort. of log jam of Senate obstructionism. From that point of view, Australia has always been regarded as a very safe and secure place. However, over recent years, the opposition has had a desperate desire to talk down economic recovery. It has tried its level best to set a course of action that denies the opportunity for economic recovery and stability to occur. 1 do not believe the people of Australia can allow that to occur. This government has started the trend towards growth-a growth to date of 2.6 per cent.· We started a positive trend in stimulating the economy through the implementation of the One Nation policy and last year's. budget. We have recognised the need to change company tax arrangements by reducing the company tax rate to 33 per cent, and by introducing measures relating to depreciation allowances, investment allowances, and so on. These are all designed to encourage private sector investment. The measures contained in the package before the House tonight add to that position because they bring forward tax cuts for ordinary income earners that were originally promised to come into effect from July next year. They bring them forward by seven months to take effect fromS November because we recognise that they will advance the contribution of households to national economic recovery. These cuts are going to the people of m'iddle Australia and giving them the benefits of tax reform because previous tax cuts have related to either the lower end or the top end of the income scale. It is generally recognised that middle income earners are the. group in line for tax cuts this particular time. Other measures that the opposition is trying to knock over in this House tonight include the $3a week rebate for low income earners. Although the opposition has been asking questions about low income earners, when it is in a position to do something constructive it seeks to jeopardise this measure. The honourable member for Mayo said that the opposition wanted to see personal income tax cuts passed on and.paid before Christmas. If that is what the honourable member wants to ensure, the simple answer is to pass the bills before the House-pass'therri expeditiously-and ensure that his colleagues hi the Senate do not employ the stalling devices that have become part and parcel of Senate processes in recent times: They should get on with the job of getting the budget passed and allowing the community the tax cuts to which they are entitled from the middle of November. I would like to mention some of the other elements of the budget process and what they mean in relation to the deficit reduction plan. In the' 1992 period, because of the sluggish nature of economic circumstances', we recognised the need for public sector stimulus. The govetnment has been attempting to meet that need for the last two years as evidenced by this year's deficit of $16 billion. While that deficit represents only a very small percentage of gross domestie product-about 3.8 per cent-we recognise that public sector borrowing requirements over the next two to three years is something we will need to watch. That is why this package of bills not only deals with measures relating to expenditure but also to revenue. We could not have a taxation deficit reduction bill without being cognisant of those two issues. ' That is what the opposition is saying does not matter. Members of the opposition are basically saying that they do not care about the deficit reduction bill; they think that we can simply have the expenditure side of the budget. The tax measures and revenue measilres which we have introduced are something which they want nothing to do with. It is fine for the opposition to take that approach but what should be borne in mind is that this is the same opposition that went to the polls last March saying that there should be cuts of over $10 billion in outlays to the community. The opposition was going to wreak havoc on, the community at large. It was going to take steps to ensure that many of the ordinary services that people need and deserve would be devastated by its approach. Now it is saying that the deficit reduction package that the government has introduced-a responsible and sustainable measure-should not be applied. ' This package of bills is crucial. It is important because it allows the government to give effect to both the revenue and expenditure side of the budget. In addition, because the question of constitutionality has been raised in the Senate, there should be an opportunity for a couple of the measures to be the subject of a' test case, if that is what is desired. We have heard all the nonsense from the oppositi()n about obtaining legal opinion after legal opinion, which it claims demonstrates and proves-those were the words used-the unconstitutionality' of the package of bills previously introduced by the Treasurer. Here is the opportunity .to have the matter tested,. All the advice that the government has received suggests that it is a highly debatable point. The committee made two basic points about the potential invalidity of the bills. The first is that any increase in the formal rate of tax is an imposition of tax. This view draws an illogical conclusion between a rate increase and an enlargement of a tax base. The second point is that any increase in liability to taxation is an imposition of tax. If this argument is accepted, then most of the tax laws passed in the last 50 years are also invalid. It is not accepted that the strategy and the opinion that the opposition has kept on advancing has been applicable to processes followed not just by this government but by the previous· government in the way it has introduced and processed tax measures. But we are told that it has somehow changed dramatically as a result of the 1993 budget. The opposition claims to have further legal opinion to demonstrate the invalidity and illegality of these measures. If that is the case, the opposition can use Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2) to test those elements. That is why the Treasurer has implemented that strategy. It has been done in such a way that it does not upset the fundamental integrity of what is required in getting the budget through, getting the deficit reduction strategy adopted and restoring certainty to the Australian community about the 1993 budget. It is not healthy to have a situation created where people llll over the world are not sure whether or riot the 1993 budget is valid. When we look at the statistics as to what the deficit .reduction plan actually means to the Australian .economy, we find that people connected with economic advice around the world say, . 'We would love to get to a situation where our budget deficit is one per cent of GDP·. Most countries say that they do not have a hope in Hades of achieving that result. 1I have referred to the example with regard to the United States. We have provided short-tenn fiscal stimulus to the economy through the 1993 budget, and we also have a comprehensive medium-tenn strategy that outlines measures on the revenue side to get the deficit reduction down to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We have a comprehensive strategy which outlines a mechanism to ensure that economic growth can be sustained, firstly, through public sector investment and then increasingly through the private sector investment. We have a competitive tax· regime in both the company and personal income tax areas. Our economic growth is faster than anywhere else in the world. We have the lowest inflation rate for 20 years, together with the lowest interest rates for over 20 years. We have a sustainable low inflation outlook, unlike some European countries that are quite worried about inflation taking off, notwithstanding their recessionary conditions and deficits. We are not in that situation. Australia is in a situation where it can mOve forward as an internationally competitive trading nation and create both the economic activity and, in tum, the jobs that are vital to get Australians over their difficulties. We have had a very painful recession. What is the opposition's approach to that comprehensive strategy? It says, 'We will try to create as .much difficulty and uncertainty as we can about the 1993 budget'. What are the matters of principle on which the opposition takes that action? It does not have any matters of principle. The opposition has an opinion of some description which says that some of these tax measures might be unconstitutional because of the way in w-ich they have been packaged. The bills before the House tonight remove that uncertainty. The opposition has its chance to pass the bills and to test the measures that the Treasurer has provided in Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2). As a result, everyone can be clear that the convention and practice that has been followed in the way many of these ipdirect tax revenue arrangements have been worked out over a long period of time-not just in the 1993 budgetcan be given effect. Thus, we can have an end to this spectacle of doubt being created around the world about the budget. It is important that we recognise the priority that should be given to this matter. The Senate should not continue to be obstructionist. It is high time that the opposition worked in . the national interest rather than in some partisan political interest, because what We need is. sustainable and stable economic recovery. That should be. the objective of everyone in the parliament. I am sure it is the objective of the people of Australia ..",70
135,Mr WILLIAMS,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"Tangney) (8.45 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, you have given me the call as the member for Tangney. The seat is named after Dame Dorothy Tangney. I take the opportunity to note quickly three anniversaries relating to her parliamentary career. The 50th anniversary of her first election to the Senate, as the first woman member, was on 21 August. The 50th anniversary of her first sitting in the Senate was on 23 September-last Thursday. The 50th anniversary of her inaugural speech was 24 September-last Friday. I turn to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) anQ cognate bills, the subject of this unjustifiably foreshortened debate. This debate is occurring because the government sought to play politicS with the constitution and got caught out. The government's problems arise out of section 55 of the constitution, an important provision relevant to revenue measures. Section 55 provides in effect that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation. The section also provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal with one subject of taxation only. The section treats each of customs duties and excise duties in effect as one subject. The reason for the existence of section 55 is to be found in section 53. This provides that a proposed law imposing taxation shall not originate in the Senate. Under the section, the Senate may not amend a proposed law imposing taxation. Section 55 provides protection to - he Senate in light of the restrictions in section 53. This House is prevented from tacking extraneous provisions to laws imposing taxation which the Senate may not amend. Section 55 also prevents this House from sending to the Senate a bill for the imposition of taxation in respect of a number of unrelated subjects when the Senate would, by virtue of section 53, be unable to amend the bill by approving some provisions and rejecting others. '. . Those. provisions set out a carefully constructed arrangement designed to ensure that each proposal for the imposition of taxation can be considered independently. They provide in relation to the arrangement protection of the .Senate against this House and protection of both this House and the Senate against the executive. It is consistent with that constitutional arrangement that the parliamentary practice has developed of enacting a tax act separately from an assessment act. The tax act imposes taxation and is, therefore, subject to the requirements of sections 53 and 55. The assessment act provides for assessment and collection of taxation and, therefore, deals with taxation. But it does not impose taxation and, accordingly, is not subject to the requirements of the sections. What the government first sought· to do with its original bill was not consistept with past practice or with constitutional arrangements, In the omnibus bill it contemplated, among a range of proposals, by clause 12 increasing the rate of tax under the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986; by clauses 70, 71' and 72 increasing the rate of tax lll1der the Income Tax Rates Act 1986; and by clause 85 increasing levies under the Medicare Levy Act 1986. Fringe benefits tax, income tax and the Medicare levy are plainly different subjects of taxation. If these proposed, clauses would impose taxation, the bill would breach section 55 of the constitution. . In introducing the original bill, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) offered no reason for the omnibus treatment. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) insisted that the bill was a package which had to be accepted or rejected as a whole-the Senate could not 'cherry pick'. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) confidently asserted on 23 August 1993 that there was no constitutional difficulty with the bill. In the Senate, with refreshing frankness, Senator Gareth Evans eventually stated on 1 September 1993 that the bill was a 'new precedent that is being created to bring together revenue measures of this kind in a particular way'. A,preCedent has certainly been set, but it is not the one that Senator Gareth Evans referred to. We all know what happened. After the bill was guillotined through this House, the Senate on 31 August 1993 referred the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee received a number of legal opinions and heard from witnesses including a number of lawyers. The committee reported on 20 September. The day before that the Attorney-General stated that he was 'perfectly confident' that the bill was constitutional. In its report the committee concluded that the bill dealt with matters other than the imposition of taxation. The eight members of the committee, including four government members, unanimously took the view that 'there is a real risk which is significant that the High Court wouid' find the bill, if enacted, to be a law imposing taxation within' the meaning Of section 55 of the Constitution'. The committee' had before it written opinions of lawyers, including leading constitutional lawyers. They included Dr Colin Howard, now a barrister but formerly Hearn Professor 'of' Law at Melbourne University and a respected constitutional writer. Another opinion was from Mr David Jackson QC, a leader of the New South Wales and Queensland bars, a former Federal Court judge, and former chairman of the Constitutional Commission's Advisory Committee on the Australian Judicial System. Another was from Mr Stephen Charles QC, a leading Melbourne silk who is regularly briefed by the Commonwealth and its agencies. Each offered the view that the bill was unconstitutional. On the other side an opinion of Mr Denis Rose QC, Chief General ,Counsel, in the Office of General Counsel in the AttorneyGen,eral's Department, concluded that the bill was valid. Mr Rose was not asked to advise on the bill before it was introduced. The Treasurer's response to the committee report was rather unusual. He made grossly unfair imputations about the motives of the lawyers who had offered advice that the bill was unconstitutional. He also released a few well-chosen comments on the government members on the Senate committee. While maintaining the government position that the original bill was constitutional, the Treasurer did acknowledge that doubts about its legality had been raised. He announced on 21 September that the original bill would be divided into the eight bills currently under consideration. One ,of the new bills is the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2) 1993 which is I referred to by the Treasurer as a test bill. This proposes to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax and to increase the rate of income tax on life insurance business conducted by friendly societies. As the government plainly intends, this appears to raise exactly the same question as to constitutional validity in relation to section 55 of the Constitution as the original bill did. ' Another of the' new bills, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993 is of particular interest. This provides for a new type of fringe benefit and imposes a tax on it in much the same way as se-tion 5 of the Fringe, Benefits Tax Act 1986 first imposed FBT., It also increases the rate of tax payable by credit unions. Although not acknowledged by the Treasurer, it appears to be in exactly the same situation as both the No.2 bill and the original bill in so fa,r as section 55 of the constitution is concerned. It also deals with other matters including amendments to deny income tax deductions to certain non-employees for car parking expenses and to effect amendments relating to payments in lieu of annual leave or long service leave. If the bill imposes taxation it contravenes section 55 in dealing with other matters so that the other matters would be of no effect. In the light of that it appears that there is not just one' test bill, but two test bills, and one of the teSt bills raises two different 'questions. ' The coalition has received formal legal advice that the new No. 1 bill and the No.2 bill are both in breach of section 55 of the cOlll?titution. On that basis it would be entirely appropriate, as proposed, for the Senate to refer those two bills to the Semite Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to consider their constitutional validity. The Treasurer has been quick to point out that in relation to the test bill there is time for the bill to be challenged before the High Court before most of its provisions come into operation on 1 April 1994. The government did not identify the new No. 1 bill as at constitutional risk. It has, therefore, not made any similar comment in relation to that bill. In fact, significant provisions of that bill come into operation earlier than 1 April 1994, including some provisions which apply from 1 July 1993. If the bill is unconstitutional it will presumably not be declared by the High Court to be invalid for some months after enactment. This would give rise to a great deal of uncertainty and confusion and, almost certainly, cost for taxpayers. The issue on whicn the legal opinions differ is not easily discussed in a truncated debate like this. It would do a disservice to the authors of the legal opinions to summarise the arguments to the extent necessary to refer to them in this debate. It is enough to say that the government view is put as a matter of form supported by authority. Those arguing the case for invalidity point to the substance and not the form and argue that the cases relied on by the government are not authority for the government's proposition. As between substance and form, I know where, I would want to rest my case. It is a sorry day when the government sees fit to embark on a precedent-setting, constitutionally risky exercise in relation to major revenue measures without first undertaking a careful examination of what is proposed to ensure that it is legal.",74
136,Mr HICKS,SALES TAX ASSESSMENT,"There is a sense of deja vu in speaking on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) and cognate bills as part of the budget mark 3 because 10 years ago, on 25 August 1983, as the member representing the Riverina and speaking on the budget I rose in this House and said: It is impossible to believe the lack of understanding of the Government in its decision to introduce an excise tax on fortified wines. That statement followed the rural policy speech of the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in Griffith on 20 February 1983, who said: Labor has pledged not to impose a sales tax or an excise tax on wine. We will seek cooperation of the states to facilitate the establishment of grower regional councils. The Labor Government will examine the special problems faced by cooperative wineries and supplying growers. We now find ourselves back in the House with the government applying yet another tax on wine. Since those days in 1983 the wine industry has gone from strength to strength, not because of the taxes imposed by the government but because the wine industry has pushed along, despite the government, and become a major export industry, of which I am sure every Australian is very proud. Under these deficit reduction bills the government proposes increasing the present wine excise from 20 per cent to 31 per cent; in other words; an increase of 55 per cent. The government has caved into the pressure groups who say that wine should be taxed the same as beer and other spirits. But we all know that wine is not produced in the same way as spirits or beer. Wine is produced from a vintage crop that is produced only once a year and, therefore, should be treated differently. Why would the government increase taxes on one of the few industries that is providing such strong growth? Strangely, when the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was asked about it, an AAP report quoted him thus: Federal Treasurer John Dawkins today described the sharp rise in the wine wholesale sales tax as an incentive for Australian wine makers. That is like the joke of putting a grasshopper on one's hands, ""taking the legs off and saying, 'Jump', but it does not jump so one says, 'He's deaf'. The Treasurer told ABC radio, 'This won't hold back the wine industry'. I do not know where the Treasurer gets his information, but this increase in the wine excise will certainly hold back the wine industry, and"" if I had more time. I would say more about that. The increase will have a dramatic effect in my electorate of Riverina. We have some famous wineries in my electorate, such as de Bortoli's. A lot of these wineries produce export wine which is known throughout the world for its quality and consistency. Some examples are MCWilliams Wines,"" Orlando Wines, Toorak Wines, Wilton Estate wiiles, Lillypilly wines from Leeton, Cranswick Estate, Miranda Wines, Rossetto Wines, West End wines and Riverina Wines.",77

159,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Burke-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport arid Communications) (9.55 p.m.)-J move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill amends four acts administered within the transport and communications portfolio. Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a finetuning and clarifipenalties cation of provisions. The amendments do not introduce substantial new policy schemes. J will refer in tum to each of the acts being amended. Amendments of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 The amendment to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 will insert a new subsection 92(la) into the act which will allow Australia Post to operate a national change address scheme. The amendments are proposed following concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances that exemptions to the secrecy provisions under regulation 20 of the Australian Postal Corporation regulations be included in primary legislation rather than delegated legislation. The bill will enable a customer's name and address to be disclosed where the customer consents in writing to the disclosure of their new address to a· person or organisation or class of organisation covered by the customer's consent. Australia Post is subject to the information privacy principles under the Privacy Act 1988. Accordingly, any information obtained by Australia Post as a consequence of the scheme must be handled in accordance with information privacy principles. Breaches of the disclosure provisions will be subject to section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, that imposes a penalty of up to two to. years iniprisonme-t for Australia Post employees or contractors who breach their duty not to disclose information. A review of information disclosure for law enforcement purposes is being undertaken in consultation with federal, state and territory agencies. It is proposed, subject to the government's overall legislative priorities, to bring forward further amendments to section 92 in the budget sittings. Amendme'nts of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 The amendments to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act will correct some minor drafting errors in relation to the term 'road vehicle'. As well, in accordance with recent amendments to the Crimes Act, all monetary will be expressed in te- of penalty units. One penalty unit is currently valued at $100. Future amendments of the Crimes Act will increase the value of a penalty unit so that the penalties will reflect variations in current money values. The Motor Vehicle Standards Act is also being amended to provide for a penalty where conditions to import a non-standard vehiCle are breached. Typical conditions which may of be determined by the minister are, in the case of a vehicle imported for wrecking, that the vehicle will be dismantled or, in the case of a vehicle that is to .be used for transport in Australia, that the vehicle will be. made standard before it is supplied to the market. Amendments of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 The bill provides for amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 which came into effect on 1 July 1993. The act replaces the Radiocommunications Act 1983 and provides for the implementation of government decisions for spectrum management refonn. The amendments are to correct a number of minor errors, such as typographical errors and incorrect references, in the 1992 act. As well, there are some amendments designed to overcome minor inconsistencies in the act. . . Amendments of the Telecommunications The amendment to section 209 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 makes it clear that Austel, the Australian Telecommunications Authority, can include conditions relating to law enforcement in class licences regulating supply of eligible services. The conditions provided for in the amendment relate in particular to requirements for suppliers of eligible services to consult with law enforcement agencies about new telecommunications technologies and to assist agencies in carrying out their law enforcement responsibilities. The provisions reflect similar conditions imposed on the licences of the three telecommunications carriers. The measures contained in this bill are expected to have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1993-94 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 September, on motion by Mr Dawkins: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Wooldridge had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes: (1) the likelihood of foreshadowed amendments to the Budget; (2) the vacillations and confusion about the Budget; (3) the pernicious impact on low income Australians; (4) the failure to reduce unemployment; and (5) the continuing abrogation of responsibilities towards the long-term unemployed"".",86
160,Mr ATKINSON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Six weeks have passed since the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) brought down the budget. We are up to mark 3, and we are probably headed for mark 4. A number of discussions have taken place on where this budget is headed and on Act 1991 some of the implications for industries, particularly the wine industry. I want to look at employment in this country, and at the way that small businesses have been dealt with by this government. I draw the attentiol). of those honourable members who in the last couple of weeks have forgotten them to the first words that the Treasurer said when he introduced the budget to this House. He said: The greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. Too many are now out of work. Too many have been out of work for too long. The primary objective of this budget is jobs. He continued on to talk about jobs in the short, medium and long tenn. I would have thought on that basis that we would have seen a budget that was in the interest of Australian companies and Australian manufacturers. That is an area, in particular, in which I believe we can help to employ a substantial part of the unemployed group in our community if it is handled correctly in the policy mix that this government puts together. The latest issue of t4e Manufacturer$' Bulletin of the Chamber of Manufactures in New South Wales says: Almost 30,000 job opportunities Australia-wide will be lost as a result of increases in wholesale sales tax announced in the Federal Budget, according to the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. Using its model of the Australian economy, the National Institute for Economic and Industry Research estimates that 3,000 job opportunities will go in the first year for every $100 million of extra sales tax revenue raised by the Government. Within five to seven years a total of 5,200 job opportunities will disappear for every $100 million of extra sales tax revenue. With the Government expecting to raise approximately $1 billion in sales tax this financial year, about 52,000 fewer jobs have been created by the year 2,000. That area concerns me a great deal, but I want to move to the overall attitudes and ways that this government has tried to talk about its interest in development. It is interesting to see that the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) is at the table. He released yesterday a report entitled, Australia: your business location in Asia, which revealed that the Australian government encouraged Cathay Pacific to move a key telecommunication hub and data centre to Australia by waiving the sales tax. I think that is fairly significant.. I would like to look at a small industry that involves Australians working in small companies. Page 4.16 of the budget statements looks at the issue of microbrewers, and says: This change will mean that establishments known as 'micro breweries' which provide individual brewing facilities for consumers to brew their own beer, will be required to account for duty on beer produced on their premises. I find that fascinating. I have received a letter from Brew Kettle in Carnegie in Victoria, which states: Customs indicated to the investors in the stores they would not be subject to tax as commercial beer was not produced. A letter from the Amateur Brew on Premises Association of Australia, from Blackwood in South Australia, states: We understand that those who would like to see us out of business have consulted with the Customs Office regarding this legislation. As we have not had the luxury of consultation, we believe that only a thorough review of the enclosed information will ensure that a balanced argument is heard. Perhaps because it was a small item in the budget, they told me that at no stage had they been consulted by the minister or the department. One particular business is close to my electorate. In fact, one of the people involved lives in my electorate. Small Australian investors put up collectively $350,000 to get' this business running. This person was going to employ Australians to provide beer at a cheap price that was manufactured on their premises. In the process of setting up that business, they decided to do the right thing and talk to the Australian Customs Service. This afternoon I received a copy of the letter that they will got back from the Australian Customs Service, which states: In response to your fax and our earlier telephone conversation, I am able to advise that the Beer Brewing Hobby shop you intend to establish will not require licensing from the Australian Customs Service. Premises need to be licensed under the Excise Act when they are used to manufacture an excisable product. Beer produced for non-commercial purposes is not excisable under the Excise Tariff Act. I point out again that the $350,000 was invested by the people in this venture. I find this process fascinating in that approximately a week after the budget was brought downnot before-when these people were concerned about the quote that I made earlier about the budget, the minister's staff asked those in this industry to send him information on what they do and details of the Canadian industry. Where did he find out about the Canadian industry? Secondly, why, one week after the budget was brought down, was the minister seeking information to this effect? It gets even worse. On Friday of last week, the minister's staff visited the business in Melbourne to talk about what they did. This is the that industry that the government decided in the budget to introduce an excise on. The people who run this business were advised by the minister's staff that the matter would be taken to a caucus committee, probably on Monday of this week, and discussed. Why did Customs not believe that the business required licensing? I have read the quote; I have the letter. It clearly made that comment when these people went to look at establishing the business. If the minister had to send his staff down in the last week to find out what this business did in detail, why at page 4.16 of the budget do we have a section that talks about applying an excise to this particular industry? We are. talking about a very new, small industry in this country. We are talking about an industry that has four shops, not hundreds. There is one in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Newcastle. What do those shops do? I will try, for the record, to get some of the details out in the open. A' brew on premises operation provides a service where conSumers can brew and bottle beer for their own consumption. Customers choose the particular recipe that suits them; they purchase the ingredients; they rent the equipment on site; and control their own brew from the start to the finish. The question arises: do they actually manufacture beer? Beer is brewed on the premises but the customer physically makes his own beer from start to finish. According to the budget statement, beer brewed at home for personal consumption will remain exempt from excise duty. Beer brewed by amateurs at a brew on premises shop, which is made by customers and is for their· own personal consumption, will not be exempt. The excise on this particular industry will cause dramatic problems for the people who have established these businesses-in many instances investing their life savings to do so-and will also affect the customers by making the beer they like more expensive. It is important to look at the growth that was expected in this industry over the next six years. In 1993 there were four shops producing 460,800 Htres of beer. In 1994 that was expected to expand. to seven shops; in 1995, to 14; in 1996, to 43; and in 1997, to 115. In 1998---:one would expect anY industry trying to get itself up and operating to make these sorts of projections-there was exPected to be 150 operations establis1:led throughout Australia. On the basis of 150 shops being established over a period of six years, the brew on. premises operation .expected to generate approximately $187 million in turnover-a not insignificant amount. It also expected to establish 750 jobs for Australians in Australia. One obvious question is whether this type of operation would cause problems for the commercial brewing industry.. I suspect that has been an area of concern for some people. The answer is that it will have little effect the commercial industry. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, the total commercial production for 1991-92 was 1,862,304,000 litres. Assuming no growth or even decline over the next six years, that equates to 11, 173,OOO,000-plus liires of beer. The total brew on premises production estimated over that six years is 36 million litres. That represents between half and one per cent of the estimated commercial productioq.. It should be noted that this percentage assumes that all brew on premises production will displace commercial production. Realistically, 30 per cent of the brew on premises production will come from current home brewers, 20 per cent from imported beer drinkers, 10 per cent from new beer drinkers, and only 40 per cent of customers will be attracted from commercial operations. So only about a quarter of one per cent or less than a quarter of one per cent-0.14 per cent - of the (;ommercial brewing industry turnover would be affected by the expansion of this new industry.. We should take note of the revenue expected to be generated by this taxation measure. From the figures provided by the brew on premises people, it is estimated that over the next six years there will be $187,913,100 in turnover. It is estimated that the excise on that amount would be in the order of $8,530,699. We .need to be clear about the· effect that would have on the industry. It would virtually prevent it from getting off the ground. It is estimated that the direct tax revenue from this operation through ,employee income tax contributions and wholesale sales taxwholesale sales tax will still be paid as part of this operation-will be $11,409,084. Without the imposition of the proposed excise, this industry would develop and create 750 jobs and the country would gain tax revenue in excess of $11 million. But what have we done? In effect, we have said to this industry, on very questionable grounds, that we really do not want it around. Some people might query that comment. I direct them to page 4.6 and table 3 of the budget papers where the income expected to on be generated as a result of this measure is set out. For 1993-94, the revenue expected to be achieved from micro-brewers is zero; for 1994-95, revenue expected to be received, zero; for 1995-96, revem.·- expected to be achieved by these taxes, zero; for 1996-97, revenue expected to be achieved by this government, zero. In fact, according to the budget papers, for every year that this particular item appears, zero tax is expected to be collected. , . , Anyone reading the Treasurer's budget statement would think that he was trying, to create jobs aQd opportunities for Australians to get work. I remi,nd the Treasurer that this particular industry does not require especially skilled people. lIere is an opportunity Jor us to give jobs to average Australians who might not have the qualities to enable them to become engineers or engage in some other very skilled occupation. Even after one of its own departments advised this industry that it would not be hit with taxes, the government has chosen to make this entry in the budget papers. Yet, at the end of the day, when the revenue to be raised is calculated, the government can expect to get absolutely zero. I want to say something now about an industry where problems will arise because of increaseS in the fuel excise. There is a petrol station in my electorate which takes about 10 tanker loads of fuel a month. If we average out the 5c excise increase on unleaded petrol and the 8c increase on leaded petrol excise at 7c a litre, because there are more cars using leaded fuel than not at the moment, then over the next two years that service station is looking at a tax hike per tanker load of 40,000 litres multiplied by 7c, which is $2,800. With 10 tankers a month, that is $28,000 of additional tax. Petrol stations pay cash for their petrol. What we should remember is that 50 per cent of. station customers are account customers with 30-day accounts. There is 30 days in which they can buy fuel, and 30 days before they have to pay for it. That means that $28,000 in additional cash flow has to be found by that business. In fact, most people do not even pay on a 30-day account basis; it is more like 60 days in the climate of this recession that we had to have. That means that this particular business could be up for a $42,000 cash outlay in order to keep going. I am talking about small Australian businesses. We must remember that they are operated by Australian people. I aSk the government to think about giving sales tax,benefits to seas businesses, such as Cathay Pacific(Tzme expired)  p.m.)-I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94. In the current world climate, any Treasurer bringing down a budget is going to have a difficult time. If we look at the Western economies of the world, we see the blight of the world as being unemployment. However, despite our difficulties, everybody recognises that we are doing better than all other Western economies. The budget predicts a growth rate of one per cent in jobs-not fast enough to pull down in appreciable terms the pool of unemployment, but still better than other Western economies are doing. We have a predicted growth rate of 2.75 per cent in the size of the economy-again, not as fast as we need, not as fast as we would want to see, but faster than any other Western economy in the world. Everybody in this chamber recognises that there are not any magic solutions; there are not any magic wands to wave that are suddenly going to repair the 'Oifficulties that are faced by all Western economies. But, if we are going to increase the level of growth in this economy, and if we are going to increase the opportunity for employment, then we have to help our businesses to grow; help them to expand; help them to make a' greater contribution to replacing imports; and help with the identification and generation of new businesses. That is the only way that we are going to create the jobs that we need. So we need to identify and grasp new opportunities. I am going to refer to' some matters that go to that objective. At the same time as we face the difficulty of falling commodity prices for our major exports, we do have the offset of the corresponding fall in the value of the dollar. That helps with our exports and with import replacement, in that it makes domestically produced products more attractive. I would like to dwell on the positive side of the budget, as contrasted with the negative side as put by those opposite. The budget provisions create a - etter climate for growth. The bringing forward of the taxation cuts of over- $2 billion to mid-November-previously scheduled for 1 July next year-will provide . a decided impetus to the budget. In 1983 the company tax rate was 49c in the dollar. Under this budget we have a further cut from 39c in the dollar to 33c in the dollar. The new company tax rate, the general investment allowances to boost investment in plant, the extension of the developmental allowance, and the earlier accelerated depreciation allowances in previous budgets are all components that help to generate greater investment in business, and generate the growth that we need. Some years ago this government abolished double taxation of dividends and that has been of enormous assistance to incorporated businesses. That initiative has not been recognised, and has perhaps been studiously avoided by those opposite and by .those who benefit. That measure alone cost some $300 million in the first year. The purpose of that measure was to encourage Australians to invest in Australian business, to encourage Australian business to incorporate, and to overcome the heavy burden of tax on company profits which were further taxed, by way of personal income tax, when they were distributed to shareholders. To that climate we must add the considerable improvement in labour productivity over the years, the considerable reduction in real labour costs and the fact that we are now experiencing the lowest interest rates for 20 years and the lowest inflation rates for 30 years. The result is a climate shaped to generate investment in corporate Australia, and to help businesses grow and seek out new opportunities. Let me identify some of the packages and operations that have been devised to stimulate business. We have a $94 million package to give local firms better access to export opportunities. I refer here to the market Australia campaign, the range of improved export programs and the first-stop shops. Under the market Australia campaign some $21 million has been provided over the next three years to promote Australia externally as a high quality manufacturer. We have shaken off the old idea in this country that 'if it is imported, it is better'. We have to convince markets abroad that, if it is made in Australia, it is good, it is reliable and it is quality; The market Australia campaign over the next three years will help create an image of Australian products . b-ing quality products, of being consistently reliable, and of prices being much more competitive. I tum next to the international trade enhancement .scheme. That scheme provides financial support for the expansion and acceleration of export marketing activities to help potential exporters. Over the next two years we are going to provide a further $26 million to some 15 to 20 identified medium to small exporters who do not have access to the present scheme because they cannot demonstrate the likelihood of generating a $20 million sale in foreign exchange over the next five years. This extra $26 million will help identify those 15 to 20 firms that do not presently benefit. It is expected that some $500 miIJion in export income will be generated over the five life years of each project. I move on to the establishment of the online computer service called Business Link. One of the major problems of small to medium businesses in Australia is that they do not know what help is available, from what government, for what purpose, or who to contact to get that help. Business Link will go some way towards providing that information about government programs, about government services and even about potential export markets. The government is providing $7.9 million for that purpose over three years. I want to move to a very important service, the National Industry Extension ServiceNIBS. Under NIES there is going to be an extra $12 million of funding available over the next three years. That funding will enable smaller firms to get greater assistance to improve their market opportunities both locally and overseas, to enable them to adopt best practice and to enable them to meet export requirements. It is clear that industry associations are going to have to play an important part in that objective. Linked to that will be an extension of export-access. Export access is a trade facilitation and enterprise development program for small and medium exporters, and it will receive an extra $8 million over the next three years. That extra $8 million will enable a further 800 companies to develop export potential. We find over and over again that small to medium businesses in Australia have a product, they know they can make it, but they do not have access to, or do not know how to go about searching out, a market even in other parts of regional Australia. Those businesses do not know how to go about getting government assistance for product improvement. They do not know who to see. We often find in the Hunter and the Central Coast that there are firms that have by-law exemption from customs duty, but because they do not have access to advice they are paying the duty. They do not know what they ought to be doing. I can go to· no better authority than Bert Evans, the chief executive of the Metal Trades Industry Associatiori, the most effective arid forward looking of the industry associations in Australia. Bert Evans spoke at the Queensland branch annual dinner recently, and he said: Governments can provide the operating infrastructure for manufacturers, but only company managements and their wodd'orces can deliver the goods. You and I know that managements and people on the shopfloor do not spontaneously move oneas to adopt new Goverriment incentives. They do not automatically seize the opportunities provided by government policies which give access to a better financial or marketing environment. The reason is, that they need leadership. He went on to say: ""The key issue, both for individual firms and for the nation overall, is that of leadership-having .vision and commitment to tum . . . opportunities into reality"". In that last paragraph he is quoting from the MCKinsey and Co. report that was released earlier this year. But Me Evans makes the very valid point that those of us who move around industry know only too well: no matter how good the product is, no matter how good the marketing may be and no inatter how good or enthusiastic people working on the shop floor may be, leadership and enthusiasm have to come from top management. If we have stultified top or middle management, this country will not get the benefit it is entitled to get from the available programs and from those companies that could be doing more for Australia but are not doing more because that leadership - is not there. I want to tum briefly to what is happening in our regions. I am talking here of extending some of those programs I have referred to and of the effect they c.an have in regions like the Hunter, the Central Coast and other parts of regional Australia. Contrary to the view put in the Industry Commission report released a few days ago, regional Australia has a major impediment to growth and opportunity. That major impediment is the fact that corporate Australia does not see beyond the boardrooms of the capital cities. For so many corporations, the world begins and ends in Melbourne and Sydney. They do not recognise the Hunter. They do not recognise the Central Coast. They do not think about the: Latrobe Valley. They do not think about all oUhe other regions that exist in this country where there is a stable work force, good training facilities, lower commercial rents, lower housing costs, a more attractive . environment and where there are people of talent and skill who are very committed to making theiJ: work a success and helping to make company operations a success. The major impediment to growth in those regions is not the fault of government in most cases. It is almost always the failure of Australian corporations to look beyond the environments of the capital cities. So in those programs we need to see the corporations the looking to take up the opportunities and utilise and build upon the benefits in the regions of Australia. In the case of the regional tourism development referred to in the budget, an amount of $5.5 million is allocated under Tourism Australia. That program is designed to help with the development of regional tourism by improving and helping the capacity of regional areas to attract both international and domestic tourists. Those grants will help in the area of integrated regional planning and in the provision of tourism infrastructure. Under the same Tourism Australia heading there is the provision of $2.7 million to provide funding for the cooperative marketing of backpacker accommodation, assistance in the development of farm based tourism, the development of a cruise shipping strategy to encourage greater use of Australia as a cruise destination and a base port for cruise ships, and the international promotion of Australia as a cruise shipping destination. We want to see the cooperative marketing of backpacker accommodation. Again, the regions of Australia have so much to offer to backpacker tourists coming to this country. For example, there are the low accommodation costs, there is so much to see and there is the advantage of being able to move around more cheaply. They can see a part of Australia ,they will not see walking the main streets of the capital cities. In respect of cruise ship operations, a port such as Newcastle lends itself ideally to the development of cruise operations based out of that port, bringing people in and taking people out. But all of the cruise ship operations essentially are centred on Sydney, with some on the north Barrier Reef. Using ports other than those I have referred to provides an opportunity to open up the regional hinterlands to tourists. Cruise shipping and that $2.7 million allocated under Tourism Australia can provide opportunities for benefits to be developed in the Hunter and the Central Coast whose economies are intertwined. I tum now to something else in respect of the people side of the budget. One of the great problems of people who are unemployed is that when they get the opportunity for short-term work they face the sheer hassle of taking that work. Getting a resumption of their jobsearch or newstart allowance is difficult, there is bureaucratic involvement and errors can take place. When people are living hard and trying to get by on support during periods of unemployment, their family budget cannot withstand the kinds of interruptions that can happen when they take shortterm work. When that short-term employment is difficult to take up and the income interrupnance, tion is more than the family can stand, it is often so easy just to not get involved. If they do not get involved and they do not grasp the opportunity then they also miss out on the opportunity of what could be continuing employment. So from 20 March 1994, the unused income test free area can be accumulated. In other words, up to $500 will be able to be accumulated to be offset as an additional free area against future income from employment by jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance recipients. That $10.5 million provided in the budget will help those people to grab the chance of getting some short-term work and staying on in the work force, even if it is only for a short time. It will give them the chance to keep touch with the work force and maintain and utilise some of their skills. We expect that some 26,000 people will benefit from that provision in the budget. Similarly, in the case of the long-term unemployed and mature age unemployed, we are addressing the problem of people over the age of 60 who have been registered as unemployed for more than 12 months and who have been in receipt of income support for more than 12 months. We are providing them with the opportunity to take up a mature age allowance-to transfer to a more generous allowance than they are already receiving under newstart, with no activity test requirements. It is estimated that 26,000 people will benefit from the introduction of the mature age allowance. That, again, is a recognition of the problems of the people in that age group and the difficulties of the long-term unemployed in gaining employment. In that higher age group we also have the seniors health card. There is the provision of $800,000 in the budget for the introduction of the seniors health card from 1 July 1994 for people of pension age and veterans of service pension age whose incomes, as assessed under the pension income test, are below the pension cut-out point. That card will provide access for those people to concessional pharmaceuticals, free hearing aids and concessional services for hearing aid mainteand access to ,the Commonwealth dental program for health card holders. The first stage of the emergency dental scheme will commence on 1 January 1994, and then there will be a broader dental health care service on 1 July 1994. Optometry services will also become available for those people under Medicare. Again, we are looking to those people in the community who have found things difficult, particularly when employment opportunities are harder to come by. A budget measure also addresses instances where people are receiving incomes that are below· the pension cut-out point. Through those last few measures I have referred to, I am trying to show that the government, through the budget, is moving to try to stimulate business, create greater business growth, create opportunities for business to get under way. and expand markets, and create opportunities for new businesses to form and to identify new opportunities to generate the jobs that will be the only solution to the problems that the Western world is facing. Following on from that is how we assist those who are unemployed-those who have been able to get some short-term work and those mature age people who have not been able to get work for over 12 months or who have been in receipt of income support for over 12 months. For years and years, I know that honourable members on both sides of this chamber have had representations from people for the provision of dental health care. The provision of $19.2 million in this budget goes to the introduction of emergency dental care and basic dental services. Under this arrangement, funds will be provided to the states to enable the expansion of service capacity within their existing dental programs covering health care card holders. There is provision in. that arrangement for private dentists to participate, but that is something that the states will have to decide themselves. The emergency dental scheme will be introduced on 1 January 1994 and the broader dental scheme that I referred to for the seniors card holders will be available to all health card holders from 1 July. The general dental scheme will cover examinations, simple preventative treatments and restorative treatments. The last matter I want to mention is the extension of child-care assistance and the provision of the home child-care allowance. Both those measures recognise the problems that families have, whether two-income families or where one spouse has gone out to work, wife or husband. Those measures are long overdue and have been demanded by the community. They represent a considerable investment by government to help Australian families. Contrary to the doom and gloom that comes from some people with respect to the budget, I have tried in these few short minutes to outline the benefits both to business and to Australian families.",87
161,Mr DOBIE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I listened to the honourable  speak glowingly of the Hunter. Strangely, I support him in all he said, except when he talked about buying Australian goods. Margaret Thatcher, who was the Prime Minister of Britain-as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, may remember-said that she did not want the British to buy British because it was British but because it was the best. So I believe it should be for Australians, buying Australian, not because it is Australian, but because it is the best. Apart from that, I agree with everything the honourable member for Shortland had to say.. ",94
162,Mr DOBIE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable member. Painted on the side of a building on one of Sydney's busiest streets is a comment which caught my attention last week. It read, 'Call a federal election nOW-Australia is going bankrupt'. I cannot be sure exactly how long that message has greeted drivers along that street. Perhaps it was there before the budget. However, I rather suspect it was a response to the Dawkins budget. It is a response which is representative of the complete rejection by the Australian community of the Dawkins budget. It is a response symbolic of the community outrage at the Keating Labor government and the path down which it is leading the country. Mr Deputy Speaker, since I was first elected to this parliament in 1966, I cannot recall a budget which has been so swiftly and comprehensively damned by all sections of the community as this second Dawkins budget. What is even more remarkable is the degree of outrage which came from traditional Labor supporters-in particular the ACTU. Who will ever forget the bucket Martin Ferguson tipped on the government when the budget was only hours old? The Labor Party is in disarray. I know that the Special Minister of State (Me Walker), who is at the table, agrees with me. the plot to such an extent that the old guard has abandoned it. It cannot rely even on its staunchest supporters to advocate this budget. Even they cannot 'defend the indefensible', as Martin Ferguson put it. Whether they are church groups, social service organisations, students, pensioners, health workers, economists-a good group-family groups, retirees and trade unionists, the bottom line is that they have all branded this budget a complete failure, both for Australia and for the individual concerns they represent. Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot recall a budget which has died so swift a death as this one. In only the second week of the budget session, the government was forced to back down on its ill-considered proposals. Now, in the fourth week-can it be only that long?we are faced with the unprecedented introduction of further budget bills because this government just cannot get its act together. Never have I seen a budget so roundly condemned. As I have done the rounds of my ekctorate, I have never heard so much anger from ordinary people as I have in response to the Dawkins budget. Mr Deputy Speaker, the parliament now has before it a budget which contains the most horrendous measures for ordinary Australian families. They must be opposed. These measures must be opposed because the government has no mandate to introduce them. More importantly, they must be opposed out of dignity for the ordinary Australian family, the family that Labor has forgotten, the family which is to be burdened with extra taxes and payments and reduced services, the family that has felt the full brunt of the worse sion in 60 years and the family that has been deliberately misled by a government which, at the last election, desperate to hold on to office, made outrageous promises which it knew it could not keep. These are the people that Labor has abandoned in this budget and it is for the welfare of these families that the coalition made the decision to oppose the tax increases. It is also for the welfare of small business proprietors, pensioners, independent retirees and young people that the coalition will oppose the It has lost Keating-Dawkins tax slugs. Mr Deputy Speaker, I anticipate that my electorate office is akin to many around the country. My office has been deluged with calls and letters from angry, frustrated constituents who understandably are irate at the government's budget measures. As t have said, the response has been unprecedented. So it is for the constituents of Cook that I stand in protest at this budget tonight. Mr Deputy Speaker, the government's so called deficit reduction strategy is fundamentally flawed-just plain bad economics. With this budget the government has not confronted the big issues. It has merely skirted around the fringe. This is evidenced by the forward estimates which show that there will be no reduction in unemployment and no sustainable growth over the coming year. We can witness the silence of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)- These estimates confirm the defeatist nature of· the budget and send alarming signals to potential investors in this country. The recent volatility of the dollar is testament-to that. Mr Deputy Speaker, in this budget tp.e government had an opportunity to introduce measqres to reduce unemployment. In the words of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins): The greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. But the reality is that this budget does nothing to get Australia back to work. It is forecast that in 12 months time the level of unemployment will be 10.75 per cent. The rate at the time of the budget-seasonally adjusted-was 10.7 per cent. What does that tell us about the recesKeating Labor. government's motivation to reduce unemployment? Quite clearly, Labor has given up on the unemployed. Despite some nonsense spoken in this House two weeks ago by government members, they have no commitment to get the unemployed people of Australia back to work. The Labor approach is simply to hike up a few more taxes and run up a huge deficit to pay the benefits. It is not interested in getting the economy growing at a sufficient rate to create jobs. The Labor Party's interest lies in ways of finding the money to pay the huge welfare bill for the people it has put on social security. We can see this in the budget papers, where the appropriations for unemployment payments for the coming year are detailed. Appropriations for newstart al10wance payments have increased while the overal1 appropriation for jobsearch payments has fal1en. It is clear from these figures that the government is expecting long-term unemployment to increase over the coming year. That is cold comfort for the nearly one mi11ion people out of work in this country-and who wi11 remain unemployed. The response from the Brotherhood of St Laurence to the budget is representative of the government's approach to the problem of unemployment. It said: The government has missed a chance to act sively on unemployment and people on low comes will continue to suffer. That is the hal1mark of this budget. It compounds our existing problems and offers no hope for recovery, in particular to pressing economic problem of unemployment. But this budget does worse than that: it slugs the unemployed and low income earners with tax increases. In return for the increase taxes, the government plans to give low income earners a pathetic $100 rebate for year-less than $2 a week. This was wel1 covered by my leader in his superb response to the budget. This is the alleged compassionate and sharing Labor government.· This is the governgovernment ment which 'will not let down' the battlers Australia. It did not take the government to show its true colours-the shame and deceit. It is worth remembering how those groups which represent the poorest people in the community view the budget. The Australian Council of Social Service said that it was 'deeply disappointing and will hurt low income people'. The Council on the Ageing said the budget was 'marked by a meanness and emphasises the lack of care for pensioners and low income older people'. The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission said it was regressive, while the St Vincent de Paul Society is genuinely concerned about the government's commitment for people to break out of the welfare cycle, and so one could go on and on. It is very clear that those organisations representing the low income and disadvantaged families have branded this budget as an abject failure, and so it is. But that should not be a surprise to members of this House. Certainly, on my side, we are never surprised at the depth the Labor Party will descend to in government. Even members of the government now brace themselves for a backlash on those rare occasions that they get out amongst their electorates and try to explain the latest decision. Just to give you an idea, Mr Deputy Speaker, the phones in my electorate office have been constantly ringing. The most common question I am asked is, 'How we can get rid deciof the Keating government?'. Even those inpeople who. did not vote for me are now asking my advice to see whether there is anything in the constitution which can be used to throw out the government. That is the the most extent of the community outrage. There are some items in the budget which I feel' I must address. The first is in relation to the decision to scrap the Medicare benefit in for optometrical procedures. The government is to be condemned for this outrageous decia sion. Let us not forget that in one hit the Labor government caused untold community anxiety and jeopardised the jobs of many people employed in the field of optometry. This is a shameful and despicable act from a which accused the opposition at of the last election of wanting to dismantle long Medicare when in fact that was not part of colours of our campaign at al1. The Labor Party has increased the Medicare payment to 1.4 per cent and almost simultaneously tried to take away the rebate for optometry. There is no justification for this, and the public should remember why the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wanted to do that. I 'congratulate the eye care industry for the strength and intelligence of its opposition to this proposal. Thankfully, after considerable pressure had been exerted by the coalition, the optometrical profession and the Australian community, it now appears that the government has abandoned this ill-conceived measure. But the terms of the Keating turnaround have to be watched very closely, and I give my word that I shall be watching for any other sneaky moves by the crew of the Treasurer. But the fact remains that the Labor government-in particular the officers of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-had thought it was good policy to strip ordinary Australian families of their Medicareentitlemerit to optometry visits. Rest assured that this backdown from the government is not part of some' process. of listening to the concerns of the electorate; it is the concession it has had to make to get itS budget legislation passed. Let· there be no mistake---the government has not had a change of heart. The Labor Party thinks it is a good idea to make struggling families pay mo-e for their children to have their eyes checked. It is only the government's lack of a majority in the Senate which stopped it. Let all Australians remember. Similarly, the Labor Party thinks it is a good idea to, hike up the tax on petrol but reduce spending on roads. It believes there is no inequity in forcing those families which are least able to afford it to pay more for their petrol. Only the government's lack of a majority in the Senate stopped it from increasing it all the way. Mr Deputy Speaker, this Keating government thinks that to retrospectively. tax someone's accumulated long service leave to increase a person's tax liability by some thousands of dollars overnight-is a good idea. It thinks that to deceive people in such a fraudulent manner is good government and, again, only a lack of a majority in the Senate stopped it. These are the measures which the Australian people will not forget, and be warned, they will not forget, and nor should they. One can only imagine what nasties the Labor Party would have inflicted on the Australian community had it had a majority in the Senate .. Thankfully for the welfare of this country, .it does not. I want to make that point patently clear. This is a major embarrassing backdown for the government, and it deserves to be condemned for the way it has been railroaded into caving in on its budget announcements. It is due only to the coalition's steadfast refusal to allow the Australian public to be slugged with unfair and discriminatory tax hikes that the government was forced to compromise with the Democrats and the Greens. This is no, change of heart. Believe me, there is no change of heart. This is a government which cannot get the support of the parliament, the community, its mates in the union movement or even its own backbench for its first budget of the 37th parliament. Let us not have the community fooled. Labor wanted to tax people more. Labor wanted to make people pay more for eye vi-its, and Labor wanted to rob people's accumulated long service leave entitlement. We would not let it get away with. that. The last sitting fortnight was truly a remarkable session in politics. The government could not get the budget passed intact; it could not organise the legislative timetable; its union supporters bucketed the budget in Sydney; and the backbench revolted against the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. We know that the backbench had no knowledge and input into the budget. Even the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) did not know that the sales tax on wine was to be increased in the budget. What a complete and utter shambles this government has got itself into and, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said, it only has itself to blame. In the moments left to me, I want to address the appalling performance of the Prime Minister in the wake of the budget. His attempts to blame everybody except himself and his government for the recent fall in the dollar is qothing short of being politically contemptible. It truly is a remarkable situation when we have the leader of this country stooping to such a despicable degradation of the office of Prime Minster. He has proved quite conclusively that the post of Prime Minister is clearly beyond his capabilities, arid his attempts to blame all artd sundry around him for his own incompetence are clearly transparent and have not been taken seriou-ly by the average Australian. This budget which we are debating tonight is a dud. That is why there is uncertainty in financial markets. That is why the Reserve Bank has had to step into try to prop up the dollar. That is why the unions, the Labor party backbench and all community organisations are protesting. That is' why ordinary Australians hold the Prime Minister and his government in such low esteem, as recent polls have confirmed. The Prime Minister has no-one to: blame but himself. As someone who once boasted that he is in control of all the levers, his attempts to put the ..blame on everybody but himself is all the more remarkable. Some years ago-1977, in facf-I drew the attention of the House to comments made by the United States Secretary of the Treasury, the honourable William Simon, when he addressed a meeting of the World Bank in Manila.' He said: Unfortunately, good economics is not always perceived to be good politics. My experierice has been that politics is an art with a high rate of discount. And while the pay-off to good economics is real, it tak!!S time. This lag, as the economists call it, is a p6litician's nightmare. Fortunately, I think that more and more people now understand that this is the case-and I sense gro\ving suspicion of the proposed instant solution, the quick fix. IIi a world of unlimited demands and limited resources, finance ministers are not only inevitably unpopular but indeed cannot afford to be popular. We are required to be the bearers of bad tidings-to reiterate the unpleasant but inescapable fact that resources are scarce while wants are limitless. It is our lot, whatever our country's economic system and whatever its circumstances, to speak out for financial responsibility-to call for prudence an age of fiscal adventure. Mr Deputy Speaker, in that same speech, I made mention of Micawber's simple statement. Micawber, as honourable members will recall, is a character from David Copperfield. Micawber in tum migrated to Australia. He said: Annual income £20 Os. Od.; annual expenditure £19 19s. 6d.; result happiness. Annual income £20 Os. Od.; annual expenditure £20 Os. 6d.; result misery. . Th- Special Minister of State would be a-are of that. I think those words are still apt today, qnly we could perhaps 'lll'date the figur-s, where the difference is not 6d but $16 billion. So be it! I have never resorted to personal abuse in this House, and I do nqt intenq to do so today but, by gosh, i have been sorely tempted to do so. ... I want to finish by saying that the Olympic games are a tremendous boost. Let us not forget that federally we have done nothing. 1n fact, the strong word doing the rounds is that the Ministyr for the Environment, SpoI:t and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was powerless. She did not try to convince the Treasurer to rally support behind Sydney's successful application for the games. All we hear about is, 'Change the flag' and 'Change the constitution'. The answer by' all Australians to this Labor government's budget is, 'Shame, shame, shame'.",94
163,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I must make some comments on the closing rem-rks of my friend the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). !felt they were out of character for his normal demeanour in this place and quite unbecoming of him. I will go slightly'further and suggest that, whilst the nation has celebrated the winning bf the Olympics for Sydney for the year 2000, we have to ensure that the management of the major expenditure on the games is done very carefully from a public point of view. . We have had some bad experience in this country of major government projects, particularly in New South Wales; and I am confident that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will be ensuring that the system of management used in by New South Wales is transparent and open and that it stays bipartisan. That is absolutely vital. The games were won because the nation was united-state, federal and local government on both sides of politics-and they will be successful only if that bipartisanship is maintained throughout the management instantaneously, process. The budget is an extremely complex ,docusector ment. We can talk glibly about over $110 billion worth of expenditure. If we look at volumes that are involved and the sheer details of it, the tendency is to ove-implify it. For the consumption of the public at large it needs to be simplified, bIlt unfortunately are seeing it being trivialised. I think the comments from so many honourable members opposite,have basically been to ,denigrate just the budget but the country and ,the econanalysis omy itself. We understand that there has been a 'great deal of uncertainty about the world's future. For example, in August, of last year Japanese government decided to spend money to try to stimulate the, economy. ' It 'did that again in April of this year and again a few weeks ago- In other words, three times in just over 12 months the Japanese government has taken measures to try to improve its recov-ry. I think President Bush lost his presidency because the American forecasters misforecast the American econo-y. Thi!;l also happened in Germany and Britain. Those countries have been in a state of confusion,and in,dilficulties with their economies-there has been a lack of growth, as projected-which have had an effect on their currencies. It is, therefore, of interest to look at has happened' in Australia' over the last three or foUr budgets in ternis of forecastirig.For all but one of the last five budgets the Treasury forecasts were much closer' to the actual outcome than the, average, of the private forecasts. Yet in some cases they were still grievously wrong, as were t-e treasury foreopposition casts, as I said, in Germany, Japan, Britain, France and the United StateS of America. We have .seen world ,econ()mies changing so dramatically and so rapidly and in a way that has meant the forecasting and accumulation of data, the synthesis and projection, almost had no relationship at times to what actually occurs. Fundamentally, forecasting is based on previous experience. Whether it is because of electronics, because of a capacity to move money around globally much more quiekly transactions, instantaneously or virtually and because'of the centralisation of the international economy where one is progressing well in a particular country and another sector adjacent to it is the performing badly-there are probably many more reasons-I do not think there is much doubt that the capacity of the world's treasuries to adequately analyse and forecast anywe thing more thaw weeks or months ahead at a time is very poor. ,It is therefore of some substance and some importance that we as a ,not country undertake a much more detailed of unemployinent and its impIlcations than perhaps we have in the past. Perhaps we have assumed that understanding history was enough. We have not underthe stood that the language of history has changed. The technology of history is different, and if we are to understand the future we certainly have to change the method by which we interpret the past. The fact is that the methods are not available. We cannot go back five, 10 and 15 years and analyse the movements in sectors of the economy that we now need to do for the future. Anybody who attempts'to project the economy from 10, 15 or 20 years ago in any substantial way into the future will very likely find that it will not perform in the same way. Communities are affected by these things. We have the economists forecasting and the politicians prophesying. Certainly the prophets of doom opposite what have been having something of a field day. Eventually the community at large reacts in 'much simpler terms to what it sees, as I indicated earlier, as trivialisation. This trivialising anddoomsaying becomes self-fulfilling. If we keep telling our community, as the has done so constantly for so long, that things are bad, things will become bad. Eventually the effect of people's cautiousness and uncertainty is for the economy to contract. The more the economy contracts, the more difficult it is for the economy to recover. "" wlien we have eminent citizens-I consider the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook, to be one-making such gloomy forecasts and prognoses and, more than that, in putting motivation to them, we have more than trivialisation; we have a distortion of fairly substantial magnitude. All parliamentarians read the budget; they all look at the details. There is not a parliamentarian in this· House who is not aware of the complexity of the document or the forecasts or of what is happening in the rest of the world's economies. The sheer dishonesty of what has been going on in the last four or five weeks is mind-boggling. It is not enough to say that it is simply politics. It is not politics. It is about the future of the country. The fundamental problem we have' iti the country is unemployment and its impacts on people. This budget, and the' appropriation bills that accompany it, substantially address the questions of unemployment, training and work generation. In the absence of consumer confidence-and that is not surprising, given what the consumers are being told-it is fundamental . that. the government in fact spends. This budget is an investment back into the economy. The budget puts· more money back than it takes. We heard that referred to earlier by the previous speaker in a negative sense. The opposition's proposals earlier this year were for the government to extract money from the economy to actually reduce the deficit, to withdraw.the money in . circulation. The natural impact of that is contraction and, hence, further. recession. This budget is stimulatory. The government is attempting to be countercyclical, injecting money into the economy to stimulate demand, as are the governments in Japan, Germany, Britain, France and virtually every other Western economy. .This budget does much more than that because it targets quite specifically areas of labour and employment. The major areas 9f growth are vocational and industry training, which is at 6 1/2 per cent of real growth; labour market assistance to, job seekers, grewing at 71f2 per cent; and employment services, growing at 10.7 per cent. These are all fundamental signals to our community that growth will come with that sort of investment. In. the process, - t also generates a higher level of skill. . If we look in more detail at vocational and industry training, we see growth in the budget overall from last year of nine per cent, particularly for entry level training and skills. training in areas such as group training for. companies, the trainet;Ship system, special trad- training and the ABC and career start apprentic-hips. All have been substantially increased in this budget and are aimed at imprqving the' skills because' eventually this country has ,to be about skill. So it· is not simply a question of investing in supporting people who are out of work; it is ensuring that, as work emerges and as the economy recovers, the work force and those who are seeking to become members of the work force are capable of winning work. It is not simply unemployment that we must be concerned about; .. we must be particularly concerned about long-term unemployment. . . I want. to quote some figures from the Newcastle area in terms of the impact of these programs and what they are doing to assist the long-term unemployed. In programs like jobtrain and jobstart,.· the percentages of commencements of the long-term unemployed in July and August were 62 per cent and 57 per cent· respeCtively. In other words, the programs' were predominantly being used to assist those who ha:dbeen out of work for more than 12 months. That is a fundamentally important factor. . The positive outcomes-long-term unemployeq people who a,re in employment or full time training thr- mon.ms after completion of their placem-nt-show. that 38 percent of those people are either in work or in training. . The overall job placement by CES-in other words, all of the jqbs found in those months fo- the long-term unemployed-was 34 per cent. That is sayi,ng that the programs themselves are effective in the sense that people who are the least !lble to compete, those who have been out of work the longest, are in fact now competing quite successfully."" ',. . "" , -,' Hence, the expenditure in those particular training areas, in the labour market assistance areas, is so vital. This is why it is so. important to note that.in this particular budget the increase in the labour market system to job seekers and to. industry has increased by just over 10 per cent to a figure of $1.36 billion. I That $1.36: billion is a subst;mtial investment in labour market assistance, and that is just one part. For the record I want to list some of those areas because I think it is important for people to understand the cohesion that this program involves. Programs incorporated into that expenditure include jobstart, which facilitates employment by providing temporary partial wage subsidies to employers-in other words, we are assisting employers to take on a person. Jobtrain provides short-tenn vocational training linked to individual needs and local labour markets. The new enterprise incentive scheme, NElS, provides training and income support to assist unemployed people to set up small business ventures. Skillshare provides grants to non-profit community organisations for structured skills training, and, of course, in Newcastle we have some superb skillshares; it is extremely effective and successful. Jobskills provides dised work experience in local government and the community sector for long-tenn unemployed people. We have jobclubs which have almost doubled in this year's budget from $13.3 million to $25.5 million. Jobclubs provide intensive training courses on job seeking skills. The accredited training program for youth, ATY, provides places for youth on accredited training courses, and all of those who achieve that are eligible for jobstart placements. The landcare and environment action program, better known as LEAP, assists young unemployed people to acquire new skills through training and practical experience in landcare. The special intervention program, SIP, provides assessment and remedial training for individuals facing specific employment barriers such as literacy, language or learning difficulties. There is the mobility assistance scheme, the community activity program and the office of labour market adjustment program. I will not go into the details of all of those. I went through some of those programs because people often tend to skip over them very quickly. We assume that the community is aware of all of those programs. The fact is that they present the most comprehensive package of programs ever devised. The figures I quoted earlier about. the successes, particularly in Newcastle-and, I think, nationwide-indicatethat the long-tenn unemployed actually are now starting to compete and to be successful in the job market. It is important. I certainly recall from my experiences in the post-1983 recession from the previous government thl,lt the people who were out of work for a period were finding it extremely difficult to compete. The jobs were going to those who were. either going from jobs or leaving school or training, and the people who were out of work became a group which found. it v:ery difficult to re-enter the work force. With this current. recovery, slow as it may be, the long-term unemployed are getting a fair go; they are actually getting a share of those jobs and will get a better share as those programs move and start to function because fully subsiof the increased expenditure. Those who want to go around bagging the budget and attempting to score political points from it do those unemployed people no justice at all. They have convinced many people that the budget provides no support for them when, in fact, there is quite a substantial amount. I want to move to a problem I mentioned earlier-the forecasting of statistics. I want to reinforce what happens in regional Australia by referring the House to the Bureau of Statistics labour force statistics for New South Wales. In the period September to October last year when the Bureau of Statistics changed the sample, we saw a decrease in the work force in the area of some 20,000 people, virtually within a month. Yet the unemployed did not increase at all; in fact, that statistic went down by 100. Again, in the last few months we have seen a two per cent shift in one month--:unemployment went down by two per cent in one month and up by two per cent a few months later. We have seen these massive changes in regional statistics. I do not wish in any way to diminish the fact that unemployment is high in the regions. There is no question of that. But the figures we are getting are very erratic and very volatile and, more importantly, they are not seasonally adjusted. For example, we cannot compare the Hunter or the lllawarra with Tasmania or South Australia because the Tasmanian figures and the South Australian figures are seasonally adjusted; the regional figures in New South Wales are not. That brings me to the next point. One of the great potentials of this budget for this government is the establishment of the regional development aspects of the industry portfolio. Australia consists of a series of regions, not six states at all. It consists of regionaleconomies which are quite separate and quite different within states and between states. The idea that we can work as a nation by working through our capital cities, as the Bureau of Statistics shows, is just a flawed argument. I and my colleagues from the Hunter have already submitted to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) that, if nothing else, the Bureau of Statistics should start to do its statistics regions on a seasonally adjusted basis and it should also substantially increase the sample size. The statistics we are getting are of no relevance and no benefit to us. They do not allow comparisons on investment or allow people looking at businesses to compare area with area. As I mentioned at the start of my speech, the problems we have had in forecasting fundamentally come back to the instruments we use to forecast. The instruments we used 10 years ago are now inadequate. The instruments we were usmg last year have not successfully forecast for the current year-not just here, but worldwide. People looking at the regions of Australia and unemployment figures see a two per cent shift per month, 4,000 or 5,000, and, notionally, movements of up to 20,000 bodies. It is just absolutely ludicrous. It creates uncertainty and it destabilises. The shift in regionalism is a follow-through of what the government has been doing now for some time. The devolution of departments-DEET and Social Security-has been substantial. In fact, in regional Australia now we have local autonomy and local management and, hence, local understanding and local purchasing are all fundamentally important. This budget also· proposes a massive cultural change-which is the idea of DSSwith Social Security, Employment, Education and Training and CSS cooperating in joint programs looking at ways in which the department that services the unemployed with financial support and the department which tries to help with training and finding work for them, work together to be innovative with new programs to try to maximise their understanding and support. I think that is only possible within the concept of the regional government perspective. This government is to be applauded, as is this budget, for finally recognising that we have upgraded in those ways. As I said, the national economy is in fact a series of regional economies clumped together. Statistics need to be completely revised structurally because they do not reflect the nation. The budget forecasting problems on the we have experienced-even though the Treasury has done better than the private forecasters-indicates that the level of forecasting we have seen in the last five years is not good enough, .nor is it good enough anywhere in the world. The way to solve it in Australia is to start analysing and doing the figures more on a regional basis than a state basis. Those opposite who want to doomsay this budget do themselves and the people of this country no justice. For those who are interested in these matters, this budget has much to recommend it. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Kerr) proposed: That the House do now adjourn Budget 1993-94",98
164,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"As one of the many community based initiatives I have commenced in the Cowan electorate, I have extended an invitation to all residents, no matter what their political persuasions, to write to me about issues and concerns they would like me to raise in federal parliament. Because parliament is meant to be the people's place, I am going to use this opportunity to air the concerns and frustrations of one of Australia's many struggling and confused citizens. Donna Matthews, a local resident of Morley, has taken up the challenge. I am confident that the concerns of Donna Matthews are echoed throughout the electorate of Cowan and across this· great nation. Ms Matthews writes: I have always been a Labor voter or supporter. My father was a stout Labor man and instilled the theory ""Labor looks after the working class"". So what happened? I had always believed that politicians had a ""grand plan""a better understanding of how things should be run and what was best for the people, but now I'm a disillusioned voter and a very disillusioned labor voter. I do not intend to vote labor again while Mr Keating is leader, or even if he is replaced. Labor will have to get itself 'back on track' before I would give them my vote. The last budget has made me very angry. It is unfair, illegal and makes no sense in several areas. Where are the initiatives, where is the hope of work for me or my family? There's not a lot of difference between Dr Hewson's O.S.T and what Mr Keating has given us-except Dr Hewson was honest enough to tell us what he was going to do. Some of the sillier things in the budget are: 1. The petrol tax. I bought petrol on the Monday at approximately 61 cents a litre and on Wednesday it was 73.7 cents. OK. The increase was at midnight, but a whole 12 cents a litre? The petrol stations had fuel in their tanks bought at the cheaper price, so who gets the extra profit? Why isn't this called profiteering? This tax (as with others) is not even law yet. How is it that it can be charged? Does that mean someone can be arrested for something that will be passed as law in the next month? How do you intend to refund the extra money collected if bills aren't passed, and what about the paper work. What a waste of time; money and effort. 2. Cigarette tax This tax, as with all taxes, is about raising money. To make it look good we can say it will make people stop smoking and therefore save money in doctors or hospital bills (ie Medicare). Well, know we can make figures say anything. Add this, take that, adjust something else. Those people who do give up smoking, good, but how do you make up the money you would have received from them? Why do you target the smokers? Why not the drinkers, even more so? The amount of money drinkers and their families cost us as a society far outweighs what smokers cost. For example, who ever heard of a wife or kids being bashed because the husband smoked? How many car accidents are caused because the driver is a smoker? How many couples divorce over smoking? Consider the legal aid, the qmnselling, the court costs, not tp mention doctors and hospital costs, and its millions and millions of dollars. Who are the brewery owners that receive such good treatment? What about Austudy? Why is that being given to the parents, but at a lesser amount?· And the dependent spouse rebate. Why change this? It's still the same for single income families with no children, but single income families with children get a home child care allowance of approximately the same value. Will this be taxed? What do these changes achieve apart from costing a fortune. Imagine all the letters and postage costs for informing Austudy receivers. The mountains of paper work and confusion will.overtake any savings in seconds. Why can't Labor ministers think like a normal person-it is stupid to waste money on unnecessary changes. People who work pay taxes. Build an industry here, not give everything away overseas, encourage people to work, build recycling plants, give us some incentive to save. I could write about many more things but I've covered some of my concerns. I don't normally put pen to paper or even voice my complaints but I've had enough-the government needs to know that a lot of the people are unhappy with what is happening. Donna Matthews of Morley, a true believer, does not need me to comment further, other than to say thank you. Chile",102
165,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Melbourne) (11.25 p.m.)In view of the forthcoming visit of President Patricio Aylwin from Chile, I wish to make a few comments on the current situation in that country. In post-dictatorial times in Chile, whilst some progress has been made towards we all the achievement of true democracy, which has been positively acknowledged in the international community, very serious concerns remain in relation to human rights. Since 1990 some 200 political prisoners have been detained in prisons such as the Penitencieria, Santo Domingo women's prison, San Miguel and Concepcion City, Rancagua .. Amnesty International reports as recently as March 1993 con finn torture and ill-treatment by members of the security forces. Carabineros, the unifonned police, is the force most frequently mentioned in these accusations, although cases of torture by members of the Policia de Investigacioines de Chile, criminal investigations police, have also been reported. The methods of torture mentioned in these reports by Amnesty International include beatings of the whole body, sometimes using fireanns and other objects, punching and kicking, near asphyxiation using plastic bags over the head, electric shocks, deprivation of sleep and food, and the use of blindfolds. The victims of torture referred to in the Amnesty International report are individuals accused of politically motivated offences. There are also a number of people who seem to have been victims of apparently random acts of violence by members of the security forces. By way of example, I would like to quote fairly briefly from the 1993 Amnesty International report. Christian Cardenas Jofre was detained in the street on 9 March 1992 by members of the Investigacioines de Chile and taken to their headquarters in Santiago where he was held until 12 March. Reports stated: Christian Cardenas was beaten, punched and kicked all over his body, received blows to the ears, a torture method known as 'the telephone' and had electric shocks applied to various parts of his A torture complaint was submitted to the third criminal court in Santiago on 20 March. To Amnesty International's knowledge he still remains in prison. At this point, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery this evening of members of the Chilean Human Rights Committee, Mr Renaldo Torres, Mr Manuel Flores and Mr Alex Aqueveque, who have supplied me with this report. Most cases of human rights violations committed after the period covered by the 1978 amnesty law in Chile remain unresolved. I recognise the many obstacles faced by the Chilean government in addressing the legacy of past human rights violations but I believe that the government has the continuing obligation to ensure that, firstly, full investigations into human rights abuses under the Pinochet regime, including all complaints of torture, are carried out in order that the full truth is made known and that those responsible are brought to justice; secondly, the proceedings against prisoners charged with politically motivated offences are re-examined without delay, in order to detennine whether those prisoners who did not receive a fair trial according to international standards should be released or should have their case reheard under fair procedures; thirdly, any allegations of torture, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment should be immediately and impartially investigated and those responsible brought to justice; and, finally, immediate action should be taken with respect to the 1991 Rettig report which establishes that there are still some 2,025 missing or disappeared persons, many of whom are women and children, in Chile. In conclusion, the government of Australia should continue to explore, as it is doing, all avenues of increased trade and commerce with Chile as well as other countries in the Latin American region. It also has an obligation to take advantage of the opportunity of President Aylwin's visit to. convey that, in accordance with our general standards with respect to human rights in this country, the examples of torture as presented in the Amnesty International report and the recent killings of two peaceful demonstrators on 11 September who were marking the 20th annibody. versary of the coup against President Allende, as reported in the Age, and the fact that General Pinochet, who is responsible for the killing of the thousands of Chileans whilst in power still remains in control of the Chilean anned forceS, confinn that today many lives in Chile are under threat and that democracy, fragile as it is, still remains very much under threat in that country. Parker, Miss Evelyn Helena: Death",103
166,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to bring to the notice of the House the passing of a great Australian-more particularly, a great Western Australian. In the early hours of this morning, Miss Evelyn' Helena Parker DBE, JP, died in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital at the age of 85 .. From 1953 to 1975, Miss Parker was a councillor with the Subiaco City Council and made history by becoming our first lady mayor from 1975 to 1978. In all, she served 25 years in local government. In her professional career, Miss Parker worked as it school teacher around country areas of Western Australia and later in metropolitan Perth. Ev Parker was a feminist in the true senseof the word; by her words and actions, she forwarded the cause of women in a manner matched by very few of her peers. I first got to know her when, I married her niece, Wendy, 22 years ago. When the new Subiaco City Public Library was named after Aunty Ev in more recent years, she confided in me, 'I haven't made a public speech in many years.' What shall I say?'. I suggested she should say that she was delighted to be able to name the Evelyn H. Parker Library before it became the Evelyn H. Parker Memorial Library. This rather tickled her fancy and it was particularly wellreceived by the crowd on the day; I can , assuteyou. Evelyn Parker will ,pe re1llembered with great fondness by many the:>usands. of Western Australians who were fortunate enough to have her as their tea.cher. To the very end, remained passionately interested in. education and politics. A sta-nch defen<;l-r of loc.al goveflllIlent from party political inter(erence, she was a great encouragement to me when I discussed with her my political ambition over a number of years. Because of her declining health, she was unable to attend the election night function at the Yokine Recreation Centre 'on 13 March this year. So, after the polls closed, with my family, I visited Aunty Ev at her retirement home in Joondanna. When' it became clear, early in the evening, that I had enjoyed a: comfortable victory in the electorate of Stirling, the only person moreexc,ited than me was Aunty Ev. Despite heaith problems, she remained keenly interested in politics right up until death this morning. When we called into the hospital to say goodbye last Saturday-knowing that perhaps that was the last time that we would speak to her before travelling to Canberra-her first questions were of the family and Canberra.' . Ev Parker will be sorely. missed by her colleagues from the associations df which she has been a valued member, by her former pupils, by her former fellow councillors of the city of Subiaco in Western Australia, by her very many friends, and by her surviving brothers-James, John and Forbes-and their families. After a rich and full public and private life, during which Evelyn Helena Parker contributed so much, may she rest in peace. Fishing: Threatened Species Mrs SI;LVIA SMITH (Bass) (11.33 p.m.) - I draw to. the House's attention a case of unseen devastation - hat is occurring, and has been occurring over recent years, in the southern waters of Australia off the coast of Tasmania. It has been brought to my attention recently that a rare species is being overfished in TasII:1anian wl;lters. This is the Tasmanian sea dragon and.it now faces extinction as a direct result of insidious, indulgent overfishing in the waters off the south-eastern coast of Tasmania. "" This warning was given last week by the threatened species network. It has called on she the federal government, via the Minister for the Environment, Sport, and Territories (Mrs Kelly);to stop this malicious exploitation of the multicoloured sea dragon, phylloteryx taeniolatus. These. beautiful creatures, which grow to about 45 centimetres, are being exported alive for aquarium markets in Asia and North ,America to satisfy a minute, indulgent market to the detriment of the sea dragon. Furthermore, there is the supposition that the sea dragon has.aphrodisiac properties when dried and crushed. This idea has created a demand in Asia and is depleting the species at an alarming rate. Phylloteryx taeniolatus is naturally a very rare species. Its distinct biology makes it highly susceptible to extinction. 'Therefore, her fishing from the wild must not be allowed to  ened species network coordinator in an interview with the Launceston Examiner newspaper last· week. The Tasmanian division of sea fisheries is considering a ban on the taking of rare species such, as this weed dwelling sea dragon. But, more importantly, we need' a national ban to stop exports of all rare 'species of sea dragons. This includes sea horses and the pipe fish. These species are intimately fragile dwellers in our ecology and far too vulnerable to. justify this crazy exploitation for utterly fnvolous purposes. If those persons in Asia must, partake of these quaint remedies, they should be compelled' to breed the species in captivity, otherwise yet another rare and beautiful species will disappear from the face of the earth. Tasmanian divers have reported that the sea dragon population in Tasmania's south-east has been almost completely depleted in recent years .. Advertisements in national fishing magazmes are offering top rates. National intervention is necessary to ban the export of t-e .sea dragon, phylloteryx taeniolatus, pIus Similar species. In conclusion, I request that action be taken now before' it is too late. Taxation: Wine",104
167,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"This e-ening I want to exercise my democratic nght to speak on the budget deficit reduction bills that were put through the House in a hurry tonight under guillotine by the governmeot. In particular, I refer to the Sales Tax (Customs) (Deficit Reduction) Bill which contained the increased sales tax on wine. We have seen the government rush this bill through the House of Representatives this evening. It has done away with the rights of a lot of the people of Australia to' have representatives speak on the issue in'this House in the proper manner. I find that I have to speak in this adjournment debate when I will get only five minutes to talk about this very important issue. In the electorate of Lyne there exists a number of quality boutique wineries which, through hard work and intelligent planning have been achieving phenomenal success. Thmost notable of these wineries is Cassegrain winery. Along with the Charley Brothers Winery, it provides much needed employment in the Port Macquarie area. The Cassegrain winery, producing some of the world's best quality wine-40 per cent of which is exported; mostly to Japan-relies enormously on the domestic market to achieve economies of scale, as is the case with the majority ohmall export companies. Domestic sales underpin those exports and domestic sales are extreme"" ly price sensitive. This 55 per cent increase will wreak havoc on this local industry. The Cassegrains' conc:;em for their future is certainly not unfounded- If this tax is introduced, domestic sales are expected to drop by 31 million litres, with a corresponding drop in grape demand. Along with this, the Wine Makers Federation of Australia estimates a loss of export income of around $126 million per annum-surely something that Australia cannot afford. The recently released Sharp report clearly ,states that the competitive advantage of the Australian wine industry is neither as secure nor an strong as some would wish. It further states:, ' Any change in the tax system which reduces the ability of Australian wine exporters to invest in the building of market-based assets has the potential to substantially downgrade the industry's international competitive advantage. ' TheSe sales tax increas- will therefore place the Cassegrain family winery at adistirict disadvantage. The survival of the Cassegrains to date has only been because the members of their extended family work six days per week all year round at minimal wages. They recognise that they cannot keep this up forever and are currently trying to plan for their future. However, with the introduction of this sales tax on wines, along with all the other burdens their on business which thisgovemmen.t has introduced over the years, the future looks very bleak. This is. not scaremongering. A business decision to close the winery, may have to be taken as the only alternative. I will put on record some correspondence recently received from Mr Claude <;:::assegrain. It states: The impediments and the ·artificial costs that a business in pure competition has to endure are staggering. The anticipated 'effect of the additional sales tax on our product includes the possible closure of our viticulture enterprise: time will telL If Cassegrain closes, it would have an enormous impact on the community of Port Macquarie and Wauchope because the· winery plays a significant role in the tourism infrastructure of the whole region. As now seems to be the common trend with this government, the worse part of the sales tax on wine is that it is an uneven tax. Those who produce a quality product carry the largest burden and . pay a disproportionate amount of tax on each litre of wine produced and sold on the domestic market. This government does not realise that the quality producers are also the flag leaders for the export market I repeat: it is .domestic sales for these quality producers that underpin their exports. The recently released Sharp report was, for mine, thefitial hail in the coffin for the uneconomic plans of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) for the wine industry. The report clearly 'shows the Treasurer's 'Canberra is Australia, Australia is Canberra' opinion to be quite wrong. As Brian Croser has said: The gap between theory in Canberra and practice in the highly competitive international marketplace is unbelit(vably frustrating to this model industry. I have heard a lot of talk amongst those on the other side of politics that we on this side have turned into the opposers of everything. Why would we not oppose this measure? The government promised no tax increases and the people of Australia expect us to stand up on their behalf after they were blatantly lied to in the campaign for the 13 March election. The government has no mandate to increase this tax and the people of Australia will not forgive the government for it. I am astounded at the government's B-grade economics with regard to the sales tax on the wine industry. Does the government not recognise that the few large wineries, consisting of 70 to 80 per cent of the market, have their costs of production artificially subsidised by the many small individual wineries? (TIme expired) Regional Australia",106
168,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to make a few observations about the recent draft report, Impediments to regional industry adjustment. It is very appropriate that I do. so because I come from one of the largest electorl\tes in the country.",107
169,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,Ninety-two per cent of South Australia.,107
170,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"As the honourable member for Fisher says, my electorate covers 92 per cent of South Australia. For many generations the region has been subjected to a dominant urban culture, and this report's coming to light is most welcome. The report looks at regional labour costs-and we could be excused for believing, from the headlines of recent days, that this was all that was in the report. That is my main motivation for speaking to it tonight. I say to Mr Kelty, and it is documented very well on page 51,'that there is already regional wage variation. I think it is very important to recognise that. The report talks about labour retraining, labour and capital adjustment, services and regional industry adjustment, the infrastructure, regional ramifications of financial relations between governments, adjustment assistance, and the regional dimension. The report discusses the actual policies. During midto late-October members of the Industry Commission will be taking evidence around Australia. At the public hearings people will have an opportunity to comment on this document, and I hope people will take every opportunity .to do that. If I were to comment on a weakness in this document, I would say that perhaps there is nothing on the indirect tax burden-and this is somewhat ironic, having listened to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), and bearing in mind the general malaise of the budget. I am on' the public record as saying that fuel excise is one of the most unjust taxes on regional Australia. It is not just a matter of the 20c or 30c a litre that is imposed; it is the whole structure and the way it impacts on the cost of productionright through the whole chain.",107
171,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,We would have scrapped it.,107
172,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Quite right. It would have been gone by now if we had our opportunity; but that is another story. It is with great pleasure that I have looked at the document. There are over 250 pages and I have not had the opportunity to look at it all, but it is a most welcome document and I thank the commissioners for the effort that they have put in. I commend the document to Mr Kelty and others, and they might have a look at it in its full context, In conclusion, I will quote from the document and perhaps try to sum up some of the aspirations of those people who have already made submissions. The quote, I think .from the Geraldton development board in Western Australia, states: Unless all levels of gO\1emment act to provide incentives to get people back into the country, many rural towns are in danger of closing; simply existing to house a large ployed people ... Federal and S-te govemmenhave the means to encourage the development of 'rural and regional communities through public sector employment policies, supply of physical social infrastructure and economic incentives. That is the key to regional Australia. I hope , These ,are debts for fanns that this parliament may take some notice it. ' Macquarie Rural Advisory Service",107
173,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"U\st week I attended the annual meeting of the Macquarie Rural Advisory Service in Dubbo. This rural counselling group, which covers fanning districts of Narromine, Dubbo and Wellington, has been operating for two years. Like other groups, around Australia, it funded 25 per cent by the local community, 25 per cent by the state government and 50 per cent by the federal government. It is run by a board of 16 volunteers, the president which is the very capable Trevor Stevenson. The rural counsellor there, Kathy Sims, is very highly regarded throughout the district. She has 15 per cent of the fanners' of those three areas on her books. A fair guess is that half or more of those will eventually go into unless there is a big upturn in the rural indusold try before long. Listening to the presentation of her annual report the other night and to contributions of the other members at the meeting, some very disturbing trends came through. Most of us here will be familiar the run-of-the-mill causes of fanners' difficulthe ties: low commodity prices, high costs, droughts, wet harvests and, in particular, high interest rates that prevlliled for so long in the 1980s. , Mr SLIPPER - And the Labor government.",108
174,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"That was caused by the Labor government. Many of the fanners in trouble bought extra land, attempting to become more efficient, and got caught by these high, interest rates. Those going out of the industry through poor management account for quite a small proportion of fanners-contrary to popular belief. It is indeed sad that ,agriculture is losing some of its better operators. The largely untold story is that of the tremendous stress put on fanning families which is lead'or ,ing to break-ups of families and, in some body pf unemcases, suicides. I learnt the other night that the fanners on the books of the Macquarie Rural Advisory and Service have an average debt of $316,000, which is up by $19,000 on last year's figure. 9f an average size of of 2,000 hectares. The average asset of those fanns amounts to about thiee-quarters of a million dollars, though the great bulk of them have assets of less than $400,000. Over the last year there has been a trend whereby we have an increase in the debt level the of $19,000. Carry over finance is becoming very hard to access; the criteria for getting it have tightened considerably. The creditors are is applying increased pressure. They are now asking 'for three-monthly reports. They are putting flow charts together. They want five year histories and three-year projections. This of is very time consuming, quite costly to put together and involves a lot of guesswork. It is causing a backlog for appointments with Kathy, the rural counsellor. She is already working a 50-hour week. ' On top of this most farmers are still locked high interest rates,.' Many are still on the five-year loans which will not expire until the end of next year. They are paying 17 and the 18 per cent. But even those who are accessing loans today are, paying 91f2 per cent prime rates from the bank, to which is added two to with four per cent for faim margins. That brings figure up to 111/2 per cent; when an extra one or two percent in bank charges and fees the is tacked on to that, 13 and 14 per cent interest rates are commonly paid. This is at a time when inflation is running at one per cent. I think it is a disgrace. ' Many farmers are in trouble. They cannot just lock into· the present low rates, as some people seem to be saying they can. These days, banks are giving farmers only one-year loans. The high value farms in the more fertile areas are getting into the most trouble. Farms in the cheaper land areas are often in a better position. Surprisingly to me, there is a strong drift towards farmers in trouble with very high equity levels, because they cannot get carry-on finance. Four per cent of the clients on Kathy's books have equity levels of 90 to 100 per cent; over 10 per cent have equity levels between 80 and 90 per cent; and 17 per cent have equity levels between 70 and 80 per cent. More than 30 per cent of her clients have equity levels greater than 70 per cent. That can be compared with the bottom level, those with equity levels between 0 and 30 per cent, which accounts for just over 10 per cent of her clients. In conclusion, the workload per client has increased dramatically over the last year. Bank pressures on these clients are becoming intolerable. The farmers in better positions are falling into trouble. She is getting more clients on the books. The projection in the budget papers that $4 million in funding will come down to $2 million next year is totally unrealistic. The need next year will be greater, not less. Furthermore, RAS funding is projected to come down from $150 million to somewhere around $50 million, to be made upout of state reserves. That is also unrealistic. Taxation: Credit Unions",108
175,Ms WORTH,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I commend the Senate for voting today to support Senator Hill's motion to refer the provisions of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) 1993 concerning the taxation treatment of credit unions to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The inquiry must report on or before 18 October and will be required to examine: (a) the role played by credit unions in Australia; (b) their structure, operations and community services; (c) the reasons for credit unions being granted a partial tax exemption in 1974; Cd) the effect of the taxation treatment proposed by the government on credit unions' capital formation and on their continued provision of financial and community services; (e) the effect of the ta-ation treatment proposed by the government on asset concentration in both the credit union movement and retail financial sector, and the implications of this effect upon consumer choice; and Cf) whether the reasons for the differentiated tax treatment of credit unions and building societies are still valid. Credit unions will now be given the opportunity to present their case in support of credit unions retaining their tax exempt status on income earned from loans to members. Credit unions are financial cooperatives owned by their members and served by volunteer directors. Credit unions are non-profit organisations, and any surplus funds are used to meet capital requirements, as required by legislation, with the remainder invested to improve member services and to maintain credit unions' traditional low interest on loans and low fees policy. The reinvestment by credit unions of surplus funds pays for community services, such as financial counselling, and member services, such as free bill paying and free payroll deductions. As with all other financial institutions, credit unions do pay income tax on all areas of their business. Only earnings from loans to members are exempt-a measure that was introduced by the Whitlam government 20 years ago in recognition of the role of credit unions in providing lower cost personalloails to Australians who did not have access to bank finance. The removal of the tax exemption will seriously erode the ability of credit unions to maintain services and member benefits at current levels. It will jeopardise the position of credit unions as virtually the only source of low cost personal loan finance for many thousands of South Australians. The tax will cost South Australian credit unions an estimated $35 million over a five-year period. Regional Aquatic Centre: Bendigo",109
176,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) today acknowledged that all of Australia should participate Sydney Olympic Games. 1 thank her for that statement. 1 concur totally, adding only that her comment should apply particularly to rural Australians. . In 1956 1 had the privilege and honour of carrying the Olympic torch. I ask the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) at the table to take of my request of the minister for sport. 1 want her to make good her support for a project that has the support of the Bendigo Regional Recreation Board, the five municipalities surrounding Bendigo, the Bendigo YMCA, the user groups, the Victorian state government-which has put in $500,OOO-and the whole community by providing financial assistance of $250,000 for the construction of a regional aquatic centre. This would enable Bendigo and district to produce another Olympic gold and bronze swimmer like Faith Leech from Bendigo in 1956. 1 believe there are a lot of opportunities throughout regional Australia for the government to show its goodwill. I ask the minister at the table to take up this particular matter with the minister for sport. Bell, Mr John: Death",109
177,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight with a great degree of sadness to mourn the loss of a great Australian. I am sure that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, would be aware of the work of the late John Bell, the founder of the Esprit clothing company. Tragically, Mr Bell was found dead at his home in Melbourne yesterday morning. On behalf of both sides of this House, 1 would like to pay tribute to this very great Australian. He was a passionate supporter of Australian youth, a passionate environmentalist and a passionate fighter for Australia's homeless young people. He had an enormous love for rural Australia and he was very proud of his roots. He was raised in country Western Australia. Last Thursday night in Ballarat he spoke passionately about his upbringing and what that had taught him. The great thing about Mr Bell was that he pricked the corporate conscience. He was a man who did it on his own. He established the Esprit Cares Trust Fund, which generated in the an enormous amount of money which was going to Australia's youth. I believe that he single-handedly raised youth issues and the problems confronting the young people of Australia in the corporate sector and it was an extraordinary success. 1 was on the board of the Open Family note Foundation with Mr Bell. Mr Speaker, in the short period that I have known him, I thought that his drive was extraordinary, as was his commitment to the young people that you and 1 so passionately care about, as does everyone in this chamber and all our colleagues. He was their· great fighter and they have lost a very close friend. Mr Bell was chairman of the Victorian state government's council of youth affairs. He was involved in the Life, Be in It campaign and in the big brothers, big sisters program. His whole life and the many hours he worked every day were committed to others. 1 think he showed-it was a great lesson to all corporate . Australia-that there are many things to life; there is the development of business but 1 think primarily there is the development of Australia, particularly Australian youth. I am deeply saddened by the loss of Mr Bell. 1 do not think that he would have wanted to have been considered irreplaceable but it will be a quite extraordinary person who will take up the work of the late John Bell. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.58 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Evans to move That this House: (1) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in sixteen for Australian women; (2) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family; (3) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer; (4) notes the extent of research funding expenditure on other medical conditions with significantly lower mortality rates such as the HIVvirus; (5) calls on the federal Government to provide more funds for breast cancer research; and (6) recommends that the Government introduces tax incentives for donations to breast cancer research in the order of 150 per cent to encourage community support to help eliminate this .disease and to increase the availability of research fun-.

(6) Has the Keating Government pursued the question of designation of Western Australia with the Government of Richard Court; if so, with what outcome.",110
178,Mr LAVARCH,NOTICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. However, the Convention was adopted on 18 March 1965, not 1975 as stated in the question. (2) Yes, Australia deposited the instrument of ratification on 2 May 1991 and designated both mainland. Territories and all States except Western Australia as constituent subdivisions for the purposes of Article 25(1). (3) Yes. I am advised that on 13 April 1976 the then Prime Minister, Me Fraser, wrote to each of the Premiers seeking comments on the draft Bill authorising ratification by Australia of the Convention. Sir Charles Court, the then Premier of WestNA em Australia, replied by letter of 10 June 1976 stating that he did not favour ratification of the Convention by Australia and requesting that, should the Commonwealth decide to ratify, Western Australia not be designated as a constituent subdivision under Article 25(1) of the Convention. On 25 September 1978, Mr Fraser, the then Prime Minister, wrote again to Sir Charles Court and asked him to reconsider his position on the matter. The then Acting Premier of Western Australia responded, affirming the State's earlier position. (4) Yes. I am advised that on 4 June 1984, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke wrote to Me Burke, then Premier of Western Australia, advising him that Australia intended to ratify the Convention at an early date and expressing a hope that Western Australia would be willing to join all other States of the Commonwealth and the Northem Territory in being designated a ""constituent subdivision"" for the purposes of the Convention. In a reply dated 31 August 1984, Mr Burke advised that the Western Australian position on designation had not changed. I am advised that the then Prime Minister, Me Hawke, wrote in some detail to the then Premier of Western Australia, Dr Lawrence, on 23 October 1990, outlining the benefits of designation and asking that Western Australia reconsider its position on the question of designation under Article 25(1). In a reply dated 22· February 1991, Dr Lawrence advised that Western Australia remained opposed to ratification of the Convention and requested that, if ratification occurred, Western Australia not be designated under Article 25(1). In response, on 16 April 1991, Me Hawke wrote to Dr Lawrence agreeing to her request but regretting the Western Australian Government's inability to give favourable consideration to designation. (5) The Attorney-General's Department has corresponded with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and ICSID has provided the Department with a list of contracting states and signatories of the Convention as at 18 May 1993. I am advised that, since the list provided in answer to question 1752, the following five countries have lodged instruments of ratification; Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia and Turkmenistan. The Czech Republic has also deposited an instrument of ratification; the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic had previously been a contracting state. The list of the 107 parties to the Convention, together with the date of entry into force for each country, has been forwarded to the honourable member. (6) In view of the fact that, over a 15 year period up to 1991, Western Australia consistently requested that it not be designated, the question has not been raised with the new Western Australian Government. In his letter in 1991, the former Prime Minister indicated that, should the Western Australian Government change its position on this matter, the appropriate designation could' take place. It should be noted that non-designation does not ' ,LIST OF CONTRACTING STATES AND SIGNATORIES The 122 States listed below; have signed the Between States and Nationals of Other States on have deposited their instruments, of ratification are attainment of the status of Contracting State by the are also indicated.

What it does mean is that Western Australia would not have open to it the options available to other States and mainland Territories; that is, the ability to offer potential investors in their .State or Territory the additional assurance of access to an internationally recognised specialist dispute resolution procedure. Even in a designated constituent subdivision of a Convention country; however, jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention requires the consent of both parties to a dispute.

' Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ATSIC does not hold the information requested by the honourable member. There are more than twenty separate Aboriginal Legal Services which receive funding from ATSIC to provide legal services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in their respective communities .. The Legal Services operate as autonomous bodies and develop their own guidelines and practices for providing legal assistance according to their assessment of the needs of their clients. Arising from this autonomy there is a range of methods used by Aboriginal Legal Services to collect data on assistance provided in civil, nal, family and corporate law matters. An assessment of the funding basis of Aboriginal Legal Services in 1992 found that the vast majority of matters handled by the Aboriginal Legal Services involved representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people charged with criminal offences. However, at present there is no standardised fonnat of data collection nal Legal Services. The May 1992 assessment by ATSIC developed a series of recommendations, one of which was for the establishment of a national, computerised, statistical data system to enable priorities to be determined based on demonstrated need. ATSIC is currently considering methods of implementing this recommendation. World Youth Championship Greats (Question No. 238)",112

(2) Yes. (3) The Government appreciates the significance of 1993 as the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. At the same time, the Government recognises the need for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be involved in considering 'ratification of this Convention, in light of its significance for issues affecting them. Consultations with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and organisations are being conducted by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in order to assist the Government in its consideration of the ratification of the Convention. (4) (a) Yes. (b) Yes. (5) The Government remains committed to pursuing the ratification of appropriate international conventions, particularly those which protect important rights. This commitment motivated the establishment in 1991 of the Task Force, referred to in (1), to review and accelerate Australian ratification of ILO Conventions. An important part of the process of pursuing the ratification of international conventions involves consulting the States and Territories. Both Convention No. 151 and Convention No. 155 have been the subject of consultations with State and Territory Governments, at Ministerial and officer level, in accordance with the normal arrangements for proposed ratification of ILO Conventions. They have also been the subject of discussions by the Task Force with State and Territory representatives. A majority of States have agreed to ratification. Both Conventions have been identified as suitable targets for ratification in the Third Report of the Task Force. The Government hopes soon to be in a position to make a decision on ratification of these Conventions.

A list of grants made by ATSIC in 1992/93 under that Program is shown below at Schedule 1. These funds were allocated for research into native title issues. With regard to the funding oC-other claims which purport to be based. on the principles established under the Mabo decision, while some such claims may have been funded from allocations to individual Aboriginal Legal Services under the Commission's general legal services funding program, it would not be possible to disaggregate the costs of any such claim from a particular Service's general budget until the relevant grant fell due for acquittal.
