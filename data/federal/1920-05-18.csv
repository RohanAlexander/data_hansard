1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. NA ALLOWANCE.",19
2,Mr BELL,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"Will the Prime Minister, before introducing a Bill to increase the allowance of members of Parliament, ask the approval of the House to the same rate of increase, namely, 60 per cent., in the allowances made to soldiers incapacitated by the war?",19
3,Mr HUGHES,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"When the Bill is introduced, the honourable member will have .an opportunity of expressing his views regarding it BEET SUGAR.",19
4,Mr FENTON,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"I B it the intention of the Government to take control of the sugar produced in Victoria from beet, and, if so, will that be done by regulations under the War Precautions Act?",20
5,Mr HUGHES,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"On Friday a deputation put its case before me, and in reply I pointed out that at present prices the Government is losing Â£14 per ton on the sugar it is supplying to the community; but I promised to do what I could. I have not yet had an opportunity to put the matter before my colleagues. Probably the Government has no power except under the War Precautions Act to control the production of beet sugar, but we could control it under that Act until its expiry, which must come about within a certain period after the declaration of peace. At present I can only say that the Government will consider the matter. We are desirous of helping, not of crushing, the beet sugar industry, and I sincerely regret that, after eight years of encouragement by the Government of .Victoria and the Commonwealth Government, the total production of beet sugar in .this State is the paltry amount of 1,400 tons. SHORTAGE OF COAL.",20
6,Mr BLUNDELL,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"Owing to the soripus shortage of coal in South Australia, a number of industries there may have to close down within the next few weeks. May I , therefore, ask whether the Government cannot, under the circumstances, try to supply coal so that these factories may be kept open?",20
7,Mr HUGHES,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"The question was raised last week, when I said that I would see what cpuld be done to make freight available. At least four Commonwealth vessels arc now carrying coal, and I have been conferring with the Manager of the Commonwealth fleet as to the extent to which other vessels could be made temporarily available. Of course, our vessels, like private vessels, are under contracts to load cargo. At the Premiers' Conference, which meets at the end of the week, an opportunity will be given .to discuss the matter, which I recognise to be of very great importance. PURCHASE OF MACHINERY.",20
8,Mr GREGORY,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"It is stated in this morning's newspapers that large sums of money are being expended in purchasing machinery for an arsenal, and works of a similar character. I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will prevent the expenditure of large sums of money in this direction until Parliament has approved of the carrying out of the work.",20
9,Mr HUGHES,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"I cannot say on the spur of the moment whether Parliament has or has not approved of the establishment of an arsenal, though I hardly imagine that it would disapprove of such a thing. Without an arsenal we might as well say to the nations of the world, "" Come in, brothers, and take our appointed place."" The material to whioh the honourable member refers was offered to us by the British Government at prices so much below cost that we felt that it would be absurd to refuse it ; but, of course, the transaction could be cancelled, because there has not yet been delivery. I shall see that when we are discussing the Estimates, the fullest information is made available to honourable members. INTER-STATE SHIPPING. FACILITIES FOB SHIPMENT OF COAL. .",20
10,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the released Inter-State shipping from Government control, during the last four or five weeks, has not reached nearly the volume of coal deliveries that were current during the period of control, the Government will ask the Inter-State shipping companies to do their best, at least, to keep up to the facilities in this regard provided during the control of Inter-State shipping by the Government?",20
11,Mr HUGHES,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"Yes , we shall, but I think I may be permitted to remind honourable members that this House almost went on its knees every day, hut the Sabbath-whic h is the best day of all for such a purpose-to ask that, for God's sake they should have no more of Government control. The Government not only listened to, hut heeded those prayers, and abolished Government control. Honourable members have now the full benefit and glorious blessings of private enterprise, which seemed so attractive to them when they were afar off. Now they have got them. MT. MCWILLIAMS - We have not got them.",20
12,Mr HUGHES,INCREASE OF PARLIAMENTARY,"You have got them. However, I shall go down to these comthe panies, and speak to them. What their answer will be is very obvious. They will say that they conduct business on commercial principles. The Government do not do that. The Gowhich vernment have bowels of compassion. by They listen to what honourable members first say. They do not want 30s. for every liament, 20s. they expend. I am very sorry to pression hear what the honourable member for Wakefield has complained of. I shall speak to the shipping companies. NA MELBOURNE.",21
13,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,FEDERAL BUILDINGS IN,I wish to ask the Acting Treasurer a question without notice. There was an announcement made in this morning's newspapers that the Government have in contemplation the erection of offices for the High Court and some other purposes in the city of Melbourne. I shall be glad to know whether Parliament will be consulted before authority is given to begin any of this work.,21
14,Sir JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL BUILDINGS IN,I should think so. I know nothing whatever of the matter to which the honourable member refers. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH. PRESENTATION OF ADDRESS-IN-REPLY.,21

CONSTITUTION ALTERATIONS. . Mr HUGHES - On the 3 r d M a r c h , the honourable member for C a p r i c o r n i a (Mr H i g g s ) asked the following question :Will the Prime Minister give instructions HOLIDAY PAY. for the preparation of a memorandum by the Crown Solicitor showing in parallel columns the respective proposed alterations to the Constitution in the years 1912, 1915, and 1919, and the clauses of the Constitution that would be affected by the proposed alterations if carried, showing in black type in what respect the proposed alterations of 1919 differed from those of previous years?

""WHEAT AND WOOL POOL CREDITS.",23
25,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"On Friday last the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) asked the following question:Can the Minister for the Navy, as Acting Treasurer, let us know on Tuesday the actual position of the credits, in Australia Wheat and Wool Pools? Can ho tell us briefly what the toJ;al credits are? This, would plify matters when we deal with Bill, which must come before us shortly. I promised to furnish the information, which is as follows: The operations of the Wheat Pools have resulted, to date, in an overdraft of Â£1,909,000. Arrangements are now being made for the payment of a further advance, details of which will be published shortly. The Central Wool Committee's only credit in Australia,, other than small balances in the various administrative accounts, is the sum of Â£521,000 received in respect of wool sold on behalf of the British Government to local manufacturers. This amount will be credited to the British Government after the 30th June next. OIL AGREEMENT BILL . Debate resumed from 14th May (vide page 2142), on motion hy Mr TUDORThat the Bill be referred to a Select Committee.",26
26,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yarra) [4.25] - The debate last week was remarkable for the fact that only one of the speakers, - the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), declared himself in favour of the Bill. My honourable friend the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) said he favoured an inquiry, and honourable member after honourable member on the other side urged that further information should be given before Parliament was committed to the agreement.",26
27,Sir ROBERT BEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I raised certain objections, and said I desired further information before I could support the Bill.",26
28,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,And apparently the honourable member has had further information upstairs from the Prime Minister. We have not had it down here.,26
29,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,We have had it on the floor of the House.,26
30,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"No , we have not. The honourable member has no doubt heard the Prime Minister upstairs, hut I did not have that advantage. On Friday, when honourable members on this side of the House were urging the need for further inquiry, the Prime Minister remarked that representatives of the Standard and "" Shell"" companies were in the galleries smiling with satisfaction, and I interjected that the smile on their of the faces was as nothing compared with the smile on the face of the Anglo-Persian simman in the gallery. The incident rethe Supply minded me of the limerickThere was a young lady of Riga, Who smiled as she rode on a tiger; They returned from the ride, with the lady inside, And the smile on the face of the tiger.",26
31,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That does not apply to this situation.,26
32,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It does. The Prime Minister is absolutely "" inside "" the tiger as far aa this agreement is concerned, and the ""tiger"" is the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.",26
33,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am sorry for the tiger, then.",26
34,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The best speech made last week on the Bill was, in my opinion, that made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce). And he ridicialed that part of the agreement relating to freight on crude oil at current rates, also that portion having reference to the amount of capital to be invested in the business. He stated that the Â£250,000 which the Government have agreed to put into the business, and the Â£250^000 to be invested by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, will not be more than sufficient for distribution expenses of the oil business in Australia. The company have taken up land at Fremantle, and have also mads arrangements for land in Port Melbourne for the erection of storage tanks, but there is nothing in the agreement providing that these tanks shall go over to the refinery company. What will be our position if oil Tefined in the Commonwealth refineries has to be stored in tanks belonging to the Anglo-Persian Company? It is quite possible that one-tenth of I d . per gallon per annum will he ample for storage, but until we have in formation' on this subject we ' shall have no idea how much it will actually cost. The Anglo-Persian Company may charge what they like, and no doubt they will do so. We have been told that crude oil has increased in price all over the world. According to the Petrol Commission's report, the price in the United States of America at present is 6 dollars per barrel, and I understand a barrel contains 42 Imperial gallons, making the price about 8d. per gallon. If we can get the crude oil to Australia, not at 8d., but at 6d. per gallon, the 200,000 tons will , at 240 gallons to the ton, cost us about Â£1,200,000. Now on the question of freight, I may inform honourable members that the Anglo-Persian Company are the only people who trade in the Persian Gulf, and, according to the Petrol Commission's Report, they are charging more than Â£ 1 5 per ton freight from Adaban, in the Persian Gulf, to the United Kingdom, and as the distance to Australia is as great, if not greater than, to England, they are not likelv to charge the Commonwealth less. ' The Prime Minister has stated that he will alter that portion cf the agreement relating to price, and that the rate for crude oil will be the same as that charged to the British Government. But the British Government are not buying crude oil at all.",26
35,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , they are. British Government are the Anglo-Persian Company.",27
36,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I know the British Government hold more than one-half the shares in, the company, but it is not likely that they would fix the price f.o.b. Persian Gulf, and then sell it to themselves after refining. If we discover oil in Papua, are we likely to fix the price f.o.b. there? The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Austin Chapman) will bear me out when I say that these house-to-house transactions are always a source of trouble to the Customs Department with companies having establishments in Great Britain or other countries and Australia. Therefore, the Anglo-Persian O i l Company would not be likely to fix the price for crude oil in Persia. Crude oil varies in quality - During the war it was found that the produot of one of the other Combines was' in f i nitely superior for explosives to that obtained from the Persian Gulf. We have been told that 80 per cent, of the toluol used ' for explosives manufactured by the Allies was made ' from , the Sumatra o i l , and the verdict, of the men "" over there "" was that had it not been for the Combine w h i c h 1 the Prime Minister has denounced as "" for e i g n"" making available this product for high explosives, the Allies would not have won the war. That is the position. During the war we spoke of those who fought with us as our Allies, and of those who were against us as the enemy. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) apparently tried to confuse the issue by making it. appear that the Shell Oil Company was a foreign corporation, and, therefore, worthy of any ill-treatment to which' we chose to subject it .",27
37,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That company was working on purely business lines.,27
38,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Undoubtedly . And the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is not in business merely "" for the goiod of its health "" or for the benefit of the country. It is in this enterprise for what it can make out of it .",27
39,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And ' so with, the Imperial Oil Company.",27
40,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The whole of them are in exactly the same position. I urge that we should have further information upon this subject, firstlv, because the agreeThe ment would commit us in respect of too long a period, and, secondly, because of the amount of money involved. Let us assume that the crude oil today is worth 6d. per gallon, or 25 per cent, less than the American crude oil is worth today, according to the report of the Petrol Commission. That Commission was appointed by the British Government. It was not in any way connected' with the oil trade, and its report was denounced by the trade in Great Britain . It proved that the value of crude oil in America at the present time is about 8d. per,gal r Ion, or 6 dollars per barrel, and it is said, that the price is going up. Taking the value of the crude oil at 6d. per gallon j we have a total of Â£1,200,000 in respect of the annual supply from Persia. If we allow freight costs at Â£ 1 5 per ton, or less than is being charged the British Government at the present time, we have in respect of the 200,000 tons an expenditure of Â£3,000,000 per annum, making a total of Â£4,200,000. Thus, during the first' five years we should have a total of Â£21,000,000 if before the end of that period we discovered oil in Papua, and they started to work it. The company's ten years' operation in Papua would represent, in respect to the cost of the oil, Â£1,200,000 per annum. Freight, at Â£7 10s. per ton-or one-half the rate at present charged between Persia and the United Kingdom-would amount to per annum, making a total of Â£2,700,000. Thus, in respect of the ten years' period the amount involved is Â£27,000,000, a grand total of Â£48,000,000, over the fifteen years covered by the agreement. We shall be committed an expenditure of Â£21,000,000 the first five years, assuming, of course, that by that time oil will have been found in Papua, and that the crude oil is still worth 6d. per gallon, or 25 per cent, less than it is today in America. Minister said last week that if we were dissatisfied with the freight charges it would practically be possible for us to bring the oil over in our own ships. Have we any oil-tank steamers available? As a matter of fact, we have none. There are only two or three companies in the world that have "" oil tankers,"" means of this Bill we are saying to those companies today, "" Clear out of Australia.

41,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In respect of some of or the commodities dealt with more than 50 spread per cent, of the trade is to be taken over. The Government propose to favour a to company with which they have entered during into partnership, and to impose' a rate of duty on oil brought in by other companies which will lead to an absolute monopoly. If I happen to be in Parliament when such a proposal is made, I The Prime shall not hold myself bound by this agreement to give the company an absolute monopoly by imposing prohibitive Customs duties, and refund them later to one company only. I shall not be prepared to freeze out every other company by means of Tariff preferences.

I am not going to traverse the ground travelled by me last Tuesday when dealing with this question. I object to the agreement for the previously reasons given last week by the honourable Minister member for Flinders and myself. The British Petrol Commission reported that Reid, the people i u Great Britain who were supposed to be interested in keeping down the price of oil were apThat parently interested in keeping up the price. That will be the effect of this Under agreement. The Commonwealth, as a intends to partner in this enterprise, will be more interested in getting revenue from its operations than in seeing that the people of Australia obtain oil at a reasonable price.",28

I am justified in repeating this statement, because certain insinuations have been made that opposition has been taken to this agreement because some of those outside who are supporting me in my motion for an inquiry are interested parties.

We have been led to believe by the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) that there were to be six amendments in the agreement, and the Prime Minister hinted on Friday last that some amendments would be made. I am anxious to know in what way the measure is to be modified. Mr HECTOR' LAMOND - The honourable member will get it in Hansard.",30
92,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Hansard number containing the Prime Minister's speech on Friday last will not be available until ad- next Saturday, and I would like to have had a copy of the speech delivered by the Prime Minister on Friday last.",30

94,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I am anxious to peruse the amended agreement, and I trust honourable members will meanwhile vote for the appointment of a Select Committee, as further information should be submitted before the Bill is considered in Committee. The particulars before us at present are not sufficient to warrant the .Government entering into' an agreement for such a lengthy period, and in view of all the circumstances it is desirable that further inquiry should be made before the House is asked to pass the Bill in its present form.",30
95,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [4.54]. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) suggests by his motion recala most unusual course, in order that we may obtain further information. The honourable member said a good deal, but very little about the proposed Committee, still less concerning the sources from which it would get its information. Committees are like human beings, neither good nor bad; they move in their appointed way, but the Father of all decides. Where this Committee is to get its information from the honourable member did not tell us. But I , when speaking on the second reading on Friday, told him where he would get it , that is, from those who know all about it . Curiously enough, a volcanic erutption of activity has taken place daring the last few days. Meetings have been held in the capital cities of the Commonwealth, traders have been brought together, and, with singular unanimity, resolutions have been passed asking for this same blessed thing,-more information. Boses do not grow on thistles, nor do meetings of this sort take place without some moving forcebehind them. In this instance, it is ea""sy to locate. Those companies which for many years have exercised a monopoly over this essential to our welfare, and which this cruel Government poses to crush, have appealed to the great heart of the trading companies of Australia, who buy their oil from them and can buy it from nobody else, and these traders, between the devil and the deep sea, have rolled up and sent sixpenny, and, in some cases, shilling, telegrams to honourable members of this Parliament, urging them, in the name of God, to stay their impious hands. When I heard the honourable member the other day-and this is the second time - I have heard him-put up his plea for private enterprise, I was amazed. If I did not know the circumstances in which he finds himself, bereft of any argument, I should be appalled; but, as it is, I am merely' amazed. He says, "" You propose to crush these companies, without which the Allies would never have won the war. There would have been no toluene and no explosives, and. men would not have been shattered to atoms but for the philanthropic efforts of these companies."" He admits that they are not in the business for their health. He says that the Anglo-Persian Company is not in the business for its health. But what has all that to do with the Bill ? The alternative that presents itself ta honourable members is whether, in regard to this vitally necessary commodity - fuel oil and the other refined products of petrolwithout which the Commonwealth qua Commonwealth is powerless, it is better that it should have some control over the price as well as an effective assurance of supplies, or whether we should go on and trust to the tender mercies of commercial companies who are domiciled in foreign countries. The honourable member hasspoken very harshly to me this afternoon about my attitude towards foreign companies. He has suddenly developed a. tenderness of heart - towards the foreigner, that seems a trifle inconsistent, coming from the lips of a Protectionist who first taught me to slip from that narrow footpath of Free Trade upon which my in fan t feet were firmly placed. I remember in the bygone days, when I was a convinced Free Trader, the honourable member coming forward with an absolutely appalling proposal, amounting, in effect, to about 40 to 60 per cent, duty on hats. I have always liked the honourable member, and while, as a matter of principle, I was a convinced Free Trader, yet when he put these hats before me, I fell, and pro- voted for his hats; I was prepared to crush at one fell blow the Austrian, the American, and the Englishman. What more could I have done to show that when it came to a choice between Australia and the rest of the world, I was for Australia? But now, when it is proposed to set up a. refinery in this country to refine o i l , the honourable member says "" No. Let the Standard O i l Company and the "" S h e l l "" group flourish in America or Holland, or wherever they are located."" The honourable member has no ground for his feet to stand on. Let me take his points, one by one. He wants more information? He does not want more information. H is trouble is that he has too much. He knows the facts. What are they? These companies, ever since they came to Australia in the dawn of the petrol age, as I have termed it , haveexploited it to the last penny. Not a trader in Australia dares to raise his voice against them. One trader wrote to me the other day, marking his letter "" private and confidential,"" saying that he had been told to attend a meeting, and* at that meeting everybody had to sign this protest, to which reference has been made. He signed it . He had to do so, but he said, ""I want to tell you that if you can get this agreement through, and the Anglo-Persian people are prepared to supply my wants, they can have my custom."" This amazing activity of the companies throughout Australia against the Bill is the best argument why we should support it. We are asked to support an Australian industry, but the honourable member wants more time to support it. I have heard him get up and advocate the establishment even of such an exotic industry as the manufacture of matches in this country. He never lacks an argument as to why ani industry should be established and encouraged here, buti when it comes to something that is vital to the very existence of the Commonwealth, ho wants more information. have seen a whole Tariff bundled through the House with less information. orable members will have an opportunity of displaying their amazing knowledge on a Tariff very shortly, and there will not be one item in it on which honourable members will not want more information than is required in regard to this agreement. The honourable member, leaving the safe and pleasant path of generalities in which a man may wander at will, incurring no ill consequences, has committed, himself to a certain particular criticism of the Bill. He says, for example, that a monopoly will be established in this country. I have already said in the plainest possible terms that this will not be so, but he himself has said it in more emphatic terms this afternoon. He said that the point that struck him more than anything else in the speech of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) was that the amount of capital these people were to put into the industry, together with that put in by the Commonwealth, would be insufficient to create a monopoly, because it would not supply one-half of the capital necessary for that purpose. Furthermore, it has been observed by honourable members on both sides of the House that not one-half of the petrol, kerosene, and lubricating oil remiired in this country can bo supplied under this proposal. Therefore, the Australian market will be - open to the whole world. That is the first answer to the honourable member's statement. The world can enter upon as good terms as ever, excepting that it will now have a competitor inside AusMr Hughet. tralia, who, at any rate, will be some protection to us against that combined influence of commercialism outside to which we have been exposed so long. The honourable member also said something about freight. He affirmed that the Anglo-Persian Company will be able to make huge profits out of its freight charges, and he mentioned Â£1,200,000 in this connection.",30
96,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That was the value of the crude oil aÂ£ 6d. per gallon.,32
97,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Naturall y the freight would be more than the value of the oil. The honourable member affirmed that the value of the crude oil is such that we cannot even bring it here and refine it locally. He said that we cannot even do that, because the raw material would be too exI pensive, and the freight would be too heavy. But he did not say one word Hon- about the freight upon refined products. Does he think that these gentlemen bring their refined oil products here for nothing, and distribute them to the people as a gift from God ? He said that the Anglo Persian Oil Company was charging Â£15 15s. per ton freight from somewhere in Persia to Great Britain. I do not know where he got his figures.",32
98,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Fro m the report of the Petrol Commission.,32
99,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Anybod y would think that the Petrol Commission was a competitor with the Almighty, and that we had to accept as gospel everything that it says. But it does not follow that what that Commission says is true.",32
100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is the Prime Minister prepared to say that its report is not true?,32
101,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If I thought that it would interest the honourable member I would not mind doing so. As a matter of fact, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company carries its own oil, in its own steamers, and it consigns that oil to itself and to nobody else. It does not carry oil to Great Britain for anybody else; it does not carry any oil except in its own ships, and it carries no oil but its own. What benefit it derives from charging itself Â£15 15s. per ton freight upon that oil, I leave it to the honourable member to determine. But this has no relevance whatever to the point under discussion. If the Anglo Persian Company is likely to charge too much by way of freight, we may then get freight wherever we are able to procure it . The honourable member said that there are no vessels available to carry oil from overseas. Then all I have to say is that we shall have to find oil in Papua. In the meantime we s""hall get oil at a reasonable rate, and freight at the world's rate. If we do not like the world's rate, we can get freight of our own. The honourable member stated that the Commonwealth will have no voice in the matter of the price at which oil will be sold here. I do not know why he said that in face of the amended schedule, which distinctly sets out that "" The refinery company shall sell its oil products at such prices as are fair and reasonable.""",32
102,Mr TUDOS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,In what section of the agreement does that provision appear? I have not seen it .,33
103,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have said that the Commonwealth will determine what is a fair and reasonable price. I do wish that those honourable members who are thirsting for information would, by their demeanour, exhibit more of those indications of a genuine desire for information.",33
104,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,You have not the information that we want.,33
105,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Pra y do not let me interrupt you. These asides with which the honourable member is accustomed to enliven the dull, prosaic tenor of our debates are so very delightful, and help us so much to get on with the public business.",33
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"They are generally true, whereas the Prime Minister's statements are not.",33
107,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In the amended agreement it is laid down quite clearly that'the Commonwealth will decide what price is fair and reasonable, and, after all, that is the thing which really concerns the people of this country. Mr Tunoa - That provision is . not contained in the agreement which has been handed to me.",33
108,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member made allusions, in a way that was very improper, to a meeting which, took place upstairs. He is the last man in the world who ought to object to such meetings, because everything that he says and does is determined by what takes place at meetings held upstairs or downstairs.",33
109,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,No . We meet on ground floor.,33
110,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The honourable membursts ber will be down in the cellar if he on as he has been doing.,33
111,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,That is not original. The late Sir George Reid said that about us.,33
112,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"In speaking of a meeting at which he says this matter was discussed, the honourable member affirmed that certain alterations had been made in the agreement. He was annoyed that they had been made, because they cut the ground from under his feet; yet he now says that he cannot see them anywhere in the agreement.. What am I to do to please him? When I make alterations in the agreement they do not suit him, and he cannot find them. The honourable member, in speaking of this bowelless combine, which in its utter disregard for foreign companies is going to crush them out of existence, rather overstepped the limits of accuracy, because it is set down in paragraph 14 of the bond that the protection to be given to the refinery company is contingent upon its selling oil at a fair and reasonable price. When it ceases to do that, the protection accorded to it wholly disappears. I wish that a similar provision could be applied to all kinds of protection-ever y item of the Tariff. I do not think there is one honourable member who would cast a vote against a proposal of that sort. When local manufacturers or traders, whoever they are, exploit or take advantage of the community under the protection given them, there ought to be some kind of punishment, and that is here provided for under the provisions of this agreement. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) is very much 'concerned about Papua. He says he is not quite sure who owns the oil in that Possession. What has the agreement to do with the oil in Papua ?",33
113,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Everything .,33
114,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It has a great deal to do with the oil in Papua-it has all to do with it . .,33
115,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,How is that?,33
116,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Because Dr Wade and those associated with him could stop production there if they wanted to. On, I know 1",33
117,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Le t me advise the honourable member to retire into that cave the of silence which he keeps with so much: dignity and so much success. These outinto speech, in which the honorgoes able gentleman is at once irrelevant, inaccurate, and not at all amusing, only besmirch his fair reputation. Despite has the interjection, this agreement thing to do with Papua. I may say-becaus e one has to deal w i things as they are-that the oil in Papua' belongs to the people of this country, and it is the intention of this Government that it shall always remain the property of the people of this country, to be sold neither to this refining company papers. nor the Anglo-Persian Company, nor any individual whatsoever, but to be owned for ever as one of the vital they necessities of the public and activities of the Commonwealth. The price of crude oil is fixed under the amended schedule, and the price of the refined product is fixed, and both prices the position. have to be fair and reasonable, with the Commonwealth as judge in both cases. Freights are to be supplied at our option, either by the Anglo-Persian Comtry. pany or by whom we will. The proposal that we should delay passage of this measure in order that may get more information fails; it must fail, because it is obviously a proi posal emanating-thoug h I do not sugnecessary gest for a moment that that is why only the honourable gentleman puts it forpire. ward-fro m those great interests which have too long dominated this country, and which see in the agreement a blow their supremacy. What are the great points we have to decide? The first is, whether we shall 'have an Australian company or a foreign company herewhether we shall have oil refined in Australia or outside Australia, whether we shall give work to our own people or to the foreigner. The second point whether we shall have a company which, in its essence, is British, or one which, its essence, is foreign; the t h i r d , we shall have a company which is not only British, but is also dominated dontrolled by the British Government, as full partners with ourselves, or ther we shall still hand ourselves over, tied hand and foot, without any protecseem tion, to the foreigner; and the last point is, whether, since we have to depend the Navy for defence, we shall take hold of this great opportunity to protect ourselves, and secure ample storage for crude oil around this coast. These are the four points on which honourable members are to form their judgment. One word more, and I have done. is said that the Anglo-Persian Mr Hughes. already, in anticipation of this agree has noment, bought land at Fremantle. However, Mr TUDOR - I know that the company th has purchased land there; it has a site there and another at Port Melbourne.",33
118,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"And the honourable gentleman, in order to support the statement, told U3 that he saw it in the news",34
119,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,There is no doubt about the company having a site at Fremantle; have applied for a Bill to the Westcorporate ern Australian Parliament.,34
120,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Anybod y who wants greater proof than that would be difficult to please. However, let me explain What has happened is this: I am told that the Anglo-Persian Company has made, or is making, arrangements for leasing land in this counB u t that has nothing to do with this agreement. What is proposed is that the there shall be storage for oil for the we British Navy in certain parts, where the China Squadron, or any other, can o i l f circumstances require. That is a very thing, which is being done, not here, but right throughout the E m That is the answer to the honourable member, and, I think, a good one. What we require is oil for our own Navy, at and the chance to control supplies, control prices, and prevent the community from exploitation. We have ample in formation-u s much information, at any rate, as we should be able to get from a Select Committee, which can hope for in formation only from one of two sources. is, We follow an admirable example-that of the British Government. The Leader in of the Opposition said that the Commonwhether wealth would be more concerned about getting profits .than in reducing prices; and but in the next breath he told us that the Geelong Woollen Mill s sell cloth at a whemuch lower price than do private firms. Those two statements, when put together, a trifle inconsistent. We are more likely to get oil at a reasonable rate when on the Government has control.",34
121,Mr MATHEWS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,How ?,34
122,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Leader of the Opposition said that we have only three directors, while the company has four. But the Commonwealth qua CommonIt wealth, and not the directors, will decide Company what is a fair and reasonable price.",34

HUGHES - If the Leader of the Opposition has notan amended copy, I am sorry; but it is not my fault. Clause 13A providesThe refinery company shall sell its oil products at such prices as are fair and reasonable. Honourable members have my assurance that the Commonwealth is to fix what is "" fair and reasonable""; but, if that assurance is not sufficient, and if the insertion of the words "" considered by the Commonwealth "" is necessary, I would be prepared to put them in . I assure the House that the Solicitor-General and myself went into this matter very carefully,and we think that a fair interpretation of the contract means "" fair and reasonable in the opinion of the Commonwealth."" Still, I should be willing to make it read, "" at such prices as are considered fair and reasonable by the Commonwealth.""",35

131,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Franklin) [5.29]. - The Prime Minister has stated that the choice is between an Australian company and a foreign company. To me it is nothing of the kind. To me, it is a question of the safety of the Commonwealth in making an agreement which will have a vital influence on perhaps one of the most important industries in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has shown by his remarks that he has not taken the trouble to read the one document where he can get information on this subject- I mean the report of the Petrol Commission, which dealt with these matters ini Great Britain lately. Por the honourable member to gibe at a Commission such as that, is an insult to the. intelligence of the House, and shows the depths to which some men. will stoop in order to carry their way through the House.

135,Mr JACKSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,He told us all about it r l y covers on the second reading.,35
136,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"When honormembers learn the rules of debate, and the procedure of the House, they will find that principles should be discussed in the House, and that the details of those principles should be dealt with in Committee. We have been told of a clause which it is said affords the protection that some of us ask for. 14 of the agreement, as amendedthe only clause that I have seen in the new form-provide s that where the Commonwealth believes that the company is charging an unfair price it may open the Customs House door, and allow competition. Competition from whom? From one of the greatest monopolies in the world. In spite of everything that has been said, the Anglo Persian Oil Company does control the Refinery Company. It has a majority of four out of seven on the board of directors. Whilst the Commonwealth retains the majority of the shares, it can elect only its own three directors, while t h * other four, comprising the majority of the board, are elected by the company.",35
137,Mr MAXWELL,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"That is an argument against the second reading of the Bill , and not in favour of the appointment .of a Select Committee.",36
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I shall be glad if the honourable member will allow me to make my own speech in my own way. The Commonwealth Government has been fighting a Combine. If honourable members look up the speeches of the Prime Minister and the then Minister for the  bitterly they resented the attempt made by the Inchcape Shipping Combine to crush the Commonwealth line of steamers. Inchcape, who controls that Combine, is the man who represents the British Government on this Combine. cape combine entered into an alliance with the Morgan combine to control the shipping of the world. Who can say that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, under the presidency of Lord Inchcape, will not enter into a similar combine here with the Amerioan oil companies to control Che oil supplies of the world ?",36
139,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"He is prevented from doing that. Mr Mc WILLLAMS - Y o u give, the company a majority of four on the directorate, and say that if oil is not being sold by it at a fair and reasonable price, the door of the Customs House will be opened to admit competition. It is reasonable to argue that Lord Inchcape, who has engineered in Great Britain a combine with an American shipping trust7-may, in Australia, engineer another combine with the American Oil Trust. What conditions in the agreement would prevent him from doing that? Clause Sir ,JOSEPH COOK - The conditions in the agreement with the parent company, and the conditions in this agreement, would prevent it . Lord Inchcape does not control the parent company. The honourable member holds him up as the controller of the whole concern, but he is not that.",36
140,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The agreement with the parent company has no bearing on the question. The Petrol Commission has shown that the rate of freight-no t that charged to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but that charged to the British Government-is Â£ 1 5 10s.

141,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I remind the House that the question before the Chair at the present time is that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee; but we are really having another second-reading debate, after the motion for the second reading of the Bill has been carried.

I regret that you did not an hour ago make your discovery of the character of the debate, because I am replying to statements which fell from the Prime Minister.",36
143,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The general purport of the Prime Minister's speech was an statutorily argument against the reference of the Bill to a Select Committee, on the ground that he had endeavoured to meet objections raised during the second-reading debate by drafting certain amendments which, would be proposed in Committee, and in cidentally, he referred to some of those amendments. But it would be improper to allow, at this stage, the discussion of those .amendments, they being purely matters for the Committee of the whole House to consider.",36

That is what I understood the Prime Minister to do. He may have been led by interjections to go more fully into matters than he would otherwise have done; but it would certainly be irregular to allow now a general disoussion on proposals which will properly come up for discussion in Committee of the whole House, and which can there be discussed in every detail.",37

149,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I accept your ruling , Mr Speaker. The statement of the Prime Minister that the only information that could be obtained by a Select Committee would be the evidence of interested parties is at variance with what I know. My object in pressing for a Select Com.mittee is not to hear what may be said by the representatives of the American Oil Trust-if I were on the Committee I would not want them to be summonedbut to get the evidence of experts. This agreement has been drawn up, presumably, by the persons whodrew up the - shipping agreement and other agreements under which the Commonwealth has been so unfortunate. In regard to all these agreements, the Commonwealth has been ,let down badly, and has lost, I think, most of the cases that it has entered into. It is not clear what the agreement means. If , as the Prime Minister has stated, the Commonwealth is to be the sole arbiter of the price at which oil shall be sold in Australia, the monopoly which some of us fear will be prevented; but there is a yet greater monopoly to fear. The extent to which this company will control discoveries of oil in Australia and its Territories has not been made clear.",37
150,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,It will not control them at all. You have been told that half-a-dozen times.,37
151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have discussed the matter with persons whom I regard as experts, and who, though not in terested in this arrangement in any way, are distinctly favourable to it , and they say that the extent to which the company will dominate operations in Papua and German New Guinea is not clear. I think that it ought to be made clear.",37
152,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The statement that some one, who is not named, but who is favourable to the Bill , is not clear about the effect of the agreement, does not carry us anywhere.",37
153,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have not the permission of the person whom I have in mind to give his name before the House; but I ask honourable members to remember that we are tying up the industry for fifteen years, and that an adequate supply of oil is essential, not only for city industries and pleasures, but also fOT rural occupations. I welcome the introduction of an oil refinery into Australia; but there are certain doubts in my mind whioh I wish to have cleared up. I do not wish to .place our oilsupplies in the hands of some outside combine, especially in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is now fighting a shipping combine, which is trying its best to strangle our line of Government steamers, and whose chairman has entered into an alliance with the Morgan 'Shipping Combine of America to dominate the shipping of the world. As this man is also at the head of the concern with which it is proposed that we should enter into an agreement for the supply of oil, I dread the effect of his influence on our oil supplies. Lord Inchcape controls the biggest combine in the world, the Shipping Combine that beat the - British, American, and Australian Governments. It is now fighting our Commonwealth line of steamers, and causing them to come out here half empty. It is. doing its best to prevent them from securing a ton of cargo. Therefore, it is our duty to see that the Commonwealth does not again enter into a contract fatal to its interests. I shall vote for sending the Bill to a Select Committee. No harm can be done by a short delay.",37

160,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have' given notice of an amendment which I hope will be accepted if the Bill is not sent to a Select Committee. I want to make it perfectly clear that there shall be no monopoly. Clause 14 of the Schedule means nothing. It provides for the opening of the door of the Customs House; but an may be made between the O i l Trusts to prevent competition. The amendments spoken of by the Prime Minister may remove some of the objections to the Bill , but the measure, - as it stands, does not make clear the position of the Commonwealth and of the company in regard to discoveries in Papua and British New Guinea.

I shall not approve of the Anglo-Persian Company having any control whatever of those appointed to investigate the possibilities of Papua for the production of oil. If we could appoint some one outside to go into the matter I would be quite satisfied, because under this agreement the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's crude oil will be used until we are in a position to refine our own crude supplies, drawn either from the mainland of Australia or from the Territories. I wish to help the Government in the production of oil in Australia, but if that cannot be brought about at once I want to assist in the matter of securing refineries here. However, we should have all the evidence cerning the suitability of the product and the economic possibilities of refining in Australia before we bind ourselves hand and foot for fifteen years.

A Select Committee should particularly inquire into three things-int o Lord Inchcape's association with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; into the matter of the inferiority of their crude oil; and with respect to who shall fix a fair and reasonable price.

192,Mr BAMFORD,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Herbert) [6.8] - I rise not to criticise the Bill-becaus e think the agreement is a good one-bu t make a statement which is rather in the nature of a personal explanation. I desire to make clear my own connection with exploration for oil in Papua. When, in 1916, I was appointed Minister for External Affairs-the Department is now known as that of Home and Territoriesone of the first matters to which I directed my attention had to do with prospecting for oil in Papua. There had been a great deal of dissatisfaction concerning these activities, and I , personally, shared in that dissatisfaction. The fact is that the position of the Commonwealth in respect to oil investigations has been unfortunate. When I made my first inquiries I discovered that up to that stage we, had expended about Â£60,000 in exploration work, with a return of about 2,000 gallons of oil. That was very poor, of course; but at least it indicated that there was oil in Papua, although it did not determine whether or not it was there in payable quantities. It was still considered that scientific and practical investigations might discover payable decon- posits. Soon after I had assumed office the representatives of two separate syndicates waited upon me to ascertain whether private enterprise would be allowed to prospect for oil in Papua. So far as I was concerned, I said ""Yes."" One of these gentlemen represented a Californian company, and the other a local syndicate. Both concerns were apparently in a position to conduct exploration work on a practical basis. I went into the matter very thoroughly, and formulated a scheme which provided for the prospecting to be undertaken in such a way as to secure the Commonwealth Government in every conceivable direction. The information at my disposal was insufficient' for me to know whether the oil was likely to be struck in the form of a continuous stream, or lode, or in reservoirs. In either case, however, I had arranged that there should be areas of 5 square miles allotted, and that every alternate area should be held by the Commonwealth Government, so that we would be protected, no matter whether the oil was discovered in lode formationthat is to say, in a continuous canal - o r in subterranean reservoirs. I set forth that the Commonwealth should have' first call upon all oil produced, and that the price should not exceed 3d. per gallon, which would amount to about 10s. per barrel on the basis of I 40 gallons to the barrel; also that the comto' pany should build such wharfs as might be necessary, and should lay a pipe line from the source of oil supply to the wharfs on the coast; further, that it should find its own tank steamers. sentatives of the syndicates were quite willing to accept all that I had laid down, and all this was to be done without cost in any way to the I then wrote to the Legislative"" Council in Papua, submitting my proposition, asking for concurrence. I was informed, however, that that body could not concur, that it would not agree to my proposition, because, if the field were developed by private enterprise, the labour thereout would be drawn from the rubber and cocoanut plantations, 'latter would be left short handed. sponded that no matter by whom the oilfield was developed the same would arise, providing prospecting proved to be successful. Prom all appearances, then, the curtain was what promised to be a commercial drama; but followed the tragedy. Before I had received a reply to my second to the Legislative Council in Papua I had departed from office. Nothing further, so - far as I could ascertain, was done; and that was three years ago last Had my project been given effect to, the oil industry in Papua might have been flourishing today. Of course, I want to - make it clear that I could not have overridden the dictum of the Papuan Council without the sanction of the Commonwealth Cabinet, and that up to that stage I had submitted nothing to my colleagues, because I desired first to have all the facts, marshalled in order that might be in a position to accept or reject a complete and definite project. I say, nothing more was done after my retirement. I have often wondered why, and have come to the conclusion perhaps, notwithstanding his versatility, and despite his speechles and voluminous the subject of boring for oil was never once mentioned or by Edmund Burke. That is the only reason that I can attribute - failure of my successor in office to go on with the Papuan oil project. been proceeded with, this rright never have been Three years ago we "".vere in dire need of oil, and it is not impossible that today we might have been floating prosperously along a stream of oil emanating from our Mr - Bamford. lown Papuan fields. Wherefore, there would have been no necessity to enter The repre- into an agreement with any outside organization. I have nothing to say against Dr Wade in respect of his scientific attainments, Government. but I cannot help feeling that scientific attainments and practical knowledge are and seldom found together. I say this in justification of my actions in endeavouring to develop and open up the Papuan oil-fields.

194,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It "" is necessary first to have the brains before they can be used. I am opposed to the motion to refer the B i ll to a Select Committee, because it is of vital importance that this great question of discovering oil should be.settled as soon as possible. We must find oil deposits in the Commonwealth territory. It is almost criminal on the part of honourable members to take any action, either here or elsewhere,.that will lead to delay. No sound reason has been-advanced to justify the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this matter. We now have all the safeguards that are necessary, for this afternoon the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) told the Leader ' of the Country party (Mr . MCWilliams) that if he were not satisfied with the Ministerial interpretation of the clause relating to the price to be fixed for crude oil-and the Prime Minister's interpretation is backed UP by the opinion of Sir Robert Garram, who does not make many mistakes-the n the Government are willing that the clause shall definitely state that the Commonwealth shall fix the price. What more can we ask? And is it not better to be associated with a company that belongs to the Empire?",42

196,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"We know what happens when Governments go into ventures of this kind. We have been fooling about in Papua for a long time without any definite results. We want experts, and we cannot expect people like those connected with, the Anglo-Persian O i l Company to go into this business for the good of their health. They want to establish a commercial concern. history of the company shows that it is comprised of men who understand the business, and, as I have just said, it belongs to the' Empire. Consequently it is inexpedient to do anything that is likely to lead to delay. The appointment of a Select Committee would mean delay, and for that reason I intend to support the Government.",43

But the time for that sort of thing has passed. Our financial position is such that sentimental considerations must be put on one side. We must endeavour to do something practical. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has moved to Tefer the Bill to a Select Committee, for the purpose of eliciting further information with regard to the agreement, and during the debate this afternoon, by a marvellous piece of conjuring, the amended schedule was placed in honourable members' hands. I was so surprised and annoyed that in speaking plainly I gave utterance to words at which you, Mr . Speaker, took offence. It is not in my nature to insult anybody, but I think the circumstances warranted a strong statement. I am informed, on credible authority, that the Anglo-Persian O i l Company's crude o i l is not a first-class article, or at least that there is better. And, moreover, I believe that the Anglo Persian Company draw their chief supply from wells that are not under the protection of the British flag, so that it is possible that foreign Governments may be in a position to place an embargo on the output.",43

Those who are interested in this matter have written to me on the subject, and in interviews with me have made statements which, I think, warrant honourable members in giving more mature consideration to this agreement before it is ratified. I .can understand the Prime Minister's confidence because of the environment in which he has moved * The in Great Britain during recent years. But he appears to have lost sight of the fact that he is now in Australia, and that we are dealing with what is purely an Australian matter. If this agreement is heaven-born, then mot much harm can be done if it is scrutinized by members of a Select Committee, to make sure that it contains nothing that is likely to be detrimental to Australian interests. I do - I not know whether members realise their position as representatives of the people.'

201,Mr WEST,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"When dealing with the question of the. freight on the oil from the wells to the refinery, the Prime Minister, in reply, to an interjection made by the Leader of the Country party (Mr MCWilliams), said that under the agreement the rates must be fair and reasonable. The determination of what i9 a fair and reasonable rate to charge for anything depends upon whether one is a buyer or a seller. We ought to have more information on this subject. If the company fixed upon exorbitant freights, it seems to me that under this agreement we could not object to them, and that the Government would be powerless to take action if it were dissatisfied with the way in which the oil was shipped to the refinery - It is all very well to say that we could use our own steamers, but the wells from which the oil is at present being obtained are in other countries over which we have no control, and we might not be permitted to use our own vessels. The schedule to the Bill is so full of anomalies that it might well be described as "" A Schedule of Anomalies for the most part Telling against Australia."" We ought to exercise the greatest caution'in accepting an agreement involving, as this does, a gigantic financial deal and binding us down for fifteen years. We have no idea what Australia's future oil supplies may be. The whole position is so uncertain that there ought to be no hostility to the proposal to appoint a Select Committee to ascertain who are the moving spirits in this enterprise, and whether a better agreement could not be drafted. If these oil people are the monuments of perfection they claim to he, and are so anxious to help Australia, they have nothing to fear from the appointment, of a Select Committee. I received this morning the following telegram from Sydney: Ait meeting of New South Wales oil trade hold Sydney today, following resolution passed:-""In view far-reaching effects of proposed agreement between Commonwealth Government and Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the oil trade-som e thirty firms-urge s upon members the necessity of the matter being referred to Select Committee of the House for further serious inquiry on behalf of the oil trade.""",44

The original agreement, as brought before the House, was found to be so dangerous that a caucus meeting of Ministerial supporters was held, and drew the attention of the Government to certain defects in it , with the result that a further agreement was drawn up and put before the House in some mysterious way - In business phraseology* it seems to be suggested that the Government have "" f all e n into at r a p .

M . Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia, or quite another man. The right honourable gentleman adduced no argument in favour of the ratification bf the agreement. In effect, what he said was that, as Lord Inchcape, the Duke of So-and-so, and several others were connected with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and they were such jolly good fellows, we ought to sign the agreement. I hope that honourable members will not be influenced by sentimental considerations, but will deal as practical business men with this question, which is deserving of the best that is in them. The Prime Minister, in supporting the agreement this afternoon, suggested that it was loaded with benefits for the Commonwealth, and in his enthusiasm he waved his arms as wildly as if he were conducting a musical entertainment. I hope that the House will recognise the wisdom of sending the whole matter to a - Select Committee for inquiry. If that is done, and the Committee recommends the ratification of the agreement, no one will be better pleased than I shall be. My own belief is that inquiry will show that it should not be adopted in its present form . We are the custodians of the all public purse, and should be watchful of the people's interests. If any honourable member were asked to sign a contract for the sale of his house, he would seek advice before doing it. Yet we find some honourable members prepared, without any inquiry whatever, to approve of an agreement involving a commodity that is the bread and butter of industrial life! I hope that my appeal will not be in vain. The proposed inquiry would not occupy much time.' It would be unnecessary for the Committee to go to the United States of America to prosecute its investigations. It would simply examine the agreement with the object of ascertaining whether it was in the best interests of Australia, and would inquire as to who were concerned in the enterprise.

The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) stated that the Government would have to continue the policy of assisting and developing the Australian shale oil industry. I fear, however, that by the establishment of this enterprise we shall practically extinguish the whole of the shale oil companies now operating in Australia. The Prime Minister contends that the agreement will not interfere with them in the slightest degree. There does not, however, seem to be any jeason for rushing this agreement through the House. If it were referred to a Select Committee that Committee could make the fullest inquiries in regard to our present shale oil industries, and also as to the personnel of the Anglo Persian Company. I have not had time to carefully consider - the whole schedule - to the Bill, but I have perused it, and can find in it no provision for empowering a private company to establish oil refineries here and to import its crude oil free of duty. If any other private company established refineries here, and attempted to import crude oil, it would thus be crushed out of - existence by this monopoly. That appears to be the stumbling block to the ratification of the agreement. If the Government are anxious that Australia shall have an adequate supply crude oil, it has an excellent opportunity to develop the oil-fields of the Commonwealth. There is now in operation [90] New South Wales a company with 250 square miles of undeveloped oil shale country. The shale is positively the richest in the world. One ton of shale will produce something like 102 gallons of crude oil. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) should be familiar with the territory to which I am referring.",45

When the deposits there were first opened up, the company was not in a position to treat crude oil, and it was not until after a period of four or five years had elapsed, when Mr John Fell took control, and when experimental retorts were erected, that the venture began to make any progress. To-day the industry is in a position to compete with other industries of a similar character.",45

I do not think there is much justification for the Bill, because I cannot see what we are - to gain by having an o i l refinery here. Enormous gain would result if sound, practical efforts were made to prove the existence of oil in Australia. For a great number of years, we have been spending money in Papua with bad results, because the work has been undertaken by the Government, instead of endeavouring to carry on the work under a political Minister. I commend them now for taking steps to utilize the services of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who have special experts and geologists who thoroughly understand the business. I am also pleased that, instead of adhering to the terms of the memorandum., which provided for retaining the field of exploration - to Government efforts, such a policy has been renounced, and the Government are now prepared to allow outsiders to prospect for oil in that field. Before we talk about establishing a refinery, we should give every assistance to people to prospect, not only in Papua, but also on the mainland, to see if oil can be developed here. Once we discover oil in Australia, we shall soon have a refinery established. I think! the iGovernment would be justified in giving a bonus or financial assistance such as is given to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, for the purpose of endeavouring to establish such refineries here, but our first step should be to do all we possibly can to .discover o i l . Some of my constituents recently paid a very large fee .to one of the best oil experts in Australia for a geological report on certain portions of Western Australia, and he gave a very favourable report. Other persons are applying for land in. the Northern Territory, believing from reports and indications that it would be possible to obtain oil there. If these people are prepared to spend their money, and if it can be certified by a geological Department that the conditions are in any way favourable for the discovery of oil, the Government will be justified in spending many thousands of pounds in the purchase of drills, which could be lent out to parties, prepared to guarantee the expenditure of a certain amount of money in prospecting work. In my opinion, the offer of a large bonus is worthless. Let ue give assistance to prospectors. However, as we are dealing with something novel, which carries with it many, important functions and conditions, and as I cannot see any justification for urgency, I strongly support-the motion to send the Bill to a Select Committee, so that we may be able to secure advice, and see that the measure gives the best possible protection to the in terests of the people of Australia.",48
257,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Maribyrnong) [8.43]. - On e of the questions uppermost in the consideration of this matter is where the great bulk of the oil supplies of the world come from , and another is what are the principal influences at work in keeping the price of oil at such a high figure. I must again refer to that most valuable report of the Committee of the House of Commons on petrol supplies from . Great Britain . It would have, been of great benefit to honourable members if the Government had had the whole of the Committee's report printed, because it is so educative. Unfortunately, I do not think the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) had taken the trouble to scan it when he introduced the Bill ; otherwise he would not have given expression to so many erroneous ideas. One' paragraph of the Committee's report says The greater bulk of the petrol landed in country (Great Britain) at the present time price. is produced by American, Dutch, or Mexican companies, which are outside the control His Majesty's Government. It is proved up to the h i bulk of the o j supplies of the world are under the control of American, Mexican, rates and Dutch companies. It is admitted that had. it not been for the supply re> ceived from these quarters, Great Britain would have been bankrupt in o i l supplies during the recent war. If this agreement be adopted, it will give the Anglo Persian Company a big Government backing and a considerable monopoly so far as supplies of oil for Australia are concerned. Now it has been admitted upon all sides that that company, either from its Persian wells or from any other source, cannot supply one-fourth of the requirements of B r it a in and Australia ",49
258,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is that not due to lack of refineries?,49
259,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The facts have been elicited by a Committee consisting of members of the House of Commons and of oil experts. This Committee grew out of the Profiteering Act which was passed by the British Parliament in 1919. To it was allotted the duty of inquiring into the petrol supplies of the world. It had the best possible evidence at its command, and, after going into the whole question exhaustively, it arrived at certain conclusions. Amongst other things, it concludes that one of the factors contributing to the high cost of o i l is the Shipping Ring. Now, who .is one of the chief instruments of that great Shipping Combine? The very man who occupies the position of representative of the British Government in connection with this Anglo-Persian O i l Company- I refer to Lord Inchcape. He is at the head of this great Shipping Combine, and, to a large extent, he and his associates can control the freights of the world. It was admitted in evidence before the Committee which investigated this matter that one of the chief factors in the high price of oil is the cost of transferring it either from the oil wells or the refineries to its various destinations. The Committee says in its reportThe .recent advance to 3s. Sid. in the price of petrol is, according to a public announcement, largely based on the increase in freight, although it is stated in the announcement referred to that only one-half of the present this nominal market freight is included in that of And who is it that is charging these high freights? In this connection the Coml t that the great mittee saysFigures furnished by the Ministry of Shipping show that early in December, 1.919, the between the United Kingdom and the northern ports of the United States were 150s. per ton, between the United Kingdom and Trinidad 170s., between the United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf 210s., and between the United Kingdom and Borneo 280s. The .Shipping Comibine, of which Lord - Inchcape is the head, and the Persian Oil Company to a large extent control freights. Honourable members, I am sivre, are grateful to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) for the splendid way in which he dealt with this question the other evening. He said that he could only see two ways by which the Anglo Persian Company can make a profit out of this agreement. It will certainly make a profit out of the production of crude oil, but it will derive a much greater profit out of the freights from Persia to Australia. What matter, then, if the Commonwealth has a bite at the small portion of the cherry which is left? Freights are dearer from Persia to B r it a in than they are from the United States to Britain , or from Trinidad to Britain .

Evidently he is prepared to listen to what takes place at the caucus meeting of his party, and to swallow whatever the Prime Minister may say. Even the British Government cannot control the supplies of oil that enter Britain today. What does the Committee to which I have alluded say in this connection % It says that the only way of rescuing the British public is by the League of Nations assuming control of the matter. The British Government have not been able to keep down freights, have not been able to leg-rope Lord Inchcape. I believe that the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this matter would not delay the passage of this Bill three weeks.",50

267,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"It will be two years before the proposed refinery is established in Australia. In three weeks, a Select Committee could obtain sufficient information to satisfy even the most critical honourable member Then, if certain amendments were suggested by it , the House would readily accept them so long as they safeguarded the interests of the Commonwealth, and the passage of the Bill would thus be expedited. In the absence of such an inquiry, there will be grave suspicion that everything connected with this agreement is not quite above board. What will happen during the - two years which must elapse before the Anglo-Persian Company is able to refine a gallon of oil in Australia ? A f t e r the refinery has been established, the company will supply us with only a portion of the oil that is required to carry' on in dustry in Australia. Every day, in every part of the world, the demand for petrol is increasing; and the day may soon dawn when America will put its long arras pracI tically around, the whole of the American supplies.",50
268,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Petrol Commission says that.,50
269,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Yes , and it predicts a world famine in petrol. That being eo, we should hesitate to shut out supplies of oil from Australia. There is the shale That oil industry here which we should encourage more than we have encouraged it in the past. We are assured by those who are interested in it that that in dustry will be seriously imperilled, if it be not actually wiped out, if this agreement be adopted. I would like to give - the representatives of the shale oil in dustry an opportunity of stating the reasons why they fear that it will be ruined if this agreement be approved. I ask honourable members to look at the amended agreement, though I understand that you, sir, will not allow me to deal with that.",50
270,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH, In Committee honourable members will be able to deal with it .,51
271,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"But before we reach that stage, a most important matter will have been decided, namely, whether this Bill is to be referred to a Select Committee. It is rather unfortunate that we are unable to discuss the details of the agreement before we arrive at a decision on that question.",51
272,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Order ! I must again remind honourable members that this is neither a second-reading debate nor a debate in Committee upon the Bill. So far, I have allowed a considerable amount of latitude; and what honourable members have really been doing is to go over a lot of matter which has already been thoroughlythreshed, out in the House. When they desire to go farther, and to debate details of the schedule, and possibly details of suggested amendments, obviously, I must draw the line, because those are matters which can be dealt with only in Committee. When we reach that stage, honourable"" members may dissect every word, every letter, and every comma bf the ' Bill , or any proposed amendments to the Bill , if they - so desire. quently It will not be in order at this stage of the proceedings to debate the matters to which I have alluded. The proposal is to refer this Bill to a Select Committee, when such matters would be freely open to discussion, as they would also be in a Committee of the whole.",51
273,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Unfortunately , the numbers appear to be up. It is set out in the Bill that this Anglo-Persian Company is to use its best endeavours to obtain a full supply of oil for Australia. It may very soon report to the Prime Minister that it has used.its best endeavours in the direction indicated, and without success. But if , on the other hand, it obtains a full supply of oil for Australia, it will be obliged to go for that supply to the very people against whom honourable members opposite have inveighed so vigorously. If the Bill be referred to, a Select Committee, I hope that that body will examine representatives of the Vacuum Oil Company, of the Standard Oil Company, of the Shell Company, of the Anglo-Persian Company, and other' experts who may be available. I understand, for example, that Dr 1 Wade is still in Australia. If honourable members' were sitting in judgment upon any case, would they limit the evidence to one side? I claim that if any information can be obtained, even fro m an enemy source, that information should be made available. I should have no hesitation in telling any Select Committee appointed to get evidence where it could, so long as it obtained necessary information, and surely some information could be "" obtained from the men to whom I am referring. A Select Committee appointed by this House would no doubt possess sufficient brains to judicially examine evidence, and the whole inquiry could be completed' in twoi or three weeks, and the report presented to Parliament when we meet again after the adjournment for the Royal visit. The question to be decided is a momentous one toAustralia, and we ought to see, when starting a business of this kind, that the foundations are firmly laid. There are columns in the Times of the 2nd March this year which disclose to me, at any rate, that we are in some danger if , without inquiry, we close with thiscompany. What is being done in other parts of the world where the oil industry is developing by leaps and bounds? In Mexico there are not fewer Conse- than 150 American companies obtaining and exporting oil, and if we depart from the State system of developing our oil resources wÂ© ought to allow other companies to send their experts to Australia. Personally, I should like to see the best experts employed, because, if we could get twenty companies to establish themselves in Australia, it would not-be long before we should be self-contained so far as oil is concerned. If this were so, we in Australia would be able to rejoice in the fact that by the development of our oil wells we were conferring immense benefits, not only on ourselves, but on all the world.",51
274,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Hlawarra) [? .'2] - The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has expressed the joy with: which he would welcome twenty companies to explore the Australian .oil resources. But Australia has been open to these'companies all along, and one result of our neglect to do anything to provide ourselves' with oil was that petrol and other oils that come from petroleum were exceptionally dear in the Commonwealth all through the war period. One would think, to listen to some honourable members, that this was a new question suddenly sprung upon us; but those who follow the news of A u s t r a ber that the operations of the American Oil Combines in this country were fully investigated in the Courts of New South Wales only a year or two ago. It was shown that these Combines had made enormous profits at the cost of this country during the war neriod, and when the Necessary Commodities Commission fixed a price which was considered fair, the Combines boycotted the State until the price was lifted to a level they thought they had a right to demand. Now, when the Commonwealth Government submit an agreement with a company which will provide, at any rate, some cheap oil, we have, from 'Unexpected quarters, these extraordinary arguments against the proposal. I was astounded to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) say that, because the Government would hold half the stock, they will become a party to the extortion of high prices. I never heard a more damaging argument against any proposal to nationalize an industry. If the Government would do such a thing, are they not just as likely to'extort high prices through the medium of other industries they might wholly control ?",51
275,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Government might do it under cover of the company.,52
276,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The argument is so artificial as to suggest that honourable members are not expressing their convictions, but looking around for some means of bolstering up the case for opposition companies, it is, unhappily, the fact that whenever an effort is made to deal with any of the big interests, we find-without the slightest suspicion of corruption or collusion-that those who wish to oppose everything the Government may do become naturally the mouthpiece of those interests.",52
277,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Is this one of the Government's anti-profiteering moods?,52
278,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I ways in my anti-profiteering ""mood""; I do not change it simply because the Bill to deal with it bears the name of some man I dislike. I venture to say that if this Bill had borne the name of the Leader of the Opposition instead of that of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), or some other Minister, we should not have heard the speeches we have been under the painful necessity of listening to in this debate -..^ - I have been waiting to hear one sound reason advanced for sending this Bill to a Select Committee. We heard reasons li a w ^ remem- last week in the House and in the lobbies, but those reasons have all been dissipated into thin air; and we now hear great fear expressed that a giant monopoly is being established. We in Australia have suffered under at least two oil monopolies for many years. In New South Wales a Labour Ministry introduced a proposal to deal with the matter by establishing a State monopoly, not of crude oil, but of petrol; and that proposal was supported, not only by the Labour party, but by a large section opt-' side. The proposal now before us is to refer to a Select Committee the agreement which the Government have entered into subject, to the approval of this House. The agreement does not establish a monopoly; and there is nothing in the way of the establishment of a monopoly to inquire into. The contract is to deliver certain quantities of crude oil yearly, and that quantity is not sufficient to meet the demands of Australia; thus the contract can have little effect on competing companies so long as their prices are as satisfactory as the prices of others. If the prices of those competing companies are better for the public than those charged by the Anglo-Persian Company the trade will soon go to them. But the fear that the public are going to be charged more is not the reason that we are inundated with expensive telegrams and literature-the fear is that the presence of a company controlled by the Government will bring down the price of oil, and that the competing companies will have to leave the market or sell at the same figure. The whole agitation against the Bill is founded on an idea that by the establishment of refineries in am al- Australia, where our people may find employment, we are striking a blow at the monopoly prices to which the Commonwealth has hitherto had to submit. That is not a matter for a Select Committee, but a matter on which every one who has followed the profiteering operations in this country can come to a speedy determination.",52
279,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Shoul d we not have made more progress if the Government had undertaken the business themselves?,52
280,Mr HECTORLAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"If the object of the Leader of the Opposition is to get from a Select Committee a report in favour of nationalization, the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine') knows that such a proposal has no chance at all of being accepted by this Parliament. That choice is not open to Parliament; the choice is between the Bill as presented and no attempt to control the price of oil. suggestion that we are to refer this matter to a Select Committee in order to get a report in favour of nationalization is an idle pretence which I do not think appeals to many honourable members. The practical suggestion is made that we should have our own refinery; but there is nothin"" to prevent the Shell Company or any other company from starting business here. Not many years ago, when I was on the same platform as honourable members opposite, the Standard O i l Company was an organization of which we spoke most scathingly; but today, apparently, the interests of that company are the inspiring theme of the opposition to the Bill . The Standard O i l Company is quite free to open refineries in Australia, give employment to our people, and sell us cheap oil if it can. There is not a line ini the Bill which removes the power of the Commonwealth to encourage exploration for oil. The agreement has nothing to do with exploration for o i l : that is dealt with inan entirely different agreement, which does not bind the Commonwealth to any one company. An y one of the twenty companies which the honourable member for Maribyrnong pictures in his imagination is free to explore for oil in Australia as much as it likes; the agreement establishes no monopolygives no monopoly rights. Reference has been made to the powers that may be exercised in connection with the Customs duties; but under what conditions? If the Commonwealth Government thinks the price charged is fair and reasonable it may do the things provided, and can only do them through this Parliament; not only is the Government to be satisfied that the price is fair and reasonable, but the majority of honourable members has to be satisfied before any one of these three conditions apply. The fear that a monopoly will be created is the emptiest of all the suggestions made in support of a Select Committee. There is not a line in the .Bill that gives a monopoly to the Anglo-Persian Company, or prevents any other company establishing refineries here; and all the arguments advanced, one after the other, against the agreement are arguments that do not touch the case. For myself, I am prepared to accept the Bill - ini its present form. A f t e r all this talk about the amendments those we have The so far seen in print are only explanations of the Bill , or intended to more clearly phrase the provisions already in the measure. To me the Bill seems entirely unobjectionable from the point of view of the establishment of a monopoly. And we must remember that we are not in a position to make a free choice. If we could have got our oil refined and sold at a reasonable price, there would have been no necessity for this Bill ; but at present we are absolutely in the grip of monopolies which have been levying toll on us all along, and which will continue to do so unless we take some action.",53
281,Mr FENTON,POST AND TELEGRAPH,The Anglo-Persian Company has been doing the same thing.,53
282,Mr HECTORLAMOND,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Of course it has; and, therefore, all the more necessity there is for an agreement to prevent it doing it in the future. If we could make similar agreements with other companies it would, be for the benefit of the Commonwealth, for that would, at any rate, give us some cheap o i l , and enable the public to see the comparative prices, and judge what ought to be paid under present world conditions.",53

Honourable members opposite have condemned these monopolies, and yet in their speeches on this Bill they have re-hashed the arguments which the Standard O i l Company has caused to appear in the newspapers, and has circulated wherever they would find acceptance. I should have liked to hear from the honourable member for Maribyrnong something in thÂ© vein of the' old Labour opposition to monopolies, and some slight approval of the action of the Prime Minister in making an agreement which will enable us to at least reduce the toll that some of these monopolies levy on the Commonwealth.

293,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The Prime Minhas told us that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company came into existence as the result of the activities of a certain Mr. Knox d'Arcy, who obtained a concession from the Persian Government for the purpose of exploiting the oil resources of Persia, excepting that part of it which borders on the Caspian Sea. In what has happened since we have an illustration of the new phase of Imperialism. The explorations of. Mr d'Arcy, and the energetic persuasions of certain high British officials who are mixed up in this company have become responsible for the fact that Persia is now to all intents and purposes a part of the British Empire. It seems to me that the scheme is part and parcel of the activities of what is known as the Round I able group, or the 1 newer Imperialism, that seeks to exploit the outlying parts of the Empire in given the interests of .a gang of financiers in London. It is eighteen years since Persia became an oil-producing country. Close upon the discovery of oil there, Persia was partitioned between Russia and Great Britain, but as the result of the European war Britain now holds not merely the part allotted to her by the agreement with Russia, but the whole of Persia. The internal composition of this Anglo-Persian Oil Company makes it apparent that it is intended to act towards the oil fields which are thought to exist in the Commonwealth and its Territories in the same way, and. to my mind, the development of the oil industry in Australia under the terms of the Bill would be fraught with as great danger to the liberties of the people of this country as the discovery of oil brought to the people of Persia. In a. booklet issued during the war by the Society of Friende in Great Britain, and entitled, Whence Come Wars, there is a very illuminating reference to this matter. The writer points out how the a great armament firms were supported by their various Governments, and were the cause of precipitating the nations into war. He goes on to say:The Powers depend on their Vickers, their Schneiders, and their Krupps, their Ternis, their Skodas, and 'their PutilofFs. With these they endeavour-snakin g the best terms they can, according as the State or the corporation is more self-assertive and independent-to obtain allies and to weaken their enemies. They foster their firms, wink at their extortions (Schneider in Morocco), disregard their corruptions (Krupp and Carnegie in Germany and United States of America), and ignore their briberies (Vickers in Japan). France helps Schneider by every means in its power to obtain the iron deposits in Morocco which Germany endeavours to prevent becoming French. Terni and Skoda both cast their eyes on the mineral riches of the Balkans. The Persian Oil Syndicate and the European Petroleum Union contend for the finest oil wells, and, when war threatens them, the Governments behind each group divert large forces to the Tigris Basin. The French Government likewise, intervene to keep Krupp from acquiring an interest in the Putiloff Steel Works, whilst the same Government works with might and main, to secure the railway contracts of Anatolia for its own capitalists as against the Germans. These are the kinds of economic conflicts which bring nations to the brink of war, for the reason that on the prosperity and consequent efficiency of certain highly-developed industrial concerns depends the success of the countries - themselves should war break out.",54

295,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member is quite wrong. What I object to is the establishment of an autocracy in this country as well as in Germany, or, for the matter of that, in any other country. I am afraid that I cannot help the honourable member if he is unable to see the d r if t of argument, but what I am endeavouring half their people. to show is that the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company represent sbnply one of the newest methods of tending the frontiers of the Empire, by securing, by one means or another, rials essential to the development of cerorder. tain industries, and especially necessary in war time. I have said also that the adoption of these methods one of the most potent factors in fomenthonorable ing wars. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) must know very well that Mesopotamia and Persia are, for all practical purposes, part and parcel of the British Empire, simply because of the existence of oil wells i those countries. The Prime in introducing the measure now under consideration, pointed out that oil has today become an essential requirement for warships, for war industries, and for transport by land and sea. It is now on the same plane as iron, cotton, rubber, and other commodities essential to the operations of people bent upon, Empire building and land grabbing, if they are to successfully make war against their trade rivals. In the view of these people, countries or small nations weak in defence have no rights, and must be wiped off the face of the earth, or be forcibly incorporated with one or other of the great Powers in order that the world may be divided up into new I m perial groups.",55

When addressing myself to subjects under consideration in this Chamber, I am not concerned about the individual opinions of honourable members opposite, or even of honourable members on this side, but my purpose is to discuss various matters from the view-point of the industrialists in all countries, who, I may tell honourable members, are very much concerned about the system of concession giving and exploitation of which the operations of the Anglo Persian Oil Company are a sample. If honourable members take the trouble to read sueh organs of the New Imperialism as the Bound Table, they will know that there is a combination in Great Britain whose idea is to exploit the Dominions of the Empire in the interests of a financial group whose head-quarters are in London.",56

It every dav becomes increasingly necessary for them to control in one way or another countries rich in iron and the other articles I have referred to that are essential for the maintenance of their superiority in armaments. They must acquire these countries by force, or, if they have them, must use force to retain them. Taking this view of the question, I find no reason for supporting the oil agreement which has been submitted to us. In my opinion, it calls for a very exhaustive inquiry by a Select Committee, or by some other body, to justify the Government in asking us to consent to it . Some honourable members have said that this agreement will not retard the development of oil supplies in Australia or the Territories under the control of the Commonwealth. Why is it that honourable members who have talked about the Commonwealth Shipping Line have not come forward with a proposal to establish exclusively Commonwealth refineries. During the debate on the second reading of the Bill it was said that the reason is that we have not men possessed of the necessary technical knowledge to handle oil.",56

315,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"The honourable member believes that the rulers of this country claim to possess brains enough to exeroise control over such matters as shipping, mills, and several other phases of commercial activity. But this oil business seems to be surrounded by a mysterious halo which cannot be penetrated. When it is a matter of Australia desiring, to build submarines and destroyers we can send men to Great Britain to learn their job. Are there no refineries in other parts the world where Australian citizens can be sent to learn the technique of refining oil during the period which is to be occupied by endeavours to discover oil deposits here? I have been reading a book in which I learned that the trouble with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been, not that it has had insufficient supplies of o i l , or that the. quality has not been up to the mark, but that it has not had enough refineries to cope with its output. ThÂ© nature of this agreement, in my mind, tends to support that fact. Can it bÂ© expected that the Anglo-Persian Company's experts will be particularly keen on discovering oil m Australia and its Territories, seeing that they have, in their Persian fields, more than sufficient oil to keep all their refineries going, including the proposed refinery in Australia? Here is a quotation from The Mineral Industry Dwring 1917I t is now stated that the oil-fields that are being developed and tested by the producing companies of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are among the most extensive and prolific in the world. Were refineries existing to deal with the oil, the field from which crude is now being obtained would produce about 4,000,000 tons annually. Most of the wells, however, have to be kept shut down for want of facilities to deal with the crude. Some idea of the richness of this field is given by the statement that the present obtainable production exceeds that of the whole of the Roumanian and .Galician oil-fields before the war. All this business is merely part and parcel of a great scheme which I term the new Imperialism; that is to say, the exploitation of the outlying portions of the Empire in the interests of a financial in London. I am opposed to the proposition, and, for that reason I shall vote in the direction of securing a Select mittee.  know that Australia is lamentably short of oil, and that it is all-important that we should be in the way of securing supplies in order to increase our produccountry. tion, primary and secondary. This agreetralia ment provides a means of securing oil fuel more cheaply, and it should certainly stimulate efforts to discover oil in tralia. If a monopoly were to be given to the Anglo-Persian Company I would endeavour to secure the insertion in the Bill of clauses calculated to frustrate such the oil companies. a purpose. But the satisfactory fact that, under the terms of the Bill as stands, the company's interests will acquirable by the Commonwealth within terests of Democracy. fifteen years. I trust that this House specifically define in the Bill the duties of dividends. the two independent persons who are to called upon to fix a valuation. The factdr of goodwill in relation to this matter should be considered now, and in cold blood. I know that in Western Australia the neglect to make definite that point in the drawing up of an agreement with a certain company cost the city of Perth over Â£240,000. I hope the Commonwealth will never be called upon to pay anything for goodwill; and that, indeed, nothing but the question of actual value will be pany. taken into consideration. Now is the to safeguard the position. I feel that House comprising, as it does', seventy-five honourable members representative of every , part of Australia, should be capable of saying whether this agreement is in accordance with the wishes of the people without calling for the appointment of a Select Committee. It would be dangerous to try to secure expert evidence in Australia upon the oil question. I certainly was not helped in that direction by a certain telegram which I received today. I have not had too much sympathy-and neither have the people of Australia, generally-fro m these people who are concerned in the supply of Australia'so i l requirements. The House is indebted to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Bruce) for his able contribution to the debate.

I regret that we are not sufficiently advanced in our ideas of Democracy to fallow the example of Japan, and deal with these corporations as effeccheap tively as has the Government of that Last year the people of Auspaid Â£6,500,000 for the petroleum used in this country, and when we remember that the total cost of production, in Auseluding mining, casing, and refining, was only about Â£500,000, and freight absorbed another Â£500,000 at the outside, we find there was a clear profit of Â£5,500,000 for I have no great reis gard for the Standard ""Oil or Vacuum it companies, because, in my opinion, they be are all joined together against the in Their only god is will pelf, and their only desire is to secure Let us look at this proposal be in a common-sense way. It seems to me that its only effect will be to prevent the development of our oil deposits in Australia or Papua, and to encourage the crude oil products of Persia in the re. fineries to be erected in Australia. Therefore, I earnestly urge honourable members to follow the lead set by Japan and support the motion for a thorough investigation into the agreement. Lord Inchcape is at the head of the Anglo-Persian O i l ComI only mention his name as a retime minder to honourable members of the difa ficulties we have experienced of late year9 in connection with the Shipping Trust. I have had many differences of opinion with the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), but in connection with this Trust evil I should like to quote briefly from The Uprising of the Many, 'by Russell, who, by the way, gives a good deal of credit to the Minister for Defence for action which he took some years ago fighting Trusts that were threatening Australia. A former Premier of South Australia, the late Mr Thomas Price, had trouble with the Shipping Trusts of Australia. This is what happenedTlie Trust got a verdict of 500 dollars. Mr. Price owned his cottage, the result of years of toiling at his trade, and beyond that he had not a dollar. So the great Shipping Trust, which annually gouged millions from the people of Australia, purposed to seize the 900dollar cottage to punish him for telling the truth.  by offering to advance him the money, and it is related by one eye-witness that a somewhat portly gentleman was seen rushing out of a house with an infuriated member of Parliament behind him. This agent, we are told, was finally kicked like a bundle of rags into the gutter. writer also has something to say about George Ryland, who was eliminated from the Northern Territory by that man who, in my judgment, ought to be in gaol for his administration there. George Ryland was black-listed for five years. This is bow Mr Andrew Fisher, who enjoyed the unique distinction of being regarded as an honest politician, wag treatedAndrew Fisher, .a locomotive and mining engineer, and afterwards in the Labour administration, the best Minister for Customs that Australia ever had, went up and down the colony looking in vain for employment. He made a study of mines; no man knew them better; but no employer would have him on liny terms. Finally a miner, who was an old friend, and to whom he had made a rather pleading application, said to him, "" Fisher, I should like to have you here, for I know your ability, but it is impossible. You know what would happen to me if I employed you. In six months we would both be looking for jobs."" I have referred to these incidents in order to bring home to honourable members the evils that confront us in connection with these Combines. I may also relate my own experience of Standard Oil methods. A gentleman who, I understand, a salary of Â£16,000 a year, and commission, boasted, I believe, at a meeting in South Africa, that, if necessary, he would buy the Commonwealth - Parliament Dr Maloney. order to advance the interests of his company. I was introduced to him a few years ago by Mr Alcock, of Messrs. James Service and Company. He at once commenced to speak about Standard oil, which, as honourable members know, is not a pleasant subject with me. I said to him , I do not care to talk about Standard oil. Let us talk about something else."" In the course of our conversation I was interrupted by a constituent, and upon my return he again started to talk Standard oil. Another interruption in the conversation occurred, and for the third time he introduced the subject of Standard oil. I then said to him, "" I will eat with you, drink with you, or smoke with you, but I will not talk Standard oil with you."" He at once replied, "" But , doctor, you must know that we give the public a better article at a cheaper price than any other company, and we pay better wages."" It then flashed across my mind that he was the man from South Africa , and I said to him, "" I believe you are the man who boasted he could buy the Commonwealth The Parliament. Let me tell you that your Standard Oil Trust may be rich enough to buy anything, but, by the Living God, you will not buy the Australian people, who have the adult franchise."" At that moment my friend, Mr Alcock, joined in and asked the reason for my display of temper, and the Standard OilCompany's representative at once replied, "" The doctor is not to blame; hÂ© gave me three warnings."" I then remarked that I would like to fling the Standard Oil Company "" down below.*' He replied, "" It would make a mighty fine blaze."" Mr Alcock was pacified, and there the matter ended. The man, however, attained his object. We were trying to bring about the importation of oil in bulk, so that it might be tinned and cased in Australia, and thus give employment to tinsmiths and carpenters. In that effort we were defeated by two votes, and I believe that those two votes were had."" The two men who were sus-pected have long since been relegated to oblivion.",57
317,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH, The honourable member is now going somewhat beyond the scope of the question immediately before the Chair.,58
318,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have mentioned 1 iii this incident in support of my contention Oil Agreement that the Government should allow, this agreement to he inquired into hy a Select Committee. If we had the power of the people of Switzerland we could alter matters.",58
319,Mr JOWETT,POST AND TELEGRAPH,But Switzerland has no Trusts.,59
320,Mr SPEAKER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Order! If the honourable member for Grampians cannot refrain fro m interrupting I may have to ask him to retire from the chamber, or take another course.",59
321,Dr MALONEY,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"There are no Trusts in Switzerland. Under Constitution of that country a law may be altered or amended at any time. If the referendum, the initiative and recall were in operation here the position would be very different. As it is I view with some degree of trepidation the proposal to bind the Commonwealth in this way for fifteen years. should Australia be delivered into the hands of this wealthy Combine, with Lord Inchcape at its head, for such a period? The time fixed for the operation of the agreement is too long. In the words of one of the brightest Englishmen that ever lived, no generation has a right to make laws that future generations must obey. No K in g or Parliament should impress upon futur e generations laws which are thought suitable for the control of the people in their day. This Parliament has no right to impress upon future Parliaments any agreement made between the Government or a Trust or Combine that may be found to be detrimental to Australia. In The Uprising of the Many, honourable members will find further arguments in support of the view I have put forward. That book shows how Japan settled the question. The Standard O i l Company was nominally dispersed, but in dealing with some results of the anti-trust laws in America that brilliant graduate of the Melbourne University, Mr H . L . Wilkinson, in his work entitled The Trust Movement in Australia, writes, at page 186In the case of the dissolution of the Standard Oil Company there are, or were, 6,000 stock or shareholders to he dealt with. They were called upon to surrender the scrip, and in exchange received shares pro rata in the forty otlier subsidiary companies which have constituted the Trust. At first sight this return to original conditions would appear to he destructive of the combination against which action had been taken.. But although the [18 MAY , 1920.] Bill. ' 2183 Standard Oil Company had 6,000 shareholders the majority of the stock was possessed by about a dozen men, who will continue to control the majority of the shares in the forty companies. It may, therefore, be expected that the forty companies will continue the policy of the Standard Oil Company, and in that case the public will be no better off, the only result being that the administrative expenses will be greater. Nominally the Standard O i l Company was dissolved, but actually it was not, and it controls many of the State Legislatures of the United States of America as only great Trusts and Combines could. the I am proud that my Leader (Mr . Tudor) has come forward with ah amendment to refer the agreement to a Select Committee. Such a Committee would make a thorough investigation. I am not the friend of any corporation, but I believe that the wages and working conditions of the company Why engaged in the Australian shale oil industry, which has spent between Â£2,000,000 and Â£3,000,000, principally in New South Wales, could be controlled by us. On the other hand, what power should we have to control the wages of those employed by this company in Persia? People work there under conditions of semi-slavery. What power should we have over them?- None whatever. Honourable members will find in The Mineral Industry During 1917, which was quoted by the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), a very strong argument in favour of the reference of this question to a Select Committee. The Bill was introduced and read a first time on. 4th May. Honourable members then saw it for the first time, and no man, no matter what his ability, could in the meantime have made a tborough study of the issues involved. We are to have next week a visit from a very high and cultured individual- a Prince of the Royal House, of England-and we are to adjourn for something like a month. During that time the Select Committee could make full inquiries, so that there would be very little delay in dealing with the agreement if the amendment were adopted. I shall vote for the appointment of a Select Committee, and I regret very much that the Government has not seen fit to accept our proposal.

If the provisions of the Bill do not interfere with any one having a free hand in the development of the oil industry of Australia no objection can be taken to the proposed new clause. It is an additional safeguard, and simply provides, for what many honourable members have been 20 advocating, that there shall be no ob31 stacles placed in the way of other companies who desire to operate in any of the 11 Territories or areas mentioned in the Bill . We have already threshed this matter out, AYES. and I , therefore, do not intend to repeat what I have already said; but, for the safety of the industry in Australia, I think it is necessary that such a provision as this should be inserted.",60
323,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [10.13] - I do not know the object of the proposed new clause; it is entirely new to me. This is a proposal for a co-operative enterprise JfOES. in which the Government is the predominant partner, and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) now desires that everybody shall be able to operate, and that nothing in this Bill shall be held to prevent them coming ini and cutting the throat of the Government at the earliest opportunity. That is what it means if it means anything at all. These gentle aids to Government enterprise no doubt appeal to some honourable members; but I am bound to say that I cannot conceive of anything more calculated to assist the foreign exploiter than such a proposal as this. It is an invitation for every one to come herÂ© and do whatever they please. PAIRS. It is as foreign to the Bill as it is possible to conceive. All that the Bill does is to give effect to the agreement. The amendment proposes that nothing contained in this measure, meaning the Bill as distinct from the agreement, shall be deemed to prevent any person or persons, either individually or collectively, from prospecting for, developing, manufacturing, refining, and marketing any well oil, shale or other oil in any part of the Territories or areas mentioned in the Act . The proposal goes very much further than the honourable member intends, if one is to deduce his intentions from his words. For example, it may be held that the agreement gives persons the righ t to prospect for oil in any Territory of the Commonwealth. But it does not. We do not propose to allow any person to prospect for oil in New Guinea, except under our direction and under certain prescribed and proper restrictions.",60
324,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They can do so on the mainland.,60
325,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,Yes .,60
326,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,They cannot do anything of the kind unless they get the permission of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.,60
327,Mr HUGHES,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"God forbid that I should do anything to dissolve the bonds - of this unholy alliance between the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) - and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams). I can. only say, as I nave said frequently in the discussion of this Bill , that there is nothing to prevent any one from coming here to start - another refinery, or to prospect for o i l . Furthermore, i said this afternoon that the Government proposed to aid in the - search by offering Â£50,000 for the discovery of oil. But now the honourable member wishes to sweep this to one side by putt in g in a' clause the scope of which may - go, for aught I know, very much further than honourable members are prepared to let it go. Since the Bill cannot take away any right from anybody, except as set out in the agreement, and since the agreement does not - prevent any one from coming here to prospect for, or develop, or refine oil, the proposed new clause is superfluous, and to the extent that it mentions the Territories, which we are resolved to reserve as the prerogative of the Crown, it is dangerous. I hope honourable members will nob agree to it .",61
328,Mr TUDOR,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Y a r r a ) [10.20] - I trust honourable members will agree to the new clause. Honourable members advocate open competition, while we on this side stand for Government monopoly; but I propose to support the clause because it will permit others to come here and erect refineries , and will not permit the people of Australia to be swallowed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.",61
329,Mr RODGERS,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"Wannon) [10.21] If the new clause were inserted in the Bill , it would most effectively reduce to nothing the agreement entered' into between the Government and the Anglo Persian Oil Company, and open wide the - opportunity to the Standard Oil Corporation, the Shell Group, and other companies to operate here while not bound hy any of the-- conditions by which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company undertake to refine oil for the Commonwealth. It would make the Territories of the Commonwealth the spoil of the great concerns that 'hold a monopoly here today. No attempt is made by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) to harness any outsider to the 'conditions under which the Commonwealth is endeavouring to safeguard the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. All the trouble the Government have taken to [91] insure the supply of oil to Australia in the hour of - emergency will be put in jeopardy. At the very foundation of the agreement is the recognition of the fact that the hour of danger may arrive when the whole of the Pacific may be in turmoil. If the two great contending Powers bordering the Pacific today come into conflict, we may be cut off from the rest of the world, and the mobility of our Fleet reduced , to naught. We would look in vain for a supply of oil fro m one of the great competitors in the struggle, and assuredly we would be drawn into the maelstrom of war, because these two great contending forces which are today more or' less our Allies, would, certainly require our foodstuffs and our raw material, and as soon as either secured supplies from us, those very supplies would be declared contraband by the other. In such circumstances, we should look in vain for supplies of oil from any other source. This agreement is an honest endeavour to provide supplies of oil within the Commonwealth or our Territories for the hour that may arise, and the company with whom we are making it is good enough for Great Britain . I repeat that the proposal of the honourable member for Franklin would render valueless all the opposite trouble the Government have taken to safeguard Australia from the need to depend on foreign competitors for supplies of o i l .",61

The ""honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) has talked more absurdly upon this question than has any other honourable member to whom I have listened.

Now, no Territories or areas are mentioned in the Bill. It has nothing whatever to do with the finding of oil, but merely with its treatment when found.

Whatever action may be taken will depend entirely on the views adopted. of the Government in office. If there is a Government in office in favour of continuing this Combine it will be prepared to pass this legislation, but if there is in office a Government opposed to a monopoly of this kind there is no power under this agreement to compel a jority in this Parliament to do anything.",64

I was glad to hear the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) say that my efforts in connection with the Tariff diverted his infant footsteps into the path of Protection.
