NA (DESIGNATED UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 August, on motion by Mr Robb: That this bill be now read a second time.",22
10,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The change that is proposed by the government is essential. It is essential to preserve equal treatment of refugees so that we can give priority to the most needy. The position being advocated by the opposition is a flawed policy currently in place which has proven to have the following main consequences: (1) it kills people by luring them or encouraging them onto the high seas, where they will drown; (2) it condemns the most needy refugees to rot and die in African detention camps while we give priority to others comparatively safe and well in Indonesia. Twelve months ago the government was stampeded into supporting changes that have this effect. The 43 Papuans who came from Jayapura and risked their lives and the lives of their children on the high sea were coming, they said, to the mainland of Australia. Why did they do that? Why did they come to the mainland? Because the ill-advised law rushed into place in Australia told them that such a course would give them a better outcome than crossing safely into Papua New Guinea or going to a Torres Strait island. They brought children with them. Why? Because those same ill-advised laws ensured that, if they took that risk and they put that risk to their children, they would be released into the Australian community-and that is exactly what has happened. They have been released into the Australian community. We often focus on that one boat of 43 refugees from April this year. We talk about that one boat that left from Jayapura, but in fact, as I illustrated earlier on in my speech last night, there were two boats that left Jayapura. Boat 2 sank. People drowned. There were bodies in the water. Although noone can say for sure that that boat was following directly in the wake of boat 1-it may have been going somewhere else-it certainly was carrying asylum seekers. If that was the case and it was following directly in the wake of boat 1, I say that those deaths can be put down directly to the flawed policies now being urged on us by the opposition. These policies, these laws, must be changed, because we cannot continue to give that kind of incentive to desperate people to take to the sea in boats, particularly when it is a matter of fact that, from Indonesia or from other locations, people can apply to seek refugee status in Australia. Even if you are in West Papua and you are a freedom fighter-or whatever you might want to say about your position over there-you can cross the border into Papua New Guinea and you can make an application for refugee status in Australia from there. That is still a lot safer than taking to the sea in a canoe. Last night I gave the quotes from the people on that boat that successfully arrived in Australia about how they ran out of food, how the motors on the boat conked out and how they were crying and in fear for their lives when the high seas hit them. We cannot continue to endorse that kind of policy. We cannot continue to give support to policies that will (1) kill people by luring them onto the high seas where they will drown and (2) condemn the most needy refugees to rot and die in African detention camps while we give priority to others comparatively safe and well in Indonesia. I gave two examples of that last night. I spoke about the 43 West Papuans and the circumstances of how they came to be on the sea and the risks that they faced. I also spoke about that one poor soul from the Sudan who was bombed and strafed as a child and fled over the border and across the desert to Ethiopia and was then bombed and strafed there and fled across to Kenya. He was in a refugee camp there where raping and killing was going on all the time. He was bombed and attacked there and then made it to Australia by what he thought was basically a fluke, a whim or an act of God. That guy is now in Australia and he is what I would say is a very needy man, someone whose case needs to be considered by this government and not pushed back by people who jump to the front of the queue, who come here in a boat, who risk their own lives and put the lives of children at risk just to jump that queue and give themselves the priority they otherwise would not have and which they do not deserve in the worldwide scheme of things. I want to say one thing that I feel very strongly about in this circumstance. If we do not make these changes, there will be other boats and there will be other deaths. We can heap them up and keep a total of these deaths but, if we do not make these changes, more people will die on the high seas and it will down to the flawed and wrong policies that are currently in place and that are luring people onto the sea in this way and causing them to die. We need to make changes to ensure people are equally assessed across the world. The most needy must get the best chance. People who are safe but still want to apply will get the opportunity to apply, but they will not get the kind of rolled gold, red carpet treatment that is being urged on us by the opposition to the detriment of the most needy. It is shameful, it is deceitful, it is wrong and it is unprincipled for them to do that.",24
11,Mr MCMULLAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise with my colleagues to oppose the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. This legislation, notwithstanding some attempts to ameliorate it, cannot be saved. It shows clearly that the government never really believed in the reforms they proposed in 2005 to seek to accommodate the rebels in their midst. If anything proves that, it is the speech by the member for Blair which we have just heard. It is stunning. I know the member for Blair and I do not regard him as a bad man, but I do not know if he appreciates quite how callous those remarks that he just made were and the implications of them. I am not quite sure. He is implying, of course, that people deliberately put their children at risk to adtheir vance themselves in the queue not because they are in genuine fear but for selfadvancement. He is implying that the legislation he voted for last year was appalling and unprincipled. The double standards are almost breathtaking. It does not really matter what the member for Blair thinks-the member for Blair thinks whatever the government thinks. It matters that the government came in here preaching high virtues last year, saying: ‘We be won't incarcerate children. We won't put people in circumstances where they lose the right to have their cases reviewed. We will no longer detain people indefinitely.' It was applauded by me, amongst others, and I congratulated the member for Kooyong for it at the time as a step forward; but what we have now is a great leap backwards. It is the government saying, ‘We absolutely repudiate our 2005 reforms now in the face of pressure from international friends.' I agree with the remarks made by those on this side, and some on the other side, who have called this bill profoundly disturbing and draconian in its implications. I hope that those who have spoken up from the government side can carry the burden of the pressure that is being put on them and I hope they can bring enough senators with them to defeat this bill. I know to some extent how they feel because I have been somewhat of a recalcitrant on this side",25
12,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,You've never crossed the floor.,26
13,Mr MCMULLAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"in my party with regard to this matter. I have never had to face the challenge which my colleagues on the other side face because my party never introduced a piece of legislation like this and the issue has not arisen in the periods in which we have been in government to confront me in this manner. I am not saying we did not do anything wrong when we were in government, I think we did, but they were not on matters of controversial legislation while I was in the parliament. It is not easy. I welcome the fact that on this occasionand I am glad that he is in the chamber-the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Watson, has given a lead on this matter which has been strong and principled and which I have been comfortable in supporting and endorsing. I thank him and congratulate him for that. Let us go to the essential character of this legislation. The three principal characteristics of it that I find totally unacceptable are those which effectively overturn the 2005 legislation as it relates to the incarceration of children, the denial of review and indefinite detention. There has been some attempt made to pretend that this legislation does not have that effect, but we all know that it does and it will not achieve the purpose that the member for Blair was lauding unless it does. If people in Nauru are to be treated exactly the same way as they would be treated in Australia, the legislation could not do what the member for Blair claimed. It can only have that effect if we treat them worse, and it is deliberately designed to do so. It cannot be both. It cannot be both what I heard my ACT colleague Senator Humphries saying it was on radio this morning-merely a continuation of the existing policy with regard to these matters-and the deterrent that the member for Blair is talking about. It cannot be both those things. This matter does not occur in isolation. It is part of a long history in Australia of the easy appeal to fear. Australia has had a long history of seeing ourselves under threat: that somehow or other the force of gravity is going to make people sweep down from the north into our country. It goes back to the White Australia policy and the formation of the Labor Party, when our party was very much committed to the White Australia policy on the ground of fear as to what would happen as the hordes came sweeping in. It took a long time for all of the major parties to change their policies and fundamentally they all have, but, because of that underlying element in Australia about the hordes that may come flooding down, it has always been the easy political option in Australia to appeal to fear and it has always been the hard political option to resist that and appeal to the better angels of our nature. That is always harder politically, and in recent history the easy option has been a temptation to which the government has succumbed with enthusiasm, particularly since 2001, when we had images of a flood, which was of course minor by international standards. But most significantly, given this bill before us, the number of people, even in that so-called flood, who were coming by boat always was a very distinct minority of asylum seekers. If the intent of government policy had been to deter asylum seekers, everybody seeking asylum would have been treated the same way. But it was only those who were seeking asylum and were on the front page of the Daily Telegraph who were treated this way. It was not a policy about border protection. It was not about protecting Australia from people seeking asylum; it was about protecting the government from the Daily Telegraph. It had bad photos on the front, so something had to be done and we dealt with the minority who come by boat with draconian legislation but kept exactly the same rules for other people who sought asylum. The government's own figures show that in the last four years boat arrivals were three to four per cent of all unauthorised arrivals. In 2003-04 they were about 1½ per cent. In fact, in 2004-05 there were no individuals seeking asylum arriving by boat. But, even at the peak of the political controversy in 2001, slightly more than 25 per cent but less than 26 per cent-almost exactly a quarter-of asylum claims were by boat arrivals, yet we had draconian legislation about those people and nothing about the rest. I do not think we should have done about the rest what we did about the boat people, because I did not agree with what we did about them. It was the height of hypocrisy; it was double standards of the first order, compounded by the fact that the high point of the debate was that the people concerned ‘would never set foot in Australia'. What is the result? About a year ago we got to the situation-and I cannot tell you the exact situation today, because my latest data is almost a year old-where, of the 958 refugees processed on Nauru, 559 had been resettled in Australia, some of them in my electorate. I am very happy to have them. I met here in this building a young man who was not the last person to leave Nauru, because some of them were single individuals, but was in the last family to leave Nauru. He was learning English at the Secondary Introductory English Centre, which is in my electorate. He was with people who came to the parliament for a familiarisation course. I spoke to them in the public gallery. He is a very fine young man who is very welcome in my community. But in the election he was never going to ‘set foot in Australia'-and I can tell you that he is living in Watson and is doing very well. So all of that was a political stunt for the times, because the legislation would have had to have other character and other consequences had it been genuine. I have another concern, which is the implications of this legislation for Australia's standing as it relates to the refugee convention. I am a bit of a critic of the refugee convention. I think it is out of date and needs fundamental review. I certainly do not think that Australia should implement bad laws merely because an international convention says we should. I am not one of those who think we should be a slavish adherent. There are some elements of some international treaties which I would not wish to see in Australian law. If it were up to me, I would be seeking internationally to review the refugee convention. But there are some bedrock elements of the refugee convention that must not be changed, and they are put at threat by this legislation, in particular article 33(1), which says you do not return people who may face human rights abuses. That is at the very core of the refugee convention; without that you do not have one. There are elements about how it should be dealt with that I think are out of date. They were written for the Cold War period and are no longer as relevant to the nature of the refuge that people seek as refugees these days. But those concerns which I have do not go to this legislation, because this legislation goes to the core of what the international community, including Australia-including this government, which says it adheres to the refugee conventionsay that we think that the fundamental principles of the refugee convention are: the fundamental humanitarian obligations of every nation and that we should never return people who may face human rights abuses. I do not say that the government would deliberately set out to do that; I am sure that it would not. But this legislation removes the protections for people who may face that. I will go now to the detail. We have had a controversial report from the Edmund Rice Centre about concerns with regard to people who might have been sent back to hazardous circumstances in Afghanistan and Iraq. What have they got for their troubles? Abuse. I know some of the people associated with that organisation. I do not agree with everything that they say, but they are fine and principled people and they would not have made that allegation lightly. I hope those allegations examined seriously. Even if you do not accept the concerns they have expressed, let us have a look at the consequences for people who are denied-as people under this legislation will be-access to the refugee tribunal. The Refugee Review Tribunal has overturned decisions by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to send 3,200 people back to Iraq and Afghanistan. Those 3,200 people would have been sent back had they not had access to an appeal. That might make some people unhappythey might wish that they had gone back. But what that means is that an independent tribunal appointed by this government concluded that those people would be genuinely at risk if they were sent back to Afghanistan and Iraq. Let us say that the tribunal is 90 per cent wrong-I do not think that they are, but let us say that they are. That then means that 320 people have been saved from being sent back to the risk of persecution. I would not support a law that sent one person back. I am not saying that other people in this House would callously do that. I know many of the people speaking on the other side of this debate and they are people of goodwill, but they have to look at the consequences of what they do, whatever the motivation. And the consequence is that in the future the next 3,200 people, were they to be subject to this law, would not have access to that review and would be sent back. That goes to the very heart of why we offer refuge: so that people will not be sent back if they may face human rights abuses. There are allegations that we have done so. In this legislation there is a removal of the protection that will prevent us from doing so in the future. What this shows is that the process concerns that people on this side of the House, people on the other side and people in the public debate have been raising are not just the technical legal obsessions of lawyers are about process. The checks and balances of our legal system and our system of administrative review are not there for fun; they are there because, although Australia is very well served by its public service, we all know that public servants, like everybody else, can make mistakes, and we need a process of review. It is especially important here because in this area of administration the consequences of getting it wrong can be tragic. To consciously set out to deny review of a decision can have profound consequences. To put it generally, the consequence could be being sent back to human rights abuses-but it could be more stark than those mere words ‘human rights abuses' indicate; it could mean torture or death, as in the allegations raised recently here in Australia. My concern is that the legislation is profoundly unfair. It is totally unnecessary. The amendments that are being contemplated cannot save it. I say to the government and to the people who are considering how they might vote-not just the four who have said so but also the others who are considering how they might vote-do not go down this path. The parliament and the processes of government in Australia are under challenge. This is happening not just in Australia but in every Western democracy, because people think that opportunism is sometimes prevailing over their interests. Sometimes people think that and I think they are wrong, sometimes people think that and I think they are right; but it does not matter. We need here to take a stand. This is an important stand. I welcome the fact that the opposition has taken it. I welcome the fact that the minor parties are supporting it. I hope Family First does too. I particularly congratulate on their courage the people who have taken the decision to say that they will not support this legislation. I hope they are joined by others, because I profoundly wish that Australia does not go down this path and that we seek a positive role in the future review of refugee arrangements, not the negative role which we have played in recent years and which is reflected in this legislation.",26
14,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I completely refute the statement that Australia has played a negative role in the settlement of refugees. Australia leads the world with settlement and compassionate programs, and the Labor Party are vile and contemptible in trying to paint the picture in any other way. Let us have a look at what the Labor Party did when they were in office. They established a program of humanitarian care. There was no refugee test or UNHCR test; there was something that the minister declared to be of interest to the Australian government. They did not observe any international covenants or processes; they took anybody that the minister designated as important under the special humanitarian program. That is not a humane program. That is a political program. This government has looked around the world for those most in need and taken people in large numbers. Proportionately we have one of the largest programs in the world for the size of our nation and for our capacity to settle refugees. I am proud of the programs that we have introduced because they are based on need. I invite members of the opposition to have a look at what is happening outside Australia's borders and to have a look at the human rights issues in Indonesia-and they are not perfect, I acknowledge that. Let us have a look at Darfur and Sudan and see whether or not you are willing to compare the people that Australia is bringing from those nations to the boat people who happen to get here because they have paid somebody or because they are inventive enough to get hold of a canoe and paddle to Australia. There is a huge difference between these two classes of people, and if we lose sight of that then we lose sight of a humanitarian program to support those in most need around the world. I think this opportunistic approach to what is need and to refugees is just a wrong and an inhumane approach. The reports I have from international organisations such as Christian Solidarity Worldwide are that, in Sudan, 1.6 million its people have been displaced, 20,000 have fled to Chad and 70,000 deaths have occurred since February 2003. That is just in one area. If you look at the surveys of what has gone on in those places, you will see that in September last year the World Health Organisation revealed that between 6,000 and 10,000 displaced persons were dying each month in the camps. These are refugee campshumanitarian refuges-and people are dying in them at the rate of 6,000 to 10,000 a month. Are the Labor Party serious when they say we need to give preference to people who can get here by boat or pay someone to come to Australia? There is a huge difference between the needs of those people and those dying at those rates in what are supposed to be places of refuge-they are called refugee camps-for people who are displaced. Why are they dying? They are dying of malnutrition, of disease and because the armies of the Sudanese government are bombing refugee camps-something that has never occurred before in the management of displaced people. The targets are actually the refugee camps. The stories are particularly appalling, and the UN has documented them. Female displaced people risk being robbed, abused, threatened, beaten with whips and gangraped as they undertake the traditional female task of seeking firewood. Sudanese authorities deny these reports, often claiming that their soldiers are disciplined and follow strict sharia. That is absolutely proven to be wrong. The Australian Labor Party, rather than deal with the issues that confront the world and that should confront Australia, would rather play games with people who can get into canoes and who can seek a better way of life in Australia. If I were in their position, I admit I would do everything to improve the way of life for my family. I would want to escape from an area that was oppressive. I would want to escape to something that offered me greater economic prospect. I would want to seek a better way of life. But that is not the same as being a refugee. A refugee, according to the United Nations, is very specific, and the way in which they should be managed is also specific. If we are going to stray outside we will go back to the old days of a Labor minister declaring areas of special humanitarian need, declaring on a political basis without any objective test what areas in the world we are going to take people from, with neither rhyme nor reason. That is the way you lose community support for immigration. That is the way you lose community support for refugee programs. That is the way you despoil and wreck the rationale, the compassionate basis, that should be the very root of our immigration policy. That is the game the Labor Party want to play. They want to go back to those days where the minister declares areas of interest-no rationale, no reason: ‘Get here on a boat and we'll declare you a different class of refugee to the type of refugee that the international community is looking at.' This government has a fine record of compassionate support for refugees. I do not want to see that change, because I think it is impeccable, I think it is reasonable and I think it needs to have a solid basis. We are not talking about a solid basis here today; we are talking about changes to the act that will allow those who can approach Australia a different class of refugee status. They will have hot and cold running lawyers to attack Australian law. Tell that to the people in the camps in Sudan. Tell them that they will have right of appeal by Australian lawyers flying into those camps to defend their claims! They will not see a lawyer; they will not even see a review. There will be one interview and the decision will be made about whether they come to Australia or not. That is not a fair way of treating people who claim to be refugees: two classes of asylum seekers-one in need and dying in camps; the other strong enough to paddle a canoe or to pay someone to bring them here. They are two different that, types of people, and they would be treated differently if the Australian Labor Party had its way. It wants to say, ‘If you can arrive on Australian shores, you'll have hot and cold running lawyers and, not only that, you'll have numerous appeals through the courtsbut, if all that goes wrong, let's put the ombudsman onto them as well, for the sake of parliament.' Tell that to the people in Sudan! Tell that to the people in the camps suffering around the world. Tell the genuine refugees we are taking that we will send the ombudsman there to see whether or not they have had a fair deal. You are creating two classes of refugees-a completely intolerable situation when you look at the humanitarian need of the situation. The government has changed its processing to deal with people who do come onshore, but this proposal is aimed to keep people offshore, deal with them as objectively as possible, search out real need, establish the true refugees and then allow them onshore, with settlement or settlement in a second or third country. What the Australian Labor Party appears to skate over and ignore completely is the international convention on the settlement of refugees. The first goal of settlement is to create a political solution the conflict and settle people back in their own land. That is the No. 1 goal of the United Nations, endorsed by Australia. The second goal is to have them settle nearby so they may return easily to their country of origin and reclaim their homes, their farms and their land. That is the second option adopted by the United Nations. This is sensible stuff. This is common sense. This is the way refugee management should be handled. The international community recognises it, but it appears that the Australian Labor Party does not want to recognise it. It wants to make up a whole bunch of new rules as we go ahead about how refugees are dealt with worldwide. The third option, according to the United Nations, is a country of settlement remote from the area, where people will be safe. Australia often gets into the situation where we take people from all around the world as part of our refugee program of 13,000. It is a big program, I would remind the House, for the size of this nation: year in, year out, we take 13,000 people. It does not matter what the economic circumstances are in Australia, we take them. That is our compassionate program, that is our internationally sound program and that is why we can hold our heads high in international fora. Year in, out, we take 13,000 people, based on these principles: (1) can there be a political settlement?-often there cannot be; (2) can there be safe settlement in a nearby country? I have read to the House the circumstances of refugees from Sudan who fled into nearby countries, dying at the rate of 6,000 to 10,000 a month and then being bombed for the pleasure of the Sudanese government. That is how safe those settlements are. The third option is the least preferred option, according to the United Nations-this is not an Australian conservative government making these rules; these are the United Nations to rules on refugees. The United Nations said, ‘Only if those two measures can't be met should we consider third country settlement some distance from the source of the conflict and the reason for people becoming refugees.' How are we going to look at these so called asylum seekers, these refugees that come to Australia by boat? We are going to give them first-class accommodation. There will be water, schooling for the kids, electricity and regular food. There are no threats to their lives, no bombings, no starvation, no ill-health, good medical serviceseverything that they could want for their safety, security and good health. Compare that with what is going on in the camps, where people have one interview: ‘Yes, you're into Australia,' or ‘No, you're not.' What do these people get? They get security, safety, care, good health, good food and a good existence, compared with, in many instances, where they have come from, but not what they ultimately desire. What they desire is settlement in Australia. Who would not want to settle in Australia? I do not blame them for that; I cannot criticise them for that. I would do that myself for my family, to get a better way of life, but I can understand why any story would be year invented, why any tale would be told to achieve that. Compare the situation of a tale told, or a story invented, to the factual reality of what is occurring around the world that you want to turn your back on in order to rescue who you think are genuine people. They may or may not be genuine. Let us have an objective test and put them up against the rest of those claimants and see how they stack up. That is the way we should make the decision and that is the way the government is making the decision, with all of these added things thrown in: hotand cold-running lawyers, safety for the children, schooling and clean water, which allows people to live a healthy life and one reason why there has been such a large increase in longevity around the world. They can live in those circumstances, have review after review and have lawyer after lawyer. They can even send the Commonwealth Ombudsman to check whether it is real and then we will make a decision about whether they should be settled here or elsewhere. There has been some protest about whether people should be settled here or elsewhere. There seems to be a theme running within the Labor Party that, automatically, whatever their condition they should come and settle here. That is not the way to run a refugee program. If you want to call it something else, call it that and be honest about it. But this is not a refugee program. With refugees, you look for the best outcome for those families and, sometimes, it just happens that settlement is not Australia. Sometimes it is New Zealand, sometimes it is elsewhere in the world, but this government has always done everything possible to ensure the safety and security of those people whom it has found should not settle in Australia. Why should people be in detention? The simple fact of the matter is that every country that has tried to let them go has found that they never turn up again. Tony Blair tried it and lost 98 per cent of everybody he said could move around in the community. Britain has since adopted many Australian rules and laws regarding the handling of refugees and asylum seekers. People have tried that process. I ask the opposition and my colleagues: what would you do in those circumstances? If you were let go and you thought that you had a chance of escaping and not being found again, that people were confused by your appearance and your name, wouldn't you take that chance? Wouldn't you seek to escape the officialdom that will declare whether you are a refugee? If you could disappear into the community and say, ‘I am now a resident of the country in which I am seeking to gain residency,' wouldn't you take that risk? Of course you would. It is human nature. You try to get the best you can for yourself and your family, and that is what this is about. It is about preservation, aspiration and a new lifestyle. That is what people are on about. The problem is that we need to sort out who is under the hammer, whose life is under threat-those who have faced torture, whose homes have been bombed, whose houses have been burnt down and who have had traumatic experiences. One only has to read some of the stories, both from the UNHCR and other agencies, to realise how serious the circumstances are. A report prepared in July this year by the United Nations Refugee Agency says the insecurity in the rule of law-the very thing that we seem to be debating here today-in these areas of refugee population has changed dramatically: It states: On one hand, refugee-populated areas may be the target of direct military attacks … … … … A number of different examples can be cited in this respect: attacks on Sudanese refugee settlement in northern Uganda … Outside Sudan, in Uganda, people have been attacked by the Sudanese army. That is what we are looking at. You cannot compare that with people paddling their canoes to Australia; these are quite different things. ought to be focusing on these things if we are going to call it a refugee program and a settlement program for refugees. If you are going to reinstall the special humanitarian system, call it that. Let us see your policy. Let us know what you are on about. I do not believe you are really saying that. I believe Australian Labor Party wants to play games with this issue. Not having a policy is a privilege that oppositions have. The United Nations Refugee Agency report goes on to describe ‘incursions by the armed forces of Burundi into refugee-populated areas neighbouring Tanzania, intended to apprehend combatants and “subversives” living amongst the Burundi population' in refugee camps. I do not think the Labor Party or my colleagues have a case. I will go into bat every time for those people whose lives are at risk, whose children are being tortured and raped, whose homes have been destroyed and bombed, whose crops have been destroyed, whose cattle and livestock have been taken by invading armies. That, to me, is a refugee program. This program that the government has put in place is a type of refugee program. People are being given extraordinary support and assistance to make their claim-a claim that is not given to anybody else. The only reason they are given this claim is that they can pay somebody or paddle a canoe-one or the other. In anything that I have read about refugees, whether from the United Nations or from anywhere else in the world, those are not among the criteria that are essary to establish the needs or the refugee status of anybody.",29
15,Mr BOWEN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"In 1951 the United Nations convention for the protection of refugees came into force. The world realised the mistakes of the 1930s, when many Western nations turned their backs on Jews fleeing persecution in GerWe many. Collectively, we said, ‘Never again.' I am sure that all of us involved in public life would like to think that we would have done the right thing in those circumstances and stood up for those facing the worse of circumstances, regardless of whether it was popular or unpopular. If the Migration the Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 passes the parliament today, it will be the day that Australia turned its back on the refugee convention and on refugees escaping circumstances that most of us can only imagine. This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character. The people who will be disadvantaged by this bill are in fear of their lives, and we should never turn our back on them. They are people who could make a real contribution to Australia. This bill represents an extension of the so called Pacific solution, in which we saw individuals who were processed offshore being treated differently from those processed in Australia. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs said in his second reading speech that the offshore processing system had preserved ‘Australia's strong commitment to refugee protection'. He is wrong. Let us take a look at how the Pacific solution has worked in practice. This bill extends the Pacific solution, so it is legitimate to look at how it has worked up until now. Firstly, we have seen families of refugees broken up-callously and in contravention of the refugee convennec- tion. Spouses of people who have been recognised as refugees in Australia received correspondence from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, which has been reproduced by Michael Gordon in his excellent book Freeing Ali. It states: Your claims have been assessed separately from your husband's claims because you travelled at different times. Under the conditions of your band's stay in Australia he is not able to sponsor you. Like all refused asylum seekers you cannot remain in Nauru indefinitely. You should consider voluntary repatriation now. What a callous piece of correspondence. I agree with Michael Gordon, who said of that letter: There was only one conclusion to draw: if you wanted to be reunited with your husband, whose fear of persecution if he returned had been judged to be well founded, your only choice was to return and to convince him to leave Australia and confront the very danger he had fled. Of course, several asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru have had their applications rejected three, four or five times, only to have the government eventually accept their claims. Unlike people processed onshore, people processed offshore have no access to professional assistance. It is hard enough for a well-versed Australian native to understand Australia's immigration system, let alone somebody with obvious language difficulties who is attempting to come to grips with the massive change in their circumstances. Of course, asylum seekers offshore have no right of appeal to higher authorities. MCAdam and Crock highlighted the importance of this in an article in the Australian on 15 May. They said that between 1993 and 2006 the refugee tribunal overturned 8,000 determinations by departmental officers to refuse asylum. Asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat will not have this right of appeal if this bill is passed. Asylum seekers have been encouragedpressured-to return to the nation they are fleeing when their applications are rejected. The government made it very clear to asylum seekers that, if their application were not successful, they would be involuntarily returned to the country they were fleeing. Some stayed and fought and eventually had their applications approved. Others were rehusturned to their homeland. The results of this are outlined in a report by the Brotherhood of Saint Laurence entitled Return to danger and in a report by the Edmund Rice Centre, which other honourable members have referred to. I cannot vouch for those examples-I am not qualified to say whether they are true or not-but if just one of them is true it damages Australia as a nation. The biggest problem is that, even if an asylum seeker overcomes all these obstacles and has their application for refugee status accepted, there is no guarantee of a visa to settle in Australia. Someone who makes it to the Australian mainland and has their case as a refugee accepted may not be able to gain a protection visa in this country, and that is a national disgrace. This is something that the government wishes to gloss over; there was no mention of it in the second reading speech to the bill. I must say, for such a major and important piece of legislation to receive the cursory treatment that this bill did in the second reading speech by the parliamentary secretary is an insult to the parliament and to the Australian people. The lack of speakers on this debate from the government side is also insulting. I also note that this morning the government gagged this debate-the most important debate that we have seen in many years. The government has gagged the debate such that every government member wishing to speak on the bill was given the opportunity to do so but while there are still many opposition members wishing to speak. I am sad that Liberal members on the other side voted for that gag motion. The parliamentary secretary did at least acknowledge one point in his second reading speech. He acknowledged that this bill was brought about by the granting of asylum to a group of refugees from West Papua. While the government recognised the link, they have not admitted the full story. The government first embraced the Pacific solution for crass electoral reasons, but they are tending the Pacific solution for reasons of crass international appeasement. I happen to think that our relationship with Indonesia is one of our most important. I have spent time in Indonesia. It is a wonderful country and has made remarkable democratic progress in recent years, but our relationship must be one of mutual respect. In Australia that means respecting the Indonesian legal system, even when we do not like the way some of our own nationals are treated, but Indonesia must respect our system of dealing with asylum seekers. The Howard government changing our system to suit the concerns of another nation is nothing short of a disgrace. The Prime Minister is selling out our national sovereignty. This tragic and discriminatory policy does not come cheap. Taxpayers are paying for the maintenance of offshore detention centres at the cost of $3 lion to $4 million a month. They are much more expensive than detention centres in Australia. We have the worse of all worldsan expensive, discriminatory and tragic policy. Let me turn to the illogical and hypocritical nature of this bill. In his second reading speech the parliamentary secretary stated that it is ‘incongruous' that asylum seekers who arrive by boat to excised areas are treated differently to those who arrive by boat to the mainland. But he did not say that it is incongruous that asylum seekers who arrive by boat are treated differently to those who happen to arrive by aeroplane. The government is claiming that the whole rationale of this bill is to fix an illogical outcome-that asy- embraced it. lum seekers should be treated the same regardless of where they land. We say that asylum seekers should be treated the same regardless of how they land. We say they should be dealt with fairly, swiftly and on Australian soil. The government has not changed the ex- situation for asylum seekers arriving by means other than boat, because that is how, in almost every circumstance, asylum seekers from Indonesia arrive. In his contribution, the honourable member for Mitchell it talked about the different ways asylum seekers are treated depending on where they are. His contribution suggested that this bill would end that situation-that now asylum seekers in camps in Africa would be treated the same as those who arrived on the Australian mainland. Of course he is wrong. They will not be treated differently if they happen to arrive by aeroplane-if they happen to be able to afford an aeroplane ticket. The convention on refugees says clearly: The Contracting States shall apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin. milThis bill contravenes that convention because it treats people differently in Australia depending on what part of the world they have come from and how they arrive. In 2003-04, 1.5 per cent of people seeking asylum in this country arrived by boat. On 9 May 2006 Minister Vanstone stated that unauthorised boat arrivals in the last four years represented three to four per cent of all unauthorised arrivals. So this bill, which the government claims is so necessary to protect our borders, will deal with a maximum of four per cent of unauthorised arrivals in Australia. It is so clearly a sop to international appeasement that I cannot believe government members can come into this House with a straight face and argue otherwise. Far from removing illogicality, the government has In the wake of the Tampa incident, the then Minister for Defence gave instructions that asylum seekers should not be humanised. He instructed that no images be presented, no stories told and no facts relayed which gave a human dimension to the people in such desperate circumstances as the Tampa asylum seekers. He did not want the Australian body politic infected with the view that these people were somehow normal human beings escaping persecution. But, of course, they are human beings and the government cannot stop their stories being told. I suspect there are government members in this House who will vote for this legislarefugee tion today but have never met a refugee or talked to them about what they have been through. Of course, some government members have acknowledged great empathy for refugees, and I acknowledge their courage, but I suspect that there are some opposite who have never looked a refugee in the eye. There are few more uplifting experiences than to meet a refugee who has made their home in Australia and is making a contribution to this nation. I met a young Vietnamese woman at the Education Week celebrations in Fairfield a few weeks ago. She came to Australia by boat with her family in 1993. When she arrived she did not speak English. She is now studying medical science at the University of Sydney. She gave a speech at the Education Week celebration about what Australia and its public education system has done for her. She will be giving back to Ausa tralia much more than what Australia has given her. There is also the young man, Zaya Mohamed, who escaped from Afghanistan and attended Holroyd High School in my electorate. He did not know whether his family was dead or alive; he escaped alone. When he arrived, he did not speak English. His schooling had been interrupted and he was hardly literate in his own language. But did the HSC last year with a view to studying information technology, and a more delightful man you could not hope to meet. It is people like this to whom the government is trying to send a message-the message that they are not welcome. Not all people seeking asylum in Australia are genuine. Not all deserve to have refugee status, and not all deserve to be granted visas. But what they are entitled to is a fair process, and they are entitled to a swift process. They are entitled to have their claims considered in Australia, and if they are granted refugee status, they are entitled to a protection visa from Australia. This bill denies them those rights. If this bill is passed, the so-called softer edge which the government put into the detention regime last year, under pressure from a few members opposite and from this side, of course, will be replaced by an edge of barbed wire. Children will be back in detention. The amendments proposed by the government do not stop that. The amendments are, in my view, particularly weak. The amendments talk about taking all reasonable steps to encourage other countries to provide suitable accommodation for children. The amendments call for all reasonable steps to work with another country to uphold the principle that children should be in detention only as a last resort. This parliament cannot pass a law that tells Nauru what to do. Amending this bill is like putting lipstick on pig. You can put all the lipstick you like on it but it will still be a pig. You can amend this bill all you like but it will still be a bad bill. What future is there for children in detention? We hear a lot about how important it is to read to our children, to ensure that they are nurtured and to ensure that they have access to resources for a much better chance at life. What future are we delivering to these children? What message will we be sending Zaya to them? How will they feel about Australia-an Australia that kept them in detention in their early years? We can only hope that they realise that it is this government that is making them unwelcome, not this nation. I appeal to the better angels of the nature of those opposite. Some have already expressed their unwillingness to support this legislation. Labor alone cannot defeat this bill. Labor, together with a principled and courageous stand by some members opposite in this House and in the other place, can defeat this bill. It is, as I said, a bill with redeeming features. We will oppose this bill, and I call on members opposite to join us. If it is passed, it will be repealed by an incoming Labor government. Decency and selfrespect as a nation would demand nothing less.",33
16,Mr CREAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise also to oppose the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. Labor opposes it outright. There is nothing you can do to this excision bill that will fix it. We do not seek to amend it; we will oppose it in its entirety. The bill is shameful and xenophobic. It is cast in denial and reeks of appeasement of the Indonesian government. It is also another broken promise by the Prime Minister of this countrythis time to his party colleagues, none of whom are sitting in here at the moment. We have seen some of them with the courage to come into this place and say they oppose it, but we now have a government that is gagging debate. So embarrassed is the government of this debate that it wants to stop it. John Howard ditched commitments he made to his own colleagues last year to make the immigration laws more compassionate. If he cannot be trusted by his own colleagues, he cannot be trusted by the Australian people. I congratulate those members on the other side who have shown courage in this debate-the members for Kooyong, MCMillan, Pearce and Cook-and Senator Troeth for the way in which she is still standing firm against pressure. These people are not rebels. They only want the Prime Minister to honour his promise to them last year. What is wrong with that? Why should people be accused of rebellion simply for insisting on a man honouring his word? He is not any ordinary man; he is the Prime Minister of the country. Peter Costello knows that the Prime Minister breaks his word. We now know that the no Prime Minister breaks it in a serial way to his colleagues, just as he has betrayed the trust of Australian people so many times over the years. In the past, Labor have opposed excision as a solution to our immigration issues. We opposed it as part of the so-called Pacific solution back in 2002. That Pacific solution has been shown to be a costly and ineffective failure. This legislation, in response to the West Papuan refugee issue, will perpetuate that failure of policy. The bill in effect surrenders our borders in the name of protecting them. It is a ludicrous proposition. It says that we defend ourselves by shrinking ourselves. The original excision bill, introduced by the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, sought to excise all of Australia's outlying islands-if you like, the islands beyond the mainland. When it was introduced in June 2002, both the minister for immigration and the Minister for Foreign Affairs refused to rule out excision of parts of the mainland from the migration zone, because we said that it was possible to do that. At the time, the minister for immigration took umbrage at our suggestions that you could excise Tasmania, for example. The Prime Minister of the day in fact said that that was a ludicrous proposition. I remember, in this House, on 17 June, asking the Prime Minister whether he would rule out excising parts of the mainland. This is what the Prime Minister said then: I want to make it clear that there is no intentionand there never has been-to excise any part of the Australian mainland. That is an absolutely ludicrous proposition. That is what the Prime Minister said on 17 June 2002. It was ludicrous then and it is ludicrous now. But this bill legislates for the ludicrous. It excises the Australian mainland, the big island, and Tasmania, the little island. The only thing left after this bill is Macquarie Island.",37
17,Mr HUNT,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,And Heard.,38
18,Mr CREAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"And Heard and MCDonald Islands. The parliamentary secretary is joining in the joke. It would be a joke if it was not so serious. Now, Labor is totally committed to strong and effective border protection, but you do not protect your borders by surrendering them-and that is what this legislation does. Surrendering the outlying islands in 2002 was a strategic mistake. The Labor Party said so at the time. We said it would encourage the people smugglers to aim for the mainland. It was an invitation to them to get to the mainland. Now that we have been proven correct in that analysis the government's response is to excise the mainland. When the government's response to xenophobia is to surrender it loses all credibility. And that is what has happened with this legislation. At the time of our response to the 2002 excision we were very supportive of other measures to stop the people smugglers. We called for deterrence in the form of a coast guard-a cop on the beat to patrol those islands. We called for laws which, by developing international agreements on processing and location, dealt with asylum seekers in the country in which they first landed, not the last country that they headed to, so that they could not country hop. That is what we proposed then. We also proposed solutions to stem the flow of people whose misery was being exploited by unscrupulous and illegal smugglers. We proposed urging the eight countries in the pipeline of the people smugglers to sign the protocol of the refugee convention, and we proposed that the Prime Minister use his good offices, through CHOGM and other international forums, to get those signatures. We urged the government to get Indonesia and other transit countries to make peoplesmuggling a crime under their domestic laws. We accepted, as part of the people smuggler deterrent, that it was appropriate to support the special treatment of Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands because of their distance from Australia and their proximity to Indonesia. This bill continues to ignore all of those constructive solutions. Instead, its solution is to excise Australia from Australia, pretending that none of Australia is Australia. It is absurd. This is a response to a circumstance in which we were not confronted by people smugglers but by genuine West Papuan refugees-genuine, as determined under Australian law. The government has resorted to a solution-a solution that the Prime Minister said was ludicrous-to deny the very operation of that same Australian law. We believe that the government did the right thing in accepting the West Papuans. But the government could not stand the heat of the Indonesian response so it rolled over, and this is the solution. So we are having this debate today, until the government brings the gag into stop the debate, on this bill to appease Indonesia. In it we are asked to accept that ‘designated unauthorised arrivals' may be removed to a declared country outside Australia-namely, Manus Island or Nauru. They are to be removed there for the processing of any claims for refugee protectionnot under our law, but under the refugee convention. Just understand the hypocrisy of that dimension of this issue. Can you remember that the government in this place, time and time again, said they were never going to cede Australian law to international authorities and that we would determine the law that would apply here and we would not have it determined by international bodies such as the UN? They bagged the UN left, right and centre when it suited them over that misplaced, misguided involvement in the war in Iraq. They bagged the UN, but this proposal adopts the refugee convention as the alternative to Australian law for the processing of these refugees. In this proposal the law is made more ridiculous because it only applies, as was mentioned earlier, to those people arriving by boat. What about those who arrive by airthose who can afford to pay the ticket? They will be processed here. Think of this: 43 West Papuan people arrive by boat and the law is changed to stop them coming in in the future. In the meantime, last year alone, over 1,600 people arrived illegally by air. And of those, 40 people applied for protection visas. So here we have the same order of magnitude, the same number of people. How is the government going to explain this dimension of inconsistency in its policy? It is worse than that; it is blatantly discriminatory, because if you can afford to fly to Australia you get Australian law but if you are too poor-if you are escaping repressive regimes where you have no means and you are so desperate to make the rush for asylum that you go in a leaky boat and take all those risks-then you do not get the protection of Australian law. What is fair about that? How does the government justify that? You could understand it if it had a consistent position. It is a reactive position. That is why we are in this mess today. The effect of this legislation is to put the kids back behind razor wire. Australian law, which now prevents it, is inoperative. The laws of other countries will apply. All of those so-called ‘softenings' of the legislation-the assurances from Minister Amanda Vanstone about this harsh legislation, assurances that they have had to give to try and placate those on the other side of this chamber to prevent them from crossing the floor-are no substitute for retaining control of the situation ourselves. How can they be? If you believe in humane treatment, then use your own laws to ensure it. Do not shift the responsibility and abrogate the control. This bill loses that control. In so doing, this country loses its compassion and its obligation to protect the rights of refugees. This is a bill which appeases Indonesia at the expense of people fleeing persecution. Australia should not change or, in this case, abrogate its laws just to please Indonesia or, for that matter, any other country. Last year we saw some welcome changes to immigration policy by the government. Those changes brought the government's policy closer to that which Labor had been advocating for many years beforehand. We wanted the government to go further last year but, as far as they went, we supported the changes. Last year, led by John Howard, they agreed that children would no longer be placed in detention, that indefinite detention would cease and case managed mental health care would be introduced, and that the Commonwealth Ombudsman would also become the Immigration Ombudsman and gain independent oversight of people in detention. They were important concessions. They dealt with concerns which were eventually-and I say ‘eventually'-raised by does not. It people in the Liberal Party. This bill reverses all of those reforms. If asylum seekers are to be sent offshore to tres such as Nauru, this bill reverses all of those reforms. That is the broken word I talked of earlier. Asylum seekers will be out of the reach of Australian law if they arrive by boat. If the bill passes, once again children will be in detention; they will be behind razor wire. No wonder there is disquiet in the government ranks. No wonder they want to gag this bill. Razor wire and detention is no place for children, as Australian law now acknowledges. This bill denies that protection. Our fundamental position is that if asylum seekers land in Australia, they should be assessed under Australian law as it now stands and which we want to further amend. If they are found on the high seas escaping an alleged place of persecution, they should be taken to Christmas Island for assessment. I want to take the opportunity to point out the efforts Labor has consistently made to get reforms in this very important area. On Australia Day 2002 in my first major speech as Leader of the Opposition, I spoke of the riches that migrants to this country had brought us: economic, social and cultural. I believe fundamentally in multiculturalism in this country. I believe it has made Australia greater place. I said that Australia had successfully settled millions of people, rich and poor, and refugees, while becoming a diverse but united and peaceful people. This immigration policy, I might add, has essentially always had bipartisan support. It needs it in a country such as ours. That biparany tisanship gave us the confidence to build a diverse, tolerant and harmonious nation: a country that we could be proud of; a country that was looked to and held up as an example overseas. That bipartisanship was shattered under the leadership of John Howard. He trashed the bipartisanship in this country. Think about it: no other Liberal leader in country has done that-not Menzies, not Fraser, not Peacock and not Hewson. And cen- remember this: it was John Howard who lost the Liberal leadership in 1989 because of his anti-Asian remarks. That bipartisanship has essentially been trashed under his leadership, and this bill is in part a reflection of that fact. Following the Australia Day call to get the kids out from behind the razor wire, in February of that same year I called for a number of measures, including bringing detention centres back under government control, not the privatised rabble that we have seen in existence under this government. I called for the closure of the Woomera detention centre and for media access to detention centres to be allowed. In April 2002, we opposed, as I have said before, the original excision bill which excised parts of Australia's territory from the migration zone. That was when we heard the Prime Minister's ‘ludicrous' statement. In June of that year I reaffirmed Labor's commitment to strong border protection but pointed out the futility of protecting our borders by handing them over or surrendering them. That is what we are doing further today. In December 2002 we moved amendments to the Migration Legislation Amenda ment Bill to get the children out from behind the razor wire. Subsequently the member for Gellibrand moved a private member's bill to get the children out before Christmas. All these attempts in parliament failed-all of the attempts that we proposed. Not one member from the government side supported of those humane and sensible solutions. In policy development in a broader sense, Labor worked through 2002 to get the balance right-the balance between protecting our borders but responding in a human, compassionate way to genuine refugees. In December 2002 the then shadow minister for immigration, Julia Gillard, and I, as this leader, announced a series of measures to protect our borders while treating asylum seekers with decency, respect, compassion and in a timely way. We believed then and we believe now that treating them decently does not come at the expense of national security. We proposed abolishing the so-called Pacific solution-a costly and unsustainable failure. This bill is a complete antithesis the positive, constructive and humane proposals that Labor has advanced over a number of years. It seeks to legislate away a problem by creating a legal fiction: excising Australia from Australia by pretending that for asylum seekers Australia does not existterra incognita indeed. This is a foolish nonAustralia's sense. It is worse than that though. It is a vindictive and vicious measure to take against unfortunate and desperate people. It does nothing to secure our borders and returns to the government's old policy of detershipped rence and punishment based on fear. It is a bill that should be opposed.",38
19,Ms HOARE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Charlton) (10.53 am)Labor will be opposing the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 for many reasons, many of which have already been articulated by colleagues both on this side and the other side of the House. This bill proposes to amend the Migration Act 1958 to effectively excise the Australian mainland and Tasmania from Australia's migration zone for people arriving by sea without a visa. The so-called designated unauthorised arrivals may be removed to a declared country outside Australia for processing of any claims that they are owed refugee protection under the refugee convention as amended by the refugees protocol. The government has indicated at this time that Nauru will be used as the declared country with Manus Island and Christmas Island as contingency locations. Asylum seekers would be prohibited under this law from instigating any legal or appeal proceedings in Australia following any determination of their protection claims. To excise the Australian mainland and Tasmania from Australia's migration law is an absolutely ludicrous and flawed proposal. We know that, for the purposes of Australian migration law, there are islands off northern Australia which have of already been excised so that if asylum seekers arrive on those islands, they do not have access to Australian migration laws. After those excision laws were passed in this parliament there were only two islands left: Tasmania and the mainland. This legislation excises those two final islands from migration law. What this means is that if an asylum seeker reaches our country by boat without a visa then they will be declared as not being on Australian soil for the purpose of the migration laws. They will be off to Nauru, a country which, coincidentally, is not a signatory to the 1951 convention on refugees. What this means is that these asylum seekers who have come in leaky boats, in canoes and by whatever means they have in fleeing from their country of origin will find themselves, on reaching Australia, shipped off to Nauru and processed there under the international conventions. The background to this is that on 18 January 2006, 43 West Papuan asylum seekers arrived on the Australian mainland. These asylum seekers feared for their lives and the lives of their children. They spent four weeks in canoes in the ocean between West Papua and Australia. They risked their lives coming here. We can only imagine what they feared back in their own country. They put their own children at risk, putting them into canoes to flee what they feared in their own country. Can you imagine, as a parent, putting your child at that kind of risk? As a parent, I cannot imagine what desperation would cause me to do that but there was that desperation for these 43 West Papuans. The decision was made fairly early this year that 42 of those asylum seekers were found to be refugees and were granted asylum. Just last month the 43rd asylum seeker had his refugee status approved. At this time the Indonesians were unhappy with Australia. They believed that the 43 West Papuans did not face persecution and believed that Australia should send them back to Indonesia, notwithstanding Australian law and Australian migration law processes. The Indonesians withdrew their ambassador from our country. What did our government do? The Prime Minister could have explained our system of migration to the Indonesian President. He could have explained the way that our processes work and explained that the fact that these 43 West Papuans seeking asylum were granted refugee status did not mean that the Australian government agreed with the ideological position that these 43 people have taken in West Papua. The Prime Minister did not do that. He could have gone through those conversations with the President of Indonesia and explained those processes rather than taking a knee-jerk reaction in proposing this legislation that we have before us today. If we take a step back, last year, as has been explained here before, we had a group of government members who were concerned about the immigration processes in relation to asylum seekers who arrived in Australia by boat without visas. They were also concerned about the processes of detention in this country and, along with Labor, forced changes to the migration laws, particularly in relation to children. They forced changes so that we would no longer see children arriving in this country by boat placed in detention behind razor wire when they were found to be asylum seekers. They made changes to the length of time people could be kept in detention, which led to the effective abolition of indefinite detention of asylum seekers. We saw the introduction of case managed mental health care, a major recommendation which came out of the Cornelia Rau inquiry as well. We have all seen the examples of how an individual's mental health suffers while being in detention for an indefinite period. We also now have the fact that the Ombudsman is also the Immigration Ombudsman and that the system can be overseen by that person. This legislation overturns all of those changes. Australian law only applies in Australia. Australian law does not apply in Nauru. While we saw Australian law changed or softened around the edges last year, that law cannot be applied in Nauru, so we are going to have, for example, children being locked up in detention behind razor wire. We are going to have people's mental health affected. We are going to have a system where people may be held indefinitely in detention. A point that also needs to be made is that, under this legislation, an asylum seeker arrives in Australia and Australia ships that individual off to Nauru and locks that individual up. If under the UN processes that individual is found to be a refugee, they can still languish in detention in Nauru until a third country decides to take that particular individual so that that person can get on with their life. There is no time frame for that detention, even if the person is found to be a refugee. Indeed, it was reported in June that the member for Pearce reminded her colleagues at a party room meeting that, at the time that they were discussing this bill, it had been 12 months since their party room had agreed to those changes that I have already listed. A lot of people in this place, on both sides, would agree that children should not be held in detention behind razor wire for any reason at all. There is no reason that anybody could conceivably understand as a good reason for that to happen. There has been a recently published report called Seeking asylum alone, by Associate Professor Mary Crock of the University of Sydney. It found a significant increase in the number of child asylum seekers who arrived in Australia without a parent or guardian in the last few years. Between 2000 and 2002 there were 197 children travelling to Australia seeking asylum alone, of whom 154 have been found to be refugees and granted asylum. However, as recently as February this year 56 of these young people remained in immigration detention. Adele Horin's opening paragraph in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald illustrates this. She says: They were smuggled out in the dead of night in the backs of trucks under hay or bags of flour. They were children from Afghanistan whose relatives were desperate to save them from the fate of older brothers or fathers, killed or kidnapped by the Taliban. Most of the children had decision, did not know where they were going, and had never heard of Australia. What is it that could possibly drive a young person from the security and comforts of home to undertake a perilous journey through strife-torn countries and across the water in vessels of questionable seaworthiness? If you think about this as a parent, as a human being, it is beyond the imagination of most of us Australians, who really take the comforts we have very much for granted. The case of Sayed Reza Moussawi, who was interviewed on Radio National's Law Report on Tuesday of this week, is telling. Reza left Afghanistan unaccompanied as a 14-year-old. His brother was kidnapped and murdered, his bloodied body dumped on the front door of his family home almost three weeks after his abduction. Following his brother's brutal murder by the Taliban, inquiries were made around Reza's community as to whether there was another son in the household. Reza recounted what his dad said to him: My Dad turned his face to me and he started crying. I saw the tears in his eyes, and he said, ‘Reza you should leave Afghanistan because your life is in danger, and I don't want you to be killed like your brother and in front of us like a kind of a sheep or a horse or goats'. Reza's father insisted that he flee. Can you imagine the pain and torture a parent would experience in sending their adored child away, with only hope that they may be given a chance of survival better than the one they have at home? I remind the House that yesterday Australia committed further troops to Afghanistan to keep the Taliban at bay. We obviously recognise that this terrorist organisation is determined to kidnap and murder, and yet the government does not understand that it is not right to treat those victims who have fled this regime and its remnants as animals, leaving them to languish in detenno say in the tion for indefinite periods. Upon his arrival in Australia after a harrowing journey in which the 14-year-old Reza was exhausted and sick, he was questioned by the authorities. He was petrified. He had fled a country where authority is to be feared with one's life. Reza did not understand what was happening at first but was granted his freedom after 45 days in a detention centre. Whilst 45 days may not sound like an extended period, we must remember that Reza was still an unaccompanied child. He describes the detention centre as ‘a horrible place for all the immigrants and especially unaccompanied people and for the children'. In her report, Associate Professor Mary Crock describes where Australia's treatment of refugees in immigration detention continues to be inadequate and she makes it clear that the passage of this legislation will make things much worse. Unaccompanied children are not provided with any effective support while awaiting the determination of their applications for asylum. Under the measures proposed in this legislation, which is abhorrent to Australia's obligations under international law, they will not even have the slim protections available to them under Australian law. This legislation proposes to send these asylum seekers offshore to places like Nauru to languish until their applications are processed. Mary Crock's report found that unaccompanied children detained in Australian immigration centres were identified and placed in separate compounds with families. However, the report made the important point that such niceties were not extended to those children detained in Nauru and that they were treated as adults. It must be noted that, of those unaccompanied children detained within Australia, either they were all granted visas or their status was resolved. But, according to statistics provided to Mary Crock's report by the International Organisation for Migration, of the 55 unaccompanied young people who arrived in Nauru, 32 were returned to the ravages of Afghanistan. This underscores the point that those seeking asylum who will be transhipped out to Nauru like freight by the Australian government under the measures proposed in this legislation will not have the protections of Australian law. I would like to get some figures into perspective. Asylum seekers who arrived by boat in 2003-04 were approximately 1.5 per cent of the total number of so-called unauthorised arrivals, the rest of them arriving by aeroplane. The so-called unauthorised boat arrivals in the last four years, as has been indicated by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs herself, represented only three or four per cent of the total unauthorised arrivals. In recent history, 2001 represented the highest number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat. In that year, 12,355 claims for asylum were lodged by individuals already in Australia, while 4,137 asylum seekers arrived by boat-only one-quarter of the total number of asylum seekers that year. To add to those figures, almost 70 per cent of the 1,547 people intercepted between August and December 2001 and assessed offshore under the Pacific solution turned out to be genuine refugees. Add to that again the total of 130 Afghans on the Tampa who were given immediate sanctuary by New Zealand and the approval rate for refugee status rose to 71.1 per cent. I congratulate all the speakers in this debate who are opposing this legislation who have brought their personal, humane values and principles to this discussion, including the member for Pearce, the member for Cook, the member for Kooyong and the member for MCMillan. These people have stood up against fierce bullying within the Liberal Party and we saw an example of that this morning by the member for O'Connor, who is renowned for his bullying tactics. It has been fierce bullying. These members of parliament have bravely, humanely and with principle stood up against it. I encourage them to further support their comments in this discussion by voting with Labor, voting against the bill. Do not be bullied by your leader; do not be bullied by the Prime Minister when he says you need to abstain from this vote, not vote against it. To further support the statements that you have made publicly and in this place you need to cross the floor, leave the Liberal-National Party coalition, vote with Labor and oppose this abhorrent legislation that will end in tragedy for many families who come to our country seeking asylum. It must be opposed, it must be defeated and that can happen in the Senate and, hopefully, it will.",41
20,Mr TOLLNER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Solomon) (11.13 am)Thank you to members opposite for persevering with me this morning. I know that we have a line-up of people who want to speak and I want to thank members opposite for allowing me this opportunity to stand up. As most people in this place would know, I am a pretty simple country boy at heart. I do not profess to be a moral crusader or to have any sort of monopoly on moral or ethical thought, but I find this debate on the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 interesting, as I do the way it is panning out. People talk about compassion for people who arrive in this country illegally. People obviously have different views on what is the right moral position to take on these matters. I enormously respect the member for Cook, the member for Pearce, the member for Kooyong and the member for MCMillan for having the strength of their convictions. They have obviously put a lot of time and effort into pondering this bill and they have been very public about their views on it. I note, reading front page of today's Australian, that they are out there telling people exactly what they think about this legislation. I do not share their views on the legislation, but I do admire their strength of conviction and their character in doing that. But when I go around my electorate, those in it wonder what all this is about and why there is so much opposition to this sort of stuff. We in Darwin are at the leading edge of illegal boat arrivals in Australia-there is no doubt about it. I remember that some years ago, when I first arrived in the Territory, they were a regular occurrence: people lobbing onto our beaches and looking around for taxis to find their way to the nearest police station so that they could hand themselves over to the authorities and involve themselves in long, drawn out legal processes, which inevitably led to their permanent entry into Australia. That has changed in the last 10 years. We do not have people lobbing onto our beaches like we used to and I think the majority of people in my electorate are happy that is the case. Darwin is of course a multicultural city. People who have turned up from other countries and settled in Darwin have done it the hard way. They have done all of the processing correctly and they have come in the front door, and I tend to think that they are a little bit peeved and miffed that there is a debate going on that would allow some relaxation in respect of people who come to this country in unauthorised and illegal manners. I look at that issue in respect of my electorate and I see that is the view of my constituents. I wonder what the members on the other side are saying to their constituents and how they are selling this line. Does the member for Lilley tell his constituents in Sandgate and Shorncliffe, as they have beaches there, that boat people could be lobbing onto their beaches and wandering the around their streets, looking for the authorities, trying to find somewhere to hand themselves in? What does the member for the wonderful multicultural electorate of Watson tell his constituents who went through all of the processes and came here legitimately and are worthwhile and wonderful members of the Australian community? Does he tell them that he is trying to make it easier for people who want to get here illegally? Does he tell them about the examples that we see in England, where they have got 60,000 unauthorised arrivals? They have no idea whom these 60,000 people are, where they have come from, how they intend to make them fit into the country, whether these people are criminals, whether they have criminal backgrounds, whether they are carrying diseases and whether they have gone through various health checks. Does the member for Brand tell his constituents that there is a possibility that if we continue to further relax immigration laws we will see people coming down between the coast and Garden Island in his electorate and landing at Point Peron, Becher Point and Golden Bay? Does he tell his multicultural constituents, people who have come here legally, that this is what his goal is, or he-like other members-hide behind the skirt of the member for Pearce? Do these members just stand there and watch the member for Pearce, the member for Cook, the member for Kooyong and the member for MCMillan take all the heat in this debate? Do they stand there and laugh at them? The greatest dog whistler that we have in this parliament is the member for Brand. I am sure that what he says to his backbench and his party is something completely different from what he says to the constituents of Brand. Does he actually tell them that he is going to sit there and hide behind the skirt the member for Pearce and try to water down our immigration laws? I think not. The point that I want to make this morning is that I find it quite reprehensible that members opposite sit there and hide behind the courage and conviction of the members for Cook, Pearce, Kooyong and MCMillan. It is an appalling situation. I will be waiting see the division on this legislation, because they will all be sitting there whistling and saying, ‘Come on! Come over to our side!' yet none of them have the courage of their convictions to go out into their electorates and tell them exactly where the Labor Party is coming from on this issue: that they want to water down our immigration laws, that they have absolutely no compassion whatsoever for the millions and millions of refugees around the world who want to come to this country in a legitimate way and that they are all there to support illegal smugglers and illegal immigrants. We do not hear any of that from the other side, and to me that is the sorry part of this whole debate.",44
21,Mr ADAMS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I would like to point out to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat that the Australian Labor Party does not support any smuggling of people anywhere in the world and we do not support the weakening does of our immigration laws in any way. Fortythree people in a leaky canoe-this is what this legislation is about. It is about 43 people from Papua in a leaky canoe fleeing persecution, landing in Australia and the government getting out its 10-tonne hammer to crack a nut. This legislation is a farce. What sort of invasion is this? How much of a threat are a few terrified people in a canoe? Time passes and the memory of this event is supposed to have faded since the autumn sittings of parliament. But I doubt it has. Accounts of returned Afghanis are now coming through. How many of them survived their of repatriation? It seems they have been sent back to an unstable and dangerous land where the war still rages and the Taliban are beginning to make themselves felt again. The Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 can mean children in detention again. Indefinite detention will return. Case managed mental health care to is over. The Commonwealth Immigration Ombudsman will also lose oversight of asylum seekers when they are sent to a remote foreign island for processing. Earlier this year the government did the right thing in issuing more than 40 protective visas to asylum seekers from Papua. The visas were issued on the grounds that these individuals had a well-founded fear of persecution. When the government made this decision, we on this side congratulated them on it. This latest legislation, if it is passed, will guarantee that the government will never again treat asylum seekers with the decency that they saw earlier this year. The bill means that if in future people fleeing persecution arrive on Australia's mainland in a canoe, they will be sent to Nauru to be processed and Australia will act as though it has no obligations. Under this proposal, children will be in detention again. We will see indefinite detention come back. Case managed health care will be stopped. The Commonwealth Immigration Ombudsman will also lose oversight of asylum seekers when they are sent to a remote foreign island for processing. The latest idea to come to light has this government suggesting we accommodate the would be asylum seekers in prison hulks before they are processed. That would really be offshore! My ancestors were convicts and spent time in those miserable, rat-infested prison hulks on the Thames before they came to this country. Are we going back to those days? What exactly are we trying to achieve by punishing those who believe that Australia is a safe and decent place to aspire to live in? There is no way of amending this bill to make it just. If one government senator crosses the floor in parliament and votes with Labor in opposing this bill, it can be stopped. This issue should be above politics. If this goes through, it means that anyone who comes to Australia's shores by boat, ship, canoe, sailboard or bathtub-anything that floats on water-will not be deemed to be in Australia. Suddenly we have no boundaries-if they do not have papers, they have not arrived in Australia. What if someone gives birth and that baby is deposited on Australian soil? What country are they in? It certainly would not be in the country of the mother's birth; they may have been through several countries since then. It seems they are stateless and forever bound to spend their life in Nauru. They will have to go through the process of seeking assistance and be sent off to Nauru for processing. They are assessed by a single officer and if that person deems them not to be refugees, they can appeal to another officer-once again one person-and then that is it. If there is no sympathy there, they are off to Nauru to try and find another country to take them. This virtually means anyone arriving by sea without papers has little or no chance of gaining asylum in Australia, whether they are eligible or not. What about the visiting ships? Or luxury yachts? Are they going to be banged up in a prison hulk or asylum camp just for daring to cross the country's sea boundaries and set foot on Australian soil somewhere? It starts becoming a nonsense when you think of it like that. More potential illegal immigrants come to this country by air than by any other way. They go through the normal processes of visas, false or real, and walk happily off aeroplanes all round the country. Is this the way we want them to turn up instead? It just means we get the rich illegal immigrants, not the poor ones, who really are the asylum seekers fleeing persecution, with only the clothes on their back and a few trinkets of memories. With this legislation I get the feeling I am living in a country run by the Red Queen out of Alice in Wonderland. You know what she used to say? She said, ‘Off with his head, off with his head', when someone displeased her. So if whoever it is does not approve of this legislation or disagrees with our leaders, and it annoys the leaders that there is dissent, then their views are dismissed summarily. ‘We cannot possibly be wrong,' seems to be the sentiment here. The arrogance of this government comes through. Yet there are many on the government side of the House, as well as in the opposition, who are concerned about this legislation. These people do not believe it right to lock up women and children. They believe that we should have a firm but just and fair process for all who seek to come here by whatever means. Whatever happened to the tenet that all are innocent unless proven guilty? It is a sad world in which we are making our own citizens suspicious of all other citizens of other nations. We are all one people under the sun-all part of the human race-and we do not have the right to subject them to this undoubted persecution. The introduction of this bill appears to demonstrate that our refugee laws are being determined and rewritten by a foreign state. This is not an initiative of the responsible department seeking to improve the quality of our asylum processes. There is no doubt that the proposed law is in direct response to Indonesian anger over the granting of protection visas to the 42 West Papuans. Australian law should not be enacted at the dictate of a country which itself falls significantly short of democratic and human rights standards yet rejects any criticism of its own justice system, particularly its criminal justice tem. The introduction in this way of foreign policy considerations into an asylum determination process giving effect to Australia's treaty obligations under the refugee convention will render these obligations meaningless in practice. As a member of this parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I find this extraordinarily stupid. We should be ensuring that we have some consistency in our approach to treaty making and are abiding by those that we have agreed to-otherwise, why do we bother to engage in this process? I do not believe this legislarise tion is needed, nor should we support it. The next thing will be that Tasmania is annexed and becomes that ‘prison offshore island'not much different from how it was in the 1800s when my ancestors finally arrived there at His Majesty's pleasure. That experiment did not work. It did little to change the behaviour of many of the inmates; it only deprived them of their liberty and hope, which sent so many of them mad or even to an early grave. If we want migrants with skills to become part of our nation, we would be better off accepting some of these desperate people who want to learn from us and who want to work and improve life for their families and for communities of which they are a part. We are all capable of learning, and many of those people would be already halfway there with many skills. So why take temporary overseas workers when we can take people who really want to be here and be part of our communities? This legislation is to appease the Indonesian anger at the acceptance of some of their people who arrived by sea from West Papua. The argument is that they are refugees and they need to be assisted under the international obligations that the world accepts as sys- due practice-for example, they are being persecuted and, if they return to their country, they will be harmed. Those are the grounds to grant them the status of refugees. Fortress Australia was never a way of solving the issue of boat people coming here. The work we do to help other countries improve the conditions of their people and their workers would be far more useful than trying to keep people out of Australia and, in doing so, wasting vast amounts of money. I oppose this legislation and reject the reasoning behind it.",46
22,Mr ENTSCH,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I to speak on the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006, coming, if you like, from the perspective of a member who represents a constituency in which all too often constituents find people basically knocking on their back doors. Those people have arrived in this country, unauthorised, through various means, walked up to constituents' family homes and knocked on their doors in some of the most remote areas of Australia. By that I am talking about the western Cape York communities and in the Torres Strait. We had no idea who they were. They had no background checks and no health checks. It was not so many years ago that we actually had a vessel land at Holloways Beach in Cairns with quite a number of very well-dressed gentlemen from China, I think. They dispersed very quickly-some of them catching cabs and others racing to the railway station to buy tickets to disappear because they had bought a ticket over. What the member for Lyons said in the introduction to his contribution is actually quite correct. This debate is about 43 people in a leaky boat. The problem we have is that those 43 can very quickly become 430 or 4,300 because, even in this case, there were many lined up to come after if they had seen that these people had got a successful outcome. You can see no better example of that than what happened prior to the Tampa, where we started to see twos, threes, fours and fives turning up in places like the Torres Strait, in the member for Solomon's electorate in the Northern Territory and those areas. Because of the system that we had, which was far more generous than anything that they could expect through any of the United Nations conventions, those couple of handfuls of people became literally thousands. Thousands arrived here but we have no idea of the number that did not-because, like those 43 I talked about and that the member for Lyons talked about earlier on, many of them were in leaky boats. Many of them were in boats that were totally unseaworthy. I can remember going to Christmas Island about the time when large numbers were arriving, and people in the Christmas Island community were complaining about the numbers of unidentified bodies that were being washed up because their vessels had sunk. It is very easy to sit back and attack the government and say that we are not compassionate, but I would challenge anybody that has that argument. By creating opportunities and expectations that people are going to get an outcome that they are not entitled to under normal circumstances, it encourages people to get into these leaky boats. Of course, we see many women and children perish as a result of it. I think that any action that we can take that will prevent people from making that decision and trying to bypass the system is something that we need to consider. I am elected to represent my constituency of Leichhardt, and the Leichhardt constituency extends to within three kilometres of the mainland of Papua New Guinea. My constituents on Saibai Island, Boigu Island, Dauan Island, Badu Island or in Aurukun in the Western Cape communities are no less important and no less significant to me as an elected representative, nor should they be any less important to the Australian government and the Australian people. They are Australian citizens and they have every right to be afforded the protection that we can give them and their families to ensure that they are not exposed to unnecessary risk. I wonder how many on the other side, who argue that we should be allowing these illegal migrants to come through these channels at will, would change their position if suddenly, in the middle of the night, they woke up, walked out and opened their front door and found a total stranger standing there, knowing that they had no health checks, no migration checks and no background checks. We have had them come through the Torres Strait, where we discovered that they were special security guards for Saddam Hussein. These are the sorts of people who have come through. They have bought their way through and have been knocking on the door of my constituents. We have had people up there with tuberculosis and Japanese encephalitis. There is no screening and it puts a lot of Australians at risk. I believe we have a strong obligation to ensure that we protect, in the first instance, the rights of our Australian citizens. That is why we are elected to this place and I think that has to come first. For that reason, I am strongly supportive of any sort of measure that is likely to act a serious deterrent to people coming through in this way. We have many people languishing in refugee camps around the world. We are a very generous taker of refugees-about 14,000, as I recall-including people from Sudan and places such as that. There are horrific stories. I am very proud to have Sudanese men in my community in Cairns. When you talk to them about their difficulties, it brings a tear to your eye. They could never have come and had the opportunities if we as Australians did not have the generosity of spirit that we have. I do believe we have to discourage people from taking risks by buying an outcome, particularly those coming from Papua New Guinea, through Irian Jaya, given that over the border they could have got asylum in Papua New Guinea. We have to take into consideration those Australians whose lives are impacted by this situation. So I strongly support this legislation. In closing, I would like to say that I respect the opinion of my colleagues the members for Pearce, Kooyong, MCMillan and Cook. As a member of the Liberal Party, I think one of the great things is that we are able to have a different opinion and, while I totally disagree with their views, I respect their right to opinion and I admire their courage in standing up for their convictions. I support this bill.",48
23,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I wish to speak in the strongest possible terms in opposition to the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. This government has a policy that is built on sand. It shifts with the wind, it shifts on the basis of what is in the political interest of the government in terms of its preparedness to promote fear, to promote hatred and to vilify some of the most vulnerable people in the global community. as It is no way for this parliament to provide the leadership that we have been entrusted to provide by our respective communities. Last year, pressure from the Australian public forced the Howard government to make some minor changes to the Migration Act. These changes finally saw an end to the detention of children. The government committed Australia to processing asylum seekers within 90 days and they introduced the oversight of the Commonwealth Ombudsman in cases of prolonged detention. These reforms were a very small step in the right direction. But now we have a case of one step forward, two steps back. Today this parliament is debating a bill that reduces us as a parliament and as a nation. This bill is based on a number of falsehoods. We just had the member for Leichhardt again introducing fear of diseased people and people who were Saddam Hussein's bodyguards coming through on this basis. What is this about? It is about 43 people who were found to be genuine asylum seekers, the Indonesian government being upset by this decision and the Australian government saying that they were prepared to put the interests of the Indonesian government before the interests of the Australian people and have that before Australian sovereignty. In guillotining this bill, we have seen a government that is prepared to even silence Australian parliamentarians. This bill is wrong in principle and it is wrong in motivation. It cannot be improved by any amendments, so we are not moving any. I pay tribute to my colleague the member for Watson-who is here in the chamber-who has taken a principled stance and who has shown that, in taking a principled stance, we can appeal to people's better nature. I think that the Australian people are essentially warm and generous people. We have taken people from countries all over the world and, with the exception of our Indigenous people, we must remember that all of us are migrants or the sons and daughters of migrants. Yet we have, because of 43 people, this promotion of fear and a bill that is prepared to excise the entire nation. You do not protect your borders by giving them up-and that is what this bill does. We need to put this into perspective. As of 28 April, there were 803 people in immigration detention in Australia-18 of them were unauthorised boat arrivals. During the first nine months of 2005 Australia received around 2,400 claims for asylum. This compares with 23,000 claims in Britain and 38,000 in France. The USA received 38,000 claims, but many times that number of people simply arrived in the USA without applying. During the past five years approximately 80,000 migrants and asylum seekers have reached the Italian peninsula by boat. More than 6½ thousand Africans have arrived, by sea, on the Canary Islands archipelago this year alone. The Australian government is removing our borders because of 43 asylum seekers whom it has found to be legitimate. This continues a campaign of fearmongering and vilification of asylum seekers. The Labor Party supports border protection but does not accept that excising the whole of Australia is an effective means of border protection. You do not deal with boat arrivals by pretending that you do not have sea borders or by pretending that, if you arrive by one particular mode of arrivalboat-you do not arrive in Australia at all. In a statement on 19 April the UNHCR expressed serious concerns about the Australian government's announced changes to the processing of boat arrivals. It said: If this were to happen, it would be an unfortunate precedent, being for the first time, to our knowledge, that a country with a fully functioning and credible asylum system, in the absence of anything approximating a mass influx, decides to transfer elsewhere the responsibility to handle claims made actually on the territory of the state. This bill is a disgraceful shirking of responsibility by Australia and it must be rejected. The Australian Labor Party rejects it. Australia's 43 Catholic bishops have rejected it. As of 8 August 2006 almost 88,000 Australians had signed Get Up's online petition rejecting the bill. I reject the bill as being fundamentally abhorrent to everything I believe in and all the reasons why I want to represent my electorate in this great parliament. The government would have us believe that these changes are small and the concessions great. The government would have us believe that the end justifies the means-that is, the temporary appeasement of Indonesia justifies the offshore detention of asylum seekers who have reached Australia by boat. We know that that is not the case. You cannot achieve peace by undermining human rights. If Australia's relationship with Indonesia is built on such a flimsy foundation it is doomed to fail. I believe our relationship with Indonesia is much stronger than that. Our relationship with Indonesia needs to be built on mutual respect. I would like to quote Justice Michael Kirby: Every diminution of freedom takes us in the wrong direction. Every act of discrimination by our parliament and governments dishonours our nation. That is certainly the case with this bill. Our perspective on the 43 who arrived by boat is very different from our perspective on the majority of people who illegally arrive in Australia-who, of course, are on planes. Surely, that dichotomy is entirely inappropriate. As a result of this bill, asylum seekers arriving by boat will be processed by countries such as Nauru or PNG. The Pacific solution was created to deter the secondary movement of asylum seekers who, before they entered Australia, had bypassed other countries in which they could have sought asylum. We need to bear in mind that this whole thing is motivated by the 43 people from West Papua. I wonder what country they could have gone to between West Papua and Australia to seek asylum. The bill will affect everyone arriving by boat in Australia, even those who have arrived directly from a state in which they face persecution. The government argues that this is the next logical step-that people arriving on mainland Australia should be processed as if they had arrived on one of the currently excised areas. This argument is patently absurd. The government is trying to pretend that, if you seek asylum in Australia and arrive by sea, you never actually arrive in the nation. This bill also reaffirms the government's commitment to prolonged detention. We all remember when the Pacific solution was established. We remember the Prime Minister's grand statements that none of these people would ever set foot on the Australian mainland. We know that a majority of those people, considered under Australian law and UN conventions, were found to be legitimate asylum seekers. We know that, despite the Prime Minister's rhetoric, many of them are now settled in Australia and making an outstanding contribution-as generations of migrants before them have done. But we know it was all about politics. Who were most of these people? Most of them were people fleeing the Taliban in Afghanistan-an abhorrent, fundamentalist regime that persecuted Christians, women and people who questioned the regime-and the abhorrent regime of Saddam Hussein. These refugees are understandably confused that the Australian government says that these regimes are so abhorrent that we will risk the lives of the brave men and women of the Australian defence forces to combat those regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, and yet those people who fought courageously for democratic change and human rights in those countries and were persecuted as a result arrive in freedom-loving Australia only to be locked up and sent away to Nauru for processing. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say that the regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban were so evil and yet we will persecute the victims of those very same regimes. Through this legislation the government has committed to providing migration assistance for asylum seekers at offshore processing centres, but a number of questions are raised. Who will provide the assistance? Will the migration agents be chosen by the government? If so, how will their independence be ensured? Will this assistance even be guaranteed? Will journalists and lawyers be given access to detainees in the centres? So far only one journalist has been allowed to visit, and that was in April 2005. Access is also a problem for the Ombudsman. Further, this bill gives asylum seekers arriving by boat no access to the Refugee Review Tribunal or to Australian courts for judicial review if their applications are refused. This bill not only physically removes Australia and its borders and excises the whole country; it also excises the values of our country. It excises our law. It excises our upholding of human rights. It excises our dignity. We know that wrong decisions can often be made on refugee status. Between 1993 and 2006 the Refugee Review Tribunal overturned 7,885 departmental decisions rejecting applications for asylum. This means that more than 7,885 refugees were not returned to countries in which they feared persecution when the department had previously refused them a protection visa. Just this week the Edmund Rice Centre released information concerning the subsequent death of asylum seekers that has resulted from bad decisions by the government in sending back asylum seekers who legitimately feared persecution in their country of origin. We know that there is a mental health aspect to this. We know about Cornelia Rau and the horrific circumstances of the failure in her case. But these failures have continued. On 22 May this year Dr Fiona Hawker, a very senior and highly respected psychiatrist who had been treating detainees at Baxter, revealed that at least six detainees who had been hospitalised with severe psychiatric conditions had been returned to detention against the specific advice of their treating psychiatrist. As a result they had to be returned to acute psychiatric care. This undermines the global framework of the 1951 refugee convention. Why was the refugee convention developed by the United Nations in the post-World War II period? It was because of the experience of Jewish citizens fleeing Nazi Germany and the other fascist persecutors in Europe. These Jewish refugees were pushed back offshore in their boats, in many cases sent back to their deaths. The world said: ‘Never again.' By adopting the refugee convention the world said that humanity is better than that, that we are part of a global community and that we do have a responsibility to stop that occurring again. Of course, Nauru is not a signatory to the 1951 convention, which is one of the reasons why that country has been chosen to house detainees. Papua New Guinea is a signatory, but it has not passed domestic legislation implementing a refugee status determination. I watched with some amazement Minister Vanstone's cold dismissal on television earlier this week of the allegations made by the Edmund Rice Centre. It is no wonder that there is not a single church organisation in this nation which is supporting this legislation. I say to Senator Fielding, who will have to consider his vote on this bill, that you are a representative of the Family First Party, not the ‘Australian Families First Party', and kids being locked up behind barbed wire in what is essentially a prison camp on Nauru is just unacceptable in 2006, regardless of their origin, religion, race, gender or colour. It is simply unacceptable. Article 31 of the UN convention makes it very clear that asylum seekers arriving in a territory directly should not be penalised for their mode of arrival. It is no wonder the UN High Commissioner for Refugees stated on 14 May 2006: It's a pretty dramatic solution to the situation ... They're penalising people arriving in Australia by boat, as opposed to people who arrive by plane. Other countries deal with boat arrivals in much greater numbers than Australia. I will conclude my comments by saying that this is a test of this parliament and this government. It has been a test of the Australian Labor Party and we have risen to the occasion, and that is why we are rejecting this legislation. But we have to bear in mind how future generations will look at what we are doing here. The kids in the schools in my electorate who saw Ian and Janey Han Hwang taken out of Stanmore Public School have seen, at that level, the persecution that can occur. But to take children offshore and lock them up behind barbed wire is something that should be completely unacceptable to all Australians. We need a government that is prepared to promote hope over fear, and we need a government that is prepared to respect the human rights of all individuals. I urge the House to reject this abhorrent legislation.",50
24,Mr DANBY,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I support the view of the shadow minister for immigration, my good friend the honourable member for Watson, that this is a bad and unnecessary piece of legislation. I agree with you absolutely, member for Watson. The Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 is also a piece of legislation that contradicts the government's own statements last year after the debacle of the Cornelia Rau and the Vivian Solon affairs and after the Palmer inquiry into the administration of the immigration program that it was going to turn over a new leaf in policy and practice on the treatment of asylum seekers. It violates the agreement that the government came to with its own members, led by the honourable member for Kooyong. As the honourable member for Watson has said, we will be opposing this bill at every stage. I am pleased to see that some of the members opposite-the members for Kooyong, MCMillan, Pearce and Cook-agree with us. I commend their adherence to principle on this matter and hope other coalition members and senators will also agree with us. Before examining the specific provisions of this bill, I would like to reflect on some the events that brought it about. This bill reaction to the Indonesian government's anger at the decision by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to recommend the granting of protection visas to 43 people from the Indonesian province of Papua, who arrived in Australia by boat in March. The arrival of these people created a difficult situation for Australia. Indonesia is one of our most important regional neighbours and a vital partner in the war against terrorism in our region. Indonesia's national sentiment is strongly opposed to separatism in Papua, and some Indonesians suspect that Australia is conniving to detach Papua from Indonesia. Australia is clear that we respect the torial integrity of Indonesia and that we do not support Papuan separatism. Now that Indonesia is a democracy, in which the rule of law and respect for human rights are being established-I am not saying that they are fully established, but great progress has been made. I do not believe that there is a case for separatism in Papua. In fact, the evidence of last year's free election in Indonesia is that the majority of people in Papua do not support separatism. It is true that violations of human rights are still taking place in Papua, but I do not believe that the solution to this problem lies in support for an independent Papuan state. As the recent peace agreement in Aceh shows, the Indonesian government is willing to come to agreements with separatist forces in the outlying regions of Indonesia, and I commend both sides in Aceh on that settlement. I think Australia's policy should be what it has been for a long time, particularly set out by the member for Griffith: to encourage a similar agreement on a ‘special autonomy' status for Papua within Indonesia. Nevertheless, so long as there is separatist agitation and repression in Papua, Australia of will have to deal with the problem of small is a numbers of Papuans seeking to come to this country. The 43 people who came to Australia earlier this year were judged by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to be people genuinely in need of protection, and they were duly granted visas. As the honourable member for Watson has pointed out, Labor did not take a position on whether or not these people were genuine refugees. That was a matter to be determined by the department in following the correct procedures, and that is what happened. If the decision was made by two junior officers, that is a reflection on the competence of ministerial arrangements. The displeasure of the Indonesian govterriernment should have been anticipated. Now that Indonesia is a democracy, Indonesia's governments have to respond to domestic political pressure just as we do-just as all democratic governments do. President Yudhoyono responded to nationalist anger in Indonesia by withdrawing his ambassador to Canberra. This was unfortunate, but I think the correct response for the Australian government was to continue with patient explanation of Australia's position-that Australia does not support Papuan separatism, that Australia supports the strengthening of human rights in Indonesia, including Papua, and that Australia supports a negotiated autonomy agreement in Papua along the lines of the one in Aceh. The government should also have defended its own immigration policies and the integrity of its own immigration department. It should have said that the 43 Papuans were not judged by politicians but by an independent process based on objective criteria. That would not have satisfied the more outspoken anti-Australian elements in Indonesia, some of whom have a broader antiWestern agenda, but it would have eventually satisfied the Indonesian government, which is an essentially moderate government trying to carry through extensive reform programs in its own country and which has no desire to have pointless disputes with its neighbours, particularly neighbours such as Australia, which is so well disposed towards Indonesia. But what did this government do instead? It reacted in a blind panic, determined to sure that no further asylum seekers from Papua would be allowed into Australia under any circumstances. In reacting in this way, the government has trashed its own procedures, repudiated its own public servants, undermined the process of reform in the immigration department and broken the undertakings it gave last year to implement the recommendations of the Palmer inquiry, in both letter and spirit. No wonder the government's own backbenchers, who thought they had the Prime Minister's word on this, are so angry. It is notable that this bill did not have its origin in the immigration department. It emerged from a meeting of the cabinet National Security Committee. In other words, it is a bill designed to fix a foreign policy problem, rather than a bill designed to improve our immigration system. Once again, as it did in 2001 at the time of the Tampa episode, this government has dealt with an immigration issue with a quick political fix rather than with a coherent policy. At the time of the Palmer inquiry, after the shameful treatment of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon were revealed, we were promised that immigration decisions would no longer be made on the basis of crude politics. Now we can see how long that promise has lasted-less than a year. It is hard to see how this legislation has any rationale other than as a quick fix for a political problem. The Papuans who came to Australia in March were not brought here by people smugglers. There is no evidence of an organised attempt to gatecrash our immigration system as there was in the 1990s. In recent years the situation in Afghanistan has become more settled and, as a result of improved cooperation between Australia and Indonesia in cracking down on peoplesmuggling operations, there have been many enfewer attempts to bring people to Australia illegally by boat. The most deplorable aspect of this bill is that it revives the discredited Pacific solution. All unauthorised arrivals by sea will now be dispatched automatically to Nauru, where they will have to stay while their claims are assessed. Even if they are found to be genuine refugees they will have to stay in Nauru until a third country is found that will accept them. Maybe a third country will be found but no other country is obliged to accept asylum seekers that Australia has refused to accept. The government says that such people will only be dispatched to places were their safety and well-being can be protected, but Australian law does not apply in foreign countries. We cannot really guarantee that asylum seekers sent to Nauru or any other place outside Australia will be properly treated. I am sure those managing the detention centre in Nauru will do their best-although events in the past give us cause to doubt even that-but Nauru is a very small island with a small population and many problems of its own. It has a tropical climate, an acute shortknows age of water and very limited amenities. With all the goodwill in the world, prolonged detention there cannot be but psychologically harmful, especially for families with children but also for single people separated from families. Last year the honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues ended their rebellion on the basis of four promises from the Prime Minister. These were: an end to indefinite detention; an end to detention of children, except as a last resort; more attention to the mental health of detainees; independent oversight of detention arrangements by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Now we discover that these concessions were phoney concessions because they only applied in Australia, not to the offshore detention centres, which the government is now reviving as receptacles for all the unauthorised arrivals by sea. Under this bill we once again have de facto indefinite detention, because even genuine refugees will be stuck on Nauru until third countries agree to take them on. der this bill children can once again be detained. They can be detained on Nauru indefinitely. Under this bill detained people will once again be denied adequate mental health care, which is impossible to provide on Nauru, an environment almost guaranteed to cause mental health problems. Under this bill detainees will be 5,000 kilometres from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, who will need a Nauruan visa even to visit the people he is supposed to be protecting, and who will be operating in a country where Australian law does not apply. This bill is a disgrace to Australia and a disgrace to this government. It is an attempt to fix a foreign policy problem at the expense of vulnerable and friendless people. I think anyone who knows my record that I am in favour of good relations with Indonesia. Indeed, I have written many articles in the Jakarta Post arguing for good relations between our two countries. I am in favour of any reasonable steps to reassure Indonesia that Australia respects Indonesia's territorial integrity and does not support separatism. But this bill is wrong, unprincipled and unnecessary. The spectacle of this government reneging on its promises and undertakings from last year and returning to the failed policies of the past-and all because of 43 Papuans in a canoe-is a truly shameful one. I hope there are enough coalition senators with a conscience who will share the scruples of the honourable member for Kooyong and his colleagues, and who will defeat this bill in the Senate. They will have the thanks of the Australian people if they do so.",53
25,Ms HALL,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 excises the Australian mainland and Tasmania from the Australian migration zone for people arriving by Un- boat without a visa. Nauru will be used to detain asylum seekers, and asylum seekers arriving by boat will have no access to legal or appeal proceedings in Australia. I think that is rather horrendous. Australia's history in relation to refugees and asylum seekers has been somewhat sullied over the last few years, and I think very important to look at who asylum seekers are and why they are seeking asylum on our shores. For a start, asylum seekers are men, women and children who have the same feelings and needs that we do. They are people who have been subjected to the most horrendous conditions: war, and many forms of torture. They face death and persecution on a daily basis. That they hop into leaky boats and come across the seas to Australia shows just how desperate they are. They are not criminals. They are not people who are trying to circumvent systems. They are people with real needs who are suffering. They come to Australia in this way as a last resort. Unfortunately, the Howard government's record in this area is something that is less than we, as a nation, can boast about. They have politicised the whole processsomething that previous governments had moved away from. There is always political gain to be made in blaming victims, particularly in this area. Previous governments have recognised the need to work together to provide asylum to people who come to our country seeking solace. This government has been very inept in the way that it has addressed the issue of asylum seekers and, as I mentioned, has politicised it at every level. The government's 2001 election strategy revolved around the Tampa. The government is on the record as publicising the event where women and children jumped from a boat to save their lives by saying they were thrown overboard. They have vilified asylum seekers and refugees in a way that would make Goebbels blush. To be quite honest, I see asylum seekers and refugees as some of the most vulnerable people in the world. I am very ashamed to have been part of a parliament that has adopted this approach. We have a fairly interesting history when it comes to refugees. The first people of Engit is lish descent who came to Australia were refugees from the prison system in the UK. From 1838-39, hundreds of German Lutherans came to Australia. From 1938-39, there were 6,500 Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. From 1941-45, we had thousands of Asians fleeing Japanese aggression. From 1945-53, 170,000 European victims of war and oppression came to Australia. In 1975, there were 1,800 East Timorese, following the Indonesian invasion. From 1975-85, there were 95,000 Vietnamese refugees. There was concern in the community at that time, but the approach by the government and opposition of the day was very different from the approach that we have seen under the Howard government. That was a time when people came in boats to Australia and Australia recognised their needs, embraced them and took them into our society. And some of those refugees are some of the most successful people in Australia today. In 1989, we had 20,000 Chinese students who were permitted to stay after the Tiananmen Square massacre. In 1999, we had the 4,000 Kosovo refugees who were given temporary sanctuary in Australia and whom we have spoken about in some detail in the past. I feel that as a nation we have suffered because of the Howard government's actions. We have been a compassionate nation in the past, but this will be seen as a very dark era in our history. History will judge the Howard government's actions in this area very poorly. I will go to the main points of the debate. We should not be appeasing Indonesia. That is exactly what this legislation is about: appeasing Indonesia. We should respect Indonesia. Indonesia is one of the countries that are very important to Australia. It is a country that we need to have a strong relationship with, but that relationship should be equal; it should not be subservient. This legislation, I believe, found its roots in the fact that 43 Papuans arrived in Australia on 18 January this year by sea, and 42 of those were later found to be refugees. In response to the immigration department's decision to grant visas to the 42 Papuans, the Indonesian government promptly withdrew its ambassador from Australia. Following this, the Australian government released the proposed legislation being debated today. We are an independent nation. We need to look at these issues on a basis that is in line with our culture, our laws and our history. We should not be adopting the approach that we have in this legislation. It is a very shortargument. term approach that fixes a diplomatic, foreign affairs situation, rather than a long-term approach-one that is considered, will benefit Australia and will raise our standing in world and our recognition as a nation. Our immigration policy should be based on Australia's interests and obligations to international law. Our immigration policy should not be based on appeasing Indonesia. Labor will not support a policy motivated by this at the expense of fulfilling our international obligations and humanitarian responsibilities. That is why we are not supporting this legislation. We realise we have international obligations. We realise that there are humanitarian responsibilities. We know who those asylum seekers are and we know the issues that have forced them to flee their countries. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat should have the right to access the same Australian legal system as asylum seekers who arrive by other means. Just because you come into Australia on a plane does not mean that you should be treated differently to asylum seekers who hop into leaking boats and are so desperate that they are prepared to come to Australia in that way. Asylum seekers on Nauru will not have access to the Australian legal system provided to asylum seekers detained at our airports or to people who come to Australia on another visa, overstay the visa and apply for asylum once they are here. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat should not be punished and discriminated against. Members on the other side of the chamber have talked about people who come on boats as queuejumpers. I do not accept that in any shape or form. If I was in a situation where I was as desperate as many of these people who are hopping on those leaking boats are, I would do exactly the same. Do not tell me that a person who arrives at an airport and seeks to circumvent the process deserves to be treated any differently. That is a non-Labor believes all asylum seekers should have the right to access Australian appeal processes, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Australian judicial review. To deny this is to deny basic human rights. Women and children should not be put in detention. The government recognised last year that children should not be kept in detention, and legislated accordingly. At the time, I would have liked the government to have gone a little bit further. There were some issues that I did not think had been addressed fully, surrounding the impact of detention on mental health and the ability of somebody in detention to know that they need to have an independent medical assessment. But, in comparison to this legislation, the previous legislation was a golden piece. A little over 12 months ago, in that legislation, we moved that children be removed from behind barbed wire. Here we are, 14 months later, putting them back again. Every single piece of information that I have read on the impact that keeping children in detention has on their psychological well-being and their development is negative. I do not know how a government can legislate to treat children in this fashion. These children will be crippled by the time they are released from detention. They will not be allowed to develop in the same way as the young people who are in the gallery today. They will not learn in the same way. When and if they are released, they will not be able to be integrated into our society in the way that we would like them to be or that they would like to be. The Howard government has gone back on a promise. This legislation will once again condemn children to live behind barbed wire, to indefinite detention and denial of basic civil liberties. In 2004 a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission inquiry into children in immigration detention centres found that the government's policy of detaining children: ... failed to protect the mental health of children, failed to provide adequate health care and education and failed to protect unaccompanied children and those with disabilities. Detention is no place for child. They are not criminals; they have not done anything wrong. The government have acknowledged that in the past but now, to appease Indonesia, they will once again immorally detain children. I will not support policy that denies basic human rights and liberty to children. This legislation amendment means that asylum seekers will, once again, be sent to languish in limbo, indefinitely, on Nauru. Under the new policy, asylum seekers granted refugee status on Nauru cannot automatically apply for Australian visas and can be resettled in a third country. That is what this government wants. They want them to be settled in a third country. Are we not abrogating our responsibility? If these asylum seekers are identified as genuine refugees, should we not be welcoming them into Australia rather than locking them up behind barbed wire or asking another country to accept them as refugees? The government's policy has shown that genuine refugees have been left to languish on Nauru in the past, and under this policy it will be much worse. The new legislation means that case managed mental health care will not be available to asylum seekers on Nauru. There has been case after case of detainees suffering mental health problems, including numerous cases of self-harm and suicide attempts. That is what we, as a nation, will be sanctioning when this legislation is passed. This government needs to rethink the legislation and what it is about. It is not about a political quick fix. It is not about winning the next election. It is not about appeasing Indonesia. Rather, it is about offering asylum to people who are refugees. These are people who are fleeing atrocities. Revelations about the botched handling by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in the past have shown the unbelievable detention of Australian citizens such as Cornelia Rau. The deportation of Vivian Solon, an Australian citizen, proves that it is necessary for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to oversee asylum seekers on Nauru. This legislation will deny this. This is bad policy designed to appease Indonesians at the expense of human rights for asylum seekers who have arrived on our shores. The Pacific solution is an illogical policy. It is a policy to which we are returning. It is a policy that has cost taxpayers more than $240 million since its implementation in 2001. This money would be better spent on services to resettle these people in our community after initial processing on the mainland. The government is abandoning our international obligation to the 1951 refugee convention and our responsibility to offer protection and humanity to asylum seekers seeking our protection. It is a mean-spirited, poll driven government that lacks moral integrity and the backbone to be independent and stand up for Australia. It is a government that kowtows to Indonesia rather than approaching Indonesia as an equal partner and negotiating so that both nations are held in respect. The government's latest initiative to holding people in detention when they enter Australia reverts back to the treatment of the first European Australians.",56
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 12.30 pm, in accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier this day, the debate is interrupted and I call the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.",60
27,Mr ROBB,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Goldstein-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (12.30 pm)-in reply-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay. I acknowledge your status as, I believe, the only MP to come to Australia as a refugee, back in 1949. I thank members for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006. For 60 years Australia's proud migration and refugee settlement record has been built on three crucial foundations: a firmly regulated and planned immigration program, an effective border control system and programs to effectively integrate migrants into our community. This bill is necessary to maintain the strength of our border control measures. It is necessary to maintain the integrity and honour associated with our nation's long standing success in integrating people from the four corners of the globe. It is necessary to prevent Australia from being used as a staging post for political protests. In other words, this bill will act to protect Australia's eignty, not diminish it. In contrast to the weakness and the opportunism of the Labor position, this bill will strengthen our border controls, not weaken them. This bill is also about consistency between those who arrive by boat at an excised offshore area and the mainland. It removes the distinction based on where a person lands and ensures all unauthorised sea arrivals have their asylum claims processed offshore. While removing the incentive to reach mainland Australia, we have also significantly enhanced arrangements for processing asylum claims in a humane and compassionate way, and we have preserved Australia's very strong commitment to its protection obligations under the refugees convention and other relevant human rights instruments. This bill is also about ensuring that Australia's limited capacity to provide places for refugees is filled by those most in need. Every year Australia welcomes thousands of refugees from camps in some of the most desperate parts of the world, many of whom have been waiting many years for resettlement and none of whom would have any chance of reaching Australia as unauthorised boat arrivals. In 2004 Australia ranked second in the world for numbers of refugees resettled, with 14,122 visas granted, and that is not a new trend. Historically Australia has ranked third, behind the US and Canada, in terms of humanitarian intake-a very proud record over 55 years. Importantly, this bill protects our ability to maximise our intake of these refugees, whom we as an independent nation choose to resettle and who enter our country lawfully. In 2001 this government made a promise to the Australian people that we would take all reasonable steps to ensure that unauthorised boats did not arrive, did not land on our sovershores. The measures we took in 2001 to excise certain islands-measures supported by the opposition-discouraged people from getting into boats and embarking on highly dangerous journeys. As a consequence, we have avoided loss of life and we have avoided unauthorised boat arrivals until recently. Those excision measures, together with other steps taken by the government, worked and have been very effective. The 2001 measures discouraged people smugglers from manipulating our migration entry arrangements. At the time, the government's response asserted Australia's sovereignty to be able to deal with those issues. It is not a dereliction of Australia's sovereignty to prevent people from manipulating our migration entry arrangements. In fact, it is an act of asserting Australia's sovereignty. The suggestion has been made that these changes before the House are at the behest of Indonesia. Let me make it very clear: Indonesia does not determine our policies. The Australian government determines our policies, which are in the best interests of the Australian people. Part of the design of this legislation is to ensure our system cannot be manipulated by those seeking to use our system for political advantage. It is quite clear that some people in West Papua and Australia decided that asylum seekers would make the hazardous canoe journey to Australia rather than walk to Papua New Guinea, as they had in the past, with the deliberate intention of fostering tensions between Australia and Indonesia. The government has decided to have such future claims processed offshore rather than give these people the opportunity to manipulate our migration entry arrangements to create a staging post for political protest. The changes allow genuine refugee claims to be determined and dealt with without the risk that our system will be used to suit the politiing cal purposes of others. Surely, in not leaving our system open to be used in this manner, as the Labor Party would have it, we are very clearly asserting our sovereignty and, in the process, we are maintaining the strength and integrity of our migration and refugee settlement program. The refugees convention does not prescribe how states must give effect to their international obligations. The convention allows a host country to restrict the movements of a refugee who is unlawfully within the country until the person's immigration status is regularised or they are admitted into some other country. The new arrangements contained in this bill draw on this flexibility. They ensure that all people continue to have access to a reliable refugee assessment process. Refugees will also be protected from involuntary return to their homeland if they are found to be refugees. Designated unauthorised arrivals will only be taken offshore for processing of their asylum claims to a declared country, and a country may only be declared by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs if it meets significant protection and human rights standards. Unauthorised arrivals taken to Nauru, a declared country, will be processed by officers of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Applicants will be able to seek a merits review of their refugee status determination in line with the non-binding international guidance on standards for refugee status determination procedures. Historically, figures for processing in offshore processing centres have compared favourably with onshore figures in terms of positive determinations. The overall refugee approval rate for people in offshore processcentres who chose not to voluntarily return to their homeland was 94 per cent. This compares favourably with the 89 per cent approval rate under Australia's onshore protection visa process for unauthorised arrivals who applied for protection visas between mid-1999 and mid-2005. This bill includes mechanisms for scrutiny. There is a requirement that the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs report to the minister on arrangements for designated unauthorised arrivals who make asylum claims. These arrangements relate to accommodation, health-including mental health-education and processing of their asylum claims. The secretary must provide details of the number of asylum claims processed and the numbers granted refugee status in the financial year. The minister is required to table this report in both houses of parliament within 15 sitting days. Other checks and balances to ensure the integrity of the arrangements and the fair treatment of asylum seekers include: merits reviews; independent legal advice to claimants; 90 days for the initial refugee status decision; an independent review within 90 days of that decision; ministerial powers to intervene and grant a visa; Ombudsman's powers to investigate actions and report to parliament; an independent review of the legislation in two years time; a five-year set clause in the provisions which extend the offshore processing regime to all sea arrivals, including those to the mainland; and women and children not to be detained-they will be housed in residential style community accommodation. So, far from being regressive, this bill in fact essentially implements the changes that were seen last year as progressive for onshore processing. It would in fact implement a system far better and fairer than that experienced by thousands of asylum seekers around the world. Our opponents have sought to bring down this bill. They have tried to suggest it will weaken Australia's sovereignty. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill is about protecting Australia's sovereignty. It is about deciding who can come here. It is about giving thousands of people waiting in refugee camps around the world their chance to come to Australia, not leaving them waiting in the queue while others who come here illegally take their places in our humanitarian program. It was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, who said in this parliament nearly five years ago: It is in the national interest of all Australians to have our borders effectively protected. It is in the national interest of all Australians that our generous attitude towards refugees is not undermined by people who seek to flout that generosity by placing themselves ahead of others in the queue who are determined by an orderly process to be more deserving. It is sad that weak political opportunism fogs the memory of the member for Brand in 2006. This bill marks an important strengthening of Australia's border control measures by providing a single and consistent set of rules to apply to unauthorised boat arrivals who sun- unlawfully enter our migration zonewhether that be around islands, such as Christmas Island or Cocos, or the mainland. It is wrong, or disingenuous, to assert, as Labor does, that the migration zone has been changed in any way through this legislation. It has not. The bill merely defines what rules will apply if you unlawfully enter the migration zone by sea. It is the sovereign government that determines those rules. We have never abandoned sovereignty. We are making the decisions about who comes here. We are maintaining control of our borders while preserving our very strong commitment to protection obligations under the refugees convention. As a country, we are strong and fair on these matters and generous to a fault. I commend the bill to the House and table the supplementary explanatory memorandum. Question put: That this bill be now read a second time. The House divided. [12.46 pm] (The Deputy Speaker-Hon. AM lyay) Ayes………… Noes………… Majority……… NA Abbott, A.J. Anderson, J.D. Andrews, K.J.

NA REPEAL BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 March, on motion by Mr Ian Macfarlane: That this bill be now read a second time.",63
29,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"As I rise today to speak on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2000, I think we all appreciate that Australians are more concerned than ever about record high petrol prices. Reform of the petrol retail industry, including the repeal of the two acts dealt with in this bill, has never been more important. The Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 are outdated. They serve no useful purpose in today's petrol retail industry, and I will tell the House why. Well over 50 per cent of the industry by volume of sales is not covered by these acts, including the supermarket chains Coles and Woolworths, and the rules for market participants are inconsistent and unfair. That is bad for industry and, perhaps far more importantly, that is bad for the Australian consumers, who are doing it tough at this point. The Oilcode, which will be introduced as a mandatory industry code under section 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974, will finally and appropriately bring the whole industry into a common regulatory regime, with better protections for market participants and better protections for consumers. The Oilcode will improve the protections available to commissioned agents and independent operators, who currently do not have the protections available to franchisees. Both franchisees and commissioned agents will also appropriately have access to a low-cost dispute resolution scheme for the first time. The Labor Party's view is that section 46 amendments to the Trade Practices Act are necessary to address outstanding concerns about the potential for abuse of market power. I call on the government to bring these forward as a matter of urgency. In that context, I also indicate to the House that we are taking the government on trust with respect to these very central and important amendments. I expect the minister to confirm in his reply undertakings given to the opposition that the government is keen to introduce legislation, the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006, to implement its response as soon as the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005, the Dawson bill, has passed through the parliament. In essence, we have shaken hands on the importance of this amendment. It is therefore very important that the minister, in replying to the debate, confirms on the public record his undertaking given to the opposition with respect to the importance of those amendments and their urgency. Nevertheless, the introduction of the Oilcode to cover the entire petrol retail sector an improvement over the existing situation, where more than 50 per cent of the industry by volume is not regulated at all. Petrol retail reform is a good step forward to give consumers more confidence that the petrol prices they are paying are as fair and as competitive as we can make them. But reform, we also accept, has been a long time coming. Interestingly, petrol reform has been on the Howard government's policy agenda since 1996. In 1998, the opposition appropriately said that it would support petrol reform as long as the Oilcode was agreed to. But it has taken this government another eight years to get to that point. As in many other policy areas, reform under the HowardCostello government has stagnated over 10 long years. The Australian government, led by the Prime Minister, John Howard, simply cannot keep up with the changes that are necessary to encourage investment and maintain competitive markets and affordable prices in petrol, electricity, transport and telecommunications. Look at the debacle, for example, that confronts the Australian community on the issue of broadband this very day. The Howard-Costello government has also failed completely to keep the reform momentum of the Hawke and Keating governments going. That was when tough decisions about reform in the Australian economy and opening it up to competitive pressures were actually put in place-the foundations of economic growth that we now experience. But we are starting to pay the price. We are paying the price for neglect-if anything, absolute negligence by the Howard government-on the need for ongoing reforms so as to keep Australia competitive. I refer to labour shortages, erosion of our skills base, choked infrastructure which is is holding back exports, inflation pressures, productivity stagnation and higher interest rates. It is most worrying of all that the HowardCostello government's answer to everything as we appreciate it-as is reflected in the recent budget-is simply ‘spend, spend, spend'. Unfortunately, all the indicators now show that that short-term approach to economic management has hit a brick wall. The budget is no longer sustainable. If anything, the chickens are coming home to roost. What are the indicators? Let us deal with a couple of those indicators. Interest rates are rising and the government seeks to deny that they have an impact not only on business in Australia but also on ordinary households trying to make ends meet from week to week and day to day and pay their mortgage payments. The high level of debt held by Australians continues to rise disproportionately to the increase in their incomes and cost of living in Australia. Then we go to the issue of prices, which is central to this debate. Prices are going through the roof. Wages-that is an interesting debate. The government are in so much trouble handling the industrial relations debate today that they now have a junior minister, the member for North Sydney, Mr Hockey, to try to assist the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to sell their message. That is interesting because the truth is that they know it is very hard to sell. I will tell you why it is very hard to sell. Wages for those already struggling are under pressure because of the government's extreme industrial relations changes, which not only open these wages and conditions to attack but also create a major sense of uncertainty in their minds, in their household's minds, in their families and in Australia at large. Then we go to the issue of tax cuts. We heard the Prime Minister and the Treasurer waxing lyrical about the impact that the tax cuts were going to have, only a matter of months ago on the second Tuesday of May. The facts show that they have been swallowed up because of mismanagement by the Howard government on a broad range of other fronts. We have the issue of competitiveness and our capacity to survive in a tough global market. Foreign debt is through the roof. All these indicators suggest that unfortunately the Howard government approach of buying or spending their way out of trouble is no longer appropriate. Tough decisions and leadership are required. Let us go to the issue of the petrol debate. Back in 2001, when they were having difficulties, they decided to cut petrol excise. They have used tax cuts, family payments, baby bonuses and any number of handouts to buy off the electorate, but eventually, as we all appreciate, the patience of the Australian community runs out just as the government coffers are starting to run dry. They have no options left on petrol prices. One of the reasons is that petrol reform has taken 10 long years. Excise cuts are no longer an option because we simply cannot afford them. This government has still done nothing to address the real issue. The real issue is Australia's security. This is the guts of the debate that Australia has to have in the lead-up to the next election, because if we do not get this debate right we not only worsen the potential situation confronting Australian consumers but also put at risk Australia's economic future. The principal reason is that the Prime Minister has sat in the oval office and accepted that basically we should place our future, in terms of where we go on resource security and the energy debate on transport fuels, on foreign oil from-guess whereunstable parts of the world like the Middle East. What a gamble. It is not a gamble that the Labor Party is prepared to take. I say that because it is obvious to everyone except the government that, if you do not have home-grown fuel industries, Australia is at risk. We will always be hostage to foreign oil. We will always be hostage to unstable areas such as the Middle East. These are very serious issues that Australian consumers understand and appreciate. They are very serious issues that Australian industries speak to me about regularly in terms of my portfolio responsibility as the shadow minister for resources-a portfolio that includes energy, forestry and tourism. This is about what is going to rule the future and our capacity to have energy to drive the Australian economy. I think we have to accept that there is no longer a capacity for short-term fixes. We need a national transport fuel policy that guarantees supplies for the long term and gives Australia options to deal with global fuel supply and price emergencies. That is the debate in Europe; that is the debate in North America; that is the debate in Asia; but unfortunately it is not the debate that the Prime Minister wants in Australia, because it requires tough decisions and leadership. I believe that we can no longer ignore that debate because, if other countries accept that this is the new Cold War and that the new cause of tension in the international community is who supplies the energy, then it is also part of what we have to face up to in guaranteeing our future as a nation. I will tell you why. It is pretty simple. It is about supply and demand. Who supplies the energy and who has influence over the energy supply of the world has economic power in the world. We want the Australian economy to go at full bore. We want to guarantee the creation of further training and apprenticeship opportunities for the Australian community. That requires a few tough decisions. We have to lift our productivity and we have to try to make it easier for Australian workers to survive from week to week and day to day with all the added cost pressures that are imposed on them because of neglect and negligence by the Howard government. That simple debate goes like this: when supplies are short or demand is high-or both, as is the case right now-guess what? Prices go up. Prices are going up at the moment. As you as a former teacher know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, it is simply economics 101. Unfortunately the Treasurer does not understand it and nor does the Prime Minister. They are not really interested in economic reform in Australia; they are merely interested in political survival: who occupies Kirribilli House or who might occupy Kirribilli House in the future. That is what occupies the minds of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer from sun-up to sundown each day-not where Australia goes but who occupies the Lodge and Kirribilli House and who might occupy the Lodge and Kirribilli House in the future. We can no longer accept the contempt shown by the Australian government for these hard issues that have to be fronted up to now. The solution has to be embraced by the Australian community, with leadership from government in partnership with the private sector. The solution is home-grown fuel industries in Australia. That requires that we accept that there are policy options available to ensure that the wheels continue to turn for Australian consumers and Australian industries, to ensure that Australians can afford fuel and to ensure that Australian industry can afford energy. That drives job growth, apprenticeships and higher education opportunities. In doing so, it creates the social dividend which enables us to have a decent healthcare system and to look after the elderly in their aged years, and it also gives us the capacity to create opportunities for families experiencing stress at the moment, to manage the family difficulties of child care. So I would have thought the debate is pretty simple. It goes from A to B and C: make the hard decisions, embrace the policy options and get on with implementation. But unfortunately this is where the Howard government is remiss. Federal Labor, alternatively, has always supported the oil and gas and alternative fuel industries. Let us deal with a few facts of modern history in Australia, because these industries are strategically important to Australia, strategically important to the region in July 2011. which we live and strategically important to the world. I remind the House that Labor supported the proposal to extend the effective excise-free period for biofuels and LPG by three years to 2011. It supported legislation to introduce mandatory cleaner fuel standards that should benefit environmentally friendly fuels. So it is not about having economic growth without paying attention to environmental considerations; it is about doing both. However, while Labor supported this approach, the House should be reminded that the overwhelming reason was-and this has always been the key to running a business in Australia-to provide some level of certainty for the alternative fuels industry and for the refining industry. It was the Keating government which introduced an 18c a litre production bounty for ethanol in the 1993-94 budget and, in addition, the zero excise rating for the product. Perhaps the member for Blair ought to pay a little bit of attention to the history of why ethanol has gone backwards while the Howard government has been on watch. The record shows that the Howard government abolished the bounty scheme one year early, in the 1996-97 budget. It has consistently undermined the industry by changing the playing field on a regular basis over the last nine years. In the last parliament alone, the Howard government changed its mind not once, not twice but on three occasions with respect to the excise regime, not only for ethanol but also for the LPG industry. Despite his May 2002 view that applying an excise to ethanol and LPG was a bad idea, the Treasurer announced in the 2003 budget that he would do just that. He announced that biofuels and LPG would be subject to an excise from July 2008. In December 2003, guess what? He changed his mind again, announcing a new excise regime to apply from For those reasons, we will be moving today a detailed second reading amendment which stands in my name, to be seconded by the member for Hunter, Mr Fitzgibbon. This goes to the future of the ethanol industry. I challenge the member for Blair, who likes to interject, to have the guts to cross the floor like other members of the government if he wants to stand up for his local community and to vote for this second reading amendment, because it is about guaranteeing the future of ethanol and biofuels in Australia. I will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker: I have no doubt that he will dog it. He will go missing in action when it comes to putting up his hand. He has form on that front. These are important issues, because, between May and December 2003, the LPG industry was in turmoil. Many of the small business operators involved in LPG conversion and maintenance suffered from serious business downturns due to the uncertainty about the excise regime. Similarly, the biofuels industry suffered during this period because there was simply no certainty for investors in the industry. It has taken time for the industry to recover. That is mainly because record high prices have meant that consumers are more willing to set aside their concerns about fuel uncertainty than they would otherwise have been and that biofuels are now more price sensitive and attractive to refiners and marketers. In fact, let me say at this point that Caltex is to be commended for its announcement today that it will discount E10 petrol by 3c per litre. We await the other refiners. The history of the Howard government's double backflips on alternative fuels is in stark contrast to the stability Labor provided through its 13 years in office when it maintained the LPG excise exemption introduced in 1979 for fuel security reasons. The other stark contrastMr Cameron Thompson-You're a comedian!",69
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,The member for Blair will get his go.,74
31,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"is just how interested in fuel security the Prime Minister was, back then in 1979, compared with his complete lack of interest today as Prime Minister, when fuel security has never been so important and petrol prices have never been so high. As I have said before, this government treats tax cuts as go-away money for motorists worried about petrol prices. I therefore remind the House of some facts I have raised many times in this place. The fact is that, without developing large scale alternative fuels industries in Australia, we will increasingly be hostage to supplies from the Middle East, West Africa and Russia. This is the debate about security. I need to spell out the implications of that fact for energy security and for the security of Australia's economic future. Australians around the kitchen table each night want to know that their governments and the companies with stewardship of their resources have a plan to secure their energy supplies for the future at prices affordable to Australians. I raise this because it is important. At the moment there is no plan. Unlike Uncle Arthur would have them believe, they should be relaxed and comfortable. Have we heard the Prime Minister talking about being relaxed and comfortable? They are not relaxed and comfortable about our energy future. Creating the right fiscal and regulatory regime to convert our natural gas and coal to clean diesel as a new industry option and a new fuel supply source for Australia is unfortunately not on the Howard government's radar. Mr Howard was thinking about it, interestingly, in 1979, but it is not on his radar in 2006 when he is the Prime Minister and it is more important. Unlike with other alternative fuels, the Prime Minister has done nothing to provide any industry framework to encourage the establishment of industries in Australia to convert our vast local coal and gas resources to clean diesel. This is the future debate. This is the key to transport security in terms of energy in the future. Alternatively, the Labor Party has always been a great supporter of both gas to liquids and coal to liquids, which is integral to the commercialisation of clean coal technology for power generation in Australia and which is part of the environmental debate. We actually achieve on both fronts-energy security and environmental progress. I recall that a former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, as resources minister, was a great advocate of gasand coal-to-liquids technologies. That was more than 20 years ago. This is a debate that has been ongoing. It is about time the do not Howard government actually got serious about it. My colleague the member for Hunter was also a great advocate when he was shadow minister for resources in the last parliament-and we continue this tradition because we believe that establishing new nation-building industries is not easy and requires, more than anything, sustained leadership and focus at a national level. For that reason, over the last couple of weeks I have had the pleasure of dealing with two innovative proposals in the private sector, both looking at coal gasification and conversion to diesel, one in Queensland and the other in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria. Unfortunately, the Howard government has waxed and waned on both coal to liquids and gas to liquids. It should pick up the challenge and run with it. Once again, let me remind the House that it is now almost five years since Senator Minchin, then minister for resources, appointed a GTL task force to investigate the feasibility and benefits of establishing a GTL industry in Australia. Five years later, no action has been taken. I suppose that is why the member for Hunter once said that in John Howard's mind it is easier to get gas to Shanghai than to Sydney. That says it all: export it; do not worry about our own local economy. John Howard is happy to dig it up, ship it out and look after Japan, China and the United States. He guarantees their resource and energy security, but when it comes to Australia he has no plan for our energy security and our economic future. I simply say to the Prime Minister that he needs an industry policy, a resources policy and an energy policy. We can no longer wait. Those policies will have to give us large scale options to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. This is pretty interesting. I think what Australians actually believe. We cannot rely on foreign oil if the Strait of Hormuz is closed, if the Alaskan pipeline has to be fully shut down, if war escalates in the Middle East or if civil unrest shuts down West African production. GTL is the best option. It is about time the Prime Minister took up the challenge laid down by the Leader of the Opposition in October last year about the importance and urgency of this debate. The Prime Minister's own GTL task force noted that, while Australia could simply wait for the market to provide an incentive for a GTL industry, once gas supply infrastructure is in place and investment is sunk in other countries-not in Australia-where taxation and infrastructure incentives are on offer today, those countries will serve as investment hubs for expansion for years to come. Unfortunately, that is what is happening in Qatar at the moment while the Prime Minister is asleep on his watch. The implication from the task force's review was that Australia's remote gas fields could be left stranded from markets for even longer because, by and large, it will be cheaper to expand existing projects than to build new ones here. It is about economies of scale. I am sure this is a concept Australia's LNG industry fully understands. The task force also highlighted the potential significance of a GTL industry to Australia's economy, saying that it could underwrite offshore gas supply infrastructure to bring forward the possibility of further major new domestic gas pipelines to connect the national market, increase domestic gas competition and energise gas exploration. That is an interesting challenge, one the Labor Party would love to have the opportunity to implement. That is why it is going to be an ongoing debate between now and the next elecit is tion. This debate can no longer be put off. The task force also said, and this is the crux of the debate: These benefits would be of national strategic significance to Australia. It went on to say this, and perhaps the Prime Minister should revisit the report: The cost of any government intervention must be considered against the potential benefits. That is simply saying that if you invest now you get the return in the future in terms of competitive energy supply in Australia, which is the key to our future. That is what attracts investment to Australia-a stable economy, stable government and energy at a reasonable price and with security of supply. The potential benefits go beyond unlocking new resources. They go beyond wealth and creating new industry, more jobs and more exports. They include the opportunity for Australia to address our most pressing problem, our future transport fuel security challenge. It is also three years since CSIRO's report Energy and Transport Sector Outlook to 2020 laid out its proposed strategy for Australia's transport future-a strategy that identified gas to liquids and coal to liquids as keys to our future transport fuel security. The tragedy is that we all appreciate the potential but the reality remains just beyond the Howard government's grasp. It requires sustained and committed national leadership. It requires that we review the PRRT regime and consider special treatment of capital investment in gas to liquids fuel projects and associated gas production infrastructure. It requires that we have some responsibility for resource related infrastructure instead of simply saying that it is a state responsibility. Above all, it requires that the Howard government should send a clear signal to Australians that it is interested in their future fuel House: supply security. We should send that clear signal. So on that basis, in order to bring this debate to a head, I will have pleasure in moving the second reading amendment circulated in my name calling on the government to immediately conduct a feasibility study into a gas-to-liquids plant in Australia. The Prime Minister needs to dust off his 2001 report, bring it up to date, move on the implementation and make it a reality. I also call on the government to review, in 2009, the proposal to introduce excise on ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG in 2011 and to consider whether or not there is a case for deferring the introduction of excise depending on industry progress. I think this is a matter of such public importance that the department should report to parliament, in the period commencing next year, on the measures taken and the progress made to wean Australia off foreign oil dependence. Such a review would keep the pressure on parliament and decision makers. It would be on the uptake of alternative fuels. We have got to be serious about the implementation, given the issues raised in the opposition's blueprint. I simply say in conclusion, before moving the second reading amendment, that the govthe ernment ought to be criticised for its tardiness in moving on petrol retail reform, for bypassing the parliamentary process in taking companies out of the sites act, for failing to announce amendments to the Trade Practices Act to implement the 2003 Dawson and 2004 Senate committee reports and, above all-and this is the crux of the debate-for failing abjectly to take action to reduce Australia's dependence on foreign oil. I now move the second reading amendment standing in my name: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the (1) calls on the Government to require the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to report to the Parliament annually, commencing in August 2007, on the measures taken and the progress made to: (a) increase market penetration of ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG, including the number and location of service stations and the names of the companies offering these products on their retail sites; (b) secure new investment in biofuel, LPG and CNG production and supply infrastructure in Australia; and (c) secure investment in new alternative transport fuel industries in Australia, including gas and coal to liquids; (2) calls on the Government to review, in 2009, the proposal to introduce excise on ethanol and biodiesel, LPG and CNG in 2011, and consider whether or not there is a case for delaying the introduction of excise, depending on the progress made: (a) in increasing market penetration of biofuels, LPG and CNG; (b) in securing new investment in biofuel, LPG and CNG production and supply infrastructure in Australia; and (c) towards achieving the 350 million litre biofuels target in 2010. (3) criticises the Government for: (a) its tardiness in moving on petrol retail reform; (b) bypassing due parliamentary process in introducing a regulation to “undeclare” companies under the Sites Act; (c) failing to introduce amendments to the TPA to implement the 2003 Dawson and 2004 Senate recommendations for reform; and (d) failing to act to reduce Australia's dependence on foreign oil and improve its transport fuel security; (4) calls on the Government to immediately conduct a feasibility study into a gas to liquids fuels plant in Australia, including: (a) consideration of Petroleum Resources Rent tax incentives for developers of gas fields which provide resources for gas to liquid fuels projects; (b) examining a new infrastructure investment allowance for investment in Australian gas to liquids infrastructure; and (c) developing a targeted funding scheme for research and development in this area; (5) calls on the Government to immediately embrace Labor's Fuels Blueprint proposal to: (a) make alternative fuel vehicles tariff free, cutting up to $2000 off the price of current hybrid cars; and (b) grant tax rebates for converting petrol cars to LPG; and (6) calls on the Government to immediately embrace Labor's Fuels Blueprint to find more oil and use more gas by; (a) re-examining the depreciation regime for gas production infrastructure; (b) allowing the selective use of flowthrough share schemes for smaller operators”.

32,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,Is the motion seconded? Mr Fitzgibbon-I second the motion.,77
33,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"After all that hot air from the member opposite, it is great to be able to stand up and create some of my own. Fuel is causing a lot of drama for Australians. We have got a situation of continually rising prices causing real pain, and that is even in the state of Queensland, where, as you would probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is not a petrol franchise fee. That fee does not apply in Queensland; it never has. All the other states of Australia had a petrol franchise fee, which was rolled into the GST. So we in Queensland are privileged because the price of our fuel is still, on average, about nine cents a litre cheaper than in all the other states. So while we in Queensland feel the pain, it is hard to imagine how people are putting up with the incredible prices that they are paying in the southern states and elsewhere in Australia. It is a pleasure to speak on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 because there is no doubt that we have come a long way down the road since 1980, when the previous bills were created. We have come a long way to where we are today. So much has gone on and there have been so many changes, particularly in the automotive industry and fuel retailing, that it is hard to see how those bills could possibly still be regarded as effective in today's environment. The world has moved on and Australia has changed dramatically, and that is reflected in the government's treatment within this bill of this area, with the introduction of the new Oilcode and the removal of quotas on the oil majors as to the number of sites that they can own. You would have to be Rip Van Winkle not to notice that today in Australia shopper dockets are playing a really big part in our process of buying fuel. People are religiously collecting shopper dockets to get what they regard as bargains as they try to minimise their fuel costs. The shadow minister said that we needed to look very strongly at alternative fuels he was roasting the government, saying the government needed to act. That was an amazing set of words to be coming from the member of an opposition that killed off ethanol quite some time ago with a whole lot of spurious nonsense about the dangers that it supposedly posed to motor vehicles. They concocted a bodgie case on that. I remember that a couple of their members were fingered in the process of doing it. They put about false claims about ethanol and its dangers and, as a consequence of that, across my electorate I still come across fuel pumps that country. have these hideous little stickers on them saying, ‘Does not contain any ethanol,' as if that is a bad thing. Ethanol actually boosts the octane content of petrol. It is a welcome addition to any fuel. I feel very strongly about this, because we could produce it so readily in Australia. Shame on the Labor Party for killing it off, given that it could have been introduced so much more effectively several years ago. Shame on them for going about Australia and telling a whole lot of untruths about the impact of ethanol on people's motor vehicles and for continuing to maintain that for such ridiculous period of time. They fallaciously linked it to the Manildra group and to all kinds of claims that they regarded as being politically advantageous to them to make. The result of their pursuing political ends that the national interest has been badly set aside. We have not made progress down the road to ethanol-there has not been an uptake of ethanol-because Labor Party members have been telling everyone that they meet in the street that ethanol is no good. They have been doing that again and again, but today the shadow spokesman is trying to perform a backflip and trying to get those words out of his mouth about ethanol being good. It must be hard for him to do that, but at last Labor are starting to get with the and strength and the reality of what is going on all over the world. Ethanol is a great alternative, particularly for a country like ours which produces heaps of sugar cane. A lot of people simplistically say, ‘Oh, sugar cane is what you get your ethanol from,' but there are plenty of other ways to get ethanol. We have lots of low grade sorghum produced in this country that could go into ethanol. There are all kinds of other grain crops and opportunities. We have got so much land and the capacity to generate sources of ethanol; it is there all over the What we need to do is to look at mandating that ethanol and saying, ‘Let's have 10 per cent of it in our fuel.' It certainly will not harm anything at 10 per cent. I think we could even have 20 per cent. That is certainly being done in the US. I think in the US now they are running something like 85 per cent ethanol in some cars. That brings me to the situation in Brazil. In that country they are using flex-fuel cars and they are making big savings because of the use of ethanol in their fuel. That use of ethanol is something that I think needs to be carefully examined by Ausa tralians, and I think we need to pursue it. I would like to quote a couple of articles about the way things are going in Brazil. The first one comes from the Guardian from 23 November 2005. It traces the history of what is has happened with ethanol in Brazil. The article was entitled ‘Sugar powers a revolution on Brazil's roads'. It says: In the 80s the then military government reacted to the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1981 by offering tax advantages to run cars on ethanol - so much so that between 1983 and 1988 up to 90% of vehicles were powered by the fuel. It goes on to make an interesting point. It says: The bottom fell out of the market when oil prices collapsed - and sugar cane producers jacked up ethanol prices more than 40%. The difference now is that drivers have a much greater choice, being able to mix ethanol and petrol at will in “flex fuel” engines that Volkswagen introduced in 2003 and are being built by rivals such as Peugeot, which launches a 1.4-litre version next month ... And it goes on to mention other producers. So fluctuations in the price of sugar and oil have meant in the past that, for example, overnight, sugar producers suddenly do not want to sell you their ethanol. When flex-fuel is the way to go, when that provides the motive power, there is no reason why those kinds of market forces will impede in any way the growth of an ethanol industry in Brazil-and there is certainly no way that it will impede the growth of an ethanol industry in Australia. The article quotes Serge Habib, Citroen's managing director in Brazil, as saying that in Brazil as many as 80 per cent of new Brazilian built cars are powered by flex-fuel engines. I heard a member of this parliament saying the other day that Holden is producing flex-fuel engines in Australia-or certainly one of the Australian producers is producing them here and exporting them to Brazil. So we have a ready-made source of flexfuel cars already here in our country. We can buy locally in terms of the fuel and we can buy locally in terms of the vehicles. According to this article, Mr Habib, from Citroen, said that producing ethanol from sugar is profitable as long as oil costs more than $37 a barrel. It sounds to me like we will be producing ethanol profitably till hell freezes over, the way things are currently. That price of $37 a barrel is a price that we are probably not likely to revisit in the near future. I think we can look at this opportunity to switch to ethanol. The article makes another point about what has happened in Brazil-and I am looking at the way this impacts on our fuel industry in Australia. It quotes Luiz Custodio Martins, president of a sugar and alcohol union in Brazil, who said: The Brazilian economy has saved $400bn in imports since the creation of the National Alcohol Program, and that's without mentioning interest ... So Brazil has made $400 billion in savings in terms of imports. We are a country that has a lot of imported fuel. The opportunity for import replacement with ethanol is a very good thing. We did not hear an awful lot on ethanol from the opposition. They still find it a dirty word. They still cannot bring themselves to recognise it as the most important option that faces us. I heard them talking about gasification-that is, turning gas to liquids-using coal to generate energy. Honestly, the member opposite quoted Paul Keating as having said that many years ago. I reckon they must have had that discussion in a telephone booth somewhere out the back of Winton, because it is not something that they have paraded down the street on. It is not something that they have brought on the cabaret for-they have not lit the lights; they have not put on their tights. They have not been out there saying anything about what to do with this gas to liquids option. It has hardly rated a mention anywhere within the Labor Party, and now we are in a position where, suddenly, it is apparently, according to them, an even greater option than the logical conclusion of a transition to ethanol. One of the major issues that we are all discussing at the moment is the price of fuel. It is affecting people's livelihoods and it is something that we have to address directly. This bill will modernise the legislation, remove irrelevant restrictions on the structure of the petroleum market and create a more transparent, competitive market that will be the best way to deliver cheaper fuel prices consumers. As I said earlier, there have been significant changes in the retailing of petrol in Australia since the acts repealed by this bill were introduced in 1980. The legislation has not been able to keep pace with these market structure changes. In Australia, the retail petroleum industry provides approximately 38,100 jobs and had a turnover of about $21.7 billion in 2004-05. There are about 6,500 service stations throughout our country. It is a major part of our economy. is also inseparable from the international economy. This bill repeals the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980. The Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act sets quotas on the oil majors-BP, Caltex, Mobil and Shell-restricting the number of sites that they can own, lease and operate either directly or on a commission agency basis. In fact, going back to 1980, there were nine majors regulated in this way. It just shows you that we have now slipped down to where there are basically four and, honestly, those are divesting themselves, in these arrangements with Woollies, Coles and Quix, of their sites. The whole thing becomes an irrelevance to the way fuel is actually being retailed in our country. The only major company now hindered by quotas as a result of those retailing activities is BP. It is at limit, with no room to compete with the other industry operators in terms of creating additional sites, because it is now the only one being limited by the sites act. Quotas are based on the volume of fuel each company has the capacity to produce in its own domestic refineries. The act was introduced at a time when there was a lot of fuel available. Independents would be able to acquire internationally sourced fuel while the refiners could sell on their own. The abundant supply meant a potential threat to the to independent operators' viability. Because the acts have not progressed alongside the petrol retailing sector changes in the last 26 years, an effect of the acts themselves has been to encourage trading in the industry outside the coverage of the act. The obvious example of that is major companies divesting their retail operations to the supermarket chains. They have taken a large chunk of operations. This has radically altered the structure and thus the competitiveness of the market. Because It of the trend, the competition that was meant to be fostered by the act has been split into those industry traders operating under the act's coverage and those operating outside. BP has not divested its operations and is therefore prevented by the act from increasing its number of sites. It cannot increase its competition with the supermarket traders, who are not limited by the acts. As a result, we have a two-tiered system that is, by its nature, discriminatory: applying one set of rules to one party while allowing the remainder to operate without those rules. The ability of the majors to compete with newer market entrants, such as the supermarkets, is limited. It has also resulted in advantage for small business franchisees over small business commission agents. Since 1980, fuel quality standards have also tightened in line with global environmental best practice. Global supply capacity its is stretched, with massively increased demand internationally, resulting from economic growth throughout Asia. The situation of 26 years ago, with abundant supply and lower demand, has been dramatically reversed. The acts no longer serve the industry or the public. This bill will create a fair and open competition between the oil majors, healthy independents and supermarkets. It also allows for what is sure to be major change in the industry in coming years as it finds alternative supply. As I said before, the obvious source to consider is ethanol. There are also the biodiesel opportunities. I do not mind the opposition talking about coal to liquids or gas to liquids. These are courses that, of course, we must pursue, but I think the one that is staring us right in the face is ethanol. We should be looking at a mandate for ethanol to drive it forward. If we look at that example from Brazil, we see quite clearly that in that coungate try it was necessary for the government to go so far as to provide special tax advantages to promote people running cars on ethanol. That is the kind of step we need to be looking at in this country. We have reached a point that, perhaps, Brazil did way back then. We have reached this point now, and we need to be looking to those positive measures to drive it forward. Mr Windsor-Hear, hear! Take the initiative.",77
34,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"I see the member for New England over there. He was the one I saw talking about E85 in the United States. That is an example of the flexfuel opportunities we certainly need to be taking up in this country. The bill is part of a government reform package: the downstream petroleum reform package. The aim of the package is to provide a more competitive retail fuel market. It has the potential to have a positive impact for consumers at the pump, and we can all hope for that but we must continue. We must find other ways to drive that forward, as I have mentioned. As a part of the package, the government will introduce a mandatory industry code for the oil industry called the Oilcode. The aim is to provide industry certainty and to make that regulatory environment uniform. This will encourage investment and employment in what is a major industry in this country, as well as achieve transparency and competition in petroleum pricing. The Oilcode will cover the relationships between suppliers and retailers. The terminal gate prices provisions in the code will improve the transparency in the industry and create an even and fair opportunity for operators. All customers, small businesses or supermarkets, franchises or commission, will have access to fuel at the published terminal price. Dispute resolution is also covered in the Oilcode to ensure the industry participants have access to ongoing cost-effective resolution without the need for involving the courts-and I say ‘Hear, hear!' to that. If we look at the quotas that are allowed, the quota allowed to BP is 87 and it has 87 current sites. Caltex's quota is 136, and it has 87 sites. Of course, it has also got its arrangements with Woolworths. Mobil's quota is 87; current sites, one. Quite obviously, that has been divested as well. Shell's quota is 114 and its number of current sites is 16. Quite obviously, the minister and the government have responded effectively to what is an emerging change in the industry. We have taken a major step in the way we control the operation of these retail sites, but we have got to go right down to the base of the industry and we have got to provide it with alternative solutions. The idea of import replacement using ethanol will be a bonus not only to our farming industries and not only to our motorists but to our current account as well. If we can reduce the amount of our reliance on imports of oil and replace it with ethanol, I think we will be moving in the right direction. Despite the shameful activities of the Labor Party in trying to kill off ethanol, it will survive. (Time expired)",81
35,Mr FITZGIBBON,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"Hunter) (1.52 pm)I will not even do justice to the member for Blair's weak and poorly researched speech, but I will congratulate him on speaking on a bill relating to petrol prices in this very when petrol prices are such an important issue and are so much at the forefront of the minds of all Australians. I do note, from having a look at the speakers list, that he was only member on that side game enough to do so, but I may return to that point. It is a pleasure to speak to the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 and to provide support to the amendments moved by the member for Batman and seconded by me. This is a very important piece of legislation and a piece of legislation that is long overdue. The regulatory regime which controls the petroleum retailing sector in Australia is now 26 years old. It was forged in an era when we had nine major oil companies, and of course now we have four. It was forged at that time because the then government was concerned about market concentration in the petroleum market. I repeat, then we had nine majors, now we have four. Some people might think we would be looking at actually strengthening the act rather than repealing it but, unfortunately, it is not that simple. This act is now antiquated. It really does not mean anything much because, over the years, the major oil companies have effectively been able to circumvent the act, particularly by way of creative multisite franchise arrangements. But, just as importantly, we now have operating in the market the partnership arrangements between Coles and Shell, and Caltex and Woolworths. Of course, the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act, which is designed to limit the number of service stations the oil companies can run directly, does not cover Coles or Woolworths. So we have a big problem. Labor supports the idea that we repeal the two acts-that is, the sites act and the franchise act, which supports it-to put in place a more modern and more effective regulatory week regime. This should have happened at least five years ago. Why did it not happen five years ago? Because of government incompetence and the government's failure to show the leadership and to secure amongst industry and consumer representatives a new regulatory structure that was acceptable to all involved. Those involved include those at the industry, refinery, wholesale, distribution and retail levels and those who represent consumers and who are naturally concerned about the impact and the efficiency of the regulatory regime and its ability to hold petrol prices as low as possible and to protect independent service stations as best as can be achieved. Competition is everything in keeping petrol prices down. We cannot sit back and allow a few major oil companies to drive any competition out of the market. In this country we need an independent sector, as we see in many American and European markets, which keeps the major oil companies and their partners, such as Coles and Woolworths, honest. It took a lot of work to get a regulatory regime, which of course keeps all those players happy. I am not suggesting the government is there yet, and I know there remains a lot of concern, particularly amongst organisations like the MTAA, representing independent service station operators, but I suspect the government has secured as close an agreement as it can achieve. But it should have happened five years ago. Certainly, it should have happened a long time before now. This bill is about consumers, it is about small business and it even goes to Australia's competitiveness, because fuel in Australia is an input to production in both the manufacturing sector and the services sector. It is also about international competitiveness and it is something we should have dealt with long before now. There is a caveat contained within the member for Batman's second reading amendment. The opposition has indicated its support for this bill on the basis of the government's belated promise that it will finally do something about the Trade Practices Act. I have talked about the importance of competition in keeping petrol prices down. We cannot have competition unless we have a strong Trade Practices Act. It is well known to all watchers of this industry that we have not had a strong Trade Practices Act for some time now. We have not had, in particular, a sufficiently strong section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, which of course contains the main provisions for protecting against misuse of market power, therefore protecting and enhancing competition. We say to the government: we intend to support the bill this time around, but we want to see the whites of their eyes, we want to see the detail of the amendments they intend to finally and belatedly move to the Trade Practices Act so we can be sure that this new regulatory regime, in partnership with those changes to the Trade Practices Act, is sufficient to protect consumers and Australian small business. Make no mistake about it: Australian families, Australian small business and indeed Australian business generally are hurting as a result of high fuel prices. Australian families are hurting to the tune of between $40 and $50 a week. Australian business are hurting to the extent that they are starting to question their viability. Yet, despite that, the Prime Minister and his Treasurer say there is absolutely nothing they can do about petrol prices. We on this side acknowledge that high petrol prices are driven largely by the high price of crude oil. We accept that. But, when crude oil is high, it is all the more urgent for governments to act in the short term, the medium term and the long term. The Prime Minister and his Treasurer can act today in a couple of ways. They can bring forward those amendments to the Trade Practices Act and the Treasurer can sign this letter, which I have with me today, which would refer to the ACCC the power it needs to properly investigate petrol prices in this country. So, Mr Prime Minister, while you and your Treasurer are present, I appeal to you on behalf of Australian families and Australian business to take that short-term action. But there is  also appeal to you and your Treasurer to embrace the Leader of the Opposition's fuels blueprint and start doing something about energy independence in this country, weaning ourselves off our dependence on Middle Eastern oil",81

Finally, will the Prime Minister support our position of strengthening the ACCC's powers to investigate petrol prices by removing the requirement that they cannot do so without the Treasurer's consent? Does the Prime Minister still maintain that nothing can be done about these crippling fuel prices?",85
41,Mr HOWARD,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I have very carefully studied the amendments that have been put forward by the opposition. I read them, in fact, before I came into the House. After very thoughtful consideration, the government has decided, at this time, not to accept them. Employment",85
42,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House the results of the July labour force survey?,85
43,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I can inform him that today's labour force survey showed that unemployment has fallen further from 30-year record lows. It has fallen from 4.9 per cent in June to 4.8 per cent in July, position that Australia has not been in for over 30 years. There was a solid rise in employment, with 50,700 new jobs in Julyalthough, as the ABS indicates, some of that could have been generated by the training of temporary staff for the August 2006 census. This is to be added to the increase in jobs in both June and May, meaning that, over the last year, 219,000 jobs have been created in Australia-and, under this government, 1.9 million new jobs have been created. In addition to that, the participation rate rose per cent in July, which is a new record high. Putting those things together, the participation rate is higher than it has ever been before, yet unemployment is now at a 30-year low. Can I also indicate to the House an interesting statistic. Since Work Choices was introduced in March, 159,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. The Labor Party predicted there would be mass sackings and that the world as we know it would end. Mr Beazley interjecting",86
44,Mr COSTELLO,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"‘What rubbish!' he says. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, some of us have a memory that lasts longer than 24 hours. We remember all of the doom and gloom which the Leader of the Opposition forecast in relation to Work Choices. He was wrong about that. There is no evidence whatsoever that Work Choices has led to doom or gloom-in fact, quite to the contrary. I should mention for the benefit of the member for Bass that unemployment in the seat of Bass was 11.1 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the relevant minister. It is now 5.4 per cent-double as good as it was under the Labor Partybecause of the economic reforms which this government has put in place. Workplace Relations",86

Is the Prime Minister aware that Tristar is refusing to guarantee that it will not use the Work Choices legislation to avoid these redunto 65 dancy provisions after 30 September? What does the Prime Minister say to the 60 remaining workers at Tristar, including Simon, who has 32 years of service and stands to have his redundancy of $160,000 reduced to just 12 weeks pay after 30 September?

49,Mr BARRESI,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister advise the House of the benefits of workplace reforms for Australian workers? Is the minister aware of any misleading claims about employment agreements offered to employees at Lufthansa?,87
50,Mr ANDREWS,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. the outset that in the 138 days since Work Choices has been in operation 159,000 jobs have been created in Australia. That is an average of more than 1,000 jobs per daysomething which the member for Deakin and I are very proud of. Despite this creation of jobs and a record low unemployment rate of 4.8 per cent, we continue to have a misleading and deceptive campaign by the ACTU and the ALP about Work Choices. The latest of these cases in which they have been caught red-handed with misleading information involved, as the member for Deakin asked me about, employees at Lufthansa. Sharan Burrow, the President of the ACTU-and I remind the House that Sharan Burrow was the woman who, at the outset of this misleading campaign, made the infamous comment that it would be desirable to have the grieving family of a dead or injured worker to help their campaign; that is what Ms Burrow said at the start of this campaign and that set the tone for everything that followed since in a misleading campaignsaid yesterday about this matter at Lufthansa that the employees were denied the right of union representation. She said, and I quote from the transcript of her interview, ‘And refused point-blank when they asked for the union to be involved.' This was what was peddled by the President of the ACTU yesterday, and it is simply plain wrong. The very respected legal firm Blake Dawson Waldron, one of the most respected legal firms in Australia, wrote to the Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate in relation to this matter. Mr Tanner interjecting",87

No employee has sought to appoint the ASUthe Australian Services Unionas a bargaining agent in relation to an AWA. No employee has complained to you that the operation of an AWA has adversely affected them. So much for the false information from the President of the ACTU that the unions were denied involvement. Indeed, Blakes go on to say: There is questionable legitimacy in a complaint which is divorced from the opinions of employees who have the opportunity of agreeing or not agreeing to the terms of the AWA. Mr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",87
53,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,The member for Gorton is warned!,87
54,Mr ANDREWS,MINISTER OTHER CHAMBER,"Mr Speaker, I table that letter from Blake Dawson Waldron. Beyond this, we have the hypocrisy of the ACTUhas Mr Combet in particular and the member for Perth and others from the Labor Party-on the matter of penalty rates, because the member for Perth was saying, ‘Isn't this a disaster that there is some trading of penalty rates going on in relation to this particular matter.' Trading of penalty rates is hardly new. Indeed, let me read you a quote: I've negotiated numerous agreements where we'd negotiate, say, an all-up payment, an all-up rate in lieu of, you know, penalty rates for working shiftwork or weekends. Who do you think might have said that? Who was it that negotiated these changes in penalty rates? None other than the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Greg Combet himself. So Mr Combet is on record as saying he has been personally involved in the negotiation in relation to penalty rates, and yet the member for Perth comes in here yesterday and says, ‘Isn't this a disaster that there was a negotiation of penalty rates.' What is most bizarre about this particular case and this allegation is that the Australian Labor Party, once the party of workers in Australia, is actually standing in the way of employees at this particular business achieving a 12 to 13 per cent increase in their wages. So we have got to the bizarre situation in the ACTU campaign that the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party, if they had their way, would actually deny workers a 12 to 13 per cent increase in their wages. Why is it that the Leader of the Opposition is so opposed to Australian workplace agreements? Why is it that he wants to rip them up when they can lead to desirable outcomes for workers, such as a 12 or 13 per cent increase in their wages? It can only be because of the vested interests of the union movement, who are ideologically opposed to Australian workplace agreements. I began this answer by recounting the fact that 159,000 jobs have been created in Australia in the last 138 days. There is no doubt about which parties represent the workers in this country. NA",87

64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Ballarat is warned!,89
65,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So what we have here is another indication from the member for Perth and the Australian Labor Party that individual Australian workers should not have the opportunity to make a choice for an industrial instrumentMs Plibersek interjecting,89
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sydney is warned!,89
67,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that will make them better off. As I said earlier, this is the bizarre and twisted situation which the Labor Party has got itself into: it wants to rip up an industrial instrument that enables tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australian workers to actually be better off and to make a choice for that. But on top of that, if there was something so bad about these particular provisions, I am trying to remember when I heard a complaint from the member for Perth about, for example, the CFMEU and Dunlop Bedding Victoria enterprise bargaining agreement 2005Mr Stephen Smith interjecting",89
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth has asked his question.,89
69,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"which contains similar provisions to those in the Lufthansa agreement. Did I hear anything? Did anybody hear anything from the member for Perth about an agreement negotiated by the CFMEU which contains like conditions? No, nothing whatsoever. This again exposes the total hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this subject. Solomon Islands",89
70,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on Australia's contribution to securing stability in the Solomon Islands?,89
71,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question and for his interest. I also add to your words, Mr Speaker, in welcoming the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs; I am delighted to have him in Canberra today. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, RAMSI, celebrated its third anniversary in July. I think it is fair to say that, with the strong participation of New Zealand and Pacific Island countries, it has done a great deal to help Solomon Islanders put their lives back together again after the ethnic conflict that essentially brought the country to a halt. There is no doubt that RAMSI enjoys very strong public support in the Solomon Islands; perhaps not all politicians support it or appreciate it but certainly the general public in the Solomon Islands are enormously supportive. The Solomon Islands government now, after the upheaval of a few months ago, appears to be stable, and our expectation is that that will continue. The recent Foreign Investment Act has made the Solomon Islands a more attractive destination for investment, with palm oil and goldmining well on the way to restarting, but there still is a very long way to go. For example, we have some concerns about a commission of inquiry into the April Honiara riots, to be led by Mr Marcus Einfeld QC. We are particularly concerned that some of the terms of reference could interfere with the independence of the Solomon Islands judiciary and may impact on current court proceedings in relation to the riots. For example, a review of the arrests, charges and detention of two MPs, Messrs Dausabea and Ne'e, relates directly to the independent decision of a magistrate of the Solomon Islands judiciary. I note that the Solomon Islands legal profession is also concerned about the terms of reference. The Attorney-General has challenged two of the terms of reference in the Solomon Islands High Court and one of the commissioners has resigned because of these concerns. I mention this simply to underline the fact that there is still a long way to go in the Solomon Islands. We should not just be complacent that RAMSI is there; the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police have done a wonderful job. The media have withdrawn from the Solomon Islands so we do not hear about it anymore, but we remain extremely focused on it and there are still some concerns about activities taking place in that country. Workplace Relations",89
72,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and follows on from his previous answer about the Lufthansa subsidiary Global's AWA and his reference to choice. Isn't it the case that the internal Global documents associated with the AWA and presented to Global employees make it crystal clear that the AWA is not subject to negotiation, that, if the AWA is not accepted, access to staff benefits will be lost-a matter which the Victorian Workplace Advocate identified as possible duress-and that Global has fewer than 100 employees and is exempt from any unfair dismissal remedy? Isn't it the case that, far from choice, this was a take it or leave it AWA-take the AWA or lose benefits, or lose your job because you have no unfair dismissal remedy?",90
73,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The short answer to the honourable member's question is no. What the honourable member for Perth is arguing is that there should be no choice between an AWA or a collective agreement. What this company has offered is a choice between an AWA or a collective agreement. Those workers who choose not to take the AWA remain on the collective agreement, and that was pointed out in advice from the company to the Victorian Workplace Advocate. The member for Perth knows that very well. Why is itMr Stephen Smith interjecting",90
74,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do not get too excited, Stephen. The reality is that the Labor Party do not like Australian workplace agreements because they give workers choice and they give them the opportunity to earn more money. Why is it that the once great party of the Australian worker is abandoning the worker today? Afghanistan",90
75,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister explain to the parliament how the deployment of troops to Afghanistan will enhance the security of Australia?,90
76,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Ryan for his question. He has a very strong commitment to the global war against terror. The Prime Minister yesterday, on behalf of the government, formally announced that Australia will send another 150 Australian troops to Afghanistan, bringing to 400 those who will be working with the Dutch, NATO and other forces in Afghanistan to assist the democratically elected Afghanistan government in dealing with significant political, economic, social and military challenges. It is important that, as Australians, we appreciate that our contribution to this is not just about supporting the Afghanistan government but also about upholding our responsibilities to be a part of the solution in relation to global terror. Australians, and many Australian families, have been touched, if not scarred, in this decade by two Bali bombings and by the bombing of our embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. And we have seen other evidence of terrorist activity in our region. There are a number of links between those who planned and committed these heinous crimes and Afghanistan. Samudra, who was sentenced to death for plotting the Bali bombing, testified during his trial that he fought in Afghanistan in the 1990s, alongside Osama bin Laden. He also testified that it was his duty as a true Muslim to wage jihad against the West. The International Crisis Group in our region is headed by Sidney Jones-the respected and pre-eminent expert in Indonesian terrorism. A 2003 document to the International Crisis Group on Jemaah Islamiah in South-East Asia documented the relationship between those who trained in Afghanistan and terrorist activity in our region. Zulkarnaen, for example, who trained in Afghanistan in 1985, was a senior military commander of JI. Muklas, who was sentenced to death for the Bali bombing, trained there in 1986. Hambali, who is JI's chief strategist and primary link between JI and alQaeda, also trained there in 1987. Dr Zachary Abuza, who is head of the Department of the Political Science and International Relations at Simmons College, in a paper that was published in 2002 looking at Hambali and the relationship between those who trained in Afghanistan and global terrorism, said: One cannot underestimate how important the Afghan connection is. It is, he says, the basis for the al-Qaeda network throughout the world. It is extremely important for us as Australians to appreciate, particularly when five per cent of the Australian population is overseas at any one time, too that the defence and security of our country, our people, our interests and our values is not just about our borders, nor indeed our region. It is about ensuring that we make a contribution, along with others, to demonstrate what the Australian newspaper describes as ‘moral musculature' in taking up the struggle against global terrorism. There is no greater source of it than Afghanistan. We have responsibilities in this area. We are very proud of the Australian Defence Force, what it is doing had and what it is about to do on our behalf and on behalf of the next generation. Interest Rates",90
77,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that the monthly mortgage payment on the average mortgage of $220,000 is $1,430. Prime Minister, is it the case that, if the average borrower in Australia today were paying a top interest rate of 21.39 per cent that prevailed under Treasurer John Howard, they would face monthly mortgage payments of $3,922-more than twice what they are paying today?",91
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think what the member for Lilley is saying, and I agree with him, is that, if you were paying higher interest rates now, you would be a lot worse off-that is true. The reality is that you are not paying higher interest rates now. That is why the community is so much better off. Mr Swan interjecting",91
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lilley has asked his question. Mr Swan interjecting,91
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lilley is warned! Infrastructure Investment,91
81,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the government's investment in infrastructure is helping our regional exporters, particularly in my electorate of Riverina? How does the Deputy Prime Minister respond to recent calls for that investment to be scrapped?",91
82,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. Of course the member for Riverina knows only too well that it is just as important that we continue to invest in critical infrastructure across regional Australia to support our exporters as it is to open up new opportunities in export markets for them, whether it be the wheat growers in her electorate of Riverina or the manufacturing exporters like CelairMalmet or Precision Parts that are doing very well. They are in regional Australia, and we support them. We support their efforts of competing across the world and providing jobs in those regions in the export industries. This year we have committed a significant amount of money to invest in infrastructure across Australia, particularly in regional AusAustralia tralia, through our AusLink program, in adding to the already successful AusLink program and in building it to a $15 billion investment in roads across Australia. But we have also announced a significant investment in communications infrastructure to underpin the need for modern communications across regional Australia as well as in the metropolitan areas. I instance the $3.1 billion nect Australia package that we announced. It had two components: the $1.1 billion investment for services such as Broadband Connect to help fill in those gaps, particularly across regional Australia; and the $2 billion perpetual Communications Fund, which is going to provide the safety net for regional Australia for years to come. Mr Beazley interjecting",92
83,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that in a minute. So, where the market fails to provide new technology, there is going to be a guaranteed source of revenue to provide that technology in regional Australia for industries like those in the member for Riverina's electorate. It is well known that the Leader of the Opposition has referred to these two lots of investment in infrastructure in regional Australia. Firstly, he referred to the Roads to Recovery program as a boondoggle. In this year's budget we have added another $307 million to local authorities through the Roads to Recovery program, and I bet that the local authorities in the member for Brand's electorate take the money and want to keep it. They would not want it taken back and they would not believe it is a boondoggle. The Leader of the Opposition described the Connect Australia package as a National Party slush fund. I wonder if the member for Capricornia thinks it is a National Party slush fund when it helps her constituents get better communication services. People in country do not believe, as the Leader of the Opposition does, that it is unnecessary and trivial. They do no believe that the Roads to Recovery program is a boondoggle. They believe that the Leader of the Opposition is unnecessary and trivial. NA",92
84,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery Conthis afternoon members of the National Parliamentary Committee on Social Development from the Parliament of South Africa. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Interest Rates",92
85,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that the monthly mortgage payment on the average mortgage of $220,000 is $1,430. Is the Prime Minister aware that the monthly mortgage payment on an equivalent sized mortgage would currently be $1,169 in the United States and $1,234 in the United Kingdom? When will the Prime Minister admit that Australians are paying some of the highest interest rates among developed countries?",92
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome this resort by the member for Lilley to American and British analogies. I am reminded, in the context of industrial relations, of that immortal injunction of Tony Blair's that fairness in the workplace starts with the chance of a job. I am fascinated that the member for Lilley wants this government to embrace the economic policies of the current United States administration. I wonder if the member for Lilley would like us to embrace, as one of his predecessors didMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Apart from the fact that the member for Lilley does not want to embrace",93
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will come to his point of order. Mr Albanese-The point of order is on relevance. It is a question about interest rates. The Prime Minister does not want to talk about that.,93
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is answering the substance of the question.,93
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wonder if they would like us to have a look at the capital gains tax on the family home that exists, subject to certain thresholds, in both Britain and the United States. When he asked me that question, I was reminded of that great Labor campaign in 1980, when Peter Walsh raised the possibility of having a capital gains tax on the family home. If the opposition wantsMr Swan interjecting",93
90,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for Lilley will remove himself understanding order 94(a). The member for Lilley then left the chamber. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. It is a question about interest rates.",93
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have just ruled on that point of order. Mr Albanese-He hasn't mentioned interest rates.,93
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat and will not debate it. I will rule on his point of order. The Prime Minister is answering the substance of the question.,93
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Labor Party wants to start advocating American housing policies, including a capital gains tax on the family home, this government will be very happy to oblige the member for Lilley and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition. Of course interest rates in the United States have been lower than they have been in Australia; that is obvious. The reason is that the United States economy was flattened a few years ago by adverse economic developments. The reason the Australian economy was not flattened is that this government managed the Australian economy better than the American administration did the American economy. Bowel Cancer",93
94,Dr WASHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House what the government is doing to fight cancer in Australia? In particular, what recent steps have been taken to improve detection and treatment of bowel cancer?",93
95,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moore for his question. I thank him for the passion and commitment that he brings to all of these health issues based on his long experience as a medical practitioner in the suburbs of Perth. I regret to say that cancer will afflict one in three Australian males and one in four Australian females before the age of 75, but the good news is that Australian cancer survival rates are the second highest in the world and that our cancer survival rates have increased by 14 per cent over the last 20 years. Bowel cancer, I regret to say, currently kills about 5,000 Australians a year, but the good news is that it is relatively easy to treat and cure if it is detected early. Over the next two years, everyone turning 55 and 65more than one million people-will be offered bowel cancer screening as the first stage of the government's national bowel cancer screening program. The first test kits went out in the mail this week in Queensland. Test kits will be going out in New South Wales from next week and test kits will be going out in Victoria from next month. I say to the Australian people: if you do have the chance to be screened, take it because it could save your life. It is estimated that, of the 25,000 people who participated in the trial program, some 20 lives were saved. Finally, I would like to thank the states and territories for their cooperation in establishing this important new national program. Skills Shortage",94
96,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with the BIS Shrapnel senior economist who recently said in relation to constraints on the growth of the Australian economy that ‘the real, enduring problem is going to be the shortage of skilled labour'? In light of the analysis that the skills shortage is the major constraint on the Australian economy, why did the Commonwealth reduce expenditure on education and training as a proportion of this year's budget?",94
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the full contribution from BIS Shrapnel, but I certainly agree that one of the problems this country faces at present is a shortage of skilled tradesmen. I agree with that. The government recognised that at the time of the last election. Ms Macklin-It takes four years",94
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The deputy leader has asked her question.,94
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The most significant policy in the last election, dealing with the issue of skills, was the commitment by the government to establish Australian technical colleges. I am very pleased to inform the House that 20 of the 25 technical colleges will be up and running by the beginning of next year. Mr Wilkie-Why weren't they getting trained this year?",94
100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan is warned!,94
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the parliament and I remind the member for Jagajaga in particular of an interview on 8 August 2006-it is very contemporary. It was an interview with Michael Costa, who is a senior minister in the New South Wales government. The intro from the ABC presenter said: After 11 years of Labor government, the Treasurer is happy to admit to other failures. Michael Costa: We failed to keep our apprentice numbers up-partly that was due to, you know, the focus on the balance sheet, the need to look at cost-cutting strategies-and unfortunately, it seems that apprenticeships was an easy one. In other words, what that does is implicate the states. The member for Jagajaga talks to me about the investment of this government in skills. Let me remind the member for Jagajaga that we now have 389,000 apprentices and trainees in training. That represents a 151 per cent increase since March 1996. We are providing 167,000 additional places between 2005 and 2008. By contrast, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in 1993 there were only 123,000 apprentices in training. Mr Albanese interjecting Ms Macklin interjecting",94
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler is warned and so is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,95
103,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind those opposite that, since 1995-96, the Australian government VTE funding has increased by 85 per cent in real terms. Unmet demand for VTEvocational training and education-places has halved. In other words, the allegation that this government has cut funding for skills training is absolutely incorrect. National Security",95
104,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House of steps the government has taken to stop Australians from joining terrorist ganisations overseas?,95
105,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question because he raises a very important question and Australians ought to be informed. It is important in the context of the conflict in the Middle East, in particular. Many in our community have strong ties to Lebanon and Israel. We understand that people are legitimately concerned about family and friends, but I would urge caution if people plan to join in the conflict or send funds to assist. While it is unlikely to be an offence if people join or are conscripted into the defence forces of recognised governments, the same cannot be said for engagement or involvement in Hezbollah. Hezbollah is a multifaceted organisation. It has political, social and military components. There is one element, Hezbollah's External Security Organisation, that has been listed as a terrorist organisation by the Australian government since 2003. The External Security Organisation is a distinct terrorist wing of Hezbollah and has been responsible for attacks dating back to the 1980s. It is assessed as continuing to prepare, plan and foster acts involving threats to human life and serious damage to property. The military wing of Hezbollah, referred to as Islamic Resistance, is not proscribed, nor are the political or social components. So Australians who engage with or provide support to the External Security Organisation might be committing a terrorist offence under the Criminal Code and, equally, under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. But under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act it is an offence to enter a foreign state with the intent to engage in hostilities or to engage in hostile activities in a foreign state. The fororeign incursion offence does not apply if a person is with the armed forces of a government, and that would mean it would not apply in relation to Israeli or Lebanese defence forces. However, Australians who engage in hostile activities with the Hezbollah military wing or the External Security Organisation could well be committing an offence. The whole of Hezbollah is listed for the purposes of our asset-freezing legislation, and it is an offence under the Charter of the United Nations Act to deal with its assets or to make assets available to it. I think this is a very important matter, which Australians who are thinking of dealing with Hezbollah in any way, shape or form should have regard to, because, as I have outlined, there is the potential for serious criminal acts to be committed. Mr Gregory Andrews",95
106,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.47 pm)My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs.

111,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. He represents two important Australian portsGladstone, which is one of the big-volume ports in Australia, and Bundaberg, which receives a large number of international recreational vessels as the first port of call-so he has a particular interest in the performance of our ports and in ensuring that our trade flows freely through those ports. Mr Danby-Tell us the cost of containers!",96
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne Ports!,96
113,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality is, of course, that it is very important for Australia to have a smoothly working port system. The BTRE, the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics, is about to release a report in which it forecasts that the volume of non-container trade to pass through our ports in Australia will grow from 0.6 billion tonnes this year to 1.4 billion tonnes in 20 years time. A big proportion of that will be going through ports like Gladstone. In addition, it is forecast that there will be an even bigger increase, a 5.4 per cent per annum increase, over the next 20 years in the movement of containers, from 5.2 million 20-foot equivalent unit containers this year to 14.9 million TEUs in 2024virtually a threefold increase. When you think back to 1996, the rate of moving these containers across the port was stuck on 14, 15 or 16 containers an hour. In fact, when the Labor Party were last in office they told us that it was physically impossible to move them at a faster rate than 17 containers an hour-that was the absolute maximum rate that could be reached. Of course, we are now well over 27 containers an hour and doing very much better. Mr Danby interjecting",96
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne Ports is warned!,96
115,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Imagine what a crisis we would have in this country if we were trying to move 15 million TEUs a year with crane movement rates. How could we possibly get the freight across the ports if we were still operating our container terminals at the rate that Labor said was the maximum that could be achieved? The reality is that this government has made substantial reforms to facilitate trade, to get our ports working better. The bad news, of course, is that the Leader of the Opposition wants to roll back industrial relations reform. He wants to go back to 1996 and presumably 1996 containerhandling rates, and that will bring our country to a standstill. Our trade will stop. Those are the kinds of policies that Labor is trying to put before the Australian people. Whistleblowers",96
116,Mr SNOWDON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I refer the minister to his claim yesterday that the protection of whistleblowers is paramount. Can he confirm that an Indigenous whistleblower in his department, Tjanara Goreng Goreng, has been suspended and had her home raided by the Australian Federal Police? Can the minister confirm that one of the grounds for suspension included the officer's alleged connection with the Mutitjulu community? Why has Ms Goreng Goreng not enjoyed the same protection as Mr Andrews, a man with a demonstrated connection to Mutitjulu?",97
117,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As he pointed out, this is a matter of investigation by the Federal Police. I do not discuss such matters in this forum or anywhere else. Business Innovation and Competitiveness  is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister outline to the House the government's efforts to support business innovation and competitiveness in Australian industry.",97
118,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forrest for his question and lament his recent announcement that he will not be joining us again in this place after next election. He has made a fine contribution on behalf of Western Australia, particularly in the resources area. The cornerstone of the Howard government's support of business innovation is very much the R&D tax concession program, a market driven program that responds directly to the needs of industry. We now have almost 6,000 Australian businesses, 90 per cent of them SMEs, registered for the concession. That is an increase of some 52 per cent in the last five years. That is no accident, and it is also no accident that business expenditure now is at record levels, reaching $7.2 billion in 2004 according to the latest ABS study. Innovation is a critical part of our competitiveness for Australian industry. As I go around Australia as part of my preparation for the industry statement. I will be discussing the issue of how we can further assist industry with innovation. Our international competitors are not standing still in this area, and neither can we. If we want to talk about people standing still, there is the opportunity to consider what is happening on the other side of this chamber in terms of policies or attempted policies that have recently been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. In raising for the Labor Party what he called the Innovation Blueprint, the Leader of the Opposition said that he was very attracted to the scrapping of the R&D concession in favour of loans and grant schemes. Judging by the reaction from industry, people there are not quite so sure that the Leader of the Opposition has any idea about innovation. In fact, some of the responses that we received, particularly from industry bodies, are worth recalling. The AiG's Heather Ridout said that the proposal would mean that ‘a board-or the government for that matter-decides what programs get up, but that under a tax concession it is a market the driven scheme, which is far more accessible'. The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies said that scrapping of the tax concession would do ‘more damage than good'. And R&D tax experts from firms like KPMG and PwC describe the proposal as ‘retrograde', ‘unfortunate', sending the ‘wrong message', creating a ‘grant mentality amongst companies', ‘picking winners' and being ‘costly and time consuming'. What we have here is obvious opposition from industry but obvious lack of understanding of innovation and innovation policy by the Leader of the Opposition. It is no coincidence then that he has gone completely silent on this area as his reheated ‘noodle nation' becomes limp and soggy. It was a poor attempt at policy which exposed the Leader of the Opposition for not only being a weak leader but also having no idea on innovation, no idea on industry and no idea to help either. Water",97
119,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and relates to the role of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister in signing off on water entitlement allocations to the six New South Wales valleys involved in the Achieving Sustainable Groundwater Entitlements program as recommended by the Groundwater Adjustment Advisory Committee some two months ago. I do not want to overdramatise the urgency of this decision, but the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary should be aware that irrigators are making critical planning decisions relating to their cropping activities on the basis of unknown water entitlements and need an urgent decision at government level. Could the Prime Minister or the parliamentary secretary update the House on progress relating to this issue.",98
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will do my best. I will consult the parliamentary secretary at the end of question time. I am aware of the importance and urgency of this issue. I am also aware that there are still a number of taxation aspects that need to be resolved. They are in hand. I had a meeting with some people concerned in relation to this issue. Of course, the actual determination of the entitlements has something to do with the roles and responsibilities of the New South Wales government, as I think the honourable member for New England would be aware. Mr Windsor interjecting",98
121,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I cannot quite pick that up. I will talk to you later. Let me simply assure the honourable gentleman that if there is anything further that needs to be done by the Commonwealth government to expedite the resolution of this matter I am quite sure that the member for Wentworth will do it. Investing in Our Schools Program,98
122,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister inform the House how schools are benefiting from the government's Investing in Our Schools program. Has the minister received any feedback on the effectiveness of the program?",98
123,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question and acknowledge his keen interest in education in his electorate. The Australian government's $1 billion Investing in Our Schools program is designed to provide funding for smaller scale projects for necessary infrastructure for schools. This program has become necessary because of the chronic neglect by state Labor governments of state government schools. There are state government schools that have been waiting years for some of the most basic amenities to be funded. To put it in context, there are about 6,900 state government schools across Australia. Just in the first two rounds-rounds 1 and 2-of the Investing in Our Schools program there have been over 8,000 applications for funding from the federal government for state government schools. In round 3 there are now 10,000 applications from state government schools to the federal government. That is almost three applications per government school-per state government school-to the Australian government. The sorts of projects for which they are seeking funding are things like fixing up vermin infested sports sheds, fixing up threadbare carpets and fixing up canteens that have failed to meet state government health department standards, yet state governments are doing nothing to invest in their schools. You would have thought that perhaps the state Labor governments would be shamed into doing something about it but, according to the Sunday Telegraph of 9 July, the New South Wales state government will spend more money on buying new cars for public servants than on upgrading schools this financial year. You would think that members opposite would be slamming the state Labor governments for failing to properly invest in state government schools. Ms Bird interjecting",98

In answering my question yesterday about the disguised appearance of Mr Gregory Andrews on Lateline, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs stated that he had been informed of Mr Andrews's appearance on the afternoon before the interview was recorded on 2 June 2006. However, the Proof Hansard of yesterday's proceedings records the minister as saying that he was informed on the afternoon prior to 21 June. The Lateline program featuring Mr Andrews was broadcast on Lateline on 21 June 2006. I have watched and listened to a tape of yesterday's proceedings which confirmed that the minister advised the House that he was advised of Mr Andrews's appearance on the afternoon before 2 June. In this matter involving a senior Commonwealth officer making an anonymous appearance on television to back claims made by his minister, the record is of critical importance. I ask that you view the tape of yesterday's proceedings and ensure the answer actually given by the minister is recorded in the Hansard.

183,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Jagajaga) (3.17 pm)The chickens have really come home to roost this week for the Howard government. What we have seen this week is not only an interest rate rise but another interest rate rise to hurt all the mortgage holders of this country. All the families around Australia who are finding it tough to pay their mortgages have only two people to blame: the Prime Minister of this country and his Treasurer. But this really was a watershed question time today. For the first time in 10 years, this Prime Minister refused to answer a question from the shadow Treasurer about interest rates, because he knows that Australian families are now paying more and more for their mortgages-and they are paying more because of the extremely poor economic management by this government. We have cackling up the back from a member of the government because he obviously, like the member for Wentworth, just thinks that the reaction to this interest rate rise has been overdramatised. I hope all the families in your electorate, all the electors Moncrieff, know that their member thinks that this interest rate rise is a big joke. like the member for Wentworth, the member for Moncrieff thinks this is a big joke. I hope he goes home and tellsMr Ciobo- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Jagajaga professes to speak on my behalf, and she is completely incorrect.",104
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member has no point of order.,104
185,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is plain that the member for Moncrieff has not been able to tell the families in his electorate what this government has been up to for the last seven years. For seven years, this government has ignored the warnings of the Reserve Bank that go back to 1999. That was the first time that the Reserve Bank, in a statement on monetary policy, started warning this government about the serious skills shortages that existed in our economy. They reported in a survey done by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations at that time, way back in 1999, that we had skills shortages at historically high levels. Again, in the year 2000, there was a statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, saying that skills shortages had emerged. Six years ago, the Governor of the Reserve Bank was telling this government how serious skills shortages were becoming and the pressure for higher wage rises appeared to be building. That was back in the year 2000. That is how long these inflationary pressures have been building in the Australian economy because of the actions of this government when it comes to skills shortages. And so it went on to 2004 and a statement on monetary policy: ‘business surveys suggest that a broad range of firms are finding it increasingly difficult to find skilled of labour ... substantial increases in wages for skilled employees in construction and reJust sources sectors and in some business service areas.' And so it went on into 2005, when there was yet again a statement on monetary policy from the Reserve Bank. Year after year, this government has continued to ignore each of these warnings from the Reserve Bank about the higher labour costs being imposed on the economy-all due, to quote the Reserve Bank, to skills shortages that have arisen because of this government's inaction on the training front. In 2005 there was a speech yet again from the Reserve Bank, with the wording getting more and more serious. In 2005 they were talking about the severity of the current skills shortage. They went on to say, ‘The difficulty of finding suitable skilled labour now is as high as it has been in the last two decades.' That was in March 2005. So it went on until the most recent statement on monetary policy, where we have the Reserve Bank again talking about tight labour market conditions, shortages of skilled labour and recognising that that is particularly the case in the construction and resources industry. It is not only the Reserve Bank that has been telling the Howard government that this is a major constraint on the Australian economy. The government have ignored the warning of the economic forecaster BIS Shrapnel that this skills crisis will impact on the capacity of the Australian economy to grow. They have said that the Australian economy will struggle to maintain growth of three per cent because of the skills crisis. They said: While the difference between 3 and 4 per cent growth may sound minor, accumulated over a whole decade it amounts to a 10 per cent difference in the size of the economyand this is the important point… This is roughly the size of the output of Australia's agriculture, mining and electricity sectors combined. That is all because this government, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer have not been capable of ensuring that we have sufficient skilled tradespeople in the economy, sufficient skilled professionals so that business has the skilled people to do the job that they need to do. How did all this come to pass? How is it that we have such a serious shortage of skilled labour in Australia? As a result of the government's action, this country is the only developed country in the world to have seen, in the last 10 years, a cut in public investment in tertiary education-that is, to universities and technical education. There has been an eight per cent drop in public investment in tertiary education in Australia, while the average investment for the industrialised world is a 38 per cent increase. The government have cut investment in education and training, so is it any wonder that we now have a serious shortage of skilled labourplumbers, carpenters, electricians and engineers? So the list goes on. It is because of the shortage of that skilled labour that we now have the Reserve Bank saying they have had to put up interest rates. The Australian family, who has a mortgage, is now paying for the extraordinary incompetence of the government as a result of the decisions taken, when they were first elected, to cut spending on higher education and training. If we look at what they did when they were first elected, we see that they froze the spending on vocational education and training, after there had been a significant cut when they were first elected. They massively cut funding to universities at the same time. We know that those cuts and the freezing of expenditure-when David Kemp was the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs-have resulted in the serious shortages of skilled tradespeople that this economy is now experiencing. It takes four years to train an electrician, a plumber or a carpenter. Between 2000 and 2003 there was a decline in the number of apprentices in traditional trades. That is why now, three years later, we have the Reserve Bank saying, ‘It's these skills shortages that are driving up interest rates.' The minister, who represents the electorate of Moreton, and the member for Moncrieff should go and tell all the mortgage holders in their electorates: ‘The reason you are paying higher interest rates on your mortgages is that we cut the funding to vocational education and training. We cut the funding to universities when we were first elected.' It is the case that the mortgage holders of Australia are now paying through their mortgages for the extraordinarily short-sighted decisions that this government made nearly 10 years ago. In the most recent budget we had an extraordinary decision by the Howard government in the face of seven years of warnings from the Reserve Bank. We saw a decline in the proportion of funding in the budget going to vocational education and training, when we have an absolute crisis when it comes to the shortage of electricians, plumbers, carpenters-and so the list goes on. The Australian Industry Group, commenting on the 2006 budget, said that this was extremely disappointing. They are the people who represent all those businesses who now cannot get the skilled tradespeople they need to meet the jobs that have to be done in the economy. What has the response been from the Howard government to this massive shortage of skilled labour? Their one response has been to bring more people in from overseas. Rather than train Australians, rather than give young Australians the opportunity to learn a trade and ensure young Australians can get a skill and a trade, this ernment has turned 300,000 Australians away from TAFE and, at the same time, brought in 270,000 extra migrants from overseas to fill the skills shortages. Mr Adams interjecting",104
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lyons has already been warned!,106
187,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is exactly what has happened under this government. We know that the government has more recently got very keen on the idea of what is called a 457 visa. These are shorter term visas, where the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs allows employers to bring in temporary skilled migrants to fill these skills shortages. We understand how important it is for Australia to have skilled migration, but we do not agree with the department of immigration doing the dirty work for this government's incompetence and allowing employers to bring in migrants from overseas to undercut the wages and conditions of Australian workers. We want Australian kids to have the chance to get a trade. We do not want those opportunities to be taken by people coming from overseas when there are thousands of young Australians who want the chance to get an apprenticeship. Skills as a driver of productivity in this country have dropped by 75 per cent over the last 10 years. We should be making sure that skills are the main driver of productivity. But we know this government's answer for getting productivity increases out of the Australian workforce: make them work harder for less. The Howard government's response to productivity is: let us compete with China and India by cutting wages and making people work harder. Labor's answer to increase productivity is to invest in skills and the education of the Australian workforce to make sure that govyoung Australians have the chance to get a good education and an apprenticeship-and not to give all those jobs to people coming from overseas. Labor has put forward many different policies in this area to address this government's gross incompetence. We proposed a trade completion bonus-which, of course, this government could have picked up. We want to make sure that young people finish their apprenticeship. Forty per cent of young Australians are not finishing their apprenticeship. They are dropping out because the wages under this government are so appalling. So give them a bonus-give them $2,000 to encourage them to finish their apprenticeship. That way we might be able to address this very serious skills crisis. That is one thing this government could do immediately. But, no, they refused to do that. Rather than addressing what the Reserve Bank says is one of the main reasons for pressure on interest rates in this economy, their approach continues to be to drive their radical industrial relations reforms to make sure that Australians are competing with China and India on wages. Until we get action from this government to address this skills crisis, we are going to see the pressure on Australian families continue to grow-we are going to see the pressure on their mortgages continue to grow. These families have only one group of people to blame for the interest rate rises they are having to pay, that is the Howard government. (Time expired)",106
188,Mr HARDGRAVE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Moreton-Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (3.32 pm)-I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. The member for Jagajaga's contribution was a curious grab bag. I noticed that less than half of the entire caucus showed up and people left-in fact, so did the public gallery. In the member for Jagajaga's efforts to secure her own deputy leadership, today is an historic occasion. She signed her letter to the Speaker today as ‘Jennifer Macklin'. I think there could be a push on. Maybe instead of losing her deputy leadership she is in fact starting to gain the momentum to try and roll ‘big Kim', the member for Brand. We will have to wait and see. Going to the substantial nature of this debate, there is no doubt in my mind that this a matter of public importance. It is absolutely important that the public is fully aware of the set of circumstances Australia is in today-and they can make a set of judgments. To compare and contrast the efforts of the previous Labor government and this government alone is a very worthy way of putting the case for why this government is quite the opposite of what the member for Jagajaga has put forward in her rant to this chamber today. The Labor Party used training to hide unemployment. I remember very clearly that, leading up to the 1996 election, there was a great community debate about the amount of money used on the Working Nation program, which was a training program designed to grab the long-term unemployed-unemployment was 11.1 per cent, while today it is 4.8 per cent; that is a great compare and contrast. There were billions of dollars in funding for Working Nation. No jobs were created, but people were slipped and into a training program and not counted as unemployed. A way to hide unemployment was to train people; that was the way Labor saw training. Looking at apprenticeship completions, it is interesting to note that at the end of 1995 just 31,500 people completed an apprenticeship. How many completed an apprenticeship at the end of 2005? It was 138,700. So Labor there were 31,500 completions in 1995 and 138,700 completions at the end of 2005. That is because this government has focused on training-not to hide people on welfare but because we believe people should have the opportunity to gain skills that are relevant to the way our economy works. We have generated an enormous number of apprenticeships. People are not only starting apprenticeships in record numbers today, but also completing apprenticeships in record numbers. The member for Jagajaga spoke about an ‘apparent' cut in investment in education and is training in the budget of August 1996. It is important to remind people that there was a very good reason why there would have been a review of expenditure in that budget. In fact, there were 96 billion reasons-and every one of them was an Australian dollar. There was a $96 billion black hole. The Australian Labor Party, announcing the 1995 budget at this very dispatch box, said there was going to be a surplus of more than $10 billion. When we came to office we found that they were not $10 billion up but $96 billion down. There was $96 billion of debt, which had an enormous impact on Australians who were borrowing money for their homes, for other investments and, indeed, for everyday expenditure. People were borrowing at a higher rate simply because the Australian government was in the borrowing market, owing $96 billion to the world. The government took the hard decisions in August 1996 and made the changes necessary to put us in a position where we are now debt free. In fact, we are now able to take the surpluses generated from the taxes paid by Australians and, using good economic management, put money aside in the Future Fundsomething the Labor Party never imagined. What I also find amazing about the contribution by the member for Jagajaga today is that, in the previous parliament of 2001 to 2004, I think she asked one or two questions on skills. Yet today she tells me this is a crisis that has been building since 1999. It is a crisis that has not garnered any effort from the member for Jagajaga except for occasionally. Over the last six or seven weeks we in my office have been remarking about how quiet she has been-in fact, she has disappeared from the agenda. Maybe the winter recess was good to her; I was on the road talking with real Australians about real issues. I also know that the member for Jagajaga did nothing when it came to the 2003 national training agreement that this government attempted to negotiate with the states in a cooperative federalism model. All the states walked out on that to try and create a political pressure point at the expense of people in training. They walked away and denied Australians the extra growth funds we were offering through that agreement. I find all of that lack of attention, lack of credibility and lack of record of engagement on this issue a point that needs to be put on the record. In fact, I do not believe it was until the federal election campaign of 2004 that we heard from her. During that campaign the Prime Minister said that a raft of new measures and expenditure would be announced in the 2005 budget-which were delivered on time and in full; in fact, we delivered more than we promised in the 2004 election campaign. But we do not believe we heard anything from the member for Jagajaga until we started these sorts of initiatives that the government has put in place through over $1 billion of extra expenditure. If you want do a compare and contrast, the Australian Labor Party's expenditure until 1996 was $1.07 billion; this government this year expended $2½ billion. On top of that there is additional money through the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and a number of other departments for training, health and other areas. There has never been a government like this as far as investing in training is concerned. As an Australian government we have sponsored the distribution of more expenditure into the national training system than ever before in Australia's history. What is absolutely critical is that we need the member for Jagajaga, and her apparently declining but nevertheless official influence in Australian politics, to participate with us to convince state governments to also do their part. I did not write the Constitution. It was written over 100 years ago and it was written by blokes. I often make the point that, if a few women had been involved, we might have got a few more sensible things in place. But, nevertheless, the Constitution prescribes that education and training is the responsibility of state governments. From the point of view of the Australian government, what we are trying to do is tell the states to stop standing at state borders and looking in and start looking across state borders and seeing themselves as part of an entire nation. If we start to get that sort of approach from state governments, we will not see a continuation of the stupid circumstance of a credential gained in one jurisdiction not being automatically recognised in another jurisdiction. That is why this government and this Prime Minister sponsored an enormous change at the Council of Australian Governments meeting earlier this year-to bring about a recognition of occupational licences in key nation-building traditional trades. State governments are now starting to realise the folly in their ways. Ms George-Get on with the issue!",107
189,Mr HARDGRAVE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Throsby interjects. This underscores how a former president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, now sitting as a member in this place, has herself sponsored the decline in the circumstances that they are complaining about. This government is actually doing something about it. The hard thing for those opposite to understand is that the state governments are starting to realise they must cooperate in this national agenda. The leadership from Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania is appreciated. The lethargy from Western Australia is lamented and the complete rallying against the way the world is going by New South Wales is pathetic. This is where the member for Jagajaga and, indeed, the member for Throsby could play a role. In fact, they could demand of the New South Wales government that they allow trade training to commence while kids are at school. There are no Australian school based apprenticeships at any of the certificate levels, first, second, third or fourth, the trades in New South Wales schoolsnone, zero. In Queensland there are about 8,000; in Victoria there is a growing number that is currently around 2,000; but in Western Australia they will not let you in the construction trades. Despite today's announcement of a 4.8 per cent unemployment rate in Western Australia and businesses screaming out for trade skills, they are instead legislating to tell kids to stay at school until the end of year 12 and denying them the full raft of possibilities to start the elements of learning a trade while they are at school. Instead of trying to become the Leader of the Opposition at the expense of the training opportunities of young Australians, I would ask the member for Jagajaga to get a serious contribution in mind and join with me, the Prime Minister and all the members on this side of the chamber and demand a truly national training system response from all state governments. Even Michael Costa, the New South Wales Treasurer, said earlier this week that dollars were more important than training. Mr Costa said: We failed to keep our apprenticeship numbers up, partly that was due, you know, to the focus on the balance sheet, the need to look at cost-cutting strategies and unfortunately it seems that apprenticeships was the easy one. The government is putting in $2.5 billion; Labor put in $1 billion the last time they were in office. That is an 85 per cent increase. We have contributed an enormous amount of additional expenditure that Labor never put into place. The state governments tell me that, for every dollar I put in, they put in three or four. So, by the state governments' own account, if we put in $2.5 billion they must put in somewhere between $7.5 billion and $10 billion. I think they are exaggerating their involvement but I will take them at their word. in If those numbers are right, where are the priorities? The priorities are building large, fat bureaucracies in the state government departments and giving jobs to union mates who can't do anything around the workplaces anymore because people are turning their backs on trade unions. They have to give them something to do, and they give them a big, fat pay packet to go with that and, as long they have a job, ‘It's okay, Jack.' I am afraid that is not the way this government sees the world. We see training opportunities for young people to start at school as a critical element of the way forward. Again, the member for Jagajaga does not understand this. It has been 12 years since we started talking about competency based training, yet here again today the member for Jagajaga is talking about the amount of time it takes. The simple matter is, if we can get units of competency being the basis for the advancement of people's ability to earn more money, the units of competency being the basis on which they are paid more because they are worth more in the workplace, we will see people leaving a trade apprenticeship in a faster way. In fact we will also see people who have experience in other places and who have done other things getting those credentials recognised, getting that prior experience recognised, and getting them working. That is why the Queensland government said to me-and in fact gave me a document to prove their point-that they need something like a 32 per cent increase in the number of people who know how to drive earthmoving equipment. They want to build dams and they want to build roads. They want to build all these things but they know that, because we lost 30,000 people in one year when Kim Beazley, the member for Brand, was the minister responsible for training, the recession we had to have dumped all of those people out of the apprenticeship system, which was evidenced by the fact that we had only 30,900 graduating in 1996. People dropped out. The Queensland government are saying to me that, because we lost so many people who had partly completed their apprenticeships in the early 1990s, there are people floating around this country with some of the skills but not all of the skills who are frustrated because they cannot actually do what they know they can do. They have not got the piece of paper. So I am happy to work with Queensland on that. I would also remind the member for Jagajaga, as she is a member of the same faction of the Labor Party in Victoria, that she was a senior adviser in the failed Cain-Kirner years when the Socialist Left faction presided over the closing down of the Victorian technical schools. It might have worked well as she was sipping cafe lattes in Brunswick Street and working for David White, a key member of that disastrous party. She was a member of the guilty party, as Victorians would know, but even Lynne Kosky, the Victorian education minister, has admitted today that the Australian Labor Party may have erred when it closed down the technical schools across Victoria during the former Cain government. So we have the member for Jagajaga trying to cover her sins and cover for the failure of the Labor Party when they were in government, and failing to understand that no government has invested more and no government has achieved more, failing to understand that never has there been more people in training, never has there been more people in the traditional trades and never has there been more opportunities for jobs, because of the strong economic management of this government. This economy is moving strongly, and as it demands more and more we will give it. (Time expired)",109
190,Mr JENKINS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was quite an intriguing contribution from the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, because he really did not at any stage defend himself on the points raised in this matter of public importance. He had a great deal of interest in the member for Jagajaga and where she has been and where she is going. I can understand that somebody would wish to follow the career of the member for Jagajaga, but that is not what we are here for today. It is not about one job; it is about many jobs. It is about the state of the Australian economy and it is about the fate of families who are confronting increasing interest rates and increasing petrol prices. I would have thought, as I understand the seat of Moreton, the electorate of the minister, that he in particular would understand that the people he represents in that area of Brisbane, the outer suburbs of Brisbane, are confronting those dual problems in their day-today lives. It is clear that the increase in interest and the threat to the consumer price index because of increasing petrol prices affect all Australians, but there are pockets in regional areas where the effect on people is even greater. Interestingly enough, there are studies now that clearly show that families in outer urban areas, such as the electorate of Scullin, who are confronting these dual phenomena at the moment are really finding it tough. The minister ignored the fact that the basis of today's matter of public importance was comments in a Reserve Bank document of 4 August which, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition clearly indicated, merely iterated concerns about the skills shortage. These concerns have been clearly identified for several years, and the member for Jagajaga went through in detail the times when this government had the opportunity to have the light globe go on and say, ‘There is a problem.' But in defence of the accusation, which is factual, of a decrease in Commonwealth resources given to university and technical training, what does the minister say? He goes back to this 1996 black holethe great spin doctoring of this government. But he did admit in making that contention that they did make the cut. So the government have now had 10 years to drag themselves out of the black hole they are supposed to have inherited at the same time that the Prime Minister said they had inherited an economy that was not bad, and very good in some parts. But forget about that 10 years down the track: ‘Oh, no, it was only the way we did the accounting and what we were told-what we didn't know until we got the blue book.' But they have had 10 years to redress this problem. In the last few budgets the government have not been fainthearted in the way they have thrown money at problems. It is just everywhere. The member behind reminds me of a comment I first rates heard from the member for Rankin: ‘They have just thrown money around like drunken sailors.' That is one of the things that the Reserve Bank is concerned about: this is a mob who, in the way they run the economy, think it runs on autopilot. When you have something running on autopilot, you have to have the gizmo that is the autopilot. They did not put in the gizmo, and they let go of all the levers. When PJ Keating, the former member for Blaxland, was Treasurer, he often said that the way in which a responsible government made sure that the economy was working in the best interests of the Australian community and Australian families was by having its hands on the lever of economic management. He decried those opposite who parodied him about that. He was no shrinking violet and would take those sorts of criticisms with a grain of salt. I was interested in looking at some of the things that he said at that time about using the levers of economic management to ensure that the government was guiding the way forward for the Australian economy, and he made some comments about his predecessor. At one stage, back in 1988, he talked about a member of this chamber called ‘ Mr Nearly'-that is a very unparliamentary term, which is beside the point as I am sure our standards have changed. I would suggest that he was referring to the Prime Minister as ‘ Mr Nearly'. He said: He nearly floated the exchange rate. He nearly deregulated the financial market. He nearly got control of the Budget. He nearly cracked down on bottom of the harbour schemes. And those opposite want to lecture us about matters economic! Let us get this clear: if they want to enter into a dialogue about those matters then the conclusion that we could make is that they have had it pretty easy and that they have squandered their opportunities. One of the things that they have squandered is maximising the potential of our human resources. Because of commodity prices being the way that they are, the government has tended to see economic growth continuing on the basis of what we rip out of the ground or what we are able to generate as primary producers. Regrettably, that is where coalition governments always seem to drop back to. They just do not want to say: ‘We're working in a modern global economy. We're acting upon an economy that has changed because of the Hawke-Keating years, and we need to recognise that. So why would we be so foolish as not to invest in our human resources and ensure that our people are skilled to the hilt when our competitors-especially countries in the Asian region such as China and India-are growing and putting out graduates in the millions while we are struggling in the thousands?' What is really amazing is that this government says: ‘We had this bright idea. At the election we announced that we would have 25 new technical schools.' Wow! That is spectacular, isn't it? There age of about 100,000 people. When you convert the loss of resources back to the schools sector, it means a reduction of 122,000 people who could have undergone training. Then you have to factor in that the promise of 25 colleges has come out as only 20. I thought the minister was getting close to admitting what the government's idea for the Australian technical schools was really about. It was really about ideological hatred and differences. A couple of days ago I said that it concerned all the state administrations. Perhaps I was wrong, because the minister did not seem to want to have a go at Western Australia and New South Wales today. That is just amazing. He said again today that the solution for the Commonwealth not putting any effort into a portfolio area is to say that it is the states' responsibility. This denies that there have been nearly 15 years of full blooded cooperation between the states and the Commonwealth in the area of TAFE colleges. How can a minister of the Crown come before us today and say that this is really the states' responsibility but then champion the Australian technical colleges as the only response that the government has to Australia's skills shortage, the effect that it is going to have on families and the way that they will be able to cope with the economy? That is a duplication-a dual system. Instead, the minister should sit down and cooperate with the states and look at places like Northland Secondary College in East Preston, the VCAL and other things that the Victorian government and other state governments have done. There is no need to re-invent the wheel: just get in there and cooperate. But unless this government acknowledges the shortages of skills and the infrastructure deficiencies, we will not see families being able to tackle the economic constraints that confront them. is a skills short- (Time expired)",110
191,Mr CIOBO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It has been an interesting debate this afternoon. The member for Jagajaga put forward this matter of public importance, with the central thrust that Australian households today have seen the recent rise in interest rates as a consequence of the Howard government not heeding Reserve Bank warnings. I heard all sorts of claims from the member for Jagajaga and the member for Scullin alleging to put forward the position of the Reserve Bank of Australia on the Australian economy. We heard allegations from the member for Jagajaga that interest rate rises were a result of inflation, and that inflation was a direct consequence of a lack of investment in skills training. We heard the member for Scullin making claims that interest rate increases were a result of economic ineptitude on the part of the Howard government-another theme that was central to the argument that the member for Jagajaga put forward. But my concern, as someone who sits on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration and having had the opportunity to sit opposite the Reserve Bank board on quite a number of occasions is that, despite what the member for Jagajaga and the Labor opposition would say, the evidence that has been put to the committee time and time again by the Reserve Bank board is in direct conflict and contrast to the allegations that the member for Jagajaga and the member for Scullin have made. In fact, the Reserve Bank board has indicated that the Australian economy is one of the best performing economies in the developed world. The economic cycle in this country has been growing for 15 years. We know that unemployment today has dropped to a 30-year low of 4.8 per cent-the lowest level since August 1976-because of the good economic management by the Howard government. We know that the Australian people have been enjoying an average GDP growth rate of 3¾ per cent because of the good work of the Prime Minister, John Howard, and, importantly, the Treasurer, Peter Costello, when it comes to the management of the Australian economy. Do not listen to what Labor says when it comes to its policies; look at what Labor does. When you actually look at the facts, you see that what the member for Scullin and the member for Jagajaga said is simply not supported by those facts. People should turn their minds to the facts, because they certainly do not support what the member for Jagajaga or the member for Scullin said. I would like to quote from what the Reserve Bank governor said. Rather than simply pretending to speak on his behalf, as the member for Jagajaga did, I will quote him. He made reference to a couple of key points in respect of how the Australian economy was growing and has been growing for 15 years, averaging at 3¾ per cent GDP growth. He spoke about the need to maintain this growth. He said: At the current stage of the expansion, there are a number of factors that might be expected to put upward pressure on inflation. The economy is operating at a high level of capacity utilisation, the labour market is relatively tight, and there have been some large increases in raw material costs. Aggregate wages growth has picked up over the past year, and businesses generally are reporting difficulty in attracting labour. He continued: This outlook is, as usual, subject to significant uncertainty. One area of uncertainty relates to wages growth, where there is a risk that current labour market tightness will result in higher than expected wage increases. He spoke about the fact that we have unemployment down to 4.8 per cent today-it was at about five per cent when he made those remarks-highlighting the fact that, because the Australian economy has been growing so strongly, it is leading to some tightness in the labour market and that may push up the inflation rate. An important and key fundamental to recognise-and I questioned the Reserve Bank governor on this-is the fact that one of the key drivers of inflation is wages growth. We saw recently, for example, that the Queensland Labor government and the New South Wales Labor government have given pay increases in the vicinity of 25 per cent to 30 per cent. Those are the kinds of wage increases that the Reserve Bank governor is directly talking about in that quote that I just read when he said that that is the kind of wages growth that will cause concern and push up interest rates. Bear in mind as well that it is the state Labor governments that are again borrowing billions of dollars to put into their economies. At a time when we are facing the risk of higher interest rates, which are still five per cent lower than the ALP's average, we have state Labor governments adopting Labor Party policy and again borrowing billions and billions of dollars. If there is anybody who is putting pressure on the Australian economy, it is the Australian Labor Party, by allowing these ridiculous wage increases at a state level and, furthermore, by actually borrowing billions of dollars. In addition, I would like to make some reference to what the Reserve Bank governor said with respect to labour market reform. He said: I have made the point on a number of occasions that, whilst monetary policy can take a lot of credit for the stability of the expansion, for a long period the lift in productivity was nothing to do with monetary policy; it was to do with structural and microeconomic reform. To me, there were about five components to this, which have been occurring over the last 15 years: tariff tion, financial deregulation, privatisation, labour market reform and competition policy. I think all five have been extremely important. I think we want to see further reform. We will be constantly evaluating our institutions to decide whether or not they really are first best. We have one reform, which has been achieved but not implemented yet, which is the third phase of labour market reform. He goes on in that transcript to talk about the absolute importance of labour market reform in ensuring that the Australian economy continues to grow-the kind of labour market reform which is directly responsible for this 30-year low in the unemployment rate, the kind of labour reform which the Australian Labor Party stands opposed to. The Australian Labor Party goes out there on a scare campaign and lies about the consequences of labour market reform. The kind of reform the Reserve Bank governor talks about when he fronts the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is the kind of reform the Australian Labor Party stands opposed to. I reassert: don't listen to what the Australian Labor Party says but look at what the Australian Labor Party does. At a state level, the Australian Labor Party is doing nothing except pushing up inflation and driving up interest rates. It is the Howard government and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, that are working to bring these down. Importantly, I heard the member for Jagajaga saying that the government's approach is to cut wages. I think, to use an almost exact quote from the member for Jagajaga, she said ‘to make them work harder for less'. Apparently that is the government's policyvery strange. In 10 years under the HowardCostello government, we have seen wages increase by 16.3 per cent. Contrast that with the 13 years under Labor when the growth rate in real terms was a miserly 1.3 per cent. reducSo we had a 1.3 per cent growth in real wages under the Australian Labor Party and a 16.3 per cent growth in wages under the Howard government. It hardly seems to be the case that this government's policy is to make them work harder for less. Quite the contrary: this government's policy is to ensure that Australians are enjoying some of the best working conditions they have ever enjoyed, as a result of this government's policies. Once again, we see another furphy put forward by the member for Jagajaga. We have seen furphies from the member for Jagajaga on what the Reserve Bank governor has said, we have seen furphies with respect to this policy on labour market reform and we have seen furphies by the member for Jagajaga on what the consequences will be of the Work Choices legislation. I would like to turn to some Labor Party form, particularly with regard to their rhetomatter ric. What we have seen is that, despite their claims, Labor actually started shutting down vocational education facilities in a whole host of areas. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, in 1987 closed down the Apprentice Training School at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. As Minister for Defence he closed down one of the best apprenticeship training courses that there was. In the limited time. I have, I simply reassert that the Australian economy is widely regarded as the miracle economy, and it is because of 10 years of solid and sustainable economic growth under the Howard government. It stands in stark contrast with the lies we have heard from the Australian Labor Party about",112

I was making the point, in the presence of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, that there are a whole lot of things the government could do about the impact of high petrol prices on both Australian families and Australian industry-and, in particular, Australian small business. I am happy to see the Minister for Small Business and Tourism present, because there is no doubt that she has had a lot of feedback. I hope she has had some feedback; I hope people are talking to her about the impact of petrol prices on their operations and the combined impact on small business of higher interest rates and petrol prices. Fran Bailey-They are also talking to me about Labor's policy on unfair dismissal",116
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"Minister, we do not need a debate across the table.",116
202,Mr FITZGIBBON,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,The minister interjects and she acknowledges that small business people have been complaining to her about the combined impact on their businesses of higher petrol prices and increases in interest rates.

I am happy to acknowledge that I have heard from some small business people who are a bit concerned about dismissal policies too.

They know that, now this government has taken away their opportunity to take the less expensive and less cumbersome path of unfair dismissal, people will be coming after their former employers under a thing we call ‘unlawful dismissal'. The minister sitting at the table must surely knowor, at least, I hope she knows-that the unlawful dismissal path will be far more cumbersome and far more expensive for small business operators.

206,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,I hope so!,117
207,Mr FITZGIBBON,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"out of respect for you, and return to the issue at hand. I said just before question time that there are some short-term things the government can do about petrol prices. They can move quickly to strengthen the power of the ACCC to ensure that things are being done properly and fairly in the market. They can restore the Trade Practices Act to its former glory, in particular section 46, so that the ACCC has some prospect of securing prosecutions for misuse of market power. They are very simple things that the government could do tomorrow. In fact, I gave the Treasurer another opportunity today in the parliament to sign that simple letter to send to the ACCC chairman that is required to give him the power to properly investigate petrol pricing and the market-both retail distribution and wholesale distribution at the terminal gate. I said before question time that this is a very important bill. These are very important reforms to the regulatory regime which our petrol retail market operates under. They were originally put in place by the Fraser government out of concern about market concentration and vertical integration in ticular. I spoke about the way in which they have been circumvented over the last half a dozen years or so and the government's failure to show leadership and to secure some agreement between the various parties before now to get rid of this antiquated law. I just want to reinforce the point again that the opposition support of this repeal bill hinges on the promise we have had from the government that very soon-in other words, almost concurrently with the repeal by this billthey will be introducing those amendments to the Trade Practices Act which we have been seeking for so long. It is very important to note that we are repealing legislation today that effectively does nothing anyway because, audaciously, some weeks ago now, the minister decided to move a regulation which undeclares each of the major oil companies under the legislation. The legislation sets up the framework, and who is covered by the legislation is determined by regulation. The four major oil companies have been undeclared, so we have a Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act that covers no-one. So it would be nonsense for the opposition to be opposing the repeal of the legislation, but the legislation is still there and has leverage for us to ensure that those trade practices amendments come forward. I look forward to the government producing those amendments in the next little while. We want to see 98 per cent of the Senate committee's recommendations. We do not want half the story or some half-baked approach to restoring section 46 of the Trade Practices Act and therefore the ACCC's ability to secure prosecutions for misuse of market power, collusion and all those other things under part IV generally. Listening to the debate on this bill before I received my opportunity to speak, I heard a parlot of talk-and it is welcome talk-about what the Prime Minister could be doing in the long term about petrol prices in this country. When the price of international oil is high, it should be a call to arms to the government to swing into action, to do something short term-and I have addressed those issues-but also something medium to long term. We accept-we are not fools-that high petrol prices at the moment are largely driven by high oil prices, but there are both shortand long-term things that the government can be doing to mitigate the impact on people, as I have said. This should be a wake-up call to the government to finally get an energy policy together and to finally acknowledge that we have to wean ourselves off Middle Eastern oil. In fact, we have to wean ourselves off our traditional fuels. Oil is such a finite source. We are running out of oil. On the basic laws of supply and demand, demand is going up and supply is going down, so naturally price is going up. When is the government going to realise that this is unsustainable and we are facing a fuel price crisis? There are some solutions. People have been talking about ethanol. Let me say something about ethanol again. The Labor Party support ethanol as an important contributor to this goal-that is, to wean us off oil and stretch our finite resources further. We started the ethanol industry in this country with capital assistance grants back in 1993. We have supported pushing out further the application of tax on ethanol. We are now out to 2012. We did not oppose the government's total removal of import competition. We have supported all the later rounds of capital assistance grants for new plant. We have done all the ethanol industry has asked of us short of mandating. None of us should be turning to mandating as a solution to ethanol's challenges. We should not need to mandate. This is a good product. It is good for regional jobs. It is good for the environment. It is good for the agricultural sector. It helps the competitiveness of independent service stations, because they can blend the product-having no tax makes them more competitive. It does not need mandating. Where do we stop once we tell people they have to buy a product? Lemonade in beer next? Consumers do not expect to be told by legislatures what they should and should not buy, but if we work together and work sensibly we do not need to mandate ethanol. We want it to play an important role in the mix. A good industry out there wants it to play an important role in the mix. The oil companies need a jab in the ribs. The government should be jabbing them harder, and rewe are happy to support them in providing those jabs. Ethanol is a very important mix and has our total and unqualified support. But we only make 37 million litres of it in this country at the moment. If we mandated it at 10 per cent, we would need two billion litres. What would we have to do? We would have to import it. If we could not import it, demand would outstrip supply. What would that do to the price of the ethanol? It would send it up. What would that do to the price of to the petrol-ethanol blend? It would send it up. So this would be an anti-consumer measure. We have to support ethanol, but we also have to support LPG, CNG, biodiesel and of course gas-to-liquids diesel. We have plentiful supplies of liquid petroleum gas. How amazing and hypocritical it was for the Prime Minister this week to roll out as a possible solution to growing LPG consumption the bringing forward of a rebate on installations which he planned to give anyway. This is the same Prime Minister who made LPG taxed for the first time, first with a GST. We should recall that the LPG industry took the full brunt of the GST. Petrol had its excise reduced by 7c to partly-and I underline partly-offset the impact of the GST. It did not. It was not enough to stop the GST causing petrol prices to rise, but petrol did have an excise reduction. LPG attracted no excise, so there was no excise to reduce, and it took the full 10 per cent brunt of John Howard's GST. Now the Prime Minister plans to put an excise on LPG for the first time. This is a Prime Minister who has been working against LPG in the market rather than assisting a greater take-up of LPG, so it is entirely hypocritical of him to pose that as a weak solution to the significant issues we face. LPG is a great opportunity for us. It is an indigenous fuel and we have plenty of it. Our other big opportunity is natural gasprior to getting to hydrogen as an ultimate solution. I should acknowledge hydrogen, because it will be our ultimate solution, but prior to that our next big resource is the enormous reserves of natural gas we have in this country-150 trillion cubic feet of it. The member for Batman acknowledged my statement that it is a funny Prime Minister who has no trouble getting natural gas to Shanghai when he cannot get it from the west coast of the country to the east coast. We should be getting those fuels to the east coast as liquid diesel fuels. Our natural gas is easily convertible into liquid diesel which goes straight into diesel engines as they stand without any modification. Whatever the price of oil is-through $US25 a barrel-this is economically viable. Why aren't we doing it? Because the government is not giving sufficient encouragement to the oil companies to get on with it. has other plans for our gas-that is, shipping it off at bargain basement prices around the world without thinking about our future needs. What we need is an energy plan that takes into account our existing reserves, our future consumption needs and what we as a nation need in the future. (Time expired)",117
208,Mr HAYES,PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION,"The Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 shows that this government can actually achieve something when it puts its mind to it. With the bill before us today, the government has decided it is time to take some corrective action in the petrol retail market. It has decided that things cannot remain as they are. Sadly, I am not talking about the government taking action on petrol prices, but I will return to that a little later. The action is supported by the Labor But Party. We support the repeal of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act 1980 and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980. We do so in principle-Labor's second reading amendment is quite a welcome contribution to this debate because it does draw attention to the tardiness and the dragging of the feet exercise that has been pursued by this government in trying to address petrol retail reform. Despite the fact that the government has not rushed to deal with the issues facing the petrol retail industry, I do welcome the structures that the passage of this bill will allow to be put in place. It is important that, as we continue to see the march of the large supermarket chains as they purchase more and more businesses in more and more sectors of the retail industry, there should be some exercise undertaken by government to temper that approach. Those who are trying hard to compete against these massive organisations deserve a break. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism is It at the table, because I am speaking for her constituency in this regard. Like her-at least, I assume like her-I have a lot of small business people talking to me in the electorate, expressing concerns about situations where they believe they need relief against some of the marauding and loss-leading practices of large organisations that seek to manipulate markets that they currently operate in. Under the current petrol retailing arrangements, there are at least three classes of operators: the commissioned agents, the independents and the franchises. Discrimination in one form or another obviously exists between these classes. It is made more difficult because of the imposition of certain legislative requirements. One in particular is that at the moment we have a class of emerging retailers which are effectively regulation free. The acts that are being repealed as a result of the passage of this bill cover only part of the petrol retailing industry, with more than 50 per cent of the industry by volume not covered at all. Under the existing arrangements, the new force in petrol retailing-the large supermarket chains of Woolworths and Coles-are not covered at all. The proposed Oilcode will provide protections and regulation for the petrol retail sector and will cover entities that are regulation free at present. This has got to be an important improvement for all those small business people operating as petrol retailers. A petrol retailer in my electorate spoke to me only recently to ensure that I understood how this piece of legislation would affect him and his business. One of the things he wanted to emphasise was that things are very tough. As a franchise operator he does not get to set the price that he sells petrol for and the margins are, as he put it to me, extremely thin. Despite the fact that petrol is hovering around the $1.50 mark, his margin remains fixed, and it remains at cents per litre. He also spoke to me about the fear that he has about the unfair competition that takes place in the industry, and he hopes that the action of establishing the Oilcode will go some way to levelling the playing field in the petrol retailing industry. He, like others, finds it difficult to compete with the entrance of the new retailers owned by the large supermarket chains, with their ability to apply discount schemes. Another thing to bear in mind, as I said, is that those large organisations, those large supermarkets, largely operate, in terms of petrol retailing, in an unregulated market at present. For them to be able to come out and offer, for instance, up to 4c a litre off the price of petrol may not seem much, but, as this operator put it to me, when you consider the difference that makes for a family, that is something that must be taken into account. That is the thing that can actually decide whether he as a franchisee can stay in business or not. There is no doubt that, given the rapid changes in the petrol retailing industry over the last few years, the time has come to address the issue facing the industry and address the disparities and the discrimination between different classes of owners and operators within this industry. We know that the petrol retail industry is currently experiencing some significant restructures, with the number of service stations dropping from some 20,000 to around 7,000 over the last few years. This process is set to continue. Debate interrupted. NA",119
209,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Middle East",120
210,Mrs IRWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"On 12 July, at 9 am, a small force of Hezbollah fighters captured two Israeli soldiers, apparently on the Israeli side of the blue line designating the disputed border between Israel and Lebanon. The raid was accompanied by a Hezbollah rocket attack on Israeli targets. This attack was one of many violations of the blue line by both sides since the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. But, as the United Nations interim force reports, none of these incidents resulted in a military escalation, and those same reports show that Israeli military aircraft have violated the blue line on an almost daily basis. Two days after the attack, after Israeli aircraft had begun laying waste to Lebanon, Robert Fisk reported from Beirut: ... and prisoner swaps is probably all that will come of this. In January 2004 for example, Israel freed 436 Arab prisoners ... in return for an spy and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers. But this was not to be a measured response. What followed the Hezbollah attack has been an all-out aggressive war. Less than 12 hours after the incident, Israeli bombing of civilian targets began, and the killing and destruction has continued on a scale which has appalled the civilised world. But this was hardly a knee-jerk response. The San Francisco Chronicle reported: ... more than a year ago, a senior Israeli army officer began giving power point presentations, on an off the record basis setting out the plan ... The Washington Post says it was told by a senior Israeli official that the raid by Hezbollah provided Israel with a unique opportunity for wiping out the organisation, and, according to New Statesman, the US government knew in advance of Israel's intention to take action in Lebanon and the British government was also informed. So it should come as no surprise that, as the carnage in Lebanon proceeded, the leading nations of the Western world did nothing to stop the killing in and destruction of Lebanon. And even today their interests ignore the welfare of the people in Lebanon. After 28 days of war, the situation on the ground can only be described as a humanitarian disaster. Over 1,000 people have been killed, the great majority being civilians. Over one-third are children. With the destruction of homes, roads, bridges and power plants, the deliberate targeting of Red Cross and other relief agency facilities and vehicles, the targeting of fleeing civilians and the deliberate killing of UN observers, the result is a nation in ruins. Over one million people, a quarter of the population of Lebanon, have fled their homes. The Israeli blockade and the bombing of vehicles prevent the supply of food and medicines to those in need. But the Western world seems to have its own agenda when it comes to calling for Israeli peace. The US-French proposal demands the implementation of Security Council resolution 1559 of 2004 but says nothing of the 138 resolutions ignored by Israel, including resolutions 242 and 338, which declare the ‘inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war'. Indeed, Israel's presence in Lebanon today is in breach of resolution 1559. The Israelis also ignore the 16 July statement by the G8, which says: ... the root cause of the problems in the region is the absence of a comprehensive Middle East peace ... But what is needed right now is an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Israel must stop its bombing of Lebanon and Hezbollah must stop firing rockets into Israel. A just and lasting peace will only come from proposals such as that of the government of Lebanon which calls for not just the release of the two Israeli prisoners but the release of Lebanese prisoners as well. Critical to peace are the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces to the blue line and the earliest repatriation of those displaced by the conflict. International assistance will be desperately needed to rebuild Lebanon. But, to address the root cause of the conflict, a just peace will require the return of lands illegally occupied by Israel since 1967, including the Shebaa Farms. Cowper Electorate: Environment",120
211,Mr HARTSUYKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to use this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House an environmental crisis that threatens to slowly engulf the town of Coramba, which is in my electorate. This crisis has been developing since January 2002, when one resident of the town, Peter Attwill, noticed traces of petrol on his property in pools of water near the Orara River. The petrol did not originate from Mr Attwill's land. But, more than four years later, Mr Attwill, his wife, Belinda, his three young children are still facing the effects of the contamination. They have to cope on a daily basis with their fears of a threat to their health. Their house, which they built some 20 years ago, and their land cannot be sold. All that, you might think, is bad enough. But, as I will explain in due course, the Attwills are having to carry an extra burden in this matter, the consequences of which may well affect a large part of Coramba as well as those living downstream from the town. As a result of Mr Attwill's discovery, shortly afterwards investigations at the local petrol station revealed that an estimated 3,000 litres of unleaded petrol had escaped from an underground storage tank, though no explanation has been provided of how a leak of this size went undetected-and neither have investigations taken place to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that the petrol station was, in fact, the source of contamination. Though it clearly seems likely, I am that there are other potential sources of tamination. Because of the lie of the land, it is possible that the petrol that leaked from the service station, if that is the source, seeped not only onto Mr Attwill's land but also in other directions and into other properties without yet surfacing. This has not yet been established or ruled out. That also applies to the other potential sources of pollution. To sum up, the residents of Coramba do not know how much of their town is, or will be, polluted. If they do not know the source of the pollution with certainty, they do not know whether petrol continues to leak into the ground. They do not know for how much longer or how much further the existing pollution is likely to spread. I have been informed that people in the town of Coramba can no longer sell their properties. Their houses have been blighted. No-one knows and the consequences for the communities downstream that draw drinking water from the Orara River. No-one knows the consequences for the livestock owners whose cattle drink from the river. Despite being informed of the situation back in January 2002 when Mr Attwill first found petrol on his land, the NSW Environment Protection Authority, now absorbed into the NSW Department of Environment and Conservation, has done little to resolve any of the outstanding issues I have mentioned. The burden of managing this situation currently lies with Mr Attwill himself, following the decision by the department of environment to set up a trust fund managed by Mr Attwill to pay for investigations by consultants. The consultants will present their report soon. So here we have a man whose property has been polluted through no fault of his own, who is under considerable stress and whose family is under considerable stress, being asked to set up and supertold vise a technical study by consultants in an con- area in which he has no expertise whatsoever. Ironically, Mr Attwill is a petrochemical tanker driver. But he is not a chemist. He has is not a geologist. He is not an engineer. He is not an ecologist. However, I am pleased to say that there are now some hopeful signs. According to the local newspaper, the department will address the problem once the findings of the report currently under way are known. If this is indeed the case, I welcome the department's good intentions. Mr Attwill tells me that there is little hope of redress from the owners of the service station or their insurers if the station is indeed proved to be the sole source of the pollution. What Mr Attwill and the other residents of Coramba desperately need to know, after four years of uncertainty, is the full extent of the pollution and that relevant agencies will remove the risk to their health and properties. As I say, I am encouraged by media reports that the department is inclined to act. I have written to the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage bringing this matter to his attention and asking him to offer what assistance he can to the residents of Coramba-despite the fact that this is clearly a state issue. In the meantime, Mr Attwill, his family and his neighbours will be awaiting the consultants' report with some trepidation. Millennium Development Goals",121
212,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, this evening I will talk about the UN Millenium Development Goals. In doing so I note that Australia this year will host the G20 gathering of finance ministers in Melbourne in the very near future. This group was established in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis to bring together industrialised economies and emerging economies to discuss the global economy. Debt and poverty reduction are among key issues that are part of this ongoing dialogue. Given this, it is timely to raise with this House the importance of the 2015 millennium goals. These goals include: halving extreme poverty; universal primary education; gender equality; the reduction of child mortality, AIDS and other diseases; improved maternal health; and environmental sustainability. I believe these goals must be recognised as more than an aspiration. They are a promise from rich nations such as Australia to the poor. With increasing wealth worldwide but growing inequality, it is more important than ever for parliamentarians across the world to confront these issues both in our own backyards-and, unfortunately, in our own Indigenous communities-and across borders. These international goals mirror aspirations the we have for our community, particularly the Aboriginal communities that currently live in Third World conditions. I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's undertaking just a week ago that as Prime Minister of Australia he would do something about Aboriginal health. To push the achievement of these goals the Make Poverty History campaign was launched across the world in 2005. It has had widespread impact in raising awareness of the need for poverty reduction. Next door to my electorate of Batman, VCE student Mervin Ng, from Parade College in Bundoora, took his own initiative recently in support of this campaign. I commend his leadership. He collected 1,500 signatures from students and staff on a 13-metre banner which was recently tabled by my colleague, the Member for Scullin, Harry Jenkins. Thankfully, as witnessed by these actions, the next generation of Australians has a rising awareness of increasing inequality, and they are to be commended. The attainment of these goals would have a dramatic impact on poverty reduction, and it is well within the power of the leadership in Australia to grasp this opportunity. To have poverty in less than 10 years, signatories are obliged to increase their aid budgets. While increases under the aid white paper are welcome-from the present 0.28 per cent of gross national income to 0.36 per cent by 2010-the Labor Party believes Australia's contribution can be greater. Britain, France, Spain and Ireland have increased their aid commitments to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2010. Of the 22 OECD donor nations, five already equal or exceed the 0.7 per cent target-namely, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Six others have indicated they will reach the 0.7 per cent target in the next few years. They are Belgium, Finland, Spain, France, the UK and Germany. That is what leadership is about. In addition, the EU has recently committed to collectively reaching a target of 0.56 per cent of GNI by 2010 and 0.7 per cent by 2015. I say therefore to the Australian community at large that as a nation we can, and should, increase our target. It is our joint sponsibility, our collective responsibility. As the 2005 United Nations report into the millennium goals stated: ... we have the means at hand to ensure that nearly every country can make good on the promises of the Goals. Australia can also, therefore, make a contribution to this campaign by ensuring that debt forgiveness does not retract from the all important aid programs in health and education. We can also take a leadership role, as we did with the Cairns Group, to push for the removal of agricultural subsidies through the World Trade Organisation. As we head towards these critical deadlines, we need a greater commitment to move beyond political rhetoric and make these goals a reality. I simply say in conclusion: where there is a will, there is a capacity to actually do something. That is the challenge to the Howard government and the leadership role it adopts in hosting the G20 gathering of finance ministers in Melbourne this year. Would it not be wonderful in the lead-up to that conference if we made an announcement as a nation that we were going to up our contribution and do something of substance in our own backyard and internationally for the general good of all people on this earth? I commend the Millennium Development Goals to the Australian community. Stirling Electorate: Local Government Boundaries",123
213,Mr KEENAN,ADJOURNMENT,"My seat is totally contained within one local government authority: the City of Stirling. Stirling's neighbouring local government authority, the Town of Vincent, has put forward a proposal to the local government advisory board-which is the state government body that advises it on local council boundaries-to incorporate areas that are an integral part of the City of Stirling. I am totally reagainst this ill-conceived land grab, and I am greatly concerned that it will have negative consequences for my constituents. I am concerned for two reasons: firstly, for the small number of electors that I represent within the affected areas and, secondly, for the vast bulk of the people who reside within the City of Stirling, who still have a legitimate voice in this debate even though they are not directly involved in this land grab. The people affected, in all likelihood, will end up paying higher rates for a lower level of services than they would expect under the City of Stirling. These families that I represent in the suburb of Coolbinia will be transferred to a local authority that does not enjoy the obvious economies of scale that they currently have within the City of Stirling. The Town of Vincent, even if this land grab is successful, is below the optimum size for the economic provision of services, and it has admitted as much. It also has a very questionable management record. It is worth mentioning that the City of Stirling, under the leadership by the current mayor, Terry Tyzack, of a hard working, dedicated team, is in a very strong economic position. The same cannot be said for the Town of Vincent. I recently asked the Mayor of Vincent, Councillor Nick Catania, to answer this question: ‘Why continue to waste Western Australian taxpayers' money on board deliberations to investigate a proposal that goes against the wishes of local residents and will push unnecessary costs onto my constituents?' He wrote back effectively saying that I should stick to my federal constituency matters and leave local government to its own processes. This pretty much accords with his standard operating procedure and that of the CEO of the Town of Vincent, a John Giorgi, when people question the merits of their land grab. Their only response is to attack anyone who dares question them and to unfairly attack the record of the City of Stirling. It is clear from this that they are completely and utterly unable to provide a positive case to support their proposal. I would like to say this to the mayor: it is my responsibility to ensure the economic security of the families in my electorate so they can plan for the future, and it is my responsibility to listen to their concerns and act on them. It is my job to support my local community, and I will not ignore their concerns against this ill-conceived plan of the Town of Vincent. I have looked very closely at the submission provided by Vincent, and there appears to be no tangible benefit that justifies the $1 million price tag of making this change. That is an extraordinarily large bill that will most certainly be pushed onto ratepayers in the Town of Vincent, including those families that might be removed from the City of Stirling. The views of the residents of the City of Stirling outside of the affected areas also deserve to be heard, because, if they lose a substantial part of the existing council, that will obviously put upward pressure on their rates also. The loss of this significant ultimately going to mean that the City of Stirling will need to make a decision to either up rates or sack part of its workforce, something that I certainly do not want to see. I know that people in my electorate feel passionately about this issue because they have contacted me about it and I have been to a public meeting that the local government authority has had, where the overwhelming number of residents were opposed to making this change. I do not believe that the Town of Vincent has any option but to withdraw this illconceived proposal and find an alternative solution to its current lack of viability as a local authority. It might be more sensible for Vincent to seek to be incorporated into one of its neighbouring councils rather than limp along in its current state. It is certainly clear that there is no point in continuing to pursue its current plan against the interests of the people it purports to represent and against the interests of my constituents in the City of Stirling. Mr Gregory Andrews",124
214,Mr SNOWDON,ADJOURNMENT,"Lingiari) (4.49 pm)This afternoon I would like to address my remarks to a number of issues arising from questions which were raised in the parliament yesterday and today of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs regarding an employee of his department, Mr Gregory Andrews, who you will recall, Mr Speaker, appeared on the ABC's Lateline program on 21 June this year. You will understand that this Lateline program made a number of very serious allegations about paedophilia and child abuse and other issues related to the community of Mutitjulu. There were a number of people who were interviewed who spoke with full identification who did not substantiate the allegations made by Mr Andrews, and what area is they had to say was very plausible. However, Mr Andrews's evidence was heavily relied upon by the Lateline program. You will recall that he described himself anonymously as a former youth worker. He was not. It has turned out, of course, that he is a senior officer of the minister's department. He made inflammatory, sensational and totally unsubstantiated hearsay allegations about individuals within the community. He was the subject of questions in parliament yesterday and again today. But Mr Andrews is an assistant secretary in the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination and, in that role, provides advice to the minister. Lateline was aware of this when it interviewed Mr Andrews on 2 June and went ahead with the deception that he was an anonymous former youth worker. The ABC did not disclose Mr Andrews's absolute conflict of interest. That surely must be a breach of the ABC's editorial guidelines. We have been told by the minister that this deception was because Mr Andrews believed that he had been threatened. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that Minister Brough said yesterday in parliament: I was informed that Mr Andrews had decided that he would only appear anonymously as he already experienced a number of threats ... These apparent threats did not prevent Mr Andrews travelling to Mutitjulu on 6 June, a few days after he had undertaken the interview recorded by the ABC on 2 June. He travelled to that community freely, safely and without any police protection. It is clear that Mr Andrews's boss, the head of the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination, Mr Wayne Gibbons, and the minister were aware of his interview and the deception. Indeed, as I understand it, he was coached, counselled and advised by the minister's office, Mr Gibbons and other senior officers of the OIPC prior to the interview. Indeed, I am also advised that Mr Andrews's statement was legalled by his department. So now it is clear to me and many others that Mr Andrews's unfortunate appearance on Lateline was part of a governmentsponsored strategy. While he was in Central Australia, Mr Andrews was improperly seeking to secure access to criminal records of individuals and we know that Mr Gibbons was aware of this intention. I have here an email from Mr Greg Andrews to Mr Wayne Gibbons, dated Monday, 5 June 2006, timed at 2.50 pm and importance ‘High'. He says: I am currently on my way to Mutitjulu-plane has been diverted and delayed due to fog. I have been using the opportunity of the delay to talk to various stakeholders by phone. He says a number of other things and then he concludes by saying: A source in Central Australia has agreed to provide me with a physical copy of … official criminal record. If I am able to obtain this document, I will provide it to you immediately on my return. This raises very serious questions about the probity and propriety of Mr Andrews's visit, the knowledge of the minister and the minister's department about his activities and what had in fact he was doing in the community. I have previously raised these issues, and I have raised these concerns with the ABC. I call on the ABC to apologise to the Mutitjulu community for the deception and the allegations which have been made by Mr Andrews, which have been unsubstantiated, uncorroborated and are all hearsay. This sort of public administration should not be tolerated in this country. Minister Brough knows much more than he has told us so far. There is a lot more to go, and we will find out. Sir David Smith Australian History",125
215,Mrs MIRABELLA,ADJOURNMENT,"I had the good fortune yesterday of bumping into Sir David Smith, a former secretary to five successive Governors-General and the last Australian to be knighted by the Queen. It was his birthday yesterday: he turned 73 and did not a look a year over 55. He is a man of immense talent, with a brilliant mind and a keen eye for accurately recording history. Recently, Sir David penned a marvellous book, a very riveting read, titled Head of State. Few people have contributed more to the important constitutional and political history in Australia than Sir David Smith. His book goes a long way to dispelling the myth-making created by those who wanted to set their own agenda and rewrite history so that any depiction of the 1975 dismissal venerates Gough Whitlam on an eternal pedestal. In his book, Sir David Smith says: As for Gough Whitlam himself, there has grown up around him almost an entire industry devoted to polishing his image and turning him into a legend in his own lifetime. It is time we had a look at the basis of that legendary image. One of the greatest crimes that we can commit in a civilised society is to twist and distort history so that a lie is passed on to future generations. It is this issue that is the rationboring ale behind the groundbreaking History Summit convened for next week here at Parliament House. I commend the Minister for Education, Science and Training on facing head-on the need for a ‘root and branch renewal', as the Prime Minister put it, of teaching Australian history in our schools. But, whilst the summit sounds good and some may even feel quite warm and fuzzy about it, it is highly imperative that we get it right, just for us but for future generations. Recently, I inaugurated an essay-writing competition for school students in the leadup to the 40th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Whilst there have already been some excellent entries from local school students, I was informed that a teacher at Wangaratta High School in my electorate belittled the concept, preferring not to engage their students in discovering more about a highly important military battle that illustrated the ingenuity, the skill and the courage of our soldiers in a relatively modern battle. It is this type of prevailing orthodoxy of the teacher in question that gave rise to the dreadful treatment of Australian soldiers who fought in Vietnam upon their return to Australia in the 1960s. Another example is the landing place of Captain Cook at Kurnell Peninsula, recently placed on the national heritage register. In the monuments currently there, very little is told of the significance of the moment when Lieutenant James Cook and his crew, including Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, first set foot on Australian soil in 1770. Even so, one of the participants in next Wednesday's summit, Greg Melleuish, was commissioned to produce a paper that would be a discussion point starter. In it he talks about the sorts of things that students should learn, but he does say that the story of Australian explorers needs to be told ‘but not to excess, as I recall explorers as being the most part of Australian history when I was at school'. It is particularly disappointing that an associate professor from the University of Wollongong is so dismissive of our explorers. The pioneering spirit of Douglas Mawson, the scientific achievements of his expeditions and not least the sheer human endurance should be an inspiring and proud part of Australia's history. It is an integral part of the not perseverance, the tenacity and the sense of adventure that makes this country the sort of nation that we should all be proud of. I hope there will be others with very differing views at next week's summit. A great Australian, Professor Geoffrey Blainey, who paid me a great privilege in 2002 when he gave the inaugural Indi lecture in Beechworth in my electorate, put it best when, recently, he said: Australia is one of the oldest continuing democracies in the world, and I think the effective continuation of a democracy depends on the majority of Australians understanding a fair amount about their nation and its background. Professor Blainey needs to be heard, unlike his time at the University of Melbourne where he was hounded from his position by the left-leaning intelligentsia. I close by wishing Sir David Smith a belated 73rd birthday and wish all of those participating in next week's summit all the courage to be honest and not to give into sectional interest groups.
