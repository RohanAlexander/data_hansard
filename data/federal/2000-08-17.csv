We are therefore This bill contains a measure that seeks to benefit may be available to include in-home would like to make a number of points. The additional not compensate for the funding cuts to child I note that Senator Newman, in all the media there have been no child-care cuts under this show that child care has been cut by this government crisis in the affordability of child care and welfare recipients attempting to move from welfare to work. So, while the government is desperate to for child care, that is simply not the case. As totalling some $850 million, and that has reduced services have responded to the fall in subsidies So there are real problems in child care, and that they have no history of savage cuts in Australian community. The government has not explained why completion of its child-care pilots and before family day care. The government is yet to explain to be provided to single or very small groups to in-service care with much larger, and therefore flexible care subject to quality controls, but developing this program, and the government to date, has certainly been missing from this cuts it has made to child care generally. While some parents, it is simply a drop in the ocean care in this country. The inclusion of measures in this bill relating an opportunity to discuss the government's payments. This approach is now completely ignoring tax evaders at the big end of town and is a signature policy of a government that is the weak. The government's family payments income to the exact dollar. If they are wrong-that just $1-a debt will be raised by this government. Prior to 1 July, there was a margin of error fluctuations in family income that come from asked to work more hours than usual. But now family policy is a reality. That is why the zero Thursday, 17 August 2000 government argued that a more modest version of to the children of families with significant opposition to a proposal that would only during the debate on the Youth Allowance their rationale for this measure, which ones as well. The inclusion of a business assets to the budget and, arguably-according to the to those who might be truly asset rich but reserving our position on this measure. extend child-care services, for which child-care care. While we will be supporting this measure, I funding contained in this measure does care implemented by the government since 1996. last night and today, is perpetrating the lie that government. Peter Costello's budget papers to the tune of $850 million, leading to a putting substantial barriers in the way of many give the impression that it is increasing funding I said, there have been savage cuts to child care flexibility in the child-care system, as some by restricting their opening hours and so on. this government cannot get away with the fiction this area; they do, and that is well known in the it has introduced in-home care before the the commencement of quality accreditation for how this new care can be affordable if it is of children at the same funding level that applies cheaper, groups. Of course, Labor supports we think that a lot more work needs to be done in needs to show a great deal more heart-which, government-if it is to make up for the savage this measure will no doubt be beneficial for in addressing the lack of affordability of child to families and to fraud control also provides approach to the administration of family one of bludgeoning average families, while other malicious social security fraud.

This measure is going to come to regret, because their offices, from people who are going to be hit by this have an impact on nearly every family receiving pick up genuine cases of fraud. The government's the millions of people receiving payments each The last half-yearly report showed that there total reviewed, there were 114,523 payment These, as I said before, are mostly due to income estimates by recipients or Centrelink set out to defraud the system.

The fact that only 0.1 per of fraud has not stopped the government that catches hard working families-and that policy. So the savings that the government claims paid off the back of honest families who simply is designed to deceive them or to catch them. rules to brand families as welfare rorters. The average debt raised by the government is struggling to buy milk. It is a hell of a lot of school excursions and so on. What is even is compulsory in cases where the mistake is to demand that the money be returned by the NA 19324 MAIN COMMITTEE family. This is a cold-hearted measure from very much distress across Australian families. This approach is matched by the government's unemployed.

For instance, the report picks common gateway for the assessment of the needs in Britain of social entrepreneurial projects, connections, building partnerships and support combining the best of social practice with a flair to the needs of disadvantaged communities. We had the Minister for Education, Training just two days ago saying, ‘Isn't this outrageous picking up some of the best initiatives in adoption of education action zones.' Well, bringing some of the best of international thinking new solutions in the Australian context? So that in education, he, for one, will be condemning MCClure report picks up initiatives in Britain-the need, and the programs that follow, and also The minister, Dr Kemp, stands condemned for The report also picks up Kim Beazley's attractiveness of the transition from welfare address the problem of high effective marginal reflected in the MCClure report to the Howard government. I am strongly supportive of the report's months ago I raised the issue of the blow-out some 600,000 Australians have been placed my concern that the Howard government was using artificially lowering the unemployment rate, not show up on the jobless figures. This government that has led to this inquiry and recommending some serious and sensible I believe there is a community expectation is, children going to high school-would be role model in the home, to value work and children know that their best future in life qualifications. There is a community expectation that single parents themselves believed that them. But it is important to understand that it Single parents need improved child-care arrangements cuts. They need transport assistance, particularly private car ownership might not necessarily be And they need training and skills programs recommendations for single parents are sound extension of mutual obligation. In the area of disability support pension, we should treat mildly disabled Australians that says, ‘Don't write these people off, don't Actually give them a chance to exercise their in our society. So don't emphasise disability; people have to work.'

We should back up 30 years of rhetoric stick them into passive, underfunded programs. capacities to gain work, to be useful participants emphasise the capacity that mildly disabled that mutual obligation be extended, through NA 19342 MAIN COMMITTEE pilot schemes, to this area. I think that is disabled people has been a bit hollow because programs, has not backed it up with rehabilitation Werriwa there are several fine providers of are only able to cover a drop in the ocean in disabled Australians back into MCClure also broadens the concept of mutual government. He is saying there should be a policy of ‘all shoulders to the wheel'; that organisations and corporate Australia need opportunities for disadvantaged people. I have often raised in the House the fact that each year in industry assistance, sometimes called obligation seriously, they have a responsibility job opportunities for disadvantaged Australians. an acute need. Some nations have a scheme needs to employ disabled people as a certain that proportion, they have to pay funds to government and support programs for the disabled. If the Howard government is serious about should introduce those programs in this government needs to do more, communities more, but businesses also need to do more to poverty and social exclusion. This needs to be to impose mutual obligation on corporate worthwhile job opportunities for These are big issues that also have a philosophic about the meaning of mutual obligation. I heard this debate in Melbourne by making a few remarks made me think very seriously about how these women have the right to work and governments in its own right. She also said that all welfare right to stay at home and governments I think this demonstrates that a rights-only social responsibilities, starts to run into itself. to work and governments should support that, home and governments should support that as in the end does not make a lot of sense in the worthwhile if they are matched by the responsibilities agenda is actually quite a libertarian agenda. individuals only-individuals without a social society. I reject the rights-only agenda. I do not Labor Party has been about for 100 years is to matched by social responsibilities, because responsibilities that we end up with a cohesive with each other, feeling morally obliged to do Thursday, 17 August 2000 right.

What we should be saying is that need to do more, welfare recipients need to do help Australians to end the curse of long-term a policy of all shoulders to the wheel. We need Australia to make sure that they are providing the most disadvantaged in our society. underpinning. There is a bigger debate the former Victorian Premier Joan Kirner join a fortnight ago.

So matter. It must be rights matched by social communitarian view of society. It is not a sort on steroids. I support the extension of mutual obligation government taking its recommendations seriously. government spending that matters, it is the quality, end the curse of long-term poverty. We government alone is responsible for these problems. the curse of social exclusion.

We have to go beyond that response to poverty, and the MCClure report said, it is not so much the size of government whole-of-community effort. I am always reminded of the debate that Thatcher government. They used to say, ‘You government was doing what the Howard government welfare programs. Spending was going up, because like the disability support pension as a way The truth is that, under this Howard government, wrong sort of spending. It is passive spending, of getting training and job placement. In a political sense, if you are on the left this government for putting people into passive Australians-for example, 600,000 on disability politics and you want value for money in government as well, because they are spending and long-term unemployment are actually going up.

That is a socially cohesive or of left wing, libertarian agenda-libertarianism under this report, and I look forward to the But, in the end, it is not so much the size of and it is the whole-of-community effort to often have a view in the public debate that Government alone is not responsible for for all Australians, and we are all responsible. working in community organisations, or just plain we have all got to do a lot more.

As I spending but the quality of the programs and the the British Labour Party used to have with the are cutting programs.' In fact, the Thatcher is doing here: blowing out passive they were shoving people on to programs of driving down the official unemployment rate. welfare spending is going up. But it is the putting people onto programs without a chance of politics and you want results, you will condemn areas and disenfranchising a whole group of support pensions. If you are on the right of the welfare dollar, you will condemn this more and yet we know that long-term poverty disturbing statistics about the number of young work.

This not getting results and value for money in the I also support his emphasis on of Werriwa, in the poorer suburbs, the public because 90 per cent of the income comes from income in these suburbs comes from the public private sector.

I might say, firstly, that I am following in his general philosophical approach to these need to have an approach which goes beyond issues. I have had occasion to commend the along those lines. I do not always come to needs to be done as he does, but that is something some focus on the general goals, vision and In that regard, obviously I, like others, welcome national debate on these questions. I hope that issues and that we will not be subjected to politics. Having said all that, I want to make a comment shadow minister made some very important happening. I was a bit surprised that there understand it, in relation to the bill and that the House but, rather, came up here in the Main issue of enormous importance, and I believe Earlier this week, I had occasion to move bill concerning education. I want to make it perfectly to be moving consideration in detail stage amendments are inadequate.

Rather than challenging the process in this move consideration in detail stage amendments, other Independent, who has also, on occasions, legislation of this kind. I notice the Minister Maybe he can answer some questions when about the impact on people of some provisions of the bill. Is the minister in a position to tell us students? It appears that the bill gets rid dependent spouse allowance. It is not clear mistaken in this; even the Parliamentary Library the minister or his advisers could sort it out. the Abstudy student is not working-if the spouse for any kind of support from the government?

I will also the member for Werriwa, who is always interesting matters. Let me say that I also agree that we the individual and deals with communitarian member for Werriwa for thinking about things the same policy conclusions in relation to what else. I think it is good that we should have philosophy that we have in these areas of policy. the MCClure report as, I hope, stimulating we will have a genuine national debate on these some kind of pseudo debate, as often happens in about process in relation to this bill. The comments, I thought, in relation to what is was no second reading amendment, as far as I the bill did not come up in the main chamber of Committee. It is quite clear that this is an it should have come up in the main chamber. a consideration in detail stage amendment to a clear that, as an Independent, I am going to these bills when I consider that they to do so in relation to this particular bill, Library only a very short time ago. I information in relation to the background particular case, I give notice that I intend to perhaps with the support of Mr Andren, the had second reading amendments in relation to for Community Services is in the chamber. he completes the debate. I am a bit confused what is going to happen to the spouses of Abstudy of certain provisions that provided them with the what is going to be available for them. I may be is having difficulty sorting this out. Perhaps If an Abstudy student has a spouse-obviously is not working will the spouse be eligible If so, what kind of support? That is one issue.

It assumes that the Aboriginal a disadvantaged situation in relation to education, principle of fairness, Minister, to give some Commonwealth provisions for people of indigenous Strait Islander people. I do not see why we as well say that we do not really need Abstudy Austudy. What happened to the point that the severely disadvantaged in terms of educational that in terms of the provisions for them?

I noticed that the minister's new scheme is right. But, as the member of Werriwa was referring distribution of private providers is equitable more private providers in rich areas than Thursday, 17 August 2000 eligible for parenting allowance. How will that allowance in terms of the actual income that answer to that question. If they do not have at all in relation to this matter? Austudy identical in terms of benefits. I do and Torres Strait Islander people are not in which they are. It is not unfair, going to the specific provision, as we do in other areas of background, to Aboriginal and Torres have got rid of the Abstudy provisions. We might because we are going to give them the same as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are opportunities? What are we going to do about may have the unintended consequence of people from going into study. I believe that In fact, some of them may actually end up more take an example of an Aboriginal young person remote area. If this were a typical Australian, a in a remote area.

There is a need to consider support for people of Aboriginal and Torres an outcome. The outcome should be more of those to support themselves in the period when they these provisions of support. I do not like the from the minister in relation to what is to have been able to say that, if Aboriginal and be disadvantaged by these changes, it would have in this parliament to move an amendment at the that happening. That is how I feel about it. youth allowances. Those provisions are primarily allowances who are not studying and people see any problem with that. However, as far as minister made a number of important points We do have serious problems with child care in positions available, the affordability of child It is all very well to say to people, when that they should go out and work, but if they child care what are they going to do?
