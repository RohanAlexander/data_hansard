2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: National Health Scheme To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the proposed' free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost many citizens more, particularly single people and working wives. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalisation of health services which will lead to impersonalised and mediocre standards of medical care, the creation of a huge new bureaucracy, and will hmit the citizen's freedom of choice. That the present health scheme can be amended to overcome existing deficiencies, and that the proposed scheme is totally unnecessary. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the existing health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Dawkins. Petition received. National Health Scheme To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the proposed 'free' national health scheme is not free at all and will cost four out of five Australians more than present scheme. That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a further erosion of the civil Liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and single persons. That the proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ultimately remove an individual's right to choose his/her own doctor. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the basic principles of the exisung health scheme which functions efficiently and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr MCLeay. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Whereas the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and many European countries have not recognized the unlawful annexation of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviet Union, it has been announced from Moscow that the Australian Government is now recognizing them as part of the PETITIONS Soviet Union. We wish to point out that according to United Nation charter these States are entitled to independence and their peoples to self-determination and beg that such recognition be disallowed. And your peuuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Nicholls. Petition received. Baltic States To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Whilst all colonial powers except the Soviet Union have granted independence and self-determination to all their colonies and dominions, and whilst Australia is in the process of granting independence to Papua and New Guinea, and whilst all previous Australian Governments have refused to recognise the Soviet Union's right to the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, occupied following a secret agreement between Hitler and Stalin, the present Australian Government has now extended such recognition contrary to international law and moral principles. The undersigned petitioners humbly beg Parliament to condemn such an action and to reverse the Government's decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wilson. Petition received. Australian Capital Territory: Self Government To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned residents of the Australian Capital Territory respectfully showeth(1) That Australian citizens are already governed to an excessive extent, and to introduce machinery to provide selfthe government for the Australian Capital Tenitory would exacerbate this situation. (2) That the cost of providing self-government for the Australian Capital Territory will have to be borne by residents of the Australian Capital Territory, and that self government should not be instituted without consulting by means of a referendum those who will have to bear the cost. (3) That any provision of self-government would be meaningless unless it received popular support from the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, and the measure of the extent of this popular support could be best obtained by means of a referendum. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government not to proceed with the introduction of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory until the residents of the Australian Capital Territory are consulted, by means of a referendum, on the issue. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Baltic States by Mr Enderby. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia do humbly petition the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia that it might take such steps as may be necessary either to direct the Commonwealth Banking Corporauon to preserve and restore the Palace Hotel or itself acquire the said Palace Hotel St George's Terrace, Perth on its present site so as to preserve and restore it in perpetuity. Further we do humbly petition this honourable Parliament to make such funds as may be necessary available to purchase the entire contents of the said Hotel from the owners thereof. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bennett. Petition received. Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology which has catered for tertiary needs of Melbourne for nearly 100 years is still without any location where students can gather in a social context. That a properly constituted meeting of students supported the policy of the elected Students' Representative Council that Union Facilities should be tute. That the SRC formulated a Definitive Plan that is an acceptable constructive and reasonable amendment to the present planning schedule at the Institute. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House ask the Australian Commission on Advanced Education to consider in their 1976-78 Triennium Repon an allocation of funds to ensure the provision Melbourne Institute of Technology. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr King. Petition received. Universal Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that all Austrahans irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (ii) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus ensuring that citizens will no longer be logical strains because of inability to meet the high cost of medical treatment (iii) It is committed, in principle, towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost of health services should be based on people who derive the most financial benefit from our society should give the most for its support. Palace Hotel, Perth (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby allow dedicated members of the medical profession to return to the occupation of their choice-the care of the ill and the prevention of disease. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will hasten to introduce this much needed scheme so that health care services in Australia can begin to function equitably, efficiently, and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received. Taxation Deductions: Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That a fundamental principle of a fair taxation system is that any form of double taxation should be avoided; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the law be amended to allow tax-payers to deduct from income, for income tax purposes, all rates and taxes paid by them in respect of their primary home or land bought for the purpose of building thereon. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, the First priority of the Instiby Mr Wilson. Petition received. NA of Union Facilities at the Royal NA",18
3,Mr LYNCH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Does he recall telling the Parliament on 18 July that unemployment was insignificant and carefully under control? Does he recall stating 2 months later that inflation could be attacked without resorting to unemployment? I ask the honourable gentleman: How can he justify those statements when he was in receipt of omciai advice that unemployment would rise to 180,000, or over 3 per cent of the work force, as a result of Government policies? Will the honourable gentleman now be honest with the people and the Parliament and admit that unemployment is a weapon of this Government's economic policy? burdened with additional psycho",19
4,Dr JF CAIRNS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"In a question of this sort I do not tliink it is altogether appropriate to impute dishonesty to me or to anyone in this place. I do not suggest that it is a breach of the his or her capacity to pay-that Standing Orders but it is getting close to it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is basing his questions on newspaper reports, as was his Leader yesterday, and those newspaper reports do not happen to be accurate. Mr Lynch-That is what we are seeking to ascertain.",19
5,Dr JF CAIRNS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I am telling the honourable gendeman that they do not happen to be accurate. The posiuon is that unemployment can be a result of objecuve conditions. It can be a result of the way the economy operates, for a start, irrespective of what is Government policy. Much of the unemployment that has occurred so far is a result of objective conditions. It is the primary responsibility of the Government, one that we readily accept, to prevent objective conditions bringing about unemployment. Mr Lynch-Does that mean the system is wrong?",20
6,Dr JF CAIRNS,UNEMPLOYMENT,You have already asked one question but if you would like to ask another I am sure the Speaker will give you the opportunity.,20
7,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting. I do not allow cross-examinations across the Table.,20
8,Dr JF CAIRNS,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is the pohcy of the Government to use measures, including the Budmatters get, to prevent unemployment and to ensure that it is kept to a minimum. That remains the policy of the Government. It has not changed and, my opinion, we can succeed in keeping unementerprise ployment to a minimum. At no time yesterday my Press conference did I suggest that any figure of unemployment that had been referred to the Government or any that had been used by me had been said to be the level of unemployment that would result from Government policy. At stage was that said. When an economy such as travelling our own reaches a peak in an inflationary boom-the 1973 peak was very high-the objecbut tive conditions are likely to produce unemployWill ment. It is the responsibility of any government to keep that unemployment to a minimum. That is the position the Government takes. NA NA",20
9,Mr KERIN,ORGANISATIONS,"I address a question to the Acting Prime Minister and refer to an article in the rent issue of the 'National Times' wherein it leged that Australian security organisations over some of the operations of the Central Intelligence Agency in Cambodia with the aim de-stabilising the Government there in much same way as the Government of Chile was recently de-stabilised. As the Australian Government now has an mquiry under way into our intelligence services-the inquiry is being held in camera-wha t assurances can be given to the public to establish that our intelligence services will in future act in Austraha's interests and with the awareness of the Government, as quite clearly the previous Government knew nothing of their alleged activities in Cambodia?",20
10,Dr JF CAIRNS,ORGANISATIONS,"It is the practice of this Government, as it has been of all previous governments, not to give information about specific aspects of security. We maintain that position as did our predecessors. A comprehensive inquiry is being conducted by a very competent commissioner, Mr Justice Hope, into the security operations of Australian security organisations. It is expected that that inquiry will cover all aspects, including any possible operations of Australian security organisations outside Australia. I am not going to pre-empt that inquiry nor make any statement until the Government has a report from Mr Justice Hope. PARLIAMENTARIANS: WORKERS NA",20
11,Mr JARMAN,COMPENSATION,"Is the Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in relating to the Public Service aware of the statement by the son of the late Sir Arthur Rylah, formerly Deputy Premier of Victoria, in that, had his father been employed in private or been a public servant rather than a in parliamentarian, Sir Arthur's widow would have been entitled to workers compensation for his death? Is it a fact that if a parliamentarian and a public servant, the salaries of both of whom are paid by the Australian Government, are killed of no incapacitated in the same car in which they are in the course of their duties, the public servant would qualify for workers compensation the parliamentarian or his widow would not? the Minister bring this matter before the Government for consideration so that parliamentarians are treated on a basis comparable to public servants and those employed by private enterprise?",20
12,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMPENSATION,"It is true that members of Parliament have no statutory right to workers compensation and accordingly if we curexamined the example the honourable member is almentioned we would find that the member of took Parhament would not be entitled to receive any compensation nor would anything be paid to his of widow. However I believe the practice has been the to make an ex gratia payment. That has no more weight than the fact that it is ex gratia. The real point of the honourable member's question relates to why members of Parliament should be deprived of having any statutory right. I understand that this matter has been the subject of discussion in previous Cabinets. I know that my colleague, the Minister for Social Security, also was interested in raising this matter. I am not trying to pre-empt any attitude the Opposition might take to a Bill which will be introduced today entitled the National Compensation Bill 1974, in which specific provision is made for members of Parliament to be included in the compensation provisions of that Bill. So I would trust that the Opposition certainly would not oppose that part of the Bill. The other factor is that the provisions of that vided. Bill are not likely to be implemented for some period. There has to be sometimefor people to have a look at the legislation. It follows that perhaps something should be done quickly to ensure that there are some statutory rights for members of Parliament. The present position, think, is that an ex-gratia payment on the death of a member would be limited to $14,500. matter of interest to the honourable member, the New South Wales Parliament, for example, members have taken out cover with their own insurance company to provide for a compensathat tion payment of a minimum of $40,000. They have made a proper use of the insurance faciUties of that State. It seems that we are in the position here of either trying to find some insurance cover for ourselves or having to alter the existing provide compensation for ourselves. I undertake to the honourable member that we will look at this matter as one of urgency to ensure that members of Parliament are no longer deprived the rights which are appUcable to other members of the community.

13,Mrs CHILD,AVTUR JET FUEL,"Will the Minister for Minerals and Energy inform the House whether any glad increase in suppUes of Avtur jet fuel is being taken by foreign international airlines at Austremely traUan international airports? If so, what are reasons?",21
14,Mr CONNOR,AVTUR JET FUEL,"The honourable member for Henty is correct in the import of her question. In fact, remarkable excess quantities being taken by international airUnes. The case in point that I have is that of Pan Am. One recent Pan Am flight picked up 11,000 gallons of Avtur for a flight from Sydney to Auckland, which would normally have taken 5,000 gaUons. We from time to time in my Department authorise the quantities of Avtur that are to be picked up by these airUnes. We receive monthly returns. It would appear on the present trend that some 250,000 gallons of Avtur are being taken up each month in excess of proper requirements. It is a matter which we have raised with those concerned and it is a matter which we will pursue. The motivation for this action by the international airUnes is a simple one. They pay less than half in Australia for Avtur than they would pay for Avtur for, say, trans-Atlantic flights. They have every incentive Uterally to stuff themselves with Avtur in Australia and to abuse our trust and confidence in them. There is a long standing arrangement amongst the various international airUnes as to the quantity which ought to be provided and the terms on which it is proNA",21
15,Mr HUNT,ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. In view of the Prime MinI ister's recorded statement from New York yesterday, as broadcast on the Australian BroadAs a casting Commission program ' AM ' , that in Australia has the potential to supply the world with greater quantities of food, and his recognition that enormous capital will be required for purpose, will the Government review its rural poUcies? WUl the Government review its elimination and partial elimination of a number of taxation and capital investment incentives that were removed from rural industries in the 1973 Act to Budget, following the Coombs report? Does he agree that investment incentives to the Australian rural industry are a means of encouraging the private capital investment necessary to meet the Prime Minister's global aspirations, enabling Australian farmers to increase agricultural production to help minimise an impending world famine?",21
16,Dr JF CAIRNS,ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY,I am aware of the Prime Minister's recorded statements and I am very that he made those statements in the world scene in the United States. I think they are eximportant. They indicate that the Prime the Minister of this country is conscious of the tremendous role that this country can play in the production of foodstuffs.,21
17,Dr FORBES,ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY,Then why do you not give incenof Avtur are tives to do so?,21
18,Dr JF CAIRNS,ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY,"The honourable member already has had too much incentive, even at this hour of the day. He is terribly keen. I do not suppose anyone interjects more regularly than he does. The Government is conscious of this enormous opportunity for the production of food in this country. The honourable member who asked the quesuon will know that we have had an mquiry into primary industry and that a Green Paper has been published. I think that Green Paper provides an excellent basis for the development of pohcies. I assure the honourable member that the Government is concerned to develop policies, guided by that Green Paper. At the earliest possible opportunity those policies will be implemented. NA",21
19,Mr CROSS,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY IN,Is the Minister for Manufacturter ing Industry aware of the concern expressed as the future of the shipbuilding industry in Brisfrom bane and the role of Evans Deakin Industries Ltd in the industry? Can the Minister give an indication of the work available to Evans Deakin Industries Ltd and the efforts which the company has been making to sustain a viable shipbuilding industry in Brisbane?,22
20,Mr ENDERBY,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY IN,"I thank the honourable he member for the question. Concern has been other expressed for many years about the shipbuilding industry generally. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd has indicated to the Department that it certainly is determined to continue in shipbuilding and that shipbuilding will continue nuity of work for the company. At present Evans Deakin is actively seeking future work and is being selective in that regard. The company cendy has handed over the tanker 'Robert Miller' to the Australian Government, which in turn has handed it over to R. W. Miller and Co. Pty Ltd. Evans Deakin is to complete the vessel for the MUler company, with the exception of painting work. Evans Deakin is closely involved with the contractor during the painting. This work is expected to be completed by Christmas. The company is building the Santa mersible oil drillingrig,which will be completed by about February 1975. The company also building 3 large barges which, I understand, also will be completed by January 1975. In addition, the company is pursuing the usual commercial avenues and ventures. It may be of some interest to honourable members if I mention in this context that the shipbuilding industry is extremely well subsidised by the Australian Government. For example, during the last 5 years Evans Deakin received approximately $ 14.4m in subsidies from the Australian Government and during last 10 years it received the sum of approximafor tely $20.6m. In the industry generally, the level of activity is very satisfactory. For example, vessels are on order or under construction, compared with about 39 in December 1972. There are 35 vessels out for tender, compared with seven in December 1972. My understanding is that in the last nnancial year about $30m in aU was paid to the industry in subsidies. NA",22
21,Mr LUSHER,HIGHWAYS,"I draw the attention of the Minister for Transport to the almost dauy occurrence of serious and fatal accidents on the Hume Highway, the Barton Highway and other highBRISBANE ways in southern New South Wales. Is the Minisaware that these accidents have been caused to by the appalUng condition of the roads resulting incessant rains this year and serious flooding of the Murrumbidgee and otherrivers?Has the Minister been advised of the avaUabUity of a hot-mix process which enables the laying of a 5-inch surface over a 22-foot road at a rate of 2,000 tons a day, covering 100 nules over a period of 6 months? Now that the Minister has assumed responsibUity for national highways is prepared to investigate this process or any process to enable an immediate start to be made on the resurfacing of the Hume Highway in the affected areas? WUl he support the payment of grants to New South Wales for the restoration of other affected highways in southern to provide contiNew South Wales?",22
22,Mr CHARLES JONES,HIGHWAYS,"I appreciate the conrecern of the honourable member for Hume at the state of the Hume Highway. Like him I want to see the road repaired as quickly as possible. On the matter of the paving process developed by, I think, Blue Metal and Gravel Ltd, and called the Bitupave, already the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the President of the Senate, Senator O'Byrne, have spoken to me about it. I have indicated to them that if the company conFe semi-subcerned is prepared to Mr Katter-What is this, a commercial? The is honourable member for Eden-Monaro and",22
23,Mr CHARLES JONES,HIGHWAYS,Do you want to answer the question? You used to make a hell of a mess of answers yourself.,22
24,Mr SPEAKER,HIGHWAYS,Order! Interjections will cease.,22
25,Mr CHARLES JONES,HIGHWAYS,"As I said, I have already indicated to Senator O'Byrne and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that I am prepared to look into the matter and I can give the the same assurance to the honourable member Hume. I am prepared to receive a submission from the company and talk to representatives if 71 need be, about how the process can be used to improve the surface of that monstrosity of a road called the Hume Highway, between Goulburn and Albury. As to the restorauon of the surface of the Hume Highway and adjoining roads, I understand that because they were affected by flood damage the Prime Minister has indicated that he is prepared to confer with the State Government with a view to restoring the roads as a flood restoration project. I do not know what has been done at a State level. The Australian Government has indicated that it is prepared to accept responsibility for major roads throughout Australia under the National Highways Act. We had a meeting last Monday week with State roads commissioners and officers of the Department of Transport to work out a program to handle national highways, road grants, and research. We left them with our ideas. They are to come back to us with an agenda of their choosing on a date of their choosing so that we can have further discussions as to when we will declare the roads national highways, how work will be carried out and how programs are to be interchanged. In the meantime we have indicated to them that they should continue with the works which they have in hand, with the exception, ofcourse, of expressways such as the north west distributor in Sydney, which we are not prepared to go ahead with. On the matter of programs, we would like to have programs from them by 1 January next year. That gives them a matter of some 3 months to prepare their programs. We can then start working together on them. That gives the whole program of highways in this transition period. But I am still prepared to arrange and to take part in discussions on the reconstruction of the Hume Highway. But at this stage it has not been declared a national highway. However, we are still prepared to talk about it. NA",22
26,Mr FULTON,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,"Is the Minister for Northern Development aware of the substantial increases in the world price of nitrogen fertilisers and the growing difficulty of many developing countries to maintain levels of sugar and cereal crop productivity? What steps are being taken to ensure that sufficient supphes of nitrogen fertilisers are available to the sugar industry, the main user of nitrogen fertilisers in Australia?",23
27,Dr PATTERSON,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,"I appreciate the concern expressed by the honourable member for Leichhardt about the supply of nitrogen and for that matter other fertilisers to the sugar industry and other industries. I also share this concern cause the trend today in the world is for there to be not only shortages of some types of fertilisers but very substantial increases in the price of essential fertilisers largely due to the increases in fuel prices. It would seem to me from an examination of the nitrogenous fertiliser situation in Australia that there is plenty of capacity to produce nitrogen here because the main basis of nitrogenous fertiliser is ammonia which is manufactured from reforming natural gas naphtha, or refinery gases.. Two investigations are being carried out at present by the Industries Assistance Commission. One relates to the bounty on the manufacture of nitrogen. The other, which is perhaps the more important, relates to an investigation into the subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers-that is the subsidy which enables nitrogenous fertilisers to be made avaUable to primary producers at the lowest possible prices. I believe that my views in respect of fertilisers are well known in this Parliament.",23
28,Mr ANTHONY,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,What are they? What about super?,23
29,Dr PATTERSON,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,I might say that they are also well known to the Cabinet. I do not think that the Leader of the Country Party ought to be too cocky; he needs to remember that it was his Government that took off the bounty.,23
30,Mr ANTHONY,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,We put it back.,23
31,Mr SPEAKER,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,Order! The Minister will resume his seat. The Chair will not tolerate incessant interjections coming from the Leader of the Country Party each day. When any Minister is answering a question the Leader of the Country Party is firing interjections across the Table. The Chair will not tolerate it. I ask the right honourable gentleman to contain himself. Mr Robinson-We want only the truth. That is aU.,23
32,Dr PATTERSON,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,"I will give you the truth. It was the right honourable gentleman's Government that took off the bounty on the manufacture of nitrogen. That Government did this in 1970. It was the right honourable gentleman's Government that also took off the subsidy on superphosphate in the 1950s. Yes, it restored the subsidy but it also took it off. That is a fact. The question asked by the honourable member for Leichhardt is a serious one because there is no question that fertiliser is the life blood of Australian agriculture. Nitrogen, phosphate and potassium are the main elements but there are also rninor elements. The application of be- phosphates in southern Australia has revolutionised agriculture there. This has been achieved by superphosphate, and subterranean clover which in turn manufactures nitrogen through nodulation. In recent years the legume, Townsville lucerne, together with phosphate is revolutionising pastures in northern Australia. Although the sugar industry is the main industry using nitrogen, honourable members may not be aware that in recent years something like 70 per cent of nitrogen utilisation is in industries other than that industry. It is being used in the wheat industry, on pastures and on other industrial crops. Therefore nitrogen is essential for Austrahan agriculture in the future. Mr Robinson-And super is not?",23
33,Dr PATTERSON,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,"I said that phosphate, trogen and potassium are essential to the Ufe blood of Australian agriculture. Any action by State or Federal governments of whatever pohti Sir. cal colour they might be or by individuals that will allow the continuous rurining down of soU fertility can only be regarded as irresponsible. Opposition members-Hear , hear!",24
34,Mr SPEAKER,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,Order! I ask the Minister to for address the Chair and to be as brief as possible his answer.,24
35,Dr PATTERSON,NITROGEN FERTILISERS,"As regards nitrogenous that, fertiliser suppUes, the Government is taking every action to ensure that nitrogen is avaUable to aU of Australia in sumcient suppUes and, course, at reasonable prices. On behalf of the poUciesGovernment, I can assure the Opposition that this action will continue. NA",24
36,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"My question is directed to tion. the Acting Prime Minister. He will know that during the course of the last few days the Reserve Bank of Australia has issued a suphim plement to the monthly statistical bulletin which it points out that, no matter what desmall finition is used-the more restricted one relating to not only cash in hand but also current deposits with the banks, or the more generous one of addition of deposits with the savings change in the money supply over the last",24

40,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"This is strictly my opinion; it is not set out in the statistical bulletin. I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to correct the position. In my view there has been a reduction in the base money supply on a seasonably adjusted basis of between 12 per cent and 13 per cent. Mr Martin- I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order is that the right honourable gentleman is deUberately abusing and disregarding your ruling in still giving information and not asking a question.",24
41,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Order! No point of order is involved. I ask the right honourable gentleman nito put his question as briefly as possible.,24

44,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"The Acting Prime Minister will know that, in the terms of normal monetary policies, a reduction of this kind is a prescription disaster. Will he therefore give consideration into, first of all, ensuring that maturing loansCommonwealth bonds-ar e paid off, that we do not enter the bond market for thetimebeing and in the international monetary field, we take off the 2 years and one day restriction on overseas loans and the residue of the variable deof posits requirement? Knowing that these",24

I have received comin plaints from both sides of the House about the number of questions being asked each day. If the right honourable member persists with his present attitude, even fewer questions will be the asked each day. I ask the right honourable banks-the gentleman to put his question.",24

57,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Order! The Minister for Labor and Immigration will resume his seat and the honourable member for Wannon will resume his seat. It seems to me that every time the right honourable member for Lowe asks a question he spends about 5 minutes prefacing it. I ask him to put his question immediately; otherwise he will have to resume his seat.,25
58,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I am putting it, Sir.",25
59,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Put it straight away; otherwise the right honourable member will have to resume his seat.,25
60,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I therefore ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will now, in view of the fact that these policies are totally inconsistent with the statement",25

63,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Will he now take up with Cabinet the proposal I now put that the present policies before the House be withdrawn and that policies consistent with the Liberal Party are policies which he strongly confirmed on 'Federal File' on Sunday night?,25
64,Dr JF CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I think the right honourable member may be the most distinguished Treasurer in the House but he is certainly not the most distinguished asker of questions. That is his present role and it is in that role that I have to deal with his question. I think first of all that the figures he has quoted at the beginning of his speech, or question, were not accurate. I think he is not quoting an annual figure when he talks about a reduction in the money supply. The annual figure for the last financial year is an increase of 14 per cent in the money supply. This compares with an average of about 6 per cent before 1972 and an increase of 20 per cent in 1972, a year in which he had considerable responsibility for what was happening. I think that the increase in the money supply in 1972 contributed very substantially to the inflation in Australia in 1973. The right honourable gentleman will know that the increase in the money supply in a year like 1972 would have a lag effect and would have a considerable influence in the year that followed. I have said before that the right honourable gentleman's moneypolicyin 1972 created a very serious problem for this Government in 1973.",25
65,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Not with a disaster like today.,25
66,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,Order! The right honourable gentleman has asked his question.,25
67,Dr JF CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Since we have assessed the economy as one in which there is need for an increase in the money supply, I point out that since June of this year we have released $600m to the trading banks-$600m . When the right honourable gentleman has time to listen rather than to talk I am sure we will have a better chance of reaching agreement.",25
68,Mr MCMAHON,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,You must be honest.,25
69,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Order! The right honourable gentleman must contain himself. He has asked his question, now he is getting the answer.",25
70,Dr JF CAIRNS,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"When he has time to study thefigureswhich reflect the $600m I have just mentioned he will see that there is no decrease in the money supply but an appropriate increase. We have also reduced the variable deposits at the Reserve Bank to 5 per cent, a nominal figure, and the Government has not entered the bond market. I am sure the right honourable gentleman has noticed that. I think it is a question of very difficult judgment, very intricate judgment, to know just what increase in the money supply is needed. But the Government and the Reserve Bank and the Treasury have this matter constantly under review-eac h of the matters he has mentioned as well as additional matters-and I am sure that we will be able to gain a lot from the advice given to us from those sources; but I am not sure that we have been helped much by the pohcy of the Liberal Party. NA",25
71,Mr SNEDDEN,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"I address my question to the Acting Prime Minister. How much more suffering will people have to go through, how much more unemployment will be created before the Government agrees to cease the credit squeeze? Why will the Government not increase the money supply? Why will it not bring down interest rates? Why will it not ease the liquidity crisis which is causing the private sector to lose confidence and causing it to reduce the supply of goods and reduce employment? Can the Government not realise that its mistakes are doing enormous social and economic harm? How can this Government declare it is the party that supports full employment, or supports low interest rates, or supports the development of this country? In the name of sanity, take the credit squeeze off now. Dr. J . F. CAIRNS-I have found that the considered Leader of the Opposition in the last few days has been very happy, but his depression at the ment is only too obvious. I wondered what had Australia. happened to him when I saw him come into the House. Now I know-h e has been reading the wrong documents. I mentioned in my answer to the right honourable member for Lowe that since June $600m has been released to the ing banks. Perhaps the right honourable member did not know that. I do not suppose any pohtical party in this country has been so firmly dedicated to full employment as has the Party. Mr Snedden-And unemployment has gone up another 25,000 or 30,000. Dr. J . F. CAIRNS-Ful l employment became a reality in Australia in terms of the White on full employment in 1945. That White Paper became the basic document for the Chifley Government over a period of 4 years, in which the transfer of over 1 million people out of industry and out of the armed Services was secured with very litde unemployment. I have not hesitated to point out that the unemployment that is occurring in Australia today is a result an objective downturn from a degree which is first of all world-wide and which is more intensive than it has been for many years. In those circumstances, because of purely objective conditions, a certain amount of unemployment occurs. The Government is committed completely, as distinct from an alternative in this nation, the prevention of that unemployment. Everyone knows that a government drawn from the other side of the House would use unemployment to bring inflation to an end, would use unemploystate ment to destroy inflationary use unemployment to destroy the ability of the trade union movement to bargain effectively for increased wages. The policy of this Government has been to ensure that the real standards of workers are maintained. The statistics show average weekly earnings have risen more cause throughout the period this Government has been in office than has the cost of Uving, and at greater rate under this Government than under any proceeding Government. (Opposition members interjecting)",25
72,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,"Order! The House will come to order. There will be no more answers and no more questions until the House comes to order. Dr. J . F. CAIRNS-Althoug h unemployment is a tragedy for every individual whofindshimself unemployed, at the present time. I think a opinion is that over 90 per cent of the people of Australia are better off right now than mothey have been previously in the history of NA",26
73,Mr MORRIS,BUILDING SOCIETIES,My question is addressed to the Minister for Housing and Construction. Does tradthe Australian Government propose action to increase funds avaUable to terminating buUding societies? WUl he ensure that any increased funds are made avaUable to those areas in which there Australian Labor is greatest need?,26
74,Mr LES JOHNSON,BUILDING SOCIETIES,"Terminating buUding societies receive their support predominantly through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Under that Agreement some 30 per cent of the total allocations to the States is adPaper vanced through the home buUders account which puts money out to a definable category of people, whose income is Umited to 95 per cent of average weekly earnings, at an interest rate of war 5% per cent. The Government has decided to break the nexus which limits the aUocation to 30 per cent of the total aUocation so that more money can be put out to terminating buUding of societies under that Agreement, with the apof inflauon proval of the Federal Minister. In addition to that, the proposed Australian housmg corporation will make it possible for financial support or loans to be given direct to terminating building societies, and this will be to done to the extent that the corporation is funded. I beheve that if we had the corporation at this moment we would be able to render a very effective service to the housing industry which is in a of downturn, the seriousness of which I do expectations, would not underrate. Mr Lynch-You can say that again.",26
75,Mr LES JOHNSON,BUILDING SOCIETIES,"I should not need to do the so. It is regrettable that we have not had this that facUity-the housing corporation-to date beit will be possible under that corporation to monitor the housing industry on a regional basis a and to put money out to areas where there is any lag in the buUding industry. In other words, it is the intention of the Government to maximise the buUding force and this will enable it to do so. The Leader of the Opposition gives his head a bit of a nudge. I think it is in desperate need of something like that. He may not be aware that the employment ratio in the building industry is still of satisfactory nature. I do not know whether he realises that. He is obviously trying to convey the impression that there is a great crisis in the buildIt ing industry. Our consultations with the trade union movement dispel that notion altogether. In fact the trade union representatives have made it very clear to me in conference as late as last Friday that they have not had cause for concern up until now. They say that unless we show some versatility and get more money into the industry there can be a crisis. Maybe therighthonourable gentleman is not aware of that fact. But it is undoubtedly the fact that we have been effectively pursuing policies of full employment in the building industry. Mr Snedden-Would you provide the figures?",26
76,Mr SPEAKER,BUILDING SOCIETIES,Order . The right honourable gendeman may not ask questions while a Minister is answering. The Mmister will address the Chair. Mr Snedden- I take a point of order. The ister was speaking directly to me and I asked him whether he would provide the figures with which he was justifying his statement.,27
77,Mr SPEAKER,BUILDING SOCIETIES,Order ! The Minister will address the Chair and interjections will cease.,27
78,Mr LES JOHNSON,BUILDING SOCIETIES,Of course we can make the figures available. They will show a reasonably satisfactory state. It is a patchy situation. (Honourable members interjecting),27
79,Mr SPEAKER,BUILDING SOCIETIES,Order!,27
80,Mr LES JOHNSON,BUILDING SOCIETIES,"I do not mind respondmabiUty, ing to this provocation to give some education the honourable gentlemen opposite. Maybe they do not know that there is such bouyancy in the building industry in some parts of Australia the governments are unable to attract tenderers. That is undoubtedly the case. I am able to put request. that unequivocaUy in my capacity as Minister for Construction as well as in my capacity as Minister for Housing. I can provide documentary evidence. So in reply to the honourable member Shonland, I want him to know that the GovernAustralian ment appreciates the role of the terminating buUding societies. If we had had the facUity referred to-the Australian housmg corporastatements tion-w e would have been able to get to the terminating buUding societies quickly when the housmg commissions were unable to spend the funds we made avaUable to them last year. They could not spend $25m of 4 per money. That indicates how buoyant has been housing industry. We have recently concluded a year in which we have built the largest number a of houses ever constructed in Australia's history. At present we have under construction a higher number of houses than we have ever had before. is our intention to take whatever actions are necessary to sustain that very satisfactory record.

89,Mr LYNCH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I claim to have been misrepestimate resented during question time by the Acting induced Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS). The House will all? recaU that I asked the Acting Prime Minister: Does herecalltelling the Parliament on 18 July that unemployment was insignificant and carefully under Does he recall stating 2 months attacked without resorting to unemployment? In the context of those first 2 questions I theh asked the honourable gentleman: How can he justify those statements when he was in redifficult ceipt of official advice that unemployment would rise to 180,000, or over 3 per cent of the workforce, as a result government pohcies? In his response to that question the Acting Prime Minister was critical of the alleged Press reports that, in fact, he had referred to a specific figure of 180,000. The whole tenor of the comments of the Acting Prime Minister, either by direct statement or by very strong inference, was that the Press report was incorrect and that, therefore, the basis of the question which I put in this House was incorrect and that, to that extent, I had misrepresented his position. In order to clarify the point COMMISSION I raised, and therefore demonstrate the accuracy the question which I posed before this House, I will quote to the House from the transcript of official Press GaUery reporting of the Press of conference given yesterday by the Deputy Prime Minister. The following question was asked of Commission the Deputy Prime Minister Dr Cairns, on September 9 last year when interest rates increased or at any other stage duringMr Martin- I take a point of order. My point of order is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is entitled under the Standing Orders to state only in what manner he has been misrepresented. He is not entitled under the Standing Orders to canvass the issue.",28
90,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes. The honourable gendeexman will keep to the point where he has been misrepresented.,28
91,Mr LYNCH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I am not in fact speaking to the point at present, as the honourable gentleman would be well aware. I seek, however, to substantiate and to sustain the point of my misrepresentation by Dr Cairns, the Deputy Prime Minby a direct quotation from the transcriptthe Press GaUery copy-of his Press conference given yesterday. I hope that that is clear to the honourable gentleman. If he can bear with me for a moment, I wiU be quite brief in relation to the point that I am taking. I repeat the question perthat was posed to the Deputy Prime Minister: Dr Cairns, on September 9 last year when interest rates increased or at any other stage during the imposition of the credit squeeze which has been going on for quite some time now, did the Government's official advisers make any of the amount of unemployment likely to be by that credit squeeze? Have they at any stage lifted up the amount of the estimate or haven't they given one at In response to that question, the transcript control? reveals that the Deputy Prime Minister anslater that inflation could be wered: I think that I would have to answer that by saying that the Government's advisers have said that any attempt to stabilise the economy by credit or by fiscal measures could result in unemployment. And I think they have always said it's to estimate how much. I think the view of how much has increased as the weeks went by and I would think that I of wouldn't be wrong if I said that about 180,000 was the highest figure that we ever heard specifically. It seems to me that quite clearly the figure of 180,000 to which I referred in my question to the Deputy Prime Minister was an accurate reflection of what was in fact said at that Press conference and was substantiated by the transcript which has been provided by the Press GaUery.",28
92,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I wish to make a personal explanation.,29
93,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the right honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented?,29
94,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes , I do, Sir. In answer to the quesdon that I directed to the Acting Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS), he said that there had not been a fall in the money supply in the last few months. I would quote, SirMr Charles Jones- I rise to a point of order. When an honourable member claims to have been misrepresented he must explain where he has been personally misrepresented. The right honourable member for Lowe is referring at this stage to a disagreement between the Acting Prime Minister and him. The opinions of each differ as to what is the state of the economy and what the facts are. Therefore, it is not a case of the right honourable member being misrepresented. The question concerns his disagreement with the Acting Prime Minister as to the state of the economy and what the facts are.",29
95,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I have not heard the honourable gendeman yet. Mr Charles Jones- I have heard enough to know that.,29
96,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! Mr Charles Jones-It is the same as the last one.,29
97,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! The Minister will cease interjecting. The right honourable gendeman will be aware that he has to explain where he has been personally misrepresented. I do not want any debate to ensue now on who is right or who is wrong. The right honourable gentleman will explain where he has been misrepresented.,29
98,Mr MCMAHON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The misrepresentation centres on the fact that I stated that there had been a reduction in the money supply. The fact is that if one cares to look at the ngures one will see that on a seasonally adjusted basis-and this is authoritative-o n either the broad or restricted definition, the reduction in the money supply was 13.2 per cent or 12 per cent. Those are the exact figures on a seasonally adjusted basis.

99,Mr GARLAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The House will be aware of the notice of motion that I gave in the House at the one-day sitting some weeks ago. It was in effect, a motion of censure of the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Willesee). The Government did not provide the necessary time to allow debate to ensue, which would have been the usual practice and which it is entitled to do under the Standing Orders. The matter relates to the activity of and the attitude taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to a young Russian violinist, Georgi Ermolenko, who was in this country. Members of the House will have heard or read about this matter in broad terms in the Press. This is the first opportunity I have had to raise the matter. I take this occasion-it is necessarily a brief one of only 10 minutes-to relate all the events which took place in some 4 days. I say to the Government that, if anyone suggests that what I am now putting is inadequate, I am prepared to put forward to the House at little notice all the details at my disposal if the time is provided later. My part in this matter can be stated fairly simply. I was informed at about 12.30 on Sunday, 14 August, that a young Russian violinist had said that he wanted to stay in Australia and did not want to return with the other Russians on an aircraft which was to leave at approximately 2.30 that very afternoon. I satisfied myself in the conversation which took place, that there was some basis for believing that this was true. I rang the Commonwealth Police and Customs officials, who act for the Department of Labor and Immigration when someone is leaving the country. I was informed that when the young man went to the airport-indeed , at this point he had already left for the airport-h e would be in the company of certain persons with whom he had been associated in the previous week at the University of Western Australia. I was informed that those persons would see whether he wanted to stay. I subsequently learned that he had indicated that he wanted to stay; that the Commonwealth Police at the Perth Airport had made available a room for him; that he had left the airport; and that thereupon the other Russians who had been accompanying him had decided not join him. Even in the limited time available me this morning I shall repeat my notice motion to the House. It reads: That the Minister for Foreign Affairs be censured and the Prime Minister call for him to resign because of his indifference or negation of human rights in Australia as exemplified by his acuons in the matter relating to Ermolenko, the Russian violinist who, being an adult, in Australia subject to the made known to the Rev. Lance Johnson, Priest of Church of England and sub-warden of St George's College, Crawley, of the University of Western Australia, Rev. Borthwick, Priest of the Church of England and in Philosophy of the University of Western Australia, Harold John Badger, Director of the Melba Conservatorium of Music, Melbourne, his desire to stay in Australia. Whereupon the Minister 1. knowing on Sunday 11 August 1974, while he, the ister, was in Perth, that Ermolenko wished not to return to Russia, failed to take steps to see he was fully protected. 2. knowing Ermolenko's whereabouts, portunity tofindout, failed to establish immediately on Sunday afternoon, evening, or Monday morning, the true and freely given wishes of Ermolenko. 3. allowed a situation to develop whereby the Rev. Johnston, Rev. Borthwick and Mr Badger (who were and are objective and truthful persons) were prevented from to Ermolenko, except much later at the airport for utes in company with all the Russians. 4. consistently accepted the views of the matter sented by the Russian Embassy officials. 5. failed at any stage to acknowledge the facts thefirstvital 30 hours of the case, now set out in affidavits those involved. Other reasons were given but I do not have time to read them out at present The next informaRussians don which I received, at about 2.30 on that Sunthat day afternoon, was that the Russian violinist Ermolenko had decided to stay in Australia,* he was in the company of the Rev. Lance ston; and that they were meeting the immigrapoint-afte tion authorities early the next morning. I assumed that he would make an apphcation stay in the country and that the Government would give consideration to that application. was agreed by those to whom I spoke on the teleof phone that, if possible, the matter should be kept as quiet as possible since it would not, in that event, create such hardship for Ermolenko or his relatives back in Russia if he decided to stay in Australia. However, it happened that the ter was announced on the Australian Broadcastproper ing Commission News that evening and thought appeared in the newspapers the next morning. At about 3 o'clock on the Monday afternoon heard that Georgi Ermolenko had gone from the immigration office at 11 a.m. to the ParmeUa Hotel, to which all the Russians had returned. learned that he had been upstairs in the rooms for four hours and that the Rev. Lance Johnston to and Mr Badger had been prevented by police, to immigration officials and other depanmental of officials from actually seeing Ermolenko or indeed any of the other Russians.",29
100,Mr WENTWORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,That cannot be true.,30
101,Mr GARLAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That was true, and it has Georgi been fully documented since. I rang a representawhile tive of the Department of Labor and Immigrafull protection of Australian law the tion and the representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Perth, Mr Henne, to ask that and the they assure me that they personaUy had talked Tutor privately with Ermolenko and had received an and assurance that he had changed his mind and wished to return to Russia. Let us not forget that when Ermolenko emerged from the immigration office in St George's Terrace, Perth, he gave an Mininterview to the Press. It is at present on video tape. He said, inter alia, in English that he or having the opwished to stay in Australia. Separation was achieved in the hotel by the departmental officials as well as by the Russians. I was unable, between 3 o'clock and 5.30 on that Monday afternoon, in spite of three or four calls talking to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Perth, to two minget any assurance that representatives of the Department had spoken to Ermolenko privately as preand divined his real intention. Indeed, Mr Henne did not ring me, in spite of all the attempts I relating to made and in spite of an assurance I received of from an officer of the Department that Mr Henne would ring me. I was told that the aircraft was due to take off with Ermolenko and the other at 6.20 that evening. At 5.30 I realised I was being fobbed off. I went to the Perth Airport to find out the real facts of the matterthat whether coercion was being used and whether Johnthe Government was co-operating. At that r more than 24 hours- I decided that the matter had to be made pubUc. I think that is to an important pomt. Senator WUlesee, in his speech to the Senate on 18 September, tried to It say that my statement to the 'Pelican' newspaper the University of Western Australia that I had taken no public action was incorrect because of the conversations I had had quietly and without for pubhcity with the Commonwealth Police and various departmental officers. Obviously no pubmatlic action was taken by me, if one applies a interpretation of those words, because I that would be in the best interests of the man concerned and, indeed, of Australia's polI icy. Those who were present were not a rabble or all louts, as the Minister said. He referred to dogooders. Now he is trying to say that he agrees I with my assessment that the reverend gentlemen and Mr Badger were truthful and objective. The Minister made great play of potential violence at the airport. Students from the University of Western Australia were at the airport. I would hardly believe that most of those students would be supporters of the Liberal Party. There were representatives of Amnesty International and representatives of 3 unions who, I think, could fairly be said to cover the whole range of political views. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Bennett), who is in the chamber, was there, as were various departmental people and certainly a number of immigrants who formerly had Uved in Eastern European countries. There was a pretty wide body of people. As for violence, noise and so on, I have heard far more noise in this House and in the Senate than occurred at the Perth Airport. Those people were concerned and they had a right to be concerned because the Government simply did not assure them and did not give any opportunity for them to satisfy themselves that coercion was not being used. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard some information on this matter: An article in the 'West Australian' of 15 August titled 'Victim of a Bungle'; an article in the 'DaUy News' titled 'Ermolenko-the 24 hours that Changed a Lifetime'; and the remarks made by the honourable Ian Medcalf in the Western Australian Legislative Council on 20 August, all of which set out the facts in this case, some opinion but mainly the facts which I think it is necessary for the people of Australia to have an opportunity to see. If the Government will not aUow me to have that information incorporated the people can draw their own conclusions.",30
102,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Is leave granted? Mr Daly-No , I have not seen the documents.",31
103,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Leave is not granted.,31
104,Mr MATHEWS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I hope that now that the Trade Practices Act is law the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) will take energetic action to stamp out the fringe operators in the field of radio and television repairs who have been aUowed to batten on this community for so very many years. I hope that following the representations I have made to the Postmaster General (Senator Bishop) the services of the Pink Pages of the telephone directory, which have so often facilitated thesefirmsin the deceptions they practise, will be, if not withdrawn, at least severely modified and made conditional on the observation of basic ethical standards. It is common at this time on Thursdays for honourable members to raise problems their attention by constituents. It is perhaps less common for honourable members to raise the against predicaments in which thenown famiUes have found themselves from time to time. I take this course today only because I feel that an experience my own fanuly had recently is one which many thousands of Australians have previously suffered and will go on suffering untU something is done about firms such as Melbourne's quite notorious MUleradio. The circumstances are these: A few months ago a television set in my home stopped working and my wife looked up the Pink Pages of the telephone directory to find a local repair man. She saw a local telephone number listed against a firm described as 'Prompt TV Repairs', in large display advertising. She telephoned the firm and a serviceman called at my home, looked at the television set briefly and advised her that it would have to be removed to a workshop so that a detaUed investigation of the trouble could be made. He said that she would be given a quote for repairs within a few days. After some weeks my wife rang Prompt TV Repairs at the number given in the telephone directory and queried the delay in the preparation of the quote. She was then advised that the telephone number given in the directory was simply the number of an answering service, and that the set had been removed to the workshops of MUleradio, more than 20 mUes away in Prahran. She then rang the number of MUleradio which she was given and was told first that the repairs to the set would cost $60, secondly that there was a $24 fee for that quotation which she would have to pay regardless of whether the set was repaired or not, and finally, that if she did not go ahead with the repairs she would be obliged to go to Prahran herself and pick up the set. The set was old and for a couple of months I thought that we would forget about it and leave it where it was because it was not worth $60 to have it repaired. But a week or so ago I changed my mind and we went and got the set, confirming at the sametimethe detaUs I have just given. We paid the $24 and took the set away. We then telephoned a bona fide local television service man who came along, told us that his quotation was free and went ahead and repaired the set for $18.40. The set is now functioning satisfactorily. Having had this experience I looked up the reports over the years of the Victorian Consumer Protection Bureau. I found that in all but one of the reports made by the Bureau since it was estabUshed in 1968 reference has been made to MUleradio in the most unflattering terms. The drawn to 1968 report states: In the year under review, 82 complaints were received the firm MUleradio, and over the past 3 years, 234 complaints have been lodged against this firm. The company was quite prepared to give quotes, but in many instances, these quotes wereflagrantlydisregarded. When consumers queried high quotations and demanded the return of appliances, they received accounts advising that half the quoted price would be charged for preparing the estimate. The 1969 report of the Bureau states: In the year under review 337 complaints were registered, and of these, 197 were lodged against the firm MUleradio. Since the Council commenced operations in September, 1965, 431 complaints have been received against this firm. The pubUc has complained about excessive over-charging, sloppy workmanship, extreme delays in the return pUances, grossly inaccurate quotes and contempt sideration of grievances. The Bureau's 1971 report states: Although the Council has many times commented on the activities of the firm MUleradio, this firm continues to take advantage of consumers. The Consumer Protection Bureau has received a number of complaints against the firm and has referred them to the firm in order to obtainredressfor aggrieved consumers. But the firm has continued to adopt an unreasonable stance in resolving these complaints. The 1972 report states: In the year under review 69 complaints for television repairs have been received against the MUleradio group whoseregisteredoffice is situated at 550 Matvern-road, Prahran. The number of complaints received against all other televisionrepairersthroughout the State of Victoria amounted to 71 for the same period. The proportion of 69 complaints against MUleradio as against 71 for all other firms is an indication of the continuing gross disregard by MUleradio of all business ethics. The Council remains convinced that MUleradio is concerned only in extracting every possible doUar from a house-holder and that such service as is provided is only a means to that end. The Consumer Protection Bureau in its 1972 report took the trouble to list the various names under which this firm Milleradio is trading. It is a very extensive list indeed, taking up more than half a foolscap page of the report. In the 1973 report, the last report available to us in the Parliament, the comment was this: In the case of the MUleradio group whose registered office is situated at 550 Malvern-road, Prahan, the Council continues toreceivemany complaints and is convinced that MUleradio is continuing to take advantage of consumers on many of the repairs that it undertakes. This situation, outUned in last year'sreport,has not changed to any with the exception that the PMG Department has included reference to 'MUleradio' in the 27 trade names and 5 company names in the Pink Consumers will now at least be able to distinguish this firm and other television repairers. Unfortunately the Bureau was clearly too optimistic in this matter. I have looked up the Pink Pages of the telephone directory and have found that in aU the very large and no doubt lucrative advertisements that are inserted there by Milleradio, the word 'MUleradio' is there in the smaUest possible print. Very few people looking for a television repair service would read all the small print in an advertisement. They are looking for a name and a telephone number which is related by its code to the district in which they Uve. I have written to the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) about this matter, a matter which as I said at the outset concerns many thousands of Australians, suggesting that action should be taken. Either MUleradio is excluded from the Pink Pages of the telephone directory or its real name appears in type at least as large as the 27 trade names under which it advertises.",31
105,Mr OKEEFE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I want to of apraise a matter in the House this morning concernfor coning the fuel shortage in both the coastal and inland areas of northern New South Wales. I refer in particular to the shortage of motor spirit and distillate which has existed for the past 3 months, and is causing great concern to the people Uving in these areas. Northern New South Wales is serviced with motor spirit and distillate from the port of Newcastle and industrial disputes in that port covering 7 unions have been one of the main reasons for the shortage. A number of industries have been affected by the fuel shortage. The wheat crop has been affected at a time when we want to produce as much grain as we possibly can. Irrigation for stock and crops by diesel engines has been seriously affected by the shortage. Land is now being prepared for the sowing of sorghum in the next few months. We need to produce as much sorghum in this country as we can. However, the preparation of the land for this crop also has been seriously affected. Transport, both rail and motor, has been affected. We have a situation where no trains have been running in the north because distiUate has not been avaUable for the diesel locomotives which haul the trains. This means that the carriage of goods and mail has been seriously affected. Also, pension cheques have been arriving a week late and other inconveniences are being caused. Service station proprietors who have invested as their money in the supply of motor fuel and disextent tillate to their customers in many cases have been a financially affected. I know of young people in listings of service companies of Pages. my electorate of Paterson who have lost their between Ufe's savings which they have put into service stations because of the rentals and wages that they have had to pay. These people have had to walk out of their service stations because fuel has not been made avaUable to them. Also, the employment situation has been seriously affected in the petroleum distribution industry. Many thousands of people in northern New South Wales are employed in bulk depots, in service stations and in other areas of petroleum distribution. This situation is having a serious effect on many of the towns in northern New South Wales. The Government is doing nothing at all to improve the situation. Inquiries made yesterday on the eastern seaboard revealed that 2Vi days supply of motor spirit was available. This situation has been brought about by the go slow tactics at the refineries at Kurnell and Clyde in New South Wales and the Amoco and Ampol refineries in Brisbane. Yet, as I said a moment ago, the Government is doing absolutely nothing at all to correct this situation. There has been a shortage of fuel for 3 or 4 months. Ample representations have been made to the Government advising it of the problems that exist. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) in reply to a telegram from me said: I wish to acknowledge your telegram of 19 August 1974 concerning the current fuel crisis. I have noted your concern and wish to advise that I am doing everything in my power to achieve a settlement in this dispute. Absolutely nothing has been done. I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) about this situation on 19 August. It took him almost 2 months even to reply to my letter. Rome burns while Nerofiddles.All the Prime Minister did in his letter of 27 September was to advise me of the situation at the port of Newcasde about which of course we already knew. He only sent me back the same information which we had relayed to him. The unions involved at the port of Newcastle represent tugmen,fittersand turners, ships' engineers, transport workers, storemen and packers and clerks. We have had situations in which work on the unloading of a tanker which perhaps had been going on for a few hours has been interrupted becausefittershave gone on strike. Thefittershave then decided to go back next day but after they have returned to work the storemen and packers have gone on strike. These are very serious matters of which the Government has been fully advised and is aware. Yet it has done absolutely nothing. I understand that most of the unions involved come under Federal awards. I thought that, if we made strong representations to the Government, the Government would take this matter up with the unions to see that some sanity was restored because the adequate supply of motor spirit and distillate is the life blood of country areas and the transport system in Australia. A very serious situation could arise in regard to overseas tankers which service our 8 ports if these delays are allowed to continue. What tanker company or oil company would want to send tankers to Australia when it takes about a month to discharge their cargoes? We have had an instance of the 'Caltex Wellington', which is an overseas tanker, taking nearly a month to discharge distillate in the port of Newcastle because of the delays to which I have referred. Demurrage has been incurred by the company chartering this vessel. Inconvenience has been caused to the users of these fuels in northern New South Wales. So it is obvious that the overseas compames which supply Australia with 30 per cent of our distillate and motor spirit will think twice before they allow their tankers to come into our regions. I ask that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) and the Cabinet take a serious view of this fuel shortage on our eastern seaboard and in particular in northern New South Wales. These Ministers should be aware of the reason the shortages are occurring in northern New South Wales and not in the southern part of the State or in other States. They should be able to put thefingeron the cause and effect a remedy to support the economy of northern New South Wales by ensuring that supplies are made avaUable. Country areas rely entirely on motor transport. Our farms are mechanised; the work is done by machinery. When the supply of fuel is short industries in these areas cease to operate and there is a resulting effect on the local economies and the employment situation. As I have said, the employment of thousands of people who distribute petrol through depots and service stations, and who are engaged in primary industries and in the great transport industries of our nation is affected by the supply of fuel. Therefore I put the fuel situation to the Government as a very serious matter. It is one that I hope will receive the attention of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers.",32
106,Mr RIORDAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to make a special plea this morning on behalf of the surf life saving movement of Australia. I give full credit to the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) for the magnificent job that he has done in showing some interest in and concern for this organisation; nonetheless it is still urgently in need of further assistance. It is true that in 1973-74 an additional amount of $ 100,000 was made avaUable on a dollar for dollar basis for surf life saving equipment to be purchased. That, of course, was in addition to the $50,000 which had been made avaUable previously for administrative purposes. In the recent Budget that amount has been increased to $160,000 on a dollar for dollar basis for the vision of surf life saving equipment, and an didonal $70,000 has been provided to help needy clubs and also for the purchase of power boats. That means that the total sum now being made available to the surf life saving movement in Australia is $280,000 as compared with the miserable sum of $50,000 which was made availreplace able under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. It did not care too much about this very important aspect of life. But, in spite of what has needs to be done. The surf life saving movement a has expressed great appreciation to the GovernState ment for its assistance. Those members of it in make authorities my area have asked me to convey their and thanks to the Minister for Tourism and that the beaches of Sydney Recreation for the job that he has done so far. safe for those who will use them But they do need additional assistance. I point ing surfing season, which will open out to the House that the maintenance costs next. alone of a power surf boat are $ 1,000 per annum. The equipment being used these days for the saving of lives in the surf is much more sophistiThe cated than it was when surf life savers used neck-house to-knee costumes. The equipment now being used includes the power boats of a very sophistiraffles cated kind, a helicopter service and up to date radio and telecommunications equipment. The task is worthwhile. The surf life saving movement has been responsible for rescuing 200,000 people in the Sydney area. The Bondi club alone has been responsible during its history for pulling 10,000 people out of the surf. Many those people might have perished but for activities of those dedicated young men who risk life and limb for no other purpose than to give protection to the Australian community. Surfing is a recreational activity that is very beneficial. suggest to the House that 10 minutes in the surf better than 2 bottles of tranquUiser piUs. Surfing is an activity that is very popular. But it lar only because of its safety- a safety guaranquickly teed by young men who serve the community. If some organisation could guarantee that no would be lost on Australian roads in the next year, I venture to say that the Government would say that no cost would be too great to meet its erations. If the surf Ufe saving movement did exist many thousands of lives would be lost in surfing activities around our coastline. The development of character and the development of youth are things that the Government has out to encourage. The surf Ufe saving movement has done a great deal in that regard. My plea for additional assistance falls under 2 broad headings. Firsdy, during May storms good lashed the east coast of Australia, causing prohundreds of thousands of doUars worth of damadage to aU sorts of facUities, both natural and man-made. Included in those losses was surf Ufe saving equipment. Through no fault of their own-throug h the very heavy ravages of naturethe surf life saving clubs are now confronted with thousands of dollars worth of debts to try to equipment which has been lost. So far they have received no assistance from the appropriate State authorities in restoring the equipment that has been lost. Even at this stage, so been done, more still pleaafter soon the introduction of the Budget, I make to the Minister for Tourism and Recreation to take special steps either to encourage the to make funds avaUable or to gratitude able from Australian to a special effort have funds made avaUGovernment sources so and elsewhere will be during the comon Monday other plea I make is in relation to club facUities. Surf clubs have to find their own funds. They do that by levying fees and running and other fund raising ventures. I suppose that the surf life saving movement is the only organisation that is performing an essential and highly desirable community service that has to pay for therightto do so. Sydney's beaches would be unsafe but for the surf life saving movement. It is ludicrous to think that those who make them safe have to pay for the right to do so. of The community should pay them, not the other the way round. Let me tell nonourabie members about the sorts of costs involved. I will give just a couple of examples. The Coogee surf club needs to find$9,000 every year, the Tamarama surf I club needs to find$8,000 every year, the Clovelly is surf club needs to find$6,000 every year and so on. In fact, the cost of painting the club houses is is popuvery high. The paint on the buUdings erodes because of the closeness to the surf. The spray from the sea has a very disastrous effect on lives the paint on those buUdings. Each time the Coogee surf club wants to paint its building, which is situated virtually right on the water, it ophas to raise $6,000 to do so. To put the club not house at Bondi beach, which is one of the greatest beaches if not the greatest beach in the world, in reasonable condition will cost the Waverley Municipal Council $40,000. That Council had to set establish a new complex at Bronte because some kind soul was responsible for it being burnt down. I am not being critical of whoever was responsible for that happening, because he did a turn. The dUapidated, broken down, shammany bling old building which was there and which was a disgrace has been demolished because of an accident and a new one has been constructed in its place. That building cost the Waverley Council $180,000. The surf club section of it cost $52,000. There is no reason why the councils in the areas in which the beaches happen to be located should have to bear the whole cost, because citizens from all over the Sydney metropoUtan area use the facilities at the beaches on the north side and south side of Sydney Harbour. It is fundamentaUy wrong that the citizens who happen to Uve there should have to bear the whole of the cost. I make a plea to the Government to take special steps in this regard. The surf Ufe saving movement needs to attract more and more young men, and one way of attracting them is to provide decent and reasonable facUities in which they may enjoy their recreadon. There is also a need, with the introduction of new oxygen equipment, for more highly skUled professional instructors. I believe that the Government would do well if it were to give serious consideration to the subsidising of the surf club movement so that professional instructors could be avaUable full time rather than reUance being placed on the part time instructors, medical practitioners and the Uke who give their services and time free of charge for this very important function. I conclude by saymg that the surf boys movement-that is, the one which deals with boys of from 5 to 13 years of age-is also deserving of some assistance from the Australian Government. I put this very sincerely and very strongly: The Australian community needs the surf club movement of Australia. It provides a remarkable and wonderful service. It is deserving of greater assistance than it is getting. I have made this strong plea on its behalf.",33
107,Mr DONALD CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan), who was the previous speaker in the debate. Every time the surf Ufe saving movement holds an art union in Queensland and sends meticketsI have no hesitation in buying an entire book ofticketsand sending the money back because I recognise the great job that it is doing. I have risen to speak on a subject of real concern at the moment to the people of my State of Queensland. I refer to an article in the Brisbane 'Telegraph' of Saturday, 14 September, headed 'Queensland's aged are worried sick'. It states: Four thousand sick age pensioners in Queensland are liv- speech ing beyond their means. The article goes on to talk about the plight of those persons who are Uving in nursing homes. I spoke on this subject in the adjournment debate on Tuesday night. I have endeavoured for some days to get the call during questiontimebecause this is a subject which I believe the Government and the Minister for Social Security are not facing in as responsible a manner as they should. For the record, we have in Australia some 54,420 beds accomodating people in nursing homes. In Queensland as at 30 June this year we had 8,340 beds. There are 2,192 State beds and 6,148 nongovernment beds. Those people who read the Queensland Press could not help but be aware of the concern which is being expressed in all directions in my State. There have been a number of letters to the editor in the Brisbane 'Courier MaU'-letter s from matrons, from the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden), a fellow Queenslander, and then a reply from the matrons, as well as a number of articles. The stage is fast being reached where because of the reluctance or refusal of the Minister to review the rate of subsidy paid to the pensioners many elderly people who are in no fit condition to do so might be faced with no alternative but to get out because they simply cannot afford the fees which are necessary to keep these nursing homes viable. In 1972 the previous Government introduced a fee system or a standard weekly fee to assist persons in the various States. I know that the Minister will tell the House that it was a Liberal Government which introduced a system which had a variance of application in the amount of fee for each State. We readUy concede that that is true, but a lot of things have happened in Australia since 1972. The economic stability that we previously knew is but a memory. Even in the last election campaign the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) in the Fitzroy Town HaU on 1 May 1974 said this: The nursing home benefit rates introduced in January 1973 have been steadily eroded by increasing costs incurred by nursing homes. These costs have risen at a rate faster than living costs generally in the community. This has meant that, notwithstanding generous increases in pension rates, only a small proportion of patients are now adequately protected by nursing home benefits. A Uttle further on in his speech when referring to increases he said: We promise urgent action on this matter. The Minister for Social Security said that: 'We promise urgent action on this matter.' I ask the Minister at the table if I could incorporate those 3 letters to the editor and the extract from the in Melbourne of the Minister for Social Security. Mr Daly- I understand the Minister for Social Security has approved of this, so leave is granted.",35
108,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Leave is granted. (The documents read as follows)('COURIER MAIL', 24 SEPTEMBER 1974) As matrons of some of the most up to date nursing homes in Australia, we are dismayed and disgusted by the attitude of the Social Security Minister (Mr Hayden), towards patients in Queensland nursing homes. Queensland patients obtain the lowest subsidy for any State in Australia. The only reason Mr Hayden gives is that Queensland has a lower standard of care and accommodation. This is absolute nonsense. We nine matrons, who between us have 214 years of nursing experience, have nursed in several other States and we affirm categorically that our standard in Qeeensland is unsurpassed by any other State. Mr Hayden is, of course, disadvantaged by lack of first hand information. Mr Hayden, we and our nursing colleagues would welcome you up-dating your information by visiting for the first ume one or more of our nine nursing homes so your comments on the Queensland nursing homes would be more accurate. We also wish to stress we comply with your Commonwealth standards, both as to accommodation and care, so see no reason for your attack on State standards generally. This letter is signed by the matrons of the nursing centres named - Matro n Griffiths (Annerley); Matron Hay (Broadbeach); Matron Cornwell (Bundaberg); Acting Matron Watson (Huntingtower); Matron Gilbank (Jindalee); Matron Barnard (Labrador); Matron Hughson (Mermaid Beach); Matron Perry (Mt Gravatt); Matron Lewald (Toowoomba). ('COURIER MAIL', 26 SEPTEMBER 1974) I am surprised and disappointed that a group of matrons from profit-making nursing homes should misunderstand my simple statement about nursing home standards set by State Governments (C-M Letters, 24 September). It is an incontrovertible fact that standards set by the Queensland Government are not as demanding as in some other States, such as Victoria. I have said on a number of occasions that Queensland standards are good. But the standards of staffing and facilities imposed by other States are more extensive and therefore more costly for the homes in those States. The matrons would know that the Queensland benefit rates are based, to a large degree, on their approved fee structures. They would also know that their fee structure, which is lower in Queensland than other States, was drawn up by the previous Coalition Government. No one has criticised the standards of care in Queensland. If the spokesman and spokeswomen for the profit-making homes were to stop their carping and petty personal jibes and were prepared to submit a proper case in support of higher bed day subsidies, I would be only too glad to consider their claims. I think the public would have noticed that I have refrained from reciprocating some of the nasty personal comments from people who claim to represent the profit-making homes. Perhaps now they wiil produce a submission which would justify the Government increasing the taxpayers' alreadyhigh commitment to supporting profit-making enterprises. Bill Hayden, MP, Minister for Social Security. ('COURIER MAIL', 30 SEPTEMBER 1974) In reply to the Social Security Minister, Mr Hayden (C-M, 26 September) we, the Matrons, wish to declare that we are in fact not the spokesmen for the private enterprise nursing homes, but are speaking on behalf of our patients. Mr Hayden must be aware the patient subsidy helps the patients, not the nursing homes, therefore an inadequate subsidy hurts the patients, not the nursing homes. [ Mr Hayden said (C-M Letters, 26 September) he was surprised and disappointed that group of matrons from profit-making nursing homes should misunderstand his earlier statement about nursing home standards set by the State Governments. If the spokesman and spokeswomen for the profit-making homes were to stop their carping and petty personal jibes and were prepared to submit a proper case in suppon or higher bed day subsidies, he would be only too glad to consider their claims.] Currently in our ten nursing centres all Tweed Heads pensioners are retaining a portion of their pension, but this does not apply to a single Queensland pensioner. To stress this point, the average patient contribution for our 797 Queensland patients is $88.90 per fortnight, and for our 79 Tweed Heads patients $54.60 per fortnight. This means on top of their pension of $62, Queensland patients have to find an average of $26.90 per fortnight, whilst the Tweed Heads patients retain $7.40 for the same period, a difference of $34.30 per fortnight. The ngures are calculated from the following: Average fonnightly patient contribution for each nursing home: Annerley (118 pauents) $90.30; Broadbeach (93) $84.55; Bundaberg (59) $91.06; Huntingtower (75) $85.09; Jindalee (93) $91.17; Labrador (69) $84.85; Mermaid Beach MINISTER'S REPLY (64) $83.30; Mt Gravatt (148) $96.96; Toowoomba (78) $84.31; Tweed Heads (79) $54.60. We do wish to stress that without staff assistance 352 of our patients cannot afford these fees for any prolonged period. Mr Hayden: Please come to the assistance of patients immediately, so there is no longer the need for us to conunue with our'carping', and this will prevent the need for our staff to continue with their present patient subsidy scheme. Matron Griffiths (Annerley Nursing Centre), Matron Hay (Broadbeach Nursing Centre), Sr West-Oram (for Matron Cornwell, Bundaberg Nursing Centre), Acting-matron Watson (Huntingtower Nursing Centre), Matron Gilbank (Jindalee Nursing Centre), Matron Barnard (Labrador Nursing Centre), Matron Hughson (Mermaid Beach Nursing Centre), Matron Perry (Mt Gravatt Nursing Centre), Sr Phelan (for Matron Lewald, Toowoomba Nursing Centre). NA Another of our new initiatives announced by the Prime Minister was that we will be increasing the level of Australian Government assistance for nursing home patients. When we came to power in 1972 we inherited from the previous Government proposals for new nursing home benefits arrangements that were authorised by the National Health Act 1972 for implementation from January of 1973. As aresponsibleGovernment we proceeded with those arrangements but improvements are needed and we been working towards both long-term and short term changes, ln the short-term we have concentrated our on the posiuon of patients, giving particular attention equitability of the amounts to be paid by patients meeting their nursing home fees and to the posiuon conducted byreligiousand charitable organisations. The nursing home benefit rates introduced in January 1973 have been steadily eroded by increasing costs incurred by nursing homes. These costs have risen at a rate faster living costs generaUy in the community. This has meant notwithstanding generous increases in pension rates, smaU proportion of pauents are now adequately protected by nursing home benefits. In reviewing the levels of benefits to to establish a situation whereby pensioners, in the great majority of cases retain $4 per week from their pensions and supplementary assistance to spend their personal needs. A survey of nursing home fees conducted by my ment showed that after allowing for patient contributions based on the standard pension rate, benefits would be increased by the following amounts if the substanual majority of patients are to be adequately protected: South Wales $5.60 a week; Victoria $18.20; Queensland $2.80; South Australia $13.30; Western Australia $3.50 Tasmama $1.40. We will therefore increase nursing home benefits by these amounts. Werecognise,of course, that further increases in home costs may occur before legislation authorising increases in these benefits can be passed. We willreviewthe benefit needs of patients closer to the time the increases be introduced so that all increases in costs that occur taken into account. We promise urgent acdon on this The rates of increases in benefits I have just mentioned based on present nursing home costs and would involve didonal Government expenditure of approximately $6m 1974-75 in respect of Pensioner Medical Service pensioner patients. Hospital benefit funds will be expected benefits by similar amounts for nursing home patients who are insured and the extra cost estimated at $ 1.5m annually. There would be no necessity increase hospital benefits contributions in the short-term.",36
109,Mr DONALD CAMERON,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,"I thank the House. Mr Speaker, if I may return to the rates, and keeping the words of the Minister in mind, thefiguresshow that from January 1972 the subsidy paid in Queensland consisted of a basic benefit of $24.50 plus, an additional benefit of $10.50. We have reached the stage where the basic benefit paid in Queensland is still $24.50 but the additional benefit has gone up by only $6.10 a week. It would be dishonest of me not to mention the fact that the patient's contribution by virtue of pension increases has also risen in that time by $5 a week. But in the Minister's own words, the cost of administering these homes has risen at a rate faster than living costs generally in the community. We have now reached the stage where hundreds upon hundreds of elderly people cannot meet the fees being set by the nursing homes to enable the nursing homes to remain open. Despite the answer given by the Acting Prime have Minister this morning to a question when he told review us we are doing so well, we have reached the to the stage where the nursing staffs in many of these towards homes in Queensland have recognised that the of homes homes are being driven into the ground and if these homes close the patients will have to be thrown out into the streets. The nursing staffs than have recognised that this is an emergency and that, they have voluntarily forgone salary increases only a because they know that the homes simply cannot afford to pay the new salary rates. If the homes are forced to pay those salary rates they are be paid we will seek going to have to close. I make a plea to the Minister to cast aside his prejudices, to forget about the fact that there-are Departand have been a handful of nursing homes who have been, to use a fairly classic but expressive have to word, unethical. Do not paint every nonNew government or private nursing home as being an exploiter. As I said the other night, if you find a and rotten apple in the case you do not necessarily tip out the entire case, but that is what the Minister is doing. He would dearly like to see the day arrive nursing when there is no one other than charitable or government institutions involved in the care of will the aged; but what he fails to recognise is that can be private nursing homes have suppUed in the past matter. a most necessary service. We have some 54,000 are persons in nursing homes and 80 per cent of adthese are in non-government homes. The figures in speak for themselves. A little compassion, even if only for the sake of the sick and the aged, is very to increase their much needed at this time.",37
110,Mr HURFORD,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,"Adelaide) (11 ^ ^ G o v e r n to the hospital benefits funds is to ment assistance to nursing homes is recognised as a very Uve issue and the form of politics in Australia is such that it is inevitable that the Opposition would make a lot of capital out of a very serious situation. I know it is serious. The very best nursing home in South Australia is in my electorate, the one that gives the highest degree of service in the way of rehabUitation. It is the WalkerviUe Nursing Home. Because it is giving so much more and therefore costing so much more it is in seriousfinancialtrouble. Unfortunately, at the present time the circumstances are such that the 79 patients at the home will have to be moved elsewhere on 11 October unless some further help can be given. AU I can say at this stage is that I believe some further help will be given very shortly, and that an announcement will definitely be made within the next 10 days, despite the fact that the Australian Labor Government has given a lot of additional help, from memory amounting to $26m of taxpayers' funds, dating from as recently as 1 August. However I am also hoping that when the extra help is given- I repeat that I beheve an announcement will be made within 10 days-that there will be a contraction as between the States in the amount paid. At the moment, of course, South Australia and Queensland deserve greater amounts per bed day than do some of the other States, which have a margin which was introduced by the previous Government. If these margins are deserved, it will be the job of the State governments to see that the necessary funds are avaUable for those margins. If my expectations are achieved, I hope that my own State of South Australia and the State of Queensland will be particularly favoured by a Government announcement. I think it is only proper to pomt out that the Government has agreed as from 1 January next to cover the deficits of aU the religious and charitable nursing homes in Australia. I have heard from very experienced administrators in this field that they are extremely pleased with the plan being put forward and discussed right now for the take-over by the Commonwealth Government of the deficits of these wonderful institutions. So it is not as though the Australian Labor Government is ignoring a tremendously great problem in our country. I anticipate, I believe correctly, that further announcements will be made shortly. I am one who asked questions about this matter as recendy as last week. The seeds sown by me and a lot of my coUeagues on the Government side of the House-and I will not neglect to mention those on the other side who have also been drawmg attention, as is their duty, to a particular problem in this country-ar e not faUing on stony ground. I rose in this debate to talk about my grievance, which is that poltiical capital is being made out of a disaster which is not the responsibUity of the Australian Government in any way. I am referring to the very tragic situation in Cyprus, which is causing a lot of worry and grievance not only to Greek people, particularly Greek Cypriots, but also to people in the Turkish community in this country. My grievance is against the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay), who is from my State. He has made poltiical capital by releasing a statement to the Press. I am not aware that any newspaper in Australia took up this Press release because of its scurrilous nature, but apparently because the newspapers did not take it up the honourable member distributed it in the Greek clubs. In my electorate of Adelaide there are a number of these Greek clubs, and these fine citizens from Cyprus and Greece have drawn my attention to the statement by the honourable member for Boothby. Let me read some of it. The opening sentences read: The present Federal Government appears to have no concern for the feelings of the Australian Greek Community over the plight of war victims in Cyprus. The Greek Community in Australia is striving to raise more than Sim for the relief of the people of Cyprus but the Government can do no better than send a miserable $50,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Whitlam Government . . . can only manage $50,000 for the 200,000 war victims on C y p r u s . . . 40c per person. And so it goes on in this vein. Let us just learn what are the facts about the Australian Government's help for the Greek people in Cyprus-in deed for all the victims in Cyprus. There is no substance whatsoever in the accusation that Australia's contribution to the relief of Cyprus victims was miserable and ignored the sentiments of the Greek community. Australia was amongst thefirst7 countries to contribute emergency relief to Cyprus. Moreover, its donation of $50,000 was exceeded at thetimeit was made by only 3 other donors. Further, this amount by no means represents the total of our contributions towards helping to find a solution to the problems of Cyprus. Australia's contribution to the peace-keeping force for Cyprus, for instance, is presently running at $450,000 per annum. That figure includes, of course, the cost of maintaining the Australian contingent. The Australian Labor Government's contribution is most generous when compared with emergency relief grants for simUar cases which were made in the last years of the Liberal Country Party Government. For example, the disastrous earthquakes which caused a great loss of Ufe and extensive damage in Peru in 1970 attracted only $15,000 from Australia. This contribution, of course, was in the time of the Liberal-Country Party Government. The flood disasters in Romania in the same year led to a grant of only $5,000 from Australia. The serious PhUippinesfloodsin mid-1972 before the Labor Government took office, led to a grant of $20,000 from the Government at that time. Australian assistance to Cyprus has by no means ended. The peace-keeping force mission is continuing and Australia will probably contribute to the relief of refugees through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' program which has not yet been fully worked out. Also, it was announced in the Senate and it has been announced in many other forms-in telegrams to me, for instance-that tremendous help will be given to private citizens in Australia by Australia's national airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, in sending goods-foo d and clothingcollected in Australia by fine citizens, both of Greek background and of other origins, for the relief of the distressed people in Cyprus. I refer to a telegram sent to me only last week by the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones), which reads: Following my request Qantas have agreed to assist in transport of relief supplies to Cyprus and will carry supplies free of charge on a space available basis on its scheduled vices. Goods will be taken off at most convenient point probably Athens. Onward movement of supplies to Cyprus will be responsibility of community leaders in Australia. I interpose to say that this is already being organised. National committees for relief supplies for Cyprus are located in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne and it is through these committees that transport arrangements with Qantas are to be made. I draw the attention of the House and the people of Australia to the number of refugees in Cyprus. This information has been suppUed by the Cypriot communities of Australia. They have divided the needs of the refugees into the various centres-Kakopetria , Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos. There are 191,309 people who are in need, and of that number nearly 160,000 need food. I also have some statistics about the number who need shelter. Any citizens in Australia who can donate sleeping bags, bed sheets, face towels, chUdren's wear, knitting wool or any other commodities Uke these can contact the Cypriot communities in Adelaide, Melbourne or Sydney, who have detaUs of the great needs of the Cypriot refugees. As I said, the Australian Government is helping through Qantas to supply these goods via Athens to the people in need in Cyprus. The raising of an issue Uke this as though nothing had been done about it is a despicable way of conducting poUtics in Australia. I deplore it and I grieve about it.",37
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NURSING HOME BENEFITS, for Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,39
112,Mr GILES,NURSING HOME BENEFITS," I do not intend to comment very much because I do not know the facts in relation to the Press release evidently issued by my colleague and friend, the honourgrows able member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) omic amongst the Greek communities think it is awfuUy difficult to resist in these circumstances the temptation to take sides as between groups of people in one's electorate. I not intend to faU for that one today. But I say in passing that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) read out the first two sentences'from the Press release and referred them as being of a scurrilous nature. I do not have the full facts that he may have at his fingertips but, frankly, I could not see anything scurrilous about it at all. I expected some one-eyed abusive attack on the Government for one thing or another but that did not eventuate. The only attitude I can take is that I hope the Government will do more to assist in this situation and in any such situation that occurs. Nothing is more tragic than people of one country or one island being in serthe circumstances of a civil war. I think that aU honourable members of this House will agree with me. Anything that the Government can do to assist the big effort of the Greek community- I am not knowledgeable about the Turkish community in Australia-wU l obviously be welcomed by aU members of Parliament on both sides. I think it is probably salutory for the House every now and again to hear from the member for Angas on the matter of brandy and the brandy industry. I do not know whether the House has yet absorbed the dreadful fact that growers, who are on very minimal wages or returns from their investment and for their enterprise because of the price control measures in South Australia which fix the mimmum price of brandy grapes receive $70 a ton for their produce. Today the Government is taking in excess of $ 1,100 a ton of grapes used for brandy. There is sometliing wrong in the state of Denmark when growers are hammered down to this level of return while the Government takes such an exorbitant cut of the cake that directly affects their interests. In its misguided fashion the Government has said that there should not be any differential between the production of Australian vodka, gin, brandy and whisky. It has totally misassessed the position. If the demand for Australian rum were to faU it would not affect the grower of Australian sugar of which it is a by-product. If the demand beer were to fall, to suggest that it would rarely affect the barley growers or the cereal growers of Australia would be a very wild assertion indeed. The same sort of circumstances can apply to other Australian spirits produced as a by-product of one industry or another. But this condition does not apply to the person who grapes for brandy production. His econplight is a very serious one in some parts of in Adelaide. I my eleaorate today. Let me read briefly one or two comments from do the industry leaders that have recently been sent must to me. The first is from Mr Angove. Honourable members will be aware of St Agnes brandy. I am not giving him free advertising when I say that it to is probably the finest brandy in Australia, particularly as no brandy is produced in the Hunter Valley electorates of my friends. Mr Angove said that the 94 per cent increase in brandy duty imposed in August last year had reduced brandy sales by 20 per cent He said: This latest excise increasethat is the current oneamounting to 4214 per cent, plus sales tax at 15 per cent, making 49 per cent overall, was a total increase of 178 per cent in less than a full year.",39
113,Mr LUSHER,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,What percentage?,40
114,Mr GILES,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,"A 178 per cent increase in Government rake-off. He said: Such savage treatment levelled at brandy can only strued as intended to severely cripple the industry, grape growers, producers and distributors. Brandy stocks at the Berri Winery and Distillery-the biggest single winery in Australiawere severely reduced by the bond store fire in February, but the company was nevertheless alarmed, according to Mr Lever, the general manager. He said that duty prior to the August Budget last year was $8 a proof gallon. This was increased to $15.58 by the August Budget and was now up to $22.20 as a result of the mini-Budget.",40
115,Mr LUSHER,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,What is the total increase?,40
116,Mr GILES,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,"I have not added it up but, to recapitulate what I said a while ago, there was a 178 per cent increase in less than 12 months. When the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) opened the South Australian Barossa Co-operative's new building a Uttle while ago he advised growers to get out of grapes that could be used for brandy production. There was an interjection from the back of the audience which caused some amusement. Someone said that the only way you can make money out of brandy today is to burn it. It was a direct reference to the fire at the Berri Winery some time ago. The situation is as serious as this. It is significant that the Government seems intent on maUciously destroying only one section of the wine industry. Amazingly enough-this has happened in more than one case and I have written evidence of it- a Mmister writes and says:' I hear you are in trouble. What can we do to help?' Having knocked the man down and half killed him the Mmister says: 'What is the trouble, old fellow? Is there anything we can do to try to Uft you up again?' In most instances this is far too late I think it is probably becoming too late now for the brandy mdustry. One can only sit and watch in horror at what happens to an industry such as that of Mr Angove. He is typical of many. He has put his whole Ufe mto the art of produc-' ing a brandy comparable with the best brandies produced in the world. He has acquired this art over many years and now by the capricious whim of Government, uninformed of the impUcations of its actionsMr Kelly-Indifferent .",40
117,Mr GILES,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,"On e would hope that it was not indifferent. It is certainly uninformed. The Government is prepared to let this art which has been learned from experience over many years fall into disuse, to the complete disadvantage of this country which surely should be aiming in every industry possible to increase the knowlbe con- edge, the know-how and the capacity of that industry, to update with plant and modern equipment. In the case of this industry and of many of the industries in the electorate of Angas which I represent, all these things have been given exactly the opposite treatment. They are short of capital to update and upgrade. In the middle of all this we have a marvellous litde remark from the nice but ineffectual Federal Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) who says in answer to repeated requests from me, the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), the Premier of South Australia and many others: 'The Government must have another look at it.' We are getting too used to this sort of answer. The Government has another look but nothing ever eventuates. All I can do is join with the Premier of South Australia- I am not on his side very frequently-wh o said",40
118,Dr FORBES,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,"He is good on this, though.",40
119,Mr GILES,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,He stood and allowed himself to be counted on this matter. He said that the Federal Government had placed him in a shamefully difficult position. He expressed his sense of shame at what happened. I can only back him up on that point of view and ask the Government once again to reassess this position.,40
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,Mr Luchetti)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
121,Mr BENNETT,NURSING HOME BENEFITS," I rise to speak in this grievance debate of the 29th Parliament because of the number of letters and other communications I have received from constituents saying that they hope that this Parliament will continue, that sanity will prevaU and that the Parliament will not be curtaUed in mid-stream as the previous one was by an election which cost more in terms of manpower, money, and lost progressive time than any industrial dispute in the nation's history.",40
122,Dr FORBES,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,WUl you table them?,40
123,Mr BENNETT,NURSING HOME BENEFITS,"Public , reaction to these stop-go parliaments is one of disgust. I have taken the opportunity to send the text of the newspaper cuttings relating to private armies and matters of that nature about which people are complaining to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and have asked for his comment. When that is available I will send it to my stituents in reply. The complaints are so that I think a circular will be required. Perhaps that will answer the interjections. The reaction people is that we should get on with government and that honourable members opposite should stop playing the man and start playing the game. Perhaps the interjector will take note of that point. I have my personal doubts about whether the wishes of the public will be upheld for already there is the indication that attempts will be made to continue constant elections until Opposition wins what it considers to be the lotrefuses tery of the ballot. Because of what has transpired over the last few months we have seen a general downturn in public respect for the Parliament. am losing my respect for some honourable members in it-and what it stands for. The attention people are losing respect for those who practise the profession of politics. I do not say but arising out of my contact with people not only in my electorate but also in other electorates- I interpose to say that I travel interstate often and have wide contact with people in otherdamp electorates- I find that people are fed up with electrical political allegations and counter allegations and need of painting. the old saying: 'Anything you can do, I can do only are these homes better'. We should settle down to the nation's interests and not our own interests. situated. These areas arearea This Government has shown a consistency of purpose in its adherence to stated and published welfare policy no matter what the opposition. The Government is sincere. Indeed it was preThe pared to go again to the people soon after its election on its record to receive re-endorsement of its mandate. Above all the Government has if demonstrated to those who had any doubts The about what was said to be its lavish welfare proget gram that such program would be implemented despite the desperate methods used within without the Parliament to prevent its implemenauthorities tation. Any reversal of these policies by any antitolerating Labor Government pressure groups, such as have in this House, would mean that many forget people in my electorate would be adversely affected and many more in dire need. Western Australia has had a long history neglect in State Housing Commission areas, parState ticularly in respect of maintenance works. Some properties have been neglected for so long that is now claimed that it is uneconomic to repair them. People are expected to continue Uving in those houses. Had the properties belonged to other than the State Housing Commission the local shire councUs would have instituted work orders or condemned the properties. Recently the Western Australian State Government conretrenched maintenance workers despite the many desperate neglect of some State houses. An unfortunate aspect of this situation is that the of properties are allocated to tenants who have already suffered Ufe's setbacks and sorrows. They are deserted wives, widows, widowers, invalid pensioners and people who have been evicted from homes because of unfortunate circumstances. These people are not in a position to reject the neglected properties when offered them. In most cases such people are offered only the one house; they have no choice. If a person an offer he is expected to wait a further 6 months for another offer. If he accepts the offer he must wait 2 years at that address before beI coming eUgible for a transfer to better accommodation. These people have Uttle desire to draw to themselves by public protest. In fact they comprise the least Ukely section of the comthis lightly munity to protest at any level. Some of these homes have leaking roofs, and collapsing ceUings and dangerous wiring and fittings. Many are in dire They have rusting roofs. Not uninhabitable but also they looking after lower the standard of the in which they are usuaUy sufficiently depressed without having these neglected homes. Other residents are trying at their own expense, to maintain a reasonable standard of living. Many of their homes are of credit to them. shires often contribute to the depressed state of these areas by persisting with the original and narrow roads, open stormwater drains and few, any, footpaths. These areas lack playing fields. theory seems to exist that the shires do not sufficient rates from these areas to justify expenditure on general maintenance, rubbish and removal and pothole repairs. The housing are just as guilty as the shires for the situation. It is not sufficient to we simply build meagre accommodation and then the tenants. I raise the issue here, for the disgrace is that the funds for the dUapidated buUdings, the branch maintenance funds, origof inaUy were aUocated by the Parliament to the on the trust that it would look after the welfare of the State citizens-a U Australian citizens. it All Australian citizens should be treated equally and the Western Australian citizen should receive as much consideration as a citizen in another State. If the State is not performing the functions entrusted to it the Australian Government should take a closer interest in the welfare of neglected people. I have raised this matter with the Federal ister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) who has asked his Department to investigate neglected homes in neglected areas. In fact the Minister was good enough to perThe sonally inspect the area of Maniana in my elecvide torate with me recently. Undoubtedly that area needs upgrading. Apart from the homes needing Compensation maintenance the area requires roads and footVolume paths. A large number of homes lack basic comtion, forts necessary for aged and infirm people. Invalids are expected to use chip bath heaters. Tbis may not seem a matter of great importance September. but it is of concern to a person who is incapacitated in some way. When such a person applies for a better facility he is told that no funds allocated for this purpose. The national ParliaVolume ment is able to supply funds for pensions, surely the State could make these homes habitable. Some attempt was made by the previous State government to clean up the backlog of neglect but the project was so vast that it was hardly under way when the new State government maintenance workers off despite the obvious need for their services. I am, therefore, pleased that welfare housing will be a priority of the national Parliament. One hopes that the shires which are undenaking regional redevelopment schemes and receiving Australian Government funds under the employment schemes will pay attention to these areas because this is a matter urgency. I trust that the State authorities will pay urgent attention to this matter particularly when it is already planned to institute a massive program of upgrading homes. If this work were undersocial taken there would be no unemployment of buildbased ing workers in the Perth area. In all areas maintenance work-painting , structural repairs and plumbing-ther e is sufficient work to ensure a continuity of employment for some time not the provision of new homes but in making existit ing welfare homes comparable to the homes supthe plied by private enterprise. There are several housing commission areas which do not require attention. All I ask is that all people who occupy government housing be treated equally. Question resolved in the affirmative. NATIONAL COMPENSATION BILL 1974 Bill presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read afirsttime. Second Reading",41
124,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,NURSING HOME BENEFITS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. National Compensation Bill 1974 will prothe framework for the compensation aspects of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into and Rehabilitation in Australia. 1 of that report, dealing with compensawas tabled in this Parliament on 10 July 1974.1 tabled Volume 2, deahng with rehabilitation and safety, in this House last Thursday, 26 I feel constrained to point out at this stage that, so far as the total report is concerned, the Government and the Committee itself place are primary emphasis on the matters contained in 2, namely, safety and rehabilitation, Volumerather than compensation, which is dealt with in 1, and is the subject of the present Bill. I should like to pay tribute to the work of the Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry, the laid Right Honourable Sir Owen Woodhouse, D.S.C., of the New Zealand Court of Appeal, and to his learned colleague, the Honourable Mr Justice C. L. D. Meares, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, who is also Chairman of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. These gentlemen have performed a most admirable task and presented to the Government a of scholarly and challenging report for which we are in their debt. The Government is grateful for the co-operation and assistance of the Governments of New Zealand and the State of New South Wales in making available their services. The Bill now before the House introduces a measure of great significance. This Bill is upon the draft Bill contained in Volume 1 of of the Committee's report, with some amendments resulting from the Government's examination of the report, and from consideration of in representations already received. I wish to make clear that, while the Government has adopted measure in principle, it is not irrevocably committed to every detail ofit. As I have already pointed out, we have made amendments to the Bill as the result of representations received and we remain open to consider further amendments in the light of representations, both during the passage of the Bill and in the subsequent period between the enactment of the Bill and the coming into operation of the scheme. The Government sees this measure as being of such importance to the Australian community that we shall welcome any views which any person or organisation including representatives of the insurance industry, women's organisations, trade unions and, of course, the Opposition Parties in this Parliament wishes to place before us, and I foreshadow now that the Government will propose amendments to the Bill during its passage through the Parliament. The Bill provides for earnings-related compensation to all people incapacitated as a result of injury or sickness and to the dependants of deceased persons. The scheme envisaged in the report of the Committee embraces injury, congenital disability and sickness. The Government, at this stage, cannot see its way clear, much as it would like to see this done, to the immediate implementation of the whole scheme and has decided that it should be introduced in 4 stages. The draft Bill has been amended accordingly. Stage one, which will extend to personal injury and congenital disability occuring on or after 1 July 1976, will come into operation on that date. The Government sees the period between now and 1 July 1976 as being necessary to phase out existing systems, allow the insurance industry to make adjustments, and enable the Government to prepare the administrative machinery to implement the scheme. Stage two, which will extend to personal injury and congenital disability occuring before 1 July 1976, will come into operation on a date to be proclaimed. Stage three, which will come into operation on a date to be proclaimed, not earlier than 1 July 1979, will extend to sickness occuring on or after that proclaimed date. Stage four, which will extend to sickness occuring before the date proclaimed for stage three, will come into operation on a date to be proclaimed. As honourable members will see, this is a term program. An initial waiting period of 18 months between the enactment of the legislation and the coming into operation of the recommended by the Committee. The operation of the first stage of the scheme will be closely watched, and decisions to implement the ensuing stages will be taken in the light of experience the economic and other circumstances existing from time to time. It would not be possible me in the short time available to explain all impUcations of the scheme. My colleague, the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation (Senator Wheeldon) has arranged for the printincreasingly ing of an explanatory memorandum on the scheme and on the detaUs of the Bill. These will be distributed to aU honourable members. Honourable members will note that entitlement to benefits under the scheme replaces the present remedies for personal injuries at common law and under workers' compensation legislation. These remedies have an important place in the history of social justice, but they are both inadequate and unnecessarily expensive. These issues are well explained in Volume 1 of the report of the Committee. With the discontinuance of common law and workers' compensation remedies, the need for compulsory insurance in the motor vehicle third party and workers' compensation fields disappears. As honourable members are aware, experience in these areas over the last 10 years or more has shown the need for the type of drastic re-thinking which has led to the development of this scheme. This is a measure which is designed to replace what we have now. This is a new scheme. It brings a fresh approach to compensation. It more efficiendy, cheaply, and justiy provides that compensation for the injured, sick and disabled, towards which those jurists who buUt our present system of common law remedies were striving. It is interesting and relevant to note that both Sir Owen Woodhouse and Mr Justice Meares are outstanding representatives of a judiciary founded upon our English common law. The Committee of Inquiry recommended in its report that the scheme befinancedfrom a levy of 10c a gallon on petrol and diesel fuels used on the road, replacing the third party insurance premiums, the imposition of a levy of 2 per cent on the wages bUl of employers and on the income of self-employed persons, replacing the present compulsory workers' compensation premiums, and the raising of any residual amounts from general revenue. The Government has considered this matter and, whUe it sees merit in the recommendations of the Committee, it has not committed itself to this or any other method of long financing. The Treasurer, the Honourable Frank Crean, is investigating the options avaUable to the Government and will bring forward proscheme was posals for later consideration. The aboUtion of the present remedies will, of course, affect the insurance industry. With the and cessation of compulsory motor vehicle third party and workers' compensation insurance, for there may be a diminution of income to the the insurance industry. However the present experience of many insurance officers shows that, in recent years, both of these fields have become unprofitable to such an extent that many companies either have withdrawn or are anxious to withdraw from these socially essential forms of insurance. For example, in an address at a symposium conducted in Sydney on 7 June 1973, during the Australian Insurance Institute Annual Conference, Mr D. G. Pettigrew, the Managing Director of Sun Alliance Insurance Ltd, said: Workers' Compensation insurance poses special problems for the insurance industry due to the natural desire of governments to increase compensation rates in response to increasing community wage levels. While this is essentially desirable the insurance company must pay this compensation out of the premium fixed, in many cases, years previously.  Obviously, the estimations of claims costs poses difficulty and raises the quesion whether private enterprise is the proper medium to private protection when liabilities are emphasised by statute and potential liabUities are unpredictable The Committee of Inquiry was unable to assess the full effects which its recommendations would have upon the insurance industry, and hence was unable to make specific recommendations as to how they should be met. Tbis matter has been placed in the hands of the Treasurer who is setting up a consultative committee comprised of representatives of the insurance industry and Government officials to look into the problems of the industry resulting from the Government's plans to introduce this national compensation scheme. The Minister for Repatriation and Compensation has been in constant touch with the representatives of various different organisations representing insurance companies operating in Australia, and with the Australian Insurance Staffs Federation, and has invited these organisations to make suggestions to him as to amendments to the Bill, including necessary transitional provisions, and has undertaken to take such reasonable advice as he may receive from these quarters. The Minister for Repatriation and Compensation has recendy visited New Zealand where he discussed these matters with representatives of the insurance industry in that country, and has learned something of the problems which may be expected. It is to be noted in this regard that the New Zealand accident compensation proposals were amended in many respects following the report which was made to the New Zealand Government by Sir Owen Woodhouse in 1967. The Bill provides for the payment of benefits at the rate of 85 per cent of earnings, calculated on earnings of up to $500 a week, for any person unable to work because of injury or sickness. The upper earnings limit of $500 a week was reached by the Committee of Inquiry after consideration of income levels payable in Australia. Any person in receipt of an income in excess of that amount would have his benefit calculated on the basis of earnings of $500 a week. We support the principle stated by the Committee in Inquiry at page 105 of Volume 1 of its report that: Real compensation demands the provision of incomerelated benefits for lost income throught the whole period of incapacity and the opportunity for every incapacitated person to maintain the living standards he or she had earUer achieved by energy and hard work. The Bill makes provision in respect of permanent incapacity. A person who suffers total permanent incapacity would be entitled to a continuation of his benefit at the rate of 85 per cent of his average earnings. A person who suffers a permanent partial incapacity will be paid a benefit calculated on the percentage of his incapacity and based on national average weekly earnings. The Bill also provides for payment of benefits to widows and other dependants of persons who die from injury or sickness. Once again, the benefit is related to the average weekly earnings of the deceased spouse. Benefits will be payable also to non-earners. These include housewives and others who are not members of the work force. In these cases, the benefits payable will be based on a notional earnings figure of $50 a week. One of the most significant advances in the law of accident and sickness compensation proposed in this Bill is the recognition of the right to compensation of non-earners, such as housewives and children. In particular, it should be noted that, although no one could deny the important contribution made to the economy by housewives and others not otherwise employed, they have until now been excluded from any scheme of workers compensation. The report and this Bill propose that this gross injustice should be remedied, and the community should accept the same responsibility for these citizens as it does for employees receiving a wage or salary. In the same way this Bill proposes that compensation should be paid in the appropriate circumstances to another important group, also excluded from the present workers compensation laws, namely self-employed persons, of whom the farming community, for example, forms a substantial part. Provision is made for the automatic adjustment of benefits each quarter based on movements in the consumer price index plus an element to reflect productivity growth. This will enable beneficiaries to retain relativity of income with movements in the cost of living. The mimmum income figure of $50 a week and the maximum income figure of $500 a week will also be. brought up to date. These will be adjusted annually on the basis of movement in seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings. As I have indicated, the Government has made some amendments to the draft Bill, but it is substantially as published in Volume 1 of the Committee's report. One major change, however, which we have made is to provide that payment in respect of injuries arising from work, that is the type of industrial injury presendy covered by workers compensation, will cover the first week of incapacity. Payments in respect of other injuries will commence, as recommended by the Committee, from the second week of incapacity in the case of injuries to earners and from the fourth week of incapacity in the case of injury to non-earners and in the case of sickness. The Government believes that it would be retrogressive to deprive workers of the rights already existing under compensation law to receive payment from the first week in respect of injuries arising at work. Equally, it would be inequitable to expect employers to be responsible for payment in the first week in these cases which at present are covered under their workers compensation insurance. As honourable gendemen are aware, the Committee of Inquiry did an amount of research and calculation to arrive at cost estimates for the scheme recommended in the report. Work is still proceeding on the analysis of these cost figures. The major costs will, of course, 3, related to sickness is implemented. Revised estimates have been prepared for stage 1, in respect of anticipated expenditure in its first year ofoperation from 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1977. is estimated that the cost for thatfirstyear ofopsimilarities eration will be $30lm. Work on the cost mates will continue and they will be revised brought up to date on the basis of the GovernZealand ment's staging of the scheme. The estimated costs in respect of each of the ensuing stages will be one of the factors which the Government will take into consideration before proclamation those stages. I should like to repeat that this Bill introduces a most important social measure. We are dealing in this Bill only with the compensation aspects arising from the report, which covers also rehabilitation and safety. These are 3 arms of total concept, namely that we must provide a safe environment at work and elsewhere, rehabilitate those unfortunate enough to suffer incapacity and ensure compensation during rehabilitation and for residual handicap. We must seek first to prevent, so far as humanly possible, the occurrence of injury and sickness. Already in Australia in the post-war period great advances have been made in accident prevention, particularly in industry and on the roads; but much more remains to be done. Where, in spite of all endeavours, incapacity occurs, the payment of compensation in itself is not the answer. The prime and important issue is rehabUitation to the maximum degree that society can provide. The role of compensation during the early stages of disabUity is to remove thefinancialworries which could interfere with effective rehabUitation. If all rehabUitation efforts faU to restore a person's total capacity, then compensation is paid to recompense the individual for that permanent residual incapacity. UntU now, insufficient stress has been placed on the rehabUitation role. This is particularly so in the common law area and has been the subject of comment by many learned judges, medical practitioners and others who see delays in litigation and setdement as being against the best interests of the injured person and, in fact, often worsening his condition by encouraging the mental approach, often referred to as 'litigation neurosis', which may lead the person to reject improvement until settlement of the claim. Through this comprehensive program, of which compensation is but one part, the Government intends to ensure that the people of Australia will enjoy the benefits of this scheme and so avoid the problems, delays and weaknesses inherent in the occur when stage existing systems. The accident compensation scheme now It operating in New Zealand which has many to the scheme proposed in this Bill, estiwas introduced by a National Party Governand ment, and supported in principle by the New Labour Pany. It is the Government's hope that the same bipartisan approach, will be achieved in the Australian Parliament and that it wiU be free from invective and polemic so far as of possible in the sometimes heated atmosphere of Parliament. My colleague, the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation, has undertaken to representatives of the Opposition Parties to make avaUable to them all of the facUities and information avaUable to him, mcluding discussions with the officers of his Department and the a perusal of any relevant documents and statistics. I am pleased to be able to say that this offer has been accepted by members of the Opposition. On several occasions, Sir Owen Woodhouse has met groups of Opposition members, and others have had discussions with officers of the Department of Repatriation and Compensation and members of the Minister's personal staff. The Minister arranged for the Opposition spokesman on repatriation and compensation, Senator Drake-Brockman, to visit New Zealand, and assisted him to meet those people in that country who could speak with some authority on the New Zealand scheme. It is naturally the Government's hope that the passage of this Bill will not be delayed for so long that the proposed date for the introduction of stage 1 would have to be postponed. At the same time, it is the Government's wish that the exchange of ideas should in no way be stifled or that representatives of those persons in the Australian community who have an interest in this proposal should be precluded from offering suggestions to the Government, either by way of amendment or in matters relating to the administration of the national compensation scheme. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Forbes) adjourned. NA BILL (No. 2) 1974 Bill presented by Dr Cass, and read a first time.",42
125,Dr CASS,BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Broadcasting and Television Act has been subject to many amendments in a piecemeal within fashion over a number of years and, for some time, the Department of the Media, in associdoubt. ation with the Austrahan Broadcasting Control tunity Board, has been giving consideration to detailed amendments which will be required to bring the Act up to modern requirements. Meanwhile there are 2 primary matters which in the opinion of the Government are in urgent need of attenpriate. tion and which are the subject of this legislation. Thefirstconcerns the powers of the Broadcastfact ing Control Board to regulate appropriately the programs of commercial broadcasting and telecism. vision stations. This power existed in the Act until it was amended in 1956. Prior to that time was provided that stations must present promerely grams 'to the satisfaction of the Board', but in tice. 1956 this was amended to provide that stations' programs must comply 'with standards determined by the Board'. In recent years some stawith tions have challenged the Board's powers in programming area by relying on a narrow legal definition of the word 'standards', and the Government's legal advisers have confirmed that this approach has had some validity. The Board has consistently drawn attention to this lack in its powers of the past 7 years, but no action has been taken until now to correct the anomaly. The relevant section of the Act is section 16, which sets out the powers and functions of the Board. The major function of the Board is stated in that section to be: To ensure that adequate and comprehensive programs are provided by commercial broadcasting stations and commercial television stations to serve the best interests of the general public. Unfortunately, however, the Act does not provide the Board with a power comparable with that function. The proposed amendments to section 16, which are included in clause 6 of the Bill I now present, specifically provide the Board with a general power to carry out all its functions. Further, it inserts two new specific powers. The first will become paragraph (e) of sub-section (3) of section 16, and provides that the Board shall have power to determine rules and standards to be observed by licensees in relation to commercial broadcasting and television programs. The second new power is provided by the new sub-section (3) (a) which specifically provides power to the Board to determine, subject to Second Reading the Minister's approval, requirements with regard to programs of Australian origin. These 2 new powers will place beyond question the powers which, I think it is fair to say, the general public has always thought the Board to have. I believe they will be generally welcomed the industry itself as putting these matters which have been the subject of debate beyond While amending section 16, the opporis also being taken to provide that, in exercising its powers under the Act, the Board shall consult not only representatives of commercial broadcasting and television stations, but also such other persons as the Board considers approIt has in fact been the Board's recent practice to discuss matters of programming with appropriate unions and others concerned, but the that this consultation has not been mandatory under the Act has given rise to some critiClause 7 of the Bill amends section 21 (2) of the Act regarding the right of a witness to elect it to make an affirmation rather than an oath. This brings the Act into line with current pracThe second important matter which is dealt by the Bill is contained in clause 11. This the provides that, instead of the present licence renewal period of 12 months, licences may be renewed for variable periods from 3 months to 3 years. A somewhat similar proposal for variable licence renewal periods was put forward by the previous Government in 1971. At the time, the matter was refened to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts, which was charged with the responsibility of mquiring into all aspects of television and broadcasting. In its second interim report, that Committee suggested for consideration a number of measures for strengthening the Board's powers, including one to the effect that the Board be empowered to recommend graded renewal periods to the Minister. Apart from the obvious value of this provision, in enabling the Board to recommend short-term renewals in cases where a licensee's performance has been less than totally satisfactory, this is an essential first step towards implementing the Government's policy that all licence renewal applications be considered at a public hearing of the Board. It will be appreciated that, since more than 200 broadcasting, television, translator and repeater Ucences come up for renewal each year, it would not be possible at the moment for each appUcation to be the subject of a pubUc hearing. It is the Board's intention, as soon as this lation is passed, to recommend to me that renewal of Ucences for varying periods so that the work-load may be spread equally over a 3-year period-that is, so that only approximately one third of Ucences will need to be considered each 12 months. Another important advantage will be that aU translator licences will be brought into step with the Ucence of the parent station so that these can aU be considered at the sametime,as is of course only logical. Clause 12 of the Bill provides for some machinery amendments to section 85 to facUitate the new proposal regarding the renewal of licences, and clause 13 provides the consequential amendments to section 99 of the principal Act resulting from the amendments to the Board's powers in section 16 to which I have already referred. Section 99 of the Act provides, at present, for the Board to determine standards which must be met by Ucensees in the presentation of programs. The amendments now proposed replace standards by a reference to the determinations which the Board will make under the new provisions of section 16. Though the major legal difficulty regarding the use of the word 'standards' in the Act has occurred with regard to programs, the opportunity is also being taken, in clause 14 of the Bill, to amend section 100 of the principal Act, which refers to standards in connection with advertising, in order to ensure that the Board's powers under this section are equally unequivocal. Clauses 15 and 16 of the Bill embody machinery amendments designed to make the new proposals which I have outlined regarding licence renewals equally applicable to television translator and repeater stations. So far in this outline of the provisions of this Bill, honourable members will have noticed that I have referred to the Broadcasting Control Board as the authority responsible to Parliament for the administration of provisions laid down for commercial broadcasting and television stations in this country. I have done this in order to facUitate an understanding of the continuing provisions of the Act. I should pomt out, however, that the Government does not believe that the functions of the Broadcasting Control Board are, or should be, confined to the control of broadcasting. In clauses 3 and 4 of this Bill, the Government proposes to change the name of the authority responsible for broadcasting in Australia to the logical alternative: The Australian Broadcasting Authority. Elsewhere in the Bill, it is made plain that the membership of the legisAuthority is to be continuous with the membership of the Broadcasting Control Board as established at the time of the commencement of the amending legislation. Within this Bill, the opportunity has also been taken to incorporate various amendments to bring the provisions for the remuneration and allowances of the various statutory office holders mentioned in the Act into line with the Remuneration Tribunals Bill at present before the Parliament. The opportunity is also being taken, in clause 17 and the accompanying schedule, to make some formal amendments to bring the wording of the Act into Une with current practice. As I have already said, the Bill sets out to overcome obvious and serious defects in the existing legislation. The Broadcasting Control Board has laboured for years under severe criticism from some quarters for its faUure to carry out adequately its function to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programs are presented by Ucensees. Though legal challenges made it clear some seven or eight years ago that the Board's powers were deficient in this area, this is the first time that any action has been taken to correct the anomaly.

128,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"The Book Bounty Bill 1974 proposes an amendment to the Book Bounty Act to give effect to the recommendation of the report of the Industries Assistance Commission of 21 September 1973. Second Reading The main purpose of the amendment is to raise that bounty, in accordance with the recommendation, from 25 per cent to 33W per cent. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. However, there are a number of things that I would like to say about it. In January 1969 book manuI facturing members of the Printing and Allied Trades Employers' Federation of Australia suba request for assistance to book manufacin Australia to the then Minister for Trade and Industry, the right honourable Sir John to MCEwen. In May 1969 the then Minister to announced the Government's intention to assist Australia's book manufacturers by approving the payment of a bounty. The payment of the the bounty has been somewhat of an interim measure up to this stage pending a report by the TariffBoard. We have now received the Board's report and subsequent upon that report the legislation now before us was introduced. I hope that for Services and Property (Mr Daly) BILL 1974 who introduced the Bill in this place will consider some of the things I will say. There are some aspects of the Bill which call for comment. Second Reading A sUght change is proposed to the Act. This change is spoken of in the last paragraph of the second reading speech made by the Minister in which he said: The subjective requirements of literary or educational character contained in the present Act are deleted but all other exclusions ate retained. The change that is proposed by the Bill is that the definition of the word 'book' is to be removed and a rather negative provision has been substituted. This change does not make any material alteration to the Act. It just puts what is in the Act at present in a somewhat different way. I want to refer to that part of the Bill which says that the bounty will not be payable in respect of a book that is not a pubUcation of a Uterary or educational character. I am perfecdy aware that it is very difiicult to define this objective in legislative terms, and having defined it to interpret it because what is indecent, what is educational and what is of a literary character would Second Reading vary very much according to the point of view of the person making the decision. One magistrate or one State may differ from another in what they regard as acceptable or objectionable. I am concerned, and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) has expressed his concern in a number of places, about who may be receiving this bounty. We do not particularly want to attack the Government on its censorship policy or any other policy. That is not the purpose of our statement today. I hope that we will at some time have an opportunity to talk about these things because from the petitions that have been received by honourable members and the discussions that one hears around the electorate I think that we should consider and talk about censorship. There must be some aspects of this subject which concern not only members on this side of the House but also members on the other side of the House. I think that we should look again at our censorship provisions not only in the literary and film spheres but also in regard to what appears on television. I do not want to express a point of view on this subject today but I hope that the Minister will allow us the opportunity at sometimeto talk about these things. As I said, I am concerned about who may be getting this bounty. I am concerned because we have no real information on what books are being subsidised. We know, of course, that the bounty is paid to the printer and not to the publisher. That being so, we ought to be able to find out the titles of of the books that attract the bounty. But we are not able to ascertain this information. The honourable member for Boothby has for quite some time directed questions on notice to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) who represents the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Murphy) in this place in which he has asked whether thetitleswould be made available to honourable members. I will read the reply that was given to one of his questions on notice. I am not criticising that reply but I want to point out the deficiency that exists because if we are to subsidise books and to pay such a bounty we ought to know and the Australian taxpayer ought to know where the bounty is being applied.",48
129,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,That is fair enough. It might be embarrassing to some of us on both sides.,49
130,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"It could well be. The Minister in his answer stated: . . . a record of titles is not kept He is referring to a specific request for an answer in respect of South Australia. He stated: 892 tides were involved in South Australia in 1972-73. Regular maintenance of a consoUdated Ust of titles ing on individual claim forms is not an operational I disagree with that. He further states: Preparation of the record now sought would thus impose a significant and-it is felt-unjustifie d work load on the Department 's South Australian office. This situation would apply to all of the other offices of the Department of Customs and Excise. I cannot accept that answer as sufficient because when we talk about book bounties we are talking about a lot of money The officialfigureof the amount of money paid in 1972-73 in the form of a book bounty was $2,984,430. The bounty in that period was paid on over 30 milhon books. That is a substantial amount of bounty on a great number of books. I do not think it is reasonable to say that the preparation of a record would impose such a work load on the Department that we should not be able to receive details of the payment of the bounty.",49
131,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,Would 'Portnoy's Complaint' attract the bounty?,49
132,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,I do not know about 'Portnoy's Complaint'. The honourable member for Boothby raised the question in the first place because he had a list of books that were printed in AustraliaMr Riordan-B y whom?,49
133,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"I will give the honourable member the answer to that. The honourable member for Boothby did not make any accusation at the time that he asked his question that these books did or did not receive a bounty. He is not making that accusation now. He wanted to know the titles of the books that were receiving the bounty. He asked a fair and reasonable question about whether the bounty was being paid on these books. When I give honourable members thetitleof just one or two of these books they will understand why the honourable member for Boothby asked his question. For instance, one of the books was entitled: 'Inside Linda Lovelace by Linda Lovelace'. It is reasonable for the honourable member to ask whether such a book attracted a bounty. Some of the other books were entitled: 'Poor AUce','Dangerous Game', 'Adultery Without Men', 'Stag FUm Girls', 'First Experience', 'The Coming of a Woman', 'The Painter of Passion' and 'The Wife WUl Play'. Is it not reasonable to ask whether the pubUcation of these books attract any bounty? If they do perhaps it is a matter for our assessment as to whether they should. In the first place we ought to know what printers are receiving the bounty and thetitlesof the books on which the bounty is paid. I know appearthat such a requirement is not adequately necessity. covered in the Act because the Act can only broadly specify what sort of books quaUfy for such a bounty. The legislation talks about educational and literary standards. Our argument today is not what those standards ought to be. That is a matter for another time. Our argument is that a list of those books on which such bounty is paid ought to be available to us and to whoever wants the informadon on demand.",49
134,Unknown,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. M i ADERMANN-Prio r to the suspension of the sitting I had explained the Opposition's stand on this Book Bounty Bill. I had said that the Opposition will not be opposing the extension of the bounty. I had pointed out that it was actually a Liberal-Country Party Government which instituted it. I had said that the Opposition is quite happy about the increase in the bounty rate to 33'/> per cent of the cost of production. The point I was making immediately prior to the suspension of the sitting related to the subject of to whom the bounty is being paid and to the lack of information as to which books attract it. I cannot understand why a list of such books ought not to be available, because surely whenever appUcations are made for the bounty-and they are made frequently-the y must be made on an appUcation form and surely both the applicant and the Department of Customs and Excise must retain a copy of such an application for their own purposes. For that reason, I cannot concede that it would impose an unreasonable work load on the Department to require it to make avaUable such a Ust. To those honourable members who queued outside my door during the luncheon break I say that I have no copies of any of the books I have mentioned. I have not read any of them. I read out their titles because I thought they might indicate something of the contents of the books. For a bounty to be payable the book must be a pubUcation of a Uterary or educational character, which is absolutely right. I suppose none of us would be stupid enough to impose his own standards of Uterature, art or anything else upon any other member. I think that there is plenty of room for division and difference of opinion. But the only restriction imposed on payment of the bounty is that it will not be paid on pubUcations the printing, pubhshing or postal transmission of which would be an offence against a law of Australia. There is a great area for argument there. There is a great difference of opmion as to what is reasonable, what is decent, what is not obscene and what should be able to be trafficked in a particular State. As we know, different emphases are placed on those matters in different States. I am very pleased that I come from Queensland. I know that sometimes Queensland's censorship laws are called archaic and that sometimes its standards are called conservative, but I have been making a study of censorship in both the Uterary and films field- I have been helped very much by the officers who carry on that task and I understand and appreciate what they are doing-and it has made me feel happy to belong to conservative Queensland when I have seen what Uterature is being peddled in Australia today. As I have said, I do not wish to impose my own standards. Once again I appeal to the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) to make it possible for us at some time to discuss freely and fully the censorship of Uterature, films and television programs in Australia because I think many people on both sides of the House would Uke to comment on and talk about those things. The only restriction is a restriction in law and understandably that law differs from magistrate to magistrate. One magistrate might caU something obscene or indecent, but somebody else might say in a changing climate and in a changing circumstance that he does not see it in that way.",50
135,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,There is no fixed definition to guide them.,50
136,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"I take the point made by the honourable member for Hunter, but I understand that it is very difficult to define what is offensive to decency, obscene or blasphemous as referred to in the legislation.",50
137,Mr JAMES,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,It is as wide as the heavens.,50
138,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"Once again it is a matter of who is doing the interpreting at a particular time. I know that it is very difficult to frame in words the intention behind an Act. That is why I have said that the only restriction here is one of law. I think that we would not find any disagreement in this House that some literature that might not be specifically banned by law still ought not to qualify for a bounty under the terms of the literary or educational qualification. That is the point I am making. That is why I think it is so very important for us to have the information I have sought when we are considering the payment of a bounty which is, as I mentioned before, of such a magnitude. Honourable members ought to have that information and the Australian taxpayers ought to be able to see to whom these bounties are being paid. A record is kept, even down to the very small amounts of all other bounties that are paid. For that reason I just cannot understand the answer that has been given to us that it is impossible to make such records available in this case. I do not want to cause any suspicion in the minds of people that there is a reason why we are not being given this information. I am not implying that. I hope that there is no reason for anybody to infer that that is what I am implying. But I do say that this information about the bounties of which we are approving ought to be available. Of couse we want to see Australian publishers and printers helped and we want to see these books being printed in Australia. Of course want to see such a bounty continue and to see increased use made of it. But we also want to the direction in which the money is expended. Because we are not being given that sort of inforpaid mation there can be very much misunderstandso ing. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Boothby, whom I have mentioned before, is very concerned about this matter has asked previously for such information. fore he finished doing so on that Press came up with the story that he was proclaiming that South Australia is the porthat nography centre of Australia. The honourable member for Boothby and I were not attacking the Government at that time; we were not atprinting tacking the legislation either. What we were tryas ing to do was to find out what was happening. In seeking that information the honourable member received a lot of unjustified criticism. Many innuendoes were drawn about what I Bounty think was a straight-forward, reasonable and logical question to ask. I do not want to hold up the proceedings of House any longer but I do wish to repeat that ought to take note of the fact that the bounty paid in 1972-73 amounted to just about $3m, which is a considerable amount of money. Nearly 31 miUion books, on which we have no information, benefited from the payment of that bounty. I have not been able to obtain the title one book in relation to which the bounty was paid. It would be easy for me to pick up the list to $3m. which I referred earUer today and say that the bounty was paid to certain people who ought not to have received it. The books mentioned in the Ust to which I referred earUer today- I hesitated to name some of the tides on the Ust-ar e not book books in relation to which I claim any bounty was paid, but they are books which were printed in Australia and about which we cannot obtain any information as to whether the bounty was or was not paid. Without repeating thetitles,I say to honourable members: If those tides are an example of the contents of those books, do they think that we ought to make any bounty avaUable in respect of those sorts of pubUcations? Let us have the information I have sought. I hope that my request will be passed on to the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Murphy) and that he wiU see it as being a reasonable request. My request is not made with any ulterior motive in mind. No honourable member can receive the letters and petitions I receive without knowing that this is in an area of particular concern to a large number of people. The Opposition will not be opposing the Bill; it we will be supporting it. But the Opposition does appeal for more information to be made freely see and readUy avaUable as to who is receiving this bounty and under what circumstances it is being and for those Usts to be made avaUable to us that we can make our own objective judgment on whether this bounty is achieving what I believe the Government wants it to achieve and and what we want it to achieve and wanted it to Beachieve when it was introduced by us when we occasion the were in government.",50
139,Mr MATHEWS,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"The Bill the House is discussing replaces the Book Bounty Act 1969-1973. That Act was introduced, as you will recall, Mr Speaker, at atimewhen the industry in Australia, at least in as much it was geared to the production of books, had reached a state of collapse. If the then Minister for Trade and Industry, Sir John MCEwen, had not taken the initiative in bringing in the Book Bill of that day it is quite safe to say that the industry would have passed the pomt of no return and that the quite considerable body of book publishing which is generated in this counthe try-the works of Australian authors, the works we of authors from overseas for which rights are bought by Australian publishers-woul d aU have gone on outside Australia. As the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann) has pointed out to us, the expenditure under the Book Bounty Act has reached very large proportions in recent of years. The honourable member for Fisher told us that the sum expended last year was very nearly I involve myself in this debate on a relatively narrow aspect of the legislation. It is true that the major expression of creativity mvolved in any is the writing itself; but it is also true that an important subsidiary field of creativity has grown up in recent years in the design of books. This extends not only to the technical layout of the book, to the designation of the type face for the book, to the illustration of the book, but also to the way in which the book is put together. It has been a source of concern to me that the way a book has been denned in section 3A (1) (c), of this legislation, both in its earlier form and in the form which is now before the House, is a restrictive influence on the way in which books are put together in this country. I give the House a particular instance. A constituent of mine who is the proprietor of a firm known as Hanging Lake Books designed a book on mathematics in such a form that the chapters of the book were not sewn or stapled together in the customary manner but were simply put together in a box so that they could be read in any sequence. The pubUcation was refused bounty on the grounds that it was not a book within the meaning of the Act. It seems to me that this was an unnecessarily legalistic and pettifogging interpretation of the legislation which negated the intentions of Sir John MCEwen. If we are to retain the capacity of Australian printers to publish books, if we are to encourage the ingenuity of Australian designers in thinking up new and more attractive and perhaps more stimulating-if the honourable member for Fisher wiU forgive the word-way s of presenting books then we can do without interpretations of legislation as narrow as the one that was made in that case. I was intrigued by remarks the honourable member for Fisher made about the need to have the names of books on which bounty is to be paid pubUshed. Of course, the inhibition to which he referred, the fact that the Department has repUed to the Minister that the titles of these books are not required for the adrrunistrative implementation of the Act and are therefore not recorded, goes back to the inception of the legislation in 1969 and the administrative procedures that were adopted at the same time. I suspect that they were included for the very good reason, in the eyes of the sponsors of the legislation that the identity of the people who produce material commonly described as pornographic-por nographies perhaps by general consent-in this country is at variance with the normal image of a pornographer as somebody lurking in a grubby shop with a printing machine in the back room. In fact, the material which excites the honourable gentleman from Fisher and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) to their expressions of indignationMr Adermann-And the honourable member for Hunter.",51
140,Mr MATHEWS,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"No doubt the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) too. That material emanates from some the largest printing concerns in this country. Its production is not a back street activity, it is not a covert activity, but one in which the greatest publishing enterprises in the country are eager to participate. The honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan), who I may say takes a closer interest in these matters than I do, said by way of interjection whUe the honourable member for Fisher was speaking that the most significant of these publishers at the present time are in fact ConsoUdated Press and Rippon Press, the latter of which is a subsidiary of the Adelaide 'Advertiser'. In fact, it is the great pUlars of the Estabhshment in this country whose names would have been put abroad, who would no doubt have been named by the honourable members for Fisher and Boothby if they had been subject to scrutiny under administrative procedures prescribed by this Bill. Over the luncheon break, I must confess, I was so intrigued by the interjection of the honourable member for PhUlip that I looked up the board of the Adelaide 'Advertiser', these entrepreneurs in the fields that the honourable members for Fisher and Boothby so righteously deplore. I must say I was intrigued to find that the Deputy Chairman of the Board is in fact a Liberal-Country League member of the South Australian Legislative Council. Judging by the decorations appearing after the names of other gentlemen on the board, I think their political persuasion was not dissimilar. Looking back on the whole thing, I suspect that the sponsors of the original legislation, the original Book Bounty Act, were acting in the best mterests of their supporters when they impressed upon their pubUc servants the need for a measure of reticence in these matters and that the honourable members for Fisher and Boothby will be opening up a Pandora's Box if they press their demands for the disclosure of the pubUcations which attract bounty and have attracted it from the inception. The Government has brought down this legislation in conformity with the desire, shared by all parties in this House, that the book pubhshing trade in this country should not die. It has made a realistic adjustment from the original level of 25 per cent to the level of 3316 per cent prescribed in the legislation before us today to see that that intention is given effective expression. I believe that this is legislation which is likely to be with us for many years to come and that we should all support it.",52
141,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",52
142,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,Order! Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,52
143,Mr ADERMANN,BROADCASTING STATIONS LICENCE,"Yes. I do not think it was advertently done but the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) brought into the debate the name of the Griffin Press. I do not recall mentioning it. He talked about its associations with the Adelaide 'Advertiser'. I did not mention that. He said that I deplored the Griffin Press but I would not like it inferred that I was accusing Griffin Press of any particular type of publication. What I did say was that every publisher should make available the names of the books on which bounty is claimed. I was not picking out any firm, any publisher or any printer for any purpose. I want to make it clear that if my remarks were interpreted in that way they were not meant in that way. Quesdon resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Daly) read a third time. NA",52
144,Mr GILES,BRANDY INDUSTRY,"by leave- I wish to clear up a misstatement I made this morning. During the grievance debate I said that under price regulation in South Australia growers of grapes received $70 a ton for the produce they sell to brandy producers. I have been informed that the figure should have been $72.40. I said that the gross rake-off by the Government $1,100. In fact it is $1,235. BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE tion of The following Bills were returned from the Senate without amendment: State Grants (Universities) Bill 1974. Universities Commission Bill 1974. Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Bill 1974. REMUNERATION TRIBUNALS BILL 1974 Officers Debate resumed from 19 September (vide page 1555), on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second ume. Mr MALCOL M FRASER (Wannon) (2.39)-The Opposition supports this legislation. The original legislation concerning the Remuneration Tribunal was clearly somewhat hurriedly drafted and that has led to necessity clear up some of the provisions of that legislation by means of the Bill that we now have before As the House would know, the former jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal beyond the limits set out in the existing Act to make sure that the Tribunal can cover all the higher salaries of the Commonwealth. That is a principle that the Opposition supports. At the same time, there were a number of other areas apparently included in the original legislation but which were not meant to be included. As the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) said in his second reading speech Trade Commissioners, to use them as an example, were included and they have now been clearly excluded in this legislation. The Opposition looks upon these changes as clarifications, as technical changes. The Bill proposes a new section relating to academic salaries. For a long while I have feltand it is Opposition policy-that there ought to be a tribunal to look at academic salaries. Third Reading Although there have been independent tribunals in the past, people in the universities have generally had to argue for six or nine months before they could get a tribunal established. There were no set procedures and no settimefor a review of their remuneration. This Bill will enable a more regular procedure to be developed. I think that is consistent and proper. There is no real reason why academics in universities should have no court to which to go. They are about the last brandy group to be covered in some regular way. There are some differences, as the Minister would be aware, between the procedures for acawas demics and the procedures for Commonwealth pubhc servants. In this respect I draw the attenthe Minister to a letter that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) wrote either to the Minister or to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) concerning representations made by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. I merely note that it is apparent that the Government has chosen not to take up the requests put forward by the Administrative and Clerical Association. It should also be noted that Second Reading whereas determinations of the tribunal dealing with pubhc servants and others need to be made at one time, for the purpose of determining the salary of academics the Chairman of the Tribunal is constituted as a separate tribunal and can report at any time. I merely note that as a difference and I point out that the Government did not take up the point made by the ACOA, which was probably put directly to the Minister to but which was also put to htm through the Leader of the Opposition. The Opposition supus. ports the measure and wishes it a speedy and Bill expands the peaceful passsage.",53
145,Mr COATES,BRANDY INDUSTRY,"We are debating the Remuneration Tribunals Bill. I would like to concentrate mainly on those aspects of the Bill affecting academic salaries. The Bill also deals with other matters, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out, including the inclusion of certam senior officers similar to statutory officers amongst those for whom the Remuneration Tribunal should determine salaries, and the exclusion of certain less senior officers for whom it is not appropriate for the Tribunal to determine salaries. As the House is well aware, the Remuneration Tribunal was set up as an independent body to determine the salaries of first division officers of the Austrahan PubUc Service, statutory office holders, members of Parliament and judges. This Bill extends the Remuneration Tribunal Act to include an Academic Salaries Tribunal which wiU have the responsibUity of determining all academic salaries for universities and colleges of advanced education and the salaries for some other senior employees ofthose institutions such as vice-chanceUors, registrars and bursars. The Academic Salaries Tribunal will be separate from the Remuneration Tribunal itself, and case hence the title of the Act is being altered to Remuneration Tribunals Act. Determinations of the Academic Salaries Tribunal will strictly apply only to the Territories, but of course will be the basis for the States grants which will be necessary for the same salaries to be paid academics in institutions set up under State legisquaUfications lation. The Tribunal will consist of only one man, the Chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal aUy. itself, Mr Justice Campbell, but assessors can be appointed, as they have been appointed in the past, and the procedure wiU be the same as for the fuU Tribunal. It will have power to decide when to make reports and determinations, and the Mmister will have to table a copy of the determination in each House within IS sitting days of receiving it. Either House wiU have the power to disaUow any determination within 15 sitting days after tabUng. It must be a single determination, so that any disallowance would be an all or nothing operation. It may be worthwhile tracing some of the hismonths tory of this issue. Until now academics have probably the only group in the work force not have a salaries tribunal or sinular machinery review what they should be paid. Members of Parliament and senior members of the Public Service shared this distinction with them until late last year. What happened in past years academic staff was that ad hoc inquiries were held from time to time to review academic salaries. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Wannon say that the Opposition supports the appointment of permanent review machinery because honourable members opposite did nothing about it during the whole time they were in office. The ad hoc reviews were usually few and far between. I will not go right back to the Eggleston inquiries of previous years. The most recent case was the appointment of Mr Justice Campbell by the previous Government in September 1972 to conduct an inquiry. He reported to this Government in May 1973. The Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) tabled that repon on 17 May 1973. The repon recommended increases of between 21 per cent and 24 per cent-the higher percentage being recommended for the lower levels, which was only right. Judge Campbell also recommended the estabhshment of an independent tribunal for regular salary reviews, as had been asked for by staff associations for many years. That increase was thefirstpay rise since 1970. As a member of the staff of the University of Tasmania at that time and an active member of the Staff Association, I had helped to prepare the for the tutor and senior tutor levels for the the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations to present to the inquiry. It was pleasing that that part of the submission was largely acthey cepted, because, as honourable members may be aware, the sub-lecturer levels of teaching staff to had been well behind those with equivalent and responsibilities in the school teaching service and the Public Service generOn 28 May last year the Minister for Education announced that the report had been accepted. He further announced on 20 June that the States, which then stUl shared the costs of universities and colleges of advanced education, had also agreed to the increases. Unfortunately, it was not until 4 AprU this year that the Government announced that it would legislate to set up permanent machinery. As honourable members wiU recall, 4 April was only a few days before the double dissolution, with the consequent election, and hence the whole issue was held up for the it took for the election to be decided, for been the Parliament to reassemble and so on. So into July the Government asked Mr Justice Campbell to to proceed with an interim inquiiy pending the legislation being changed to provide for the permanent machinery. Once again, shortly after that event in July, the Senate disallowed the report of for the Remuneration Tribunal. That was the one referring to honourable members and senators and also to senior levels of the Pubhc Service. Following that, I can well understand Mr Justice Campbell wondering whether he ought tp proceed with his interim review. Because of this doubt the Government decided early in September to give Mr Justice Campbell statutory backing and to advance this legislation. On 19 September an Opposition member asked the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) what was happening about the interim review. It was on that day that notice was given that the Remuneration Tribunal Act would be altered. The Minister said at the time: The signincant factor of the whole report of the Remuneration Tribunal is that it was disallowed in another House. No doubt the honourable memberreferring to the member of the Oppositiontook part in a ballot in his own Party as to what it in relation to that disallowance. was disallowed, Mr Justice Campbell felt it would be improper and inappropriate to proceed with any determination without statutory support. The reason nothing has been done with respect to academic salaries is due directly activities of the Opposition. It is because of that, as the honourable member would know if he looked at today's notice paperthat is, for 19 Septemberthat we are to introduce a Bill to amend the Remuneration Tribunal Act, which will allow for academic salaries to be so determined. I am very confident that if the Opposition will give its support and the proposed legislation becomes law His Honour will then proceed with that interim determination. The Bill was then introduced, and we are now debating it. Once it is passed- I anticipate that it is important will be passed as the Opposition, at least in this possible because House, is giving it support-Judg e Campbell can ahead until the Bill go ahead. The Bill allows him to go ahead himas he does, I am certain self and make a report at any time, but he may the staff associations of universities still wish to have some indication from the of advanced education and their national Government as to what the Government will will be ready immediately to put submissions support. Perhaps it could be said that, in the current economic climate and with a rather informal freeze on higher salary levels, only levels of academic salaries should be determined. Professors are currently being paid $18,600 per annum. I am certainly not plugging for them. Their salary is at about the level of those officers who will not receive an increase bemending cause of the disallowance of the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal. Even though their increase last year was the only one since 1970 they may have to forgo it for the time being, as readers who receive $15,500 may have Certainly at least the levels of lecturers and below deserve a review and an increase, particuthe larly the lower levels I mentioned before tutors and senior tutors. Mr Justice Campbell's report of last year hasfixedup the situation to a certain extent. I would like to quote briefly from part of what he said in paragraph 7.1: Very early in the course of my Inquiry, it became clear to me that sub-lecturer staff in ^Australian universities were suffering greater disabilities, in relation to salaries, than other members of the academic staff. Unlike senior grades of lecturer and above, sub-lecturer grades have not been standardised in terms of qualifications, functions, responsibilities, nomenclature, salaries and other conditions of appointment. Substantial disparities exist not only among universities generally, but also, in some cases, within individual universities. I could point out to the House that the commencing salary for a tutor-demonstrator, as recommended by Mr Justice Campbell last year, was $5,500. Apart from the national wage case increase, that remains the salary. Of course, it is now below average weekly earnings. I am not would do suggesting that in this debate we should have a Naturally, when the report work value inquiry ourselves as to what junior members or the teaching staff at universities and colleges of advanced education should be paid, to the but I think it would be acknowledged that, in comparison with what school teachers and graduates entering the Public Service receive on commencement, tutors and senior tutors should receive an increase. Therefore I hope that Mr Justice Campbell will proceed rapidly with an inquiry and that the Government will encourage him to do that, even if the Government discourages him from bringing in any recommendations about professors and readers. That covers the history of academic salaries. It that the Bill be passed as quickly as Mr Justice Campbell cannot go receives royal assent. As soon that representatives of and colleges bodies to him. I hope that if he does intend waiting for the nod from the Special Minister of State he will quickly receive the nod and proceed with the the lower inquiry. I support the Bill.

Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-SmithSpecial Minister of State and Minister Assisting Prime Minister in Matters relating to the of Public Service) (2.55)- A machinery amendment to clause 9 has been circulated to all honourable members. The relevant part of that clause reads: Section 7 of the principal Act is amended(c) by omitting sub-section (9) and substituting the following sub-sections:'(9) Remuneration or allowances to which a subsisting determination applies shall, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law of Australia, of any law of a State or Territory, effect by vinue of such a law or of any contract, but subject to the succeeding provisions of this section(a) in the case of remuneration or allowances payable to a person who(i) holds an office or appointment as, or as a (ii) holds an office or appointment as a direcbeing a corporation or company that has funds under its control pay the remuneration or allowances-be paid in accordance with the determination out of those funds; and I move: In proposed secuon 7 sub-section (9) paragraph (a) (i) after 'corporation', insert 'or an office or appointment as a member of a body established to manage, conduct or control the business or affairs of, or otherwise to perform functions in relation to, such a corporauon'. It appears that there are certain groups in a category not yet denned-group s such as the Export Payments Insurance Corporation which has a board of management. The amendment seeks to include that sort of structure so that officers of such boards of management can be paid from the management's funds. It is felt that unless this is done it will be a charge on Consolidated Revenue. The amendment merely seeks to ensure that structures such as the one mentioned pay the officers from their own funds. Amendment agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment; report-by leave-adopted . But (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen)-by leave-rea d a third time. NA BOUNTY BILL 1974 Debate resumed from 26 September (vide page 1854), on motion by Dr JF CAIRNS: That the Bill be now read a second time.",54
146,Dr EDWARDS,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"As the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) stated in his second reading speech, the purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's decision to adopt a recommendation of the then TariffBoard that assistance by way of bounty be afforded the manufacture in Australia of sealed unit compressors of 1.5 kW or less, the bounty to be in addition to the protective tariff. The tariff rate on these compressors, following the 25 per of any instrument having cent across-the-board cut, was 43.125 per cent. What extraordinary apparent precision! In its report of 10 October 1973 on 'Domestic Appliances, Heating and Cooling Equipment, Etc' the Board recommended that the tariff rate be member of, or in the service or employ- reduced to 25 per cent but that for a period of 2 ment of, a public statutory corporation; or years from 4 February 1974 a bounty of $5 be paid per compressor with an annual limit of $2m tor of, or in the service or employment of, to the subsidy. Since it is held to be important an incorporated company, from the point of view of the finished appliance manufacturers that the new 25 per cent rate that are lawfully available to apply immediately the provision of this bounty is essential if the industry is to have any chance to survive, so the Opposition supports the Bill. At page 11 of its report the TariffBoard states: . . . local production costs (and consequently disabilities against imports) are . . . so high that it may not be possible to reorganise production in Australia on an economic basis. Later on that page it states: Useful economies would be realised if production were less fragmented. There is also substantial excess capacity. It is clear that the local demand for compressors in this range will support economic production by no more than one company, and even then economic production may not be possible without continued substantial expon sales. Hence the board considered that the present main producer . . . should be given the opponunity to develop profitable operation under the proposed level of protection. Later in the report the Board says: It would . . . be in the interests of all concerned if other manufacturers took rd vantage of the adjustment assistance provisions being recommended to discontinue their present production which operates largely on a marginal cost basis. There are those who would argue that this represents an unacceptable degree of interThird Reading ference with private industry and the market mechanism. But for my part I would not accept that view; rather I believe it is only reasonable to recognise that the vitality and competitive power of Australian manufacturing will benefit from the greater rationalisation of manufacturing industry. I say that, notwithstanding the Second Reading philosophy of the Trade Practices Act which pushes the other way. In point of fact too much of this is happening today. The trade practices law, the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Industries Assistance Commission are all pulling, or perhaps pushing, industry in different directions. I have said that I support the proposed rationalisation. In fact, I wish the Government would come up with a bit of planned rationalisation in the colour television area. What a shambles looks like emerging there, repeating all the chaos of the early days of monochrome television. Far from heeding the warning of the Tariff Board on fragmentation and its advice on rationalisation, the Government and, in particular, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), seem to have gone out of their way to welcome newcomers. Broadly, therefore, I support the Board's recommendations and the intention of the Government as evidenced by the terms of the Bill, notably clause 5(b), to give effect to these recommendations. But the rationaUsation of this and other parts of the appliance industry, especially the domestic white goods industry, is commendable and desirable providing 2 things apply: First that the machinery for structural adjustment is around and functioning effectively. As yet I suspect it is not much more than words on paper-and likewise the labour retraining and relocation program. With present Government poUcies, both parts of the adjustment program are going to be increasingly necessary. But second, this rationaUsation of industry in the manufacture of these compressors, the subject of the Bill, and in the areas where others are to be 'adjusted to' is OK if subsequently the Australian firms in these several areas of production can command the market. One may be forgiven for feeling some conper cern- a whole lot of concern-as to whether this will be so. The rate of protection recommended for most things covered by this reference, estic Appliances' is 25 per cent. That, as I have said, is the long term rate recommended for comprinciple, pressors, the subject of this Bill. But even the does not know whether it is adequate. Thus the Board states at page 12 of its report: Because of the significance of the price of compressors the cost efficiency of (and the market goods industries using them (as well as for more general economic reasons) it is considered that they should be accorded no higher rate of protection than that being recommended for white goods generally, viz., 25 per cent. But. . . it remains uncertain whether such duties will suppon profitable production in Australia. As I said, even the IAC does not seem to know whether this rate will be adequate. But if we ask why the rate being recommended for white goods generaUy is 25 per cent we find a pretty general and wide ranging discussion culminating in this- I quote from page 7 of that Tariff Board report: In determining the appropriate duty rates, the Board has paid considerable regard to the points of reference described and discussed in recent Annual Repons and panicularly to the range of effective protection designated as 'low cost by Australian standards', viz. up to 25 per cent effective. The duties recommended are, except for a few cases, equivalent to effective protection of the order of 25 per cent. We had a general and wide-ranging discussion culminating in that statement. I submit that that is hardly what one could call a convincing basis for so important a decision in the particular-this particular-case . I take this opportunity to assert again that the arithmetic or statistical levels of protection and points of reference just referred to are not accepted in the tariff poUcy of the Liberal Party. Evidently however, the Board-no w the Industries Assistance Commission-and the Government in accepting the report, is so committed, especially, as the passage I quoted underlined, to the 'low point' or to what one might call the magical 25 per cent which keeps coming up. It came up in the report on foundation garments tabled yesterday. It is the same long-term rate recommended for the motor vehicle industry. It is the rate recommended for many of the goods under reference in the electronics industrythough that was not accepted by the Government which opted for a 35 per cent level. One could extend the list. The proposition evidently is- certainly there is an increasingly widespread beUef in industry that this is so-and that what cannot survive at 25 cent is dispensable. This is not the occasion to enlarge further on this theme. It is however, I believe, a matter of truly major moment for the 'Domsound working and economic development of Australia. If what is suggested were the guiding it is not good enough, and the developIAC ment by the Government of a national industrial poUcy with the tariff as the servant of the policy, not an end in itself, is becoming increasingly to urgent. Meanwlule, the Opposition supports the available to) the white Bill before the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1974-75 Debate resumed from 2 October (vide page 2106), on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Snedden had moved by way of amendment: That all words after'That' be stituting the following words: that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's economic that: (1) unemployment is permitted to grow and the prospect for school leavers is prejudiced, (2) inflation is accelerated, (3) existing poverty is ignored and new poverty is created, (4) personal income tax is increased 45 per cent, (5) living standards will be lowered, (6) private enterprise is stifled, (7) Government power is further centralised, (8) individual incentive and thrift is penalised, and (9) a double tax is levied on estates; and because the Government: (a) has made the Budget a socialist vehicle to intensify the attack on the States and break down enterprise system, (b) believes the absurdity that the Government spend without people paying or can build people producing, and (c) has preached private restraint but has threatened achievement by its own Government extravagance.'",56
147,Mr LUSHER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"Last night I had the opportunity to make a 10 minute contribution to this Budget debate. Today 10 minutes of my speakingtimeremains. I am sorry that members of the Labor Party are not thronging into the chamber in their full numbers to Usten to my speech because it will contain a bit of fresh thinking. Government members have sat opposite for the last week or two and have asked us where we would make cuts in proposed expenditure. Last night, I made reference to this and suggested a few areas where we might start. To pick up the threads of my argument, I will repeat a few of these points today. I suggested first of all",58
148,Mr UREN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,Is your name Jones?,58
149,Mr LUSHER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"No, it is not Jones.",58
150,Mr UREN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,There was a Jones here once.,58
151,Mr LUSHER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,Sorry .,58
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,Order! The honourable member for Hume will address the Chair.,58
153,Mr LUSHER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"The Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Mr Uren, was interrupting. The national pipeline is one project on which we could start. Its construction wiU cost mUlions and miUions and millions of doUars. This area of Second Reading activity properly belongs to private enterprise. In a time when private enterprise is supposed to be (Budget Debate) slack, this would have been a magnificent opportunity for the Government to show its magnanimity and to transfer one project back to the private sector. But no. It is to be paid for out of Commonwealth revenue. Mr Kelly-Isn' t there something also about omitted with a view to subpaintings? 'this House is of the opinion crises, in Mr LUSHER-Yes . I was going to come to the arts. I suggested last night that we could make serious cuts in the allocation of money to the arts. We are spending a fortune in the purchase of such things as 'Blue Poles' and 'Woman V . We are now moving into the area of ceilings, sculptures, birds and that sort of thing. I sincerely believe that we could stop making an absolute fool of Australia in the eyes of art people around the world.",58
154,Mr COHEN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,Stic k it into superphosphate.,58
155,Mr LUSHER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"Yes, stick it in to the free superphosphate; the money would be far more efficiently expended. The situation now is that can the art brokers of the world are rubbing their without hands together every time Australia goes on a its spree. What sort of a spree has it been? It is about time that we gave serious thought to expending the money aUocated to this area on far more acceptable purposes. I made mention also of unemployment and the rackets which are going on. Vast sums in unemployment benefits are being paid out to people who are perfectly able to work but who will not accept jobs. People in fact are drawing unemployment benefits in two, three or four different centres. This is providing them with a very comfortable income, thank you. I spoke also of the 115 committees and commissions of mquiry which have been set up by this Government. These bodies are costing vast amounts of public funds and are not serving any particularly useful purpose. I referred also to the growth which has taken place under this Government in the size of the Public Service. We have suggested that the growth ceUing should be much lower than that established by this Government. I mentioned also the overseas jaunts which have been occurring for some months past and which are taking place at this time. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) is presently on his eighth overseas trip. People are fed up with the waste of money occurring on these sorts of things in the Government sector. Another area of concern is expenditure on Aboriginals. I support completely the idea that money should be expended in the area of Aboriginal policy to try to overcome some of the problems that are experienced in this respect. But it is no answer for the Government just to make untold hundreds of millions of dollars available, as it is doing, and then wiping its hands of the problem and saying: 'Well, we have done our bit'. Far more concrete policies and a far more satisfactory and sensible approach to the expenditure of thatmoney are called for. What has happened is that all members of the Labor Party who are in government today have been issued with the same economic primer. They cannot even get a grasp of that. They cannot understand even the basic facts. They are all digging around trying to find the few benefits that this Budget will provide. Nobody can argue that any Budget does not have some good features. But they are failing to see the total impact of the Budget and its overall effect. Nobody seems to understand those aspects. They all have the same tutor in economics just as they seem to have the same drama tutor, because they all sound identical. They are not prepared to be original because they are all being totally dominated by this structure that is being laid on from the top. Yesterday I asked how Labor members hold their heads up when they go into their electorates and hear what their fellow men and supporters are saying to them when they into their electorates. How can they possibly hold their heads up in such surroundings? It is a Budcountry get of absolute hypocrisy. Yet, members of the Labor Party go home and say that they have increased welfare benefits and that the people should be happy about that The people will retralian alise, as the months roll on, just what a this Budget has been. What about this hypocrisy of restraint? Restraint is being called for everybody in the Government. The Ministers and the backbenchers are all running around saying that we have to have restraint. Among those calls for restraint come the proposals to boost government expenditure by more than per cent. That follows an increase of 20 per cent last year. So, we have had an increase comfortI ably in excess of 50 per cent in government expenditure. We are watching and witnessing a massive shift from the private sector to the public sector. This is a socialistic approach. There are plenty areas, such as housing and the pipeline which mentioned, where money could nave been better applied within the private sector. I quote the Treasurer The relatively subdued conditions in prospect in the private sector provide the first real opportunity we have had to transfer resources to the public sector. What is the basis for that statement? Having brought the economy to its knees, having completely destroyed it and having pulled the rug out from underneath it, is the Government in a position to say that because of subdued conditions that exist in the private sector it will drag all the resources into the public sector? I suggest that the Government could easily have spent the money, if it wanted to, in providing some stimulus, some incentive and some meaningful tax cuts to the economy-to business, to the private sector and to individuals-rathe r than these phoney tax cuts that will be meaningless by Christmas. The Government could easily have got some activity going in the private sector so that it could have taken up its own slack. The Government has created conditions for making further inroad into the private sector and transferring much more into the public sector. This Budget will add significantly to wage claims and industrial unrest as people inevitably fight to maintain the real value of their wages in their pockets. This Government, with its meaningless tax cuts and its massive shift into the public sector, will create many more problems, much more can unemployment, much more pressure on wages the pubs in and much more inflation. go What could the Government have done in this Budget about interest rates? Interest rates in this are at an all-time high. It is a disaster, particularly for those who are trying to buy a home. The Labor Party says that a person has to own his own home. It says that that is the Ausdream and it will see that people get their disaster own home. Eight or nine months ago the repayments on an average $20,000 mortgage by through a building society were $150 a month. Today on the same mortgage as a result of interest increases the payments are $230 a month. That is hitting the pocket of the average fellow, the litde fellow, the chap who is supposed 30 to be being taken care of by the Labor Party wanted to make reference to the capital gains tax and the serious effect it will have on family farms, small businesses and the general economy in the private sector. I wanted to make reference also to the Prime Minister's statements in overseas arenas about what this Government could of do for providing the hungry world with food. I I wanted to refer also to what it could have done in this Budget to provide some incentive in the area of agricultural production so that we could have looked forward to some stimulation, some increased production and some better productivity in this area.",58
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,60
157,Mr COHEN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"During the past 2 weeks of this Budget sitting I have listened intently to the speeches of members of the Opposition-and those that I have been unable to hear I have followed in Hansard-hopin g against hope to hear some contributions that were original; some contributions that, if not original, at least showed some depth of understanding of the sort of problems that face Australia today. I had hoped and even expected to find some comprehensive plan for how Australia, alone of aU the advanced economic countries today, could solve its economic problems. I thought that the first infusion of new blood into the ParUamentary Liberal Party for many years might mtroduce into this Budget debate the first glimmer of rethinking of its social and economic poUcies in nearly 3 decades. TragicaUy for this country, that was not to be. The new Liberals are the same as the old Liberals but without the wrinkles, the paunches and the grey hair. Nothing has changed. The new faces and the old faces are shouting the same old tired cUches about manning the barricades against the terrible Whidam sociaUst government. They are loud in their praise of individual endeavour and the hoUest of hoUes-fre e enterprise. HopefuUy they will reaUse that one needs a litde more than cUches to run a country and to solve the economic problems that beset the world today. Rarely does one find in this place any real debate on political phUosophy. Listening to members of the Liberal and Country Parties using these tired old phrases, one gains the impression that for them the debate is over; that if one can say the word 'sociaUst' with enough sneer in one's voice and the words 'free enterprise' with enough reverence, there is nothing more to be said. It may have been appropriate in the forties and thefifties.It may even have appUed in the early sixties. But for 1974 it is positively ludicrous. Opposition members do not seem to reaUse that in the past 10 to IS years a new generation has grown up. It is a new educated generation which is not satisfied with slogans of the Left or of the Right. It wants answers to today's problems with less simplistic and less dishonest catch-cries. I am surprised that members of the Opposition have not realised that more and more people see the absurdities of Liberals being champions of the free enterprise system whUe at the same time doing their level best to see that the system is anything but free and anything but enterprising. If they genuinely wanted free enterprise-which , as I understand it, means the law of supply and demand and the flow of free market forces free of any form of government controls-the y would applaud any move to reduce tariffs, but they do not; they would applaud the end to special government handouts to business by way of tax incentives, depreciation aUowances or special write-offs for businesses of any kind, but they do not, they would oppose any form of market control, Umited franchises, restrictive trade practices, monopoly contols, price fixing or any of the other cosy Uttle agreements between government and business and between business and other businesses that grew up during their 23 years in government, but they do not. Not only do they oppose these moves, but they scream like stuck pigs when those terrible socialists try to create some of that very free enterprise environment which they claim to admire so ardently. What I find so amusing about the debate is that those who profess so loudly in this Parliament their faith in free enterprise know virtually nothing about the subject, primarily because few of them have had any business experience at all. It will probably come as a shock to many Liberal and Country Party supporters to find that probably fewer than half a dozen of them have had business experience. The majority are farmers and lawyers. Let that not be interpreted as an attack on farmers and lawyers, but they are not noted for their business experience. This has been perfectly obvious in the inflationrevaluation-devaluation-tariff debate that has occupied so much of ourtimeduring the past 18 months and during this Budget debate. Members of the Opposition have totaUy faUed to understand what was happening in the business world and the necessity for the Government to take the steps it took when one takes into account the lack of powers that the Government has avaUable to it through the obstruction of the Senate and the restrictions placed on it by the Constitution. Shortly after we came to office an inflationary situation had arisen through factors totally outside the control of the Australian Government. The 1972 Budget, aimed at winning the December election by pumping money indiscriminately into the economy; the huge inflow of foreign capital and avaUable funds which enable anyone and everyone who wanted to take off on some speculative venture to do so without any consideration of the supply of goods, labour and materials that was available; and the international rise in prices of commodities such as wool, wheat, meat and so on and later oil caused a rapid rise in domesdc inflation. That did not stop the Liberal and Country Parwater, ties from blaming the Labor Party. In fact, if one reads speeches made by members of the Oppoand sition from March to June 1973 when the of Government had made no major economic let moves that would, at that stage, have had any significant effect on the economy, one is struck the absurdity of their claim that the then exisung inflauon rate of from 8 per cent to 10 per cent was the fault of the Australian Labor Governwho ment, when it was obvious that at that point the mflation we were suffering was totaUy as a result of economic poUcies pursued by them during investment. their last months in office. Lacking powers over prices and operating in free market economy, the Government took only steps open to it to reduce inflation. It revalued the currency twice and cut tariffs across the board by 25 per cent to reduce prices to the consumer. It also tightened the inflow of foreign capital, much of which had gone into land specutariff lation and development, to take some of the pressure off the buUding industry which had per reached absurd levels of growth and was forcing the price of land and housmg through the roof; whUe at the sametimeit was buUding office blocks that were not needed. Representing one of those areas that had had one of the highest growth rates in Australia, had a fair insight into the mad speculation had gone on during the previous 2 years. Land often changed hands two or threetimesin a few months with each new speculator putting a few doUars deposit on the land and placing it back on the market after adding a few thousand dollars to the price. The price of land I purchased build a home on in 1970 had risen cent. House buUding had reached the absurd position where a person wanting a house built agree could wait from six or eight months for comcorrect,with pletion. There was a mad scramble buUders outbid each other for skUled tradesmen. compensates the the I was told of one example where in notices were posted each day by local offering $35, then $40 andfinaUy$45 per day for bricklayers. Bricks, naUs,timberwere unobtainathem. ble or mvolved long delays. It became perfectly obvious to anyone with even half a brain that be providing unlimited funds for land and buUding, buyaamug did not provide homes; it merely of inflation. Another disastrous cost of this situation that virtuaUy no labour was avaUable for low income houses, housing commission homes or for pubUc works. Areas Uke the Central Coast where buUding booms had taken off were already years behind in basic amenities, such as sewerage, roads, drainage, kerbing and guttering, welfare, recreational, sporting, health educational faciUties. What hope was there providing the needs and doing the new works, alone catching up on the backlog of services from 23 years of Liberal-Country Party rule, and by 8 years of State Liberal Government. This mflation caused by the Liberals' handling of the economy had created the situation where anyone did not have his money in land and property speculation, and instead had it invested in banks, buUding societies, etc., was losing heavUy on his The profits being made in this area were simia larly having its effect in the retaU market where the consumer demand was rocketing ahead of our capacity to produce the goods. Only last Christmas the Ust of items that could not be purchased in the shops was a daUy news item in the Press. At that stage the effect of the revaluations and cuts had not been felt. Retailers were having a ball with turnovers up by an average of 25 cent to 30 per cent. Despite their orchestrated screams about rising overheads they were making bigger profits than they had ever made in their history. They had had 2 bumper years but that was nothing to what they were planning to make out of the imported goods that were due to I hit the market for the winter and summer of that 1974. What the business world was doing was neither moral nor immoral; it was amoral, because business has no morals-that is at least when it is talking about profit margins. No doubt this will bring forth a cry of horror from the business community. What I have said is no condemto nation of businessmen, but simply a condemby 400 per nation of the system. The free enterprise purists will argue, and I right them, that there is no such tiling as the or moral profit mark-up. The right for labour as mark-up is what market will allow. No one a hotel, goods at a loss, which he when retailer he has to seU his buUders No one, he would argue, occasionally should has to do. therefore, dictate what his profits should be when he can make If he can buy a block of land for $5,000 and seU it next month for $ 10,000 why should he and sell it for $7,500? Why, if he can fuelled the fires in Australiafrom shirt for Hong Kong at $2 and can sell it $8, should he therefore sell it at $3.50 or $4? He does not think of himself as was being immoral or as a profiteer; he see himself simply as a good businessman. He did nothing ulegal, so why does society condemn him as a profiteer? He would argue that no one was forced to buy his merchandise. Providing he does not misrepresent the product and keeps his side of the bargain then, he beheves he should be admired, not denigrated. His responsibility to himself and his company is to buy as low as possible, to sell as high as possible and to pay as litde as is required in costs, including labour, to maximise his profit. Anyone who does otherwise, again he would argue, is either a fool or a bad businessman. Normally this system of supply and demand operates fairly successfully. I mean successfully in the sense that the competition in the market place usually reaches a level that enables a few to make substantial profits because they are more efficient at what they are doing, the majority to make a comfortable living and a few to go under. The market adjusts itself between over-supply and under-supply, enabling the public to receive goods at reasonable prices. There are, of course, constant abuses of the free market system such as monopolies, cartels, price fixing, restrictive trade practices and straight-out fraud. Governments both here and abroad have tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to moderate these abuses. However, these abuses aside, every now and then the system fails to work, as it has in Australia and other parts of the world during the past 12 to 18 months. The Government, lacking power over prices and incomes and able only tofine-tunethe economy by exercising the controls it has over the flow of money both into and within the country, and its powers of cunency valuation and tariffs, sought to make the market more competitive and less speculative by using those powers. The reduction in the tariffs and the revaluation of the currency should have led to lower prices of imported goods, particularly in the electrical, clothing, textile and footwear industries. That it failed to do so initially was caused by importers and retailers in particular, being able to sell goods they bought at the same prices, and even higher pnces in some circumstances, than they had previously. The only difference was that after the tariff cuts they were buying the goods at half the price of locally manufactured articles of a similar quality. Let me give an example of how it works. The price of a locally manufactured shin is $5. The retailer sells it for $8, showing a margin of 60 per cent. After revaluation and tariff cuts, plus the fact that it probably was originally a bit cheaper overseas anyhow, he can now buy it for $3. If there were such a thing as business morality he would sell at, say, $3, showing a better mark-up of 66 per cent The market, however, is buoyant and he sells is easily for $8. The profit margin is not now 60 per cent; it is 170 per cent. This is only a mild example of the son of mark-ups that have been operating over the past 12 months. The example I have cited here is typical of every time ofbusiness enterprise, whether one is talking about clothing, textiles, real estate, minerals, building materials or whatever. The opportunities open to the retailer to maximise his profits were created by Government action.He will not act unilaterally to co-operate with the Government's objectives. He will be forced by further Government actions to create a climate which forces him to lower his prices. Even in countries hke the United States, which has the power to control prices, he will react like the beef producer and withdraw his cattle from the market until the price freeze is over.  Government.",60
158,Mr COHEN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"What gives me a pain in the neck when I listen to people like the honourable member for Kooyong is not that this occurs in a capitalist society, but the incessant whining of the business community that the Government should not interfere in free enterprise. If the honourable member really meant that he would be pleading for an end to all Government action - stabilisatio n schemes, guaranteed floor prices, tax incentives, subsidies, restrictive trade practices protection, award wages and the removal of all tariffs and import controls. Of course he does not believe in that and neither do we. So stop talking all this garbage about free enterprise. What each business sector wants is action on its behalf to maximise its profits. It is not the responsibility of one retailer to look after other sectors ofbusiness and also the consumer. What the Government has to do is constantly to balance the needs of each sector of the community to bring about the greatest benefit. Twelve months ago, and even before that, our predecessors were faced with the problem of rocketing land prices. That problem is over. We now have the problem of the crash of some of the speculators and the investors who put their savings into those companies in the hope of making profits out of their speculation. That is the way the system operates. You cannot have it both ways. I recently had the misfortune to read an incredibly ill-informed, incredibly stupid speech by Mr J. H. Valder, Chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange. Quickly brushing off the international situation and the economic situation prevailing when we came to office in 1972, he blamed the present state of the domestic economy on fear-fea r of socialisation. He quoted no facts but simply rattled off a series slogans that sounded more like a speech from once 1949 than the 1970s. I am sure that he made the Rotarians, to whom the speech was given, feel by cutting warm inside, but it was a totally dishonest speech with no other objective, as far as I can see, than late to blame this Government for every that besets this country today. To limited and selective use of prejudice he gave as his example Great Britain and said: I myselffindit hard to escape the conclusion that Australia is being headed in exacdy the same direction that Britain has been going for the past decade or so and where the situation generally now seems to have reached an absolutely critical stage. The inference is clear. Australia is heading in the position same direction as Great Britain because it too has exist in Australia a Labor Government. What garbage. Great Britain has had during the past 24 years, 17 years of anywhere Conservative government and 7 years of British more Labor Party Government. Since June 1970 there honourable have been only 7 months of a Labor government. the United States are Britain's economic problems have continued for solutions that are enshrined years under both political parties-the honourtralian Budget.

If honourable membersthose economic chaos that had reigned early this year the article to which I have referred they would and during 4 years of Conservative rule. I want to conclude, in answering the stupidity of the Valders of the community and the Liberal and Country Parties, by quoting from story in the 'Time' magazine of 9 September 1974.1 think that honourable members would agree that this is hardly a radical rag. magazine stated: The US is afflicted by a massive economic migraine, more than 200 million Americans know too well just much it hurts. There incomes, savings and life-styles being assailed by a whole group of aches and pains. feverish inflation, constriction interest rates. The stock market has scarcely been so since 1929. Just about everybody who buys, sells, borrows invests has that overall feeling of unease. And fast, fast relief in sight. The attack of problems seems to be almost diabolically ordinated. Inflauon drives up interest rates; then Wall Street to pursue the higher interest rates, pushing prices down further; then the impossibility of seUing new stock issues in a collapsing ket make it difficult for companies to raise the money to expand or in some cases even to stay alive, thus ing the threat of recession-o r worse.

I support the Budget. opposite Mr GRAHAM (North Sydney) (3.39)- I The would Uke to begin my speech by saying a few words to my young and learned colleague from and Robertson (Mr Cohen) who has been in this how House for a Umited period oftime.I understand are that he is a successful businessman and therefore There ishe would be quaUfied to make some comment of credit and throbbingly high shaky about the ethics of business people. I feel, howor ever, that the party political type of speech which there is no he made and in which he attacked the Opposition was not a very serious speech in the Ught of cothe circumstances that confront Australia today. money fleesAs we know, the economic downturn within this stock countiy has been compounded by many of the high cost of borrowing and the maractions of the Australian Government, as it now needed prefers to be called, as distinct from the Comintensify-monwealth Government. I would rernind the honourable member for Robertson that the bigof gest shareholder in every business in Australia, the one shareholder who is most dependent upon the success of business in Australia, is his the Treasurer (Mr Crean). There is no in single shareholder in any business in Australia who derives more from the success of that business than does the Treasurer of Australia. It is absurd to see the economy on the one hand as being free enterprise and therefore different and on the other hand as being Government and absorbing enormous benefits from the success of commerce within the country. There is very little variation in humanity or human outlook whether one has a free enterprise economy or a socialist economy. I would advise the honourable member for Robertson if he were still in his place that he would find humanity is much the same on any part of this earth and when there is a black market, as there was certainly in Berlin, London, Tokyo and Sydney during the last war, there are any number of people, including a number of successful socialists, who are prepared to make what is know colloquially in the United States as the fast buck. I do not believe that this sort of thinking stops in commerce at all. I think there is ample evidence to indicate that many of the people who are expert in the business of the fast buck have found their way into the ranks of the much vaunted Australian Labor Party. I support the amendment that has been moved on behalf of the Opposition by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden). It states: That all words after 'That' be omitted with the view substituting the following words: 'this House is opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's crisis, in that: (1) unemployment is permitted to grow and the prospect for school leavers is prejudiced, I think that that was not challenged by the honourable member for Robertson(2) inflation is accelerated, That certainly was not challenged by him(3) existing poverty is ignored and new poverty is created, (4) personal income tax is increased 45 per cent, (5) living standards will be lowered, (6) private enterprise is stifled, (7) Government power is further centralised, (8) individual incentive and thrift is penalised, and (9) a double tax is levied on estates; and because the Government: (a) has made the Budget a sociaUst vehicle to intensify the attack on the States and break down the free enterprise system, (b) believes the absurdity that the Government can spend without people paying or can buUd without people producing, and (c) has preached private restraint but has threatened its achievement by its own Government extravagance'. I notice that the Treasurer in his Budget Speech said: The abatement in demand pressures is widened also in the labour market, Unemployment has increased and overtime working has diminished. I want to relate those events-othe r than international influences-whic h have contributed to these circumstances because I believe it is reasonable for us to accept in Australia that we should show how the actions of the Government have contributed to the economic situation and the crisis which we face today. When the members of the Australian Labor Party came to power in 1972 they did so because they had said to the people successfully on that occasion, as they had said unsuccessfully on many previous occasions: 'If you elect us we will do all sorts of things for you. All sorts of goodies will come in the bag. We will spend thousands of millions of dollars extra, which you have not earned but which we will give you because we are going to soak the rich and get it out of their pockets for you'. That was successful to a degree. Suflicient to put them into power. With all the charm of robbers down through the ages, they proceeded in 1973, despite the dire warnings that were being given to them and the red lights that wereflashingaround the world, to honour their promises. They poured hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into honouring their promises, which tended to be fuel for the fire of to inflation that was starting to burn in Australia. of the Certainly they stimulated the economy and cereconomic tainly the unemployment that was apparent in August and September of 1972 had vanished by March, April and May of 1973. But from then on the story becomes one of very great significance for the people of Australia, particularly those people who one would have expected to support the Australian Labor Party. There is a program that must be faced by a serious government if it is to deal with the economic crisis and that is the international program that has been recommended by the Chairman of the Union Bank of Switzerland. I will turn to the international field briefly to give honourable members an Ulustration of the type of thing which has been recommended by this international economist. He said that we must reduce inflation by imposing consistent and restrictive fiscal, monetary and foreign trade measures, with all industrial nations co-operating; end inflation-oriented thinking; recognise the simple truth that we must put something into an economy to get something out of it; gear wage and salary increases to productivity; curb excessive demands for wage increases, greater social benefits, shorter working weeks, and so on; and avoid creating more special-Internationa l Monetary Fund-drawin grights,raising the price of gold, imposing import restrictions, or forcing trade among industrial nations in a bid to correct the balance of payments problems. He said that nations will need to devise a mechanism for recycling of surplus Arab oil money to those countries with balance of payments deficits. He said that there are major difficulties in this would lead to the need for a second from the countries with large monetary reserves In into those with low reserves. That has been refer-stabilised red to in this House in recent weeks by the reached Treasurer and by a former Treasurer, the right towering honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon). the The Chairman of the Union Bank of SwitThat zerland went on to say that governments put theirfinancesin the black primarily by reducing their spending. That means right across produce the board. Even if it is a matter of being lar, if one is talking about a reduction in cation programs, a reduction in social service programs and a reduction in defence programs, one has to face up to the situation because if this country's inflation rate goes to 20 per cent and if inflation is allowed to run riot for 2 years we willresulted find that Australia will be collapsing around ourand ears and we will have hordes of people unemresulted ployed simply because those who provide emThe ployment for them in free enterprise will have crisis, become bankrupt and no longer will be able to sponsibility provide the employment that is the absolute lifeas blood of the workers of this country. Surely it must be clear even to the most of the Government's Ministers that it is no real answer to unemployment to take a man who has been working in some specialfieldand offer employment as a labourer in the building of a swimming pool or toilets in Tasmania or someReserve thing of that nature, as was referred to by Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) in this House yesterday. cratic governments that are able to employ unpopular means to achieve what is necessary and agement appropriate for their economies are the ones which will win the respect of the world and be Cheaper thefirstto put their nations back on to a sound lending and rational level. I was interested in yesterday's article by former Premier of New South Honourable J. T. Lang, who would be well remembered, I am quite sure, by my distheCrucial tinguished friend the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti), who is present in the chamber. The former Premier of New South Wales, the Honourable J. T. Lang, who is now one of the patriarchs of our democracy and who is in his nineties, wrote a very interesting article in which he compared 1930 with 1974. The sage that is quite clear for people who have capacity to comprehend and for people read is that in future years we may look back on the 1974 and see a greater similarity between 1929-30 and 1974 than we in fact realised at this time was possible. At the conclusion of the article whichto which I have referred the Honourable J. T. recycling Lang had this to say: the United States the rate of inflation seems to have at a steady 10.7 per cent a year. In Britain it has 16.S percent, and in Japan 23.4 percent. Israel has a 44 per cent inflauon rate due mainly to the cost of October war, and taxation is currently taking 63 per cent of the national income. paints a terrible picture for the people of must Israel. The article continues: The international bankers and the economists failed to a satisfactory solution of the 1930 world depression, unpopuand now in 1974 the same peopleeduHe does not mean the same people in a physical sense; he means the people occupying the same positions of power and influencehave no answer to the problem of world inflauon. Excessive debt charges and restrictions on borrowing in wholesale bankruptcies and foreclosures in 1930, excessive interest charges and restrictions on credit have in liquidations and forced sale of businesses in 1974. easy way out is to blame the Government for the but the blame lies well beyond that. The primary remust be carried by the reserve banks, which act advisers to the Governments and are the principal originators and directors of monetary policy. With great respect to the former Premier of New obtuseSouth Wales, I doubt very much whether the Reserve Bank of Australia would be prepared to accept responsibility for the monetary and fiscal himpolicies of the Whitlam Government. In fact, I have every reason to suspect that the chiefs of the Bank of Australia would quietly put on the their hats and steal away into the darkness if such an incredible suggestion were put to them. Strong demo-The article continues: The present crisis is entirely in the field of monetary manand that is where the prime responsibility rests for both the world depression of 1930 and that of 1974. money and acceptance of calculated risks by the bodies are the essentials for bringing the present inflation under control. But time is running out. My friend the Treasurer had the hide to come the into this House-thes e words send shivers up and Wales, the down my spine-and say: as the fight against inflation is, it cannot be made sole objective of Government policy. I venture to suggest that by thistimenext year that unfortunate man will be eating his words, because by this time next year it will be clear, even to the thickest ever crust of mankind, that thefightagainst inflation must be the sole main mesobjective of government in this country. the Mr King-Did he not recommend the purchaswho can ing of BHP shares at $7.50?",62
159,Mr GRAHAM,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"My friend from Wimmera has reminded me that on one occasion the Treasurer did recommend putting in orders for BHP shares at $7.50. That was probably a fair enough recommendation some years ago. If he puts m an order next year to buy at $2 he will probably get substantial figures. That is myjudgment on the matter. The Treasurer said: The Government is committed to the program of reform to improve the position of less privileged our society and to maintain employment opportunities. We have said in our amendment that the Budget ignores existing poverty and further increases poverty. After all, for people who were getting small benefit from a $400 deducuon for eduat cation expenses to be told that it had been reduced to $150 is tantamount to admitting again that the Labor Party is out to do all to destroy the independent school system in Australia. It is such a small amount in the context of the $ 16,000m that the Government has taken the concept. from the economy that it seems incredible that it could have been done with any economic motive in mind, and one wonders what on earth the social motive could be. Furthermore, this absurd tax that the Government is going to put on to unearned income in its first introduction to the House is quite clearly a sectional tax that is to bit people who have invested as the years have gone by and accumulated some possible chance of smaU dividends. They are going to find themneglect selves taxed because that particular income is described as unearned income. If I may say that is the most arrant bunkum I have heard years. Most people who exert themselves neglect throughout their lives earn income to invest order to get other income. So in the first place income for most people is income that is earned by some form of endeavour. Surely if you are going to encourage investment, if you want tralian investment- I understand the Governto ment disapproves of investment from overseas from what it describes as foreign multiwere nationals-wh y does it discourage people who are Australians from investing in their own counwith try, because the Government is then going to them by an extra 10 per cent in this Budget? That is itself absurd. I believe that Australians must face up to the fact that the holidays good days are gone for a period oftime,and that probably 60 per cent of the effect of that hitting the 'lucky country' comes from overseas but absolutely certain that 40 per cent comes from the stupidity, the cupidity and the immoral apgrants proach to politics of the Australian Labor Party. They have gone out into the market place with bag in one hand saying: 'Put your vote into hand of mine and take your parcel of goodies out of the bag in the other hand.' I rejea the Budget. I will vote for the amendment and I hope that it will not be long before Australians understand that they have a group of people in their Government who do not know what they are doing as far as this nation and its economy is concerned, people who appear to social have a very limited sense of responsibility and groups in who allow-the best one can say-thei r compassion and their sincerity to get the better of their own judgment, people who want something for nothing and who set abroad in this country this pernicious beUef that you can get something a for nothing when you can not. You can only get it some other poor wretch's expense, and this I warn you is in every social sense the very worse type of concept to have going abroad in the Ausit can tralian community. I hope the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) will do all he can as robusdy and as quickly as he can to stifle",66
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,66
161,Mr DAVIES,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate because it going will enable me as a Tasmanian to answer some of the criticisms that have been levelled at the Australian Labor Government for alleged of the island State of Tasmama. I refer to arguments such as those appearing in the 'Advoso, cate' newspaper in Tasmania on Tuesday, 1 for October, in which they complained about the of the island State. As I say, this debate in has given me an opportunity to put the record straight. Australian Government financial assistance to the State of Tasmania will increase dramatically in 1974-75. In the financial year Aus1973-74 total Australian Government payments the State and its Loan Council program, which was supported by the Australian Government, $225.3m. The corresponding total for this financial year, 1974-75, cannot be estimated precision at this stage but in round terms it is tax expected that over $310m will be avaUable, an increase of approximately 38 per cent. Even after aUowing for cost increases this is a very substanare over, the tial increase indeed. I would like to detaU some of this expenditure and some of the revenue that is avaUable to the I am Tasmanian people from the Australian Labor Government. In connection with general revenue I point out that these are up from $ 10lm in the last financial year to an estimated $130m a in this financial year, 1974-75, an increase of this nearly 30 per cent. General purpose capital funds comprising capital grants and Loan Council borrowings are up from $64m in the last financial year to $76.4m thisfinancialyear. Tasmania will share in the wide variety of new and expanded programs of specific purpose assistance to the States, and I would like to give some special examples. New initiatives are provided in the field of health. An amount of $ 1.6m is provided for public hospitals in Tasmania, and we have never had anything at all before from any Australian Government. In Launceston the Australian Government wiU meet half the cost of the buUding and operation of the new general hospital. In Hobart, the capital city, the Australian Labor Government will whoUy buUd and operate a new women's hospital. In the field of community health services we have never had any assistance at aU before, and in this Budget a sum of $2m is provided. In the field of school dental health, of course, we must be particularly pleased because we got this year an allocation of $3m. I want to stress that Tasmania gets more than 10 per cent of the total aUocation with only 3 per cent of the population. I am particularly pleased that in the Budget papers there is a special mention given to nursing homes. The Treasurer said: It is proposed to amend the National Health Act orise the Minister to enter into agreements with religious, charitable and other non-profit organisations conducting nursing homes, under which the Government will meet the deficits incurred in running the homes. It is planned to introduce this arrangement in January next. The cost in 1974-73 is esumated at $ 1.8m. I know that the nursing homes in Tasmania will be particularly pleased with this innovation of deficit funding. I think every member in this Parliament wiU be pleased, because we know how difficult it is in Tasmania to run these homes. The State Wages Board makes a determination in relation to pay for State nursing staff and after some months there is an appUcation on behalf of staff in private nursing homes. It takes some whUe for this salary determination to flow on, so there is a heavy impost of salary arrears that has to be met by the nursing homes. This deficit funding, where the Commonwealth will enter into an agreement with the nursing homes to assist them with the losses that they incur through no fault of their own-and after doing the wonderful work that they do-wil l certainly be a great innovation in that particular field. Under general roads legislation, Tasmama will receive $31m, which is an increase of more than 40 per cent over the aUocation of the vious 2 years. Over the next 3 years, mcluding this year, Tasmania wiU receive an allocation $53m and $2.7m for urban transport assistance programs. Of course in the field of housing the attitude of this Government to Tasmania is reaUy spectacular. In the last year the Liberal-Country Party Government was in office, Tasmama received an aUocation of $300,000. Last year under a Labor Government this allocation increased to $16m and this financial year that amount wiU be increased to $20m. In thefieldof social security we have done a great deal to keep contact with the people who need assistance and advice. I point out to the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who is the Opposition spokesman sitting at the table, that no new buUdings were constructed in Tasmania by his Government during the last 7 years of its office. Under the Labor Government new offices have been opened up at Devonport, New Norfolk, Queenstown, BeUerive and Glenorchy, and new offices are being considered for Georgetown, HuonvUle and Ulverstone. The Australian Assistance Plan initiated by this Government is of course a magnificent concept. It will bring the people, the community, into the planning stages for welfare programs. In Hobart last year the southern regional councUs were allocated $5,000 and the same amount has been allocated tins year. In Launceston the aUoto authcation to councUs has been doubled from approximately $2,500 last year to $5,000 this year. Councils in the region I am particularly interested in, the Mersey-Lyell area, received $5,000 last year and will receive $6,000 this year to assist with planning and administration expenses. Tasmania'is to receive $6.3m this year for urban and regional development works and this includes $2.7m for sewerage and $2m for the lands commission. There is also a commitment in the Budget for a north-west regional water scheme. I will deal with that matter later. There is also an amount of $ 1.3m in the Budget for the completion of the Hobart airport which is planned for 1975-76. It is in the field of education that this Government has made spectacular progress and has done a tremendous amount of good work. Tasmama alone will receive $20m this year for universities. I point out to the House that this amount is more than 3 times that allocated in the previous 2 years. Tasmania will receive $ 14m for coUeges of advanced education and that amount is about 4 times the allocation of the previous 2 years. For technical education it will receive $2m, which is almost 3 times the allocation of the preprevious 2 years. Tasmania government and non-government schools will receive $16m, of which is about 4timesthe aUocation of the previous 2 years. Anyone who says Tasmania is neglected is miles away from the truth. The school dental scheme that I referred to earlier was initiated under a Labor government in financial year 1973-74 and in that year an amount of $ 1.4m was allocated by way of grants. This year the estimated grant will be $1.7m, an increase of $0.3m. On Tuesday night the Government was ticised in the House for its policy towards the Tasmanian apple industry. I point out that it the previous Government that started pull scheme and refused to give growers any subsidy assistance in the export of fruit. But under the Labor Government an amount of $2m has been allocated in the 1974-75 Budget on a dollar for dollar basis in order to assist the apple export industry. The Budget also includes $2.7m for sistance for sewerage schemes in Tasmania. I very pleased indeed that the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) has now made it possible for towns of more than 20,000 people to be included in the scheme. This will mean that the new sewerage scheme will now compass the towns of Devonport and Burnie. In this financial year $2.7m is provided for public transport in Tasmama. An amount of $1.4m is provided by the Government for the King Island shipping service to enable the Tasexports manian Government to buy the 'Ra', which is the replacement vessel for the 'Straitsman' which unfortunately sank in the Yarra River last year. Local councils are particularly pleased with the allocation from the Grants Commission. mania received $1.7m for municipal authorities last year. This is the amount that was rectonnes ommended by the Grants Commission. Of this, $500,000 went to councils in the Braddon torate. When this was mooted I can remember some Liberals saying: 'This is pie in the sky. will never eventuate'. They got an awful shock when some councils received up to $100,000 with no strings attached. You ought to see these Liberals scurrying around and opening their mouths now, when they are visited by the comto run down. missioner from the Grants Commission, to make sure that they get a bigger slice of the cake. They were full of criticism when it was first mooted, but they certainly do not mind taking the money. Tasmama receives much more Australian Government assistance per capita than do any the other States. For example, last year funds Tasmania totalled $565 per head of population compared with $335 on an average for all States. This additional assistance paid in recognition the State's unique circumstances is continuing increase under the Labor Government. Tasmania's per capita allocation is 70 per cent higher than the average for the rest of Australia. The generous treatment of the State of Tasmania by the Australian Labor Government has replaced the undignified haggling and meanness to which Tasmama was subjected by past Liberal Party governments in Canberra. Tasmama crihas about 3 per cent of the population of Australia but will receive almost 5 per cent of the was total assistance grants from the Australian the tree Government thisfinancialyear. I wish to turn to shipping, because shipping is of great importance to Tasmama. Unlike the other States, Tasmania does not have road and raU links with other parts of Australia, and shipasping is its lifeline. The Federal Government will am spend $54.7m on new ships and equipment this year to expand the Australian National Line. Over the past years the ANL never had a Budget figure of more than $ 10m. This year this Government will be allocating more than 5 times as enmuch as was allocated in any previous year. Money will be spent on starting new ships, which urban will be worth more than $200m. Most of the money will be used to buUd, charter and operate enough ships to carry a fair share of Australia's and imports. A cellular container ship of 29,000 tonnes is being buUt for the AustraliaEurope trade and a ship has been built for the Australia-Japan trade. Contracts have been let for buUding 4 modern bulk carriers, all more than 100,000 tonnes, for use in the AustraliaJapan ore trade. Delivery dates for these vessels Tasare June, July, and December 1976 and May 1977. Two of the carriers will be of 120,000 and two will be of 140,000 tonnes. For the firsttimethe Australian flag will fiy regularly in electhe bulk trades. Coastal trade has not been neglected. Six ships have been bought or are This being built for it. A new Melbourne terminal is also being buUt and this will help remove the cargo congestion and improve turnround. The previous Liberal-Country Party Government allowed the shipping service on the Tasmanian run I am pleased to see that adequate recognition is given in this Budget to the need to upgrade the shipping services to Tasmania. The Australian National Line has on order from the State Dockyard a 6,700-ton vehicle deck container Sea of Coaster due for deUvery in approximately 12 for months. Delivery of this vessel was expected early next year, but because it is now 12 months away the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles of Jones) has approved the purchase of a 5,400-ton to unit load vessel at present under construction in Norway. These two vessels, together with the order of a second Sea Coaster from the State Dockyard, will provide Tasmanian exporters with a more economic service of greater capacity. I appeal to the Minister, however, to keep the 'Bass Trader' and the 'Echuca' in service on the Bass Strait run until such time as these new vessels are on the Tasmanian run. I turn now to the question of freights. These, coupled with the availability of adequate shipping, are of tremendous importance to Tasmania. I maintain that the Government has honoured its 1972 and 1974 election promises. Mr Nixon-It has done nothing.",66
162,Mr DAVIES,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"You did nothing at all. The Government has removed the disadvantage facing Tasmama by reason of the fact that it has only a sea link to the mainland. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) who was the previous Minister for Shipping and Transport knows quite well, because he was responsible for authorising the increases in ANL freights, that under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government ANL freight rose by about 30 per cent but that Government did nothing at all about giving a subsidy to Tasmama to compensate for that disability. For the first time, from 1972 to 1974 since this Government came to office, when the ANL sought an increase of 25 per cent because it expected losses on the Melbourne-Tasmania run of $3m and on the Sydney-Tasmania run of $lm, this was brought to the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) and Tasmama received a subsidy of $2m, which will equate to approximately $2 a ton on the basis of 1 million tons of northbound general freight from Tasmania to the mainland. One has to bear in mind that at the same time results that the ANL asked for the 25 road, rail and sea freights on the mainland rose an interim BudgetLabor by an average of 35 per cent. So I maintain that within a few months to have would the Government's pi^mise has been honoured. problems created by this Budget. In addition, since it came into office this ment has given a subsidy of $ lm to the passenger throughout the entire country among all reflected service on the 'Empress of Australia'. provided for in the 1973-74 Budget and it is provided for in the 1974-75 Budget. So the subsidy now applicable to the Tasmanian passenger and freight runs is worth $3m a year. I simply repeat that, despite all the increases that the previous Government authorised, it refused absolutely give Tasmania a subsidy to offset this disadvantwill age. Tasmamans are looking forward to the Nimmo report with a great deal of eagerness cause we hope that this will be the blueprint the future for our shipping service. I am delighted that there is a commitment in the Budget for the north-west regional water scheme. As the Minister for Urban and Regional Development said earlier this week, a commitment has been made to the extent of about $ 10.5m which will be spread over some 6 years. He said: The commitment agreed upon in principle was that 40 per cent of the scheme would be paid for by the Tasmanian Government and 60 per cent by the Australian Government. Of the Australian Government's commitment of 60 per cent, 30 per cent will be in interest free non-repayable loans and the remainder will be lent at the long term Commonwealth bond rate which is the same as the provision for the national sewerage program. The Minister also went on to say why there were no actual funds provided in this Budget but if agreement were reached this year between the State and Commonwealth governments an amount of money could be provided in the Autumn to make sure that that work will commence. I strongly support the Budget. I strongly support the wonderful work that has been done in Tasmania. I utterly reject the rubbish one sees in the newspapers",69
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,69
164,Mr BONNETT,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"I sympathise with the back bench members of the Government having to defend the shocking Budget introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) on 17 September. There certainly is not much in it that they could point to with pride and honestly say that it would help cure the nation's economic ills. It is thefirstannual Federal Budget. I have ever heard of where, within a week of its introduction, the Government back bench members have sought to have some of its provisions adjusted or deleted because of the disastrous and unjust they would have on some sections of the community. In fact, within 2 days of its introducper cent increase, tion responsible leaders were saying that to be introduced off-set the economic This is a sad Governstate of affairs which is certainly being sections That was of the community. One of the most frightening aspects of the Budget is that it appears to make no provision whatsoever to ease the unemployment situation which is increasing rapidly. Even the leaders of to the Labor movement seem to think that there be massive unemployment by the end of the year and in the early part of next year. Apparbeently the Government thinks so as well, for we for have been advised that a Regional Employment Development Scheme Committee, consisting of Government Ministers, has been formed to try to off-set the unemployment problem. We have been further advised that they have met and are providingfinancefor local government projects in order to employ some of these unfortunate people who have been thrown out of work. Some examples of their decisions are as follows, and they intrigue me: In Bega for the extension of the Cooma Creek plan they expect to employ 20 persons; in Maitland for the extension to the community centre they expect to employ 4 persons; in Lismore for tree planting and construction of public facilities they expect to employ 14 persons; in Benalla for footpath, kerb and channel construction and showground improvements they expect to employ 26 men; in Devonport for clearing of bushland and development of parks and the elimination of potential fire dangers they expect to employ 25 men; in my own city of Townsville they expect to employ 19 persons on a drainage project. Nineteen persons will be employed, when the figures as late as Monday last were 860 males and 440 females out of work. Thesefiguresare expected to increase, and then of course will be augmented by the school leavers in November. I have no quarrel with the idea of a regional employment development scheme; in fact I applaud the idea, but might I suggest that it does not go far enough. I say this to prove my point: The Government appears to be prepared to spend a few hundred thousand dollars or $Xm to ensure employment for a short period for a very small percentage of people out of work, but is also prepared to spend $1.8m on unemployment benefits each week to help the greater percentage of people out of work who do not even have to work at all but can go on drawing this sustenance for as long as they wish, providing they fill in the requisite forms. This situation applied even before the sharp increase in unemployment we have experienced since this Government came to office nearly 2 yean ago. The point I am making is this: It is quite clear that the Government recognises that local governments need financial assistance to implement such projects that would benefit their respective communities and it is equally clear that the Government has decided that if they are to assist financially those out of work they wish this assistance to be productive, hence the formation of the Regional Employment Development committee. But why do they hesitate and help only a few? Why do they not allow all thefinancethey are prepared to spend on unemployment to be productive? In thefinancialyear 1973-74 the amount spent on unemployment benefits was $58.2m, or an average of $ 1.1m each week. In July this year the Government spent $5.3m on these benefits and in August this year the ouday was $7.2m, or $1.8m each week. It is anticipated that the Septemberfigureswill show an outlay of almost $2m each week. While this money is serving a useful purpose it is not productive but could be made so. If the Government is prepared to help a few unemployed people through its regional employment scheme by offering them useful employment, why does it not gainfully employ all people who are out of work and receiving unemployment benefits? They could be usefully employed two or three days a week in making a worthwhile contribution to the community. I am sure that all local governments would welcome the opportunity of such a work force for local projects. It would mean that local governments would be able to commence andfinishnecessary projects which they have had to shelve because of lack offinance.It would mean an easing of the demand for increased rates to meet the loan moneys required for these projects. I am sure that the great majority of those unfortunate people who have been forced out of work would appreciate earning money instead of receiving a hand-out from the Government. It would certainly make those people who do not wish to work earn the money they receive. In other words, no work no pay. The millions of dollars that the Government is prepared to pay out through unemployment benefits and under its regional employment scheme would be productive. After all, it is taxpayers' money. Everybody who pays tax contributes to these funds and I am sure they would like to see such outlays of finance used productively. Speaking of finance being used to good purpose, if the Government would restrain its eagerness to spend millions of dollars on overseas art works, at least until we are in a better position to afford them, and use such money for the advantage of our unemployed people, it would be doing this country a service. If the Government must spend millions on art works, why not purchase such works from our local artists and not fill the pockets of some overseas artists? I get a bit touchy when it comes to a matter of spending millions of bucks on art works. Two very important projects which come immediately to mind and which could be undertaken through the scheme I have mentioned are reafforestation and necessary work on river trust projects. I note that the Regional Employment Development Committee would give sympathetic consideration to projects which would contribute to permanent employment. The two projects I have mentioned would do just that. For some years I have been consistently advocating a program of reafforestation for the Ingham district for in that area there are approximately 100,000 acres ofland ideally suited to the growing of soft woods. In that climate trees would mature in ten or twelve years. The pulp, with the waste from our northern cane mills, would help considerably in overcoming the paper shortage which is world wide and which will remain so for a long time. The dealing, planting and subsequent care of the plantation could well be undertaken by those people who, unfortunately, at present are unemployed. As well, this reafforestation would be an economic asset to the Ingham district and to north Queensland. Work undertaken by river trusts is another important and nesessary task, especially in the matter of conservation. During the monsoonal season the rivers in the north are subject to heavy flooding and severe damage results, especially the gouging of the river banks which results in untold damage to surrounding farmland. Areas affected by heavy flooding have to be worse strengthened and often rebuilt. work. Those people who have been forced out work could be usefully employed on this type work. This would certainly ease the burden those local governments which have to be conlonger cerned with this type of conservation. These only 2 projects which come immediately to mind. Undoubtedly local governments could produce many more which would be of value to the comthe munity. However the main purpose is to keep unemployed people active and productive. They are unemployed through no fault of their own and if the Government's pohcies have caused this problem the Government must accept the sponsibility and do something constructive about it. Time itself is not the solution. It will take action, and immediate action, to solve the ployment problem. Another item in the Budget which is causing much dissatisfaction throughout the community in the north is the reduction in the education allowance from $400 to $150. Why this reduction? I know that the Government is money hungry, but why penalise parents who wish to educate their children at private schools, to get it? Is Government doing this simply in order to another crack at the private school system? should parents not have the right to educate children at a school of their choice without being penalised? Every taxpayer who has a child imponant attending school has $250 added to his taxable income. Are the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and his advisers aware of the cost of outfitting a student these days? I doubt it, and I doubt if much thought was given to the repercussions flowing from such an unjust reduction in the education allowance or to the people who will be adversely affected by it. It could also be claimed that little thought was given to the effects of the proposed tax on unearned income on the great number of people who do not deserve such treatment. If the Government is determined to destroy the incentive of people to save, it could not have chosen a better way to do it. It is refreshing to know that supporters of the Government are taking a stand against such imposition. I should have thought that in view of the promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam) during the election campaign of last May this Budget would certainly be directed at solving the problems of inflation and unemployment, but it is not. If the Government intended it to be so, it has either hidden its solin utions among the jumble of words or it is waiting for time somehow to cure our economic ills. I can assure Government supporters thattimeis their enemy because the longer they govern the This is constant bigger the mess. of During the May election campaign the Prime of Minister told the people he had inflation by the on throat. He said it had been reduced and was no a problem. He also promised full employare ment. He said that employment and inflation do not march side by side. In one sense he was right; they are not marching, they are galloping, and Government has dropped the reins. He gave our a pre-election promise that inflation would be reduced to 8 per cent by the end of this year. He even repeated that promise early in this Parliament. Perhaps he meant that 8 per cent was half reof what it would be. If this Budget is an indication of how to stall inflation, 8 per cent will be only a third of what it could be by the end of the unemyear. Inflation and unemployment have both been ignored apparently to serve the Government's own peculiar purposes. The Australian people do not deserve this type of treatment. I see no mention of the Burdekin Dam in the Budget. I thought that this important project would have received a high priority in the provision for water conservation. I am not the only the person to say this project is very important; no have less a person than the Minister for Northern Why Development (Dr Patterson) also thinks so. I their remember in June 1970 his saying: The Burdekin River development is vital, not only to the towns and hinterland of Bowen, Home Hill and Ayr but it is an essential pre-requisite for the growth and expansion of Townsville, the most important city in northern Queensland. Later in that statement he said: In terms of the cost of gross storage capacity per the Burdekin Dam is an outstanding proposition. I wholeheartedly agree with him; he has never been more right. I know that a study of the dekin Basin is proceeding at enough favourable studies have been made over the years to warrant an immediate start on the project. This area grows the richest sugar and the best rice in the world, but it is a dry belt and water is the lifeblood of the district. aware that recendy the Government allocated insulate $3m towards the cost of construction of the Clare Weir, but it will be two or more years before can be of any assistance to water supphesyears of wasted time because the main dam partly could have been commenced, saving money and time. The dam will serve a multitude of purposes. It will provide for hydro power, flood and drought mitigation and an umlimited water supcountry ply for people, industry and agriculture. At the present rate of growth the Ross River Dam will be sumcient for Townsville's needs for between five to eight years. But what then? Will the people have to experience water restrictions for six to nine months each year when only a miles way the Burdekin dam could supply Hong sufficient water to serve cities, towns and farmlands in an area almost as large as Victoria? I say to the Minister for Northern Development and to the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass): Get the Government cracking on the Burdekin Dam project. If they do, I promise to have a statue erected to each of them for their efforts. I would even do the same for the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren) if he also pulled his weight in the matter. Looking at the Budget in an overall context, think that the best possible thing to do would to scrap the lot and to start again. In this way, may be possible for the Treasurer and his advisers to introduce a Budget the provisions of which would contain some semblance of sanity, responsibihty and justice. I support the amenddoes ment moved by the Leader of the Opposition.",69
165,Dr GUN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"The world is osition going through very troubled times. In every industrialised country in the world we are being reminded of the fundamental weaknesses and had contradictions of the capitalist system. The econwould omic welfare of the system depends upon the deworld cisions of individuals to invest or not to invest. From the point of view of the individual or the firm making it, the investment decision may be perfectly rational, but whether serving the interests of that individual orfirmis also serving the interests of society as a whole is a matter of acre foot coincidence. The consequence is that society is faced with the immutable law that economies will go through successive cycles of boom and reBurcession. This law is as immutable as Newton's present but surely law of gravity. At the presenttime,the economies of the noncane socialist world are undergoing recession. Australia, being a capitalist society, and a great I am trading nation as well, cannot completely itself from what is happening in the rest of the world. What is happening in Australia this today, with the severe problems of maintaining 2 full employment and coping with inflation, is rooted in the national economy, but it is due more to the international situation. The mechanism of recession spreading from one country to another is not hard to detect. As one goes into recession, its consumers buy less. Manufacturersfindthemselves with increasing stockpiles of unsold goods. They cannot sell them at home and their only recourse is to try to export them, even if they have to cut their prices to sell them on the export market. We know what few is happening in the economies of Japan and Kong. Is it any wonder that we are experiencing a huge inflow of low-priced imports from those countries? Like other countries, Australia also had a boom in 1973, and Uke other countries, we cannot escape the inevitable downturn which foUows a boom. So as well as an international element, there is a national element. This is the genesis of our problem, and it is this diagnosis upon which the Budget strategy and the Government's long-term strategy are based. It is senseless and wrong to lay the blame on such I measures as tariff decisions or the up-valuations be of the Australian dollar. The tariff cuts and the it revalutions of 1972 and 1973 were correct decisions at thetime.The situation has changed, and so has the policy, as evidenced by last week's devaluation. This decision was a good one, but it not make the earlier decisions to reduce tariffs and the revalue wrong. I reject the propthat these earUer decisions are the cause of our present problems. The main cause of our problem is an international recession, and if we not revalued or cut tariffs, our situation now be only marginally different. That it is the economy, rather than tariffs, which determines the level of imports was quite clearly shown in our experience last year. When tariffs were cut, the volume of imports was almost unAnthony) changed. Why? Because there was a world comism, modity boom, and the imports were unavailable. The same reasoning applies in the opposite situation today. Foreign manufacturers are lookhave ing to export markets such as Australia because they have nowhere else to go. Take the hypoeducation, thetical example of a shirt coming into Australia at a landed price of $1, and the equivalent Auscation trahan price is $5. Supposing we had not cut tariffs or revalued, and the import cost $1.25 instead of $1. How much difference will that make to the competitiveness of the Austrahan producer? In fact, the foreign manufacturer, necessary, might even be able to back to $1 from $1.25. This argument is of enormous importance in deciding what to do about it. In my opinion, some action is called for to protect employment in the short term, and I therefore support the devaluation and the temporary voluntary restraints in textile imports. But let not delude ourselves that this is the long-term answer to our problems. We have to remember that if every country puts up barriers to trade, result will be not more employment but less, and living standards not higher but lower. Based on this analysis, the strategy of the Budget and long-term economic strategy of the Government are correct and should be supported by all tralians. The Government has a social goal and an economic goal, and the Budget strategy incides with both. The objective is to incorporate a very much greater share of the economy in the Government sector, by transferring resources from the private sector to the public sector. The social aim known, as it is to carry out this social aim which the Labor Government has been elected on 2 occasions. The economic aim is equally important. It will mean that the much larger lic sector can maintain planned and ongoing investment and welfare expenditures, and sertion. thereby reducing the vulnerability of the econconclusion, omy as a whole to the stops and starts of intercountries national capitalism. It also means that the residual private sector will operating in those areas where Australia has comparative advantages over other countries. This means that in future world economic downfact turns we will not be damaged by imports, and we as suggested will not have to take restrictive action which is so other countries. damaging to other countries in return. I find it very difficult to understand the tions which have been raised to the planned expansion of the Government sector. May I make 4 comments on this matter? Firsdy, the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr has described this strategy as socialand presumably this is meant to say that it must therefore be wrong. He can call it socialism, or anything he likes for all I care, but he should some regard to what is in the Government programs. There is a huge increase in outlays on a large outlay on pubUc hospitals, and more funds for welfare housing. Is more edusocialism? Are pubhc hospitals sociaUsm? Are higher pensions sociaUsm? For that matter, the Leader of the Country Party could teU us whether he regards a bounty on nitrogenous fertiliser as socialism? If he does, the public has a if right to know whether he regards this form of cut his final cost sociaUsm as evU. The second pomt is that the Opposition has soundly condemned the planned increase in Government expenditure, but it is not prepared us to indicate one single item of expenditure which it would cut. I invite honourable members to scan the long amendment moved by the Leader the of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) to see whether there is one single item of expenditure which is claimed to be excessive. They will search in vain. the Opposition members will have a further chance to vote for a reduction or a deferment of expendiAusture when the Estimates come up for each department. But they will again be lacking in the cocourage or the conviction to do so. The Opposition should put up or shut up. Thirdly, the Opposition has invoked the old Tory argument that only the private sector is generates real wealth, and that the Government for somehow lives off the fat created by private enterprise. I chaUenge the Opposition to name one respectable economist or even one respectapubble argument in support of this assertion, because that is all it is, an unsubstantiated asIf this argument were taken to its logical it would follow that those sociaUst with no private sector at aU would have no wealth, no production at all, and no consumpbe more efficient, and tion at aU. Fourthly, I would like to draw attention to the that the size of the pubUc sector in Australia by taxation, is lower than in many Honourable members will have just received a Treasury paper on taxation conobjectaining a table which shows that, of 23 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries studied, Australia's percentage of taxation to gross national product is the tenth highest if social security contributions are excluded and, if they are included, Australia ranks eighteenth in 23 countries.

166,Dr GUN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"Nobod y denies that the tax schedwhere ule needs revision, particularly in income earners; but it cannot be argued that the Government takes too big a share compared with other countries. I have stated my belief that the transfer resources to the public sector is the conect egy, but I believe that we will have to give a greatsive deal of attention to the very great struaural problems in trying to bring about this transfer. Planning government programs is a time-conare suming process, and the actual retraining and relocation of manpower from the private sector to the pubUc sector is very difficult and cannot achieved overnight. In other words, increased demand in the government sector cannot be expected to take up the slack in the private sector without a considerable delay, because resources are not readUy transferable. Thus, in analysing the present economic situation, we are looking not one economy, but two.

The demand is there, in the Government's programs, and the supply is there, from those seeking retraining. We need to marry be the two. All the Ministers who are responsible for new programs should ensure that urgent studies are carried out to find out the future manpower requirements of their programs, and the type of skills and training needed. Where these programs are to be implemented through State at governments, there should be consultations with appropriate State government department to out the future manpower needs. If the Department of Labour and Immigration has this information, it will be in a much better position to advise applicants for adult retraining as to what training will best guarantee their future security of employment. Secondly, until the Government programs and the adult retraining are under way, some short term assistance is needed in the private sector. This should not be taken as guaranteeing every inefficient industry in Australia, but it does mean something to buy time until the Government programs can be implemented. As I said at the beginning of my speech, we are still beholden to the private sector. Because there is slackening in the private sector, I believe that a stimulus to it would be less inflationary in the short term than any further stimulus to the public sector. The devaluation of the dollar will protect our import competing industries, and I hope that the exporters who gain from the devaluation will soon be purchasing more goods and services. I think that a further increase in the money supply will be needed, however, either by further tax cuts or by supporting the bond market. I note with approval the activities of the Reserve Bank in this area in the last couple of days Finally, I call on the Government to give special attention to the employment potential of what should be our No 1 growth industry, and that is the housing industry. One of the great problems in transferring from one industry to another is that the new job means transferring to a job which is lower in pay, lower in status and less pleasant. The result is that such jobs are advertised, but even the unemployed people simply will not apply. This does not apply to the building industry, where the work certainly is not unpleasant compared to many other jobs which Australian workers endure. Surely there is a great growth potential in this industry. The demand will always be there because Australians will always want houses. The opportunity exists for thousand of jobs for men and women, not just in construction but in the manufacture of building materials. One problem which does exist here is the restrictions on entry into the building trades. I do not criticise the building unions for their opposition to adult retraining for the building industry. After all, if training more building operatives means less job security for the workers already in the industry, who can blame them? On the other hand, if the bunding workers were given permancy, the situation would be quite different. We have a good precedent in the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, which was a great advance in the stevedoring industry. I suggest that we need a similar arrangement for building workers. The Government could then show that an expansion of the housing industry would mean more jobs not fewer. Hand in hand with an arrangement for permanency there would need to be a planned housing program, carried out jointly by the pubhc housing authorities and the private housing industry. I strongly commend this course of action to the Government.",74
168,Mr SPEAKER,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,The honourable member for Riverina now has the call. I rernind honourable members that this is his maiden speech and I ask them fo extend the usual courtesies.,75
169,Mr SULLIVAN,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS," Iriseto make my maiden speech fully conscious of the important task I have been given as the democratically elected representative of the people of Riverina. I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the high office of Speaker of this House. I also congratulate other new members who have made their maiden speeches in this, the Twenty-ninth Parliament. Myfirstduty is a very personal one. On behalf of my famUy and myself, I wish to convey sincerely out heartfelt thanks for the comfort given to us from both sides of the House, from the House staff and from not only the Riverina but all over Australia since the tragic loss of my eldest son. The grief and utter desolation associated with the loss of a loved one cannot be shared, but the comfort gained from the sympathy given by compassionate people is a true expression of human love and understanding and cannot be forgotten. Mr Speaker, I assure you that my famUy and I wiU never forget. It is only fitting that I pay my respects to former representatives who have worked so hard in the past to look after the interests of all people Uving in this vital electorate. Mr Hugh Roberton is still remembered with affection, for he was truly a man of the people. I am sure that his friends will join with me in wishing him well in his retirement in Canberra. Despite his unfortunate and untimely incapacity through premature loss of sight, his spirit and love of Ufe remain high. Mr Bill Armstrong, gentleman and personal friend, continues ms involvement and retains his interest in the Riverina. I believe that his work in the field of estate and death duties while a member of this House has not been given due and justifiable recognition. The last sitting member, Mr A. J. Grassby, needs no introduction from me. He was, above all else, a man of the people and his energy, his vitaUty and his desire to help aU must give him a special place in our hearts. It was a pity to see this man who had buUt up such goodwill faU to identify himself with his supporters in defeat. It was not reasonable or just for him to imply or suggest that the campaigns conducted by the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) and by me were anything but clean and honourable. Nevertheless, I do wish him well in his new job. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to take this opponunity to refresh the memories of honourable members on some general aspects of the electorate of Riverina. Of almost 40,000 square miles, covering rich agriculture land, Riverina is probably one of the most imponant electorates in Australia. Every form and type of farming endeavour, with the exception of the growing of tropical fruits and sugar cane, is undertaken. I can only heartily concur in the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), who wrote less than 5 weeks ago: The Riverina district, rich in history and rich in economic potential, contributes greatly perity. In this fertile and beautiful the great rural industries on which Australia depends, and some of her most attractive cities and towns. This afternoon I would like to speak about these industries, some of these towns, the people who live and work in them, and the problems facing them today. I know that ultimately I must be judged by these people on how I fulfil the task of seeking solutions to these problems. The electorate divides itself roughly into 5 areas: The northeast wheat area, the western grazing area, the southern grazing area and Murray Valley irrigation districts, the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally irrigation areas and the eastern mixed farming areas. Naturally, these areas overlap and some similar types of farming are practised in all, but the divisions are important because each one described has its own distinct set of problems. There are of course problems common to the whole area concerned with roads, telephones, mail and rail services which I will refer to later in this speech. To speak in some detail about each of these areas, first the northeast wheat area where West Wyalong, Lake Cargelligo, Ardlethan and Barmedman as well as the smaller but equally important towns Uke Ungarie, Tullibigeal, Rankin's Springs, Weethalle, Tallimba and Ariah Park, support the magnificent wheat farms covering this area. The chances are that the bread eaten by honourable members today had its origins in this part of Australia. As well as its great rural industry, Ardlethan is also proud of and grateful to its tin mine and workers for their contribution to the prosperity of a smaU country town. The great western grazing areas stretching from Goolgowi and Hillston through Hay and the famous BooUgal to Balranald gives a glimpse of the sheer size of the electorate. Cattle and sheep are bred and fattened for home and for what once were thriving overseas markets. I sincerely hope that the recent currency devaluation wiU help in reoperiing these markets for the farmers and graziers of this area as well as for the rest of Australia. In the southern area stretching from Barooga to Euston along the great Munay River Valley including the centres of Berrigan, Tocumwal, Finley, Conargo, Deniliquin, Mathoura, Moulamein, Moama, Barham one finds vast irrigation districts as well as beautiful sheep and cattle grazing properties. The major problems are associated with drainage and salinity. These 2 words, 'drainage' and 'saUnity', are to be to Australia's wealth and prosheard at practically every meeting considering region are to be found many of rural matters in this area. Both problems have far-reaching impUcations and are of national importance. The time has come for action from both State and Federal authorities as talk, investigation, planning and consideration and more talk will no longer serve any useful purpose. The people living in these once highly productive areas face continuing financial hardship in the short term and complete loss of homes and farms unless we, the politicians, take the necessary steps to avert such an outcome. I am aware and deUghted to hear that the New South Wales State Mmister will be visiting the area this month, but as a representative of the people, I would be neglecting my duty to them if l did not emphasise the need for action. Mr Speaker, special reference must be made to the town of DenUiquin, which is the central or main town in the southern area. Its energetic councU has worked hard to provide the district, as well as the townspeople, with a prosperous, modern town. If decentraUsation is to be more than just a word then towns such as DenUiquin must receive priority treatment for assistance in the future. The Murrumbidgee and Coleambally irrigation areas are in the centre of the Riverina and provide a magnificent example of the rewards for hard work. When one thinks of hard work, one must naturally think of the tremendous contribution made by the wonderful Italian people and other migrants who have seen fit to settle in this part of Australia. Rice in abundance, citrus and stone fruits and grapes and vegetables provide this area with prosperity and stabUity. Who has not heard of MCWUliams wines, Sunwhite rice and Letona fruits? Griffith and Leeton, dynamic towns, share an almost unlimicompletely ted potential for development in the future. I sonally visualize these towns becoming a excess regional growth centre and I shall work for this to occur. The last but certainly not the least important area lies on the east of the electorate. Wheat growing and sheep and cattle from Barellan, through Narrandera to Jerilderie guarantee a livelihood for the farmers living here produced although the last 12 months have been extremely Flooding this difiicult. Mr Speaker, I taketimeto praise the efforts the Narrandera Shire Council on the work it done in developing Lake Talbot as a tourist traction. People from all over Australia will join with me when I congratulate the planners and workmen who have produced this inland oasis. From the foregoing description it is easy to understand why we of the Riverina feel justifiState ably proud of our contribution to the national wealth and prosperity of Australia. In return this contribution we ask for no more than a share of the national wealth and prosperity. rently we feel we are being discriminated against. You see, Mr Speaker, very few people of the Riverina drinkfilteredpurified water, more half of our dwelUngs are unsewered, many of our children travel an incredible 7,000,000 kUometres each year to attend school, and many these are travelled over shocking roads. Buses have to be pulled by tractors in the wet season and in one shire during the current year the school chUdren on one bus route lost 11 school days through the state of the roads. As well this, the maU services have been irregular. services are not as good today as they were in 1950s, and train services are being reduced. Unfortunately in most cases the passenger train service has been the only means of travel for aged, the invalids and the low income earners. am aware that raU services are not a Federal matter but they are nevertheless a problem which aU of us should be concerned. The cost of instaUation of telephones and cost of telephone caUs are a real cause for conigines. cern and anger among country people. Telecommunities phones are vital for survival by famUies isolated from normal community services and for the purpose of communicating with doctors, tradesany men, business and friends. I make the point these country people I refer to are not merely ing in the country to escape from the city. These are producers. These are the people the Prime Minister said contribute gready to Australia's wealth and prosperity. Yet the cost of telephones in 1974 is becoming a cripphng burden, if not prohibitive. Costs of provision of perUnes to farms in some cases have been quoted in of $2,500. This is an intolerable burden for the average farmer or rural worker to bear and because of the vital job they do there is not one vaUd reason why they should be expected to grazing pay such massive costs. Excessive rain during the past two seasons has some additional serious problems. year has reached record heights on the 3 rivers, the Murray, the Murrumbidgee and of the Lachlan. Many families have suffered the has heartbreak of seeing homes and personal posatsessions destroyed or damaged, while the farmers with land situated in the flood plains have suffered losses to pasture and stock. That there was no loss of life along the Murrumbidgee during the recent record flood is a credit to the Emergency Service, thefloodwarning system and the many voluntary organisations for including service clubs, rescue clubs, church fair groups and the Country Womens Association, Curwhich helped in the crisis as the record peaks moved down theriver.It was heartening, indeed, it was magnificent, to see the people in Narrandera, Darlington Point, Hay, Balranald and Euston rally together as one to cope with the probthan lem. I pay them all the highest tribute. Special praise must go to the young men of the of Leeton Rescue Club who travelled to, and worked in Darlington Point, some without the promise of pay from employers, for the duration of the flood. It is this sort of community activity and spirit which is so desperately needed in the as country today if we are to solve the national The problem, one even more dangerous than the the flood just described. The damage caused by the excessive rains andfloodingto the rural industry and to the roads is difficult to assess, but the the figure for roads alone could be as high as $4m. I Additional funds will be needed to bring roads back to a reasonable state of repair as they have about never been in worse condition. No poltiical speech about the Riverina would the be complete unless mention was made of AborIn most centres in the Riverina there are of Aborigines and these people have their own special problems. Understanding, education and time must be 3 ingredients in satisfactory plan initiated to solve these that problems but, sadly, I observe that there are UvUtde, if any, of these ingredients in the present policy. In many ways this Government's current poUcy is isolating the Aborigines to a greater extent than ever before and it is also helping to create additional and certainly more serious problems for the future. I would suggest that in many cases understanding and compassionate white leaders would achieve more at the local community level than Aborigines, however well intentioned, who are perhaps unskilled and untrained in the work that must be done. Furthermore, straight handouts of money are to be condemned as they merely produce a dependent response from the receiver whether he be Aborigine or anyone else. Some of the Aborigines' handouts discriminate against the underprivileged white citizens-and we have far more under-privileged white Australians than we have under-privileged Aborigines I am here to seek a better deal for the Aborigines and for the under-privileged whites. I am here, like many other honourable members on both sides of the House, to fight to keep Australia free and democratic, I am here to fight for, because I believe in, a free enterprise system where hard work and thrift stand the best chance of being adequately rewarded, and I am here to fight specifically for the needs of the people in the Riverina. Perhaps most importantly I am here to speak as a representative of the Riverina people on legislation being considered by this Parliament. If legislation put forward by the Government is designed genuinely to cater for the needs of people it will have my full support, but if legislation is designed merely to achieve some sort of political advantage then, Mr Speaker, you can be assured that I will be a hard and unyielding opponent to such legislation. In conclusion, let me emphasise that all of us as Australians, whether we come from the city or country, are inextricably bound together, our future is shared, our fortunes rise and fall together. If the great rural industries fall by the wayside weakened by subsidising consumers and secondary industries, while at the same time competing unaided on the world's markets to earn more than SO per cent of Australia's overseas income, it will mean the end of Australia as we know it and love it and I am here to help prevent that from happening.",75
170,Mr WILLIS,REFRIGERATION COMPRESSORS,"At the outset may I congratulate the honourable member for Riverina (Mr SulUvan) on the maiden speech which he has just made. I would also Uke to express the sympathy of myself and my colleagues for the recent bereavement in his fanuly. The Budget represents the framework of the Government's economic pohcy for the current financial year and as such it deserves to be seriously debated in this place. With some notable exceptions this is not what has been happening on the Opposition side of this chamber. If the Opposition beUeves that the poUcies of the Government are inappropriate to the economic circumstances facing the country it has an obligation to the people of Australia to say not only that it considers that to be the case but also to explain what alternative poUcies it would implement and why those policies would be more successful than those adopted by the Government. This has not been happening in this debate. Instead, the Opposition has set out to score as many cheap political points as it can and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) has been the prime offender in this behaviour. Simply comparing current rates of inflation or unemployment with those of 2 years ago or comparing what the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) says now with what he said previously in entirely different economic circumstances is a pathetic and puerile exercise from a pretender to the Prime Ministership. Yet that is what the Leader of the Opposition spent much ofhis time doing in this debate. The principal and the quite unforgivable weakness ofhis argument was his complete faUure to mention the fundamental reality of our time, that is, that the competitive market economic system which operates in most countries and governs their mternational trade is in a state of world-wide crisis. Almost every country similar to Australia has a problem of growing inflation and unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition and his followers make not a skerrick of allowance for that fact. The only acknowledgment by the Leader of the Opposition of international factors in his speech was his allegation, in direct contradiction of the facts, that under a Labor government Australia's rate of inflation is accelerating faster than that of any other OECD country-OECD being the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which covers practically all the countries of Western Europe, North America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. To make his point the Leader of the Opposition had a table incorporated in Hansard. That table was quite out of date when he had it incorporated in Hansard and is completely misleading in the way it is drawn. BasicaUy it lists the rates of inflation in Australia and other OECD countries for the 12 months to April this year and compares those inflation rates with the average rates which appUed in each of those countries over the decade 1961-1971. Although it lists the inflation rate for 1972, the last year of the Liberal-Country Party Government, the Leader of the Opposition did not use that figure for comparison with the rate of inflation for the 12 months to April 1974. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table. I have received the approval of the Opposition to do this.",78

172,Mr WILLIS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"This table gives the latest availprocess, able ngures and compares the rises in prices for the 12 months to July 1974 with those of 1972. shows that by 1972, the last year of the Liberalsubtleties Country Party Government, prices in Austraha were increasing substantially faster than the erage for all OECD countries. So they were increasing faster than the average of OECD was countries in the last year of Liberal-Country Party government. Since then the rate tion in Australia has increased considerably but so too has the rate in all OECD countries. In fact, the latestfiguresshow that the disparity between the rate of inflation in this country and the age rate in all OECD countries has declined consition siderably. In 1972 the Australian inflauon rate was 1.23 times the OECD average. In 1973, the first year of the Labor Government, it remained exactly the same-1.2 3 times the OECD average. But in the most recent period available, the 12 months to July 1974, the disparity declined to 1.08 times the OECD average. That means that the disparity now between the OECD rate and the the Australian rate is considerably less than it was in the last year of Liberal-Country Party Government. These figures show that the assertion of the Leader of the Opposition in this debate that under the Labor Government the acceleration in inflation has been greater than in any 12 months Differ- other OECD country is completely and utterly to July ence Ratio false. 1972 1974 2-1 2:1 The fact is that inflation is Australia has 6.5 2.4 increased at a substantially lower rate than it has 8.4 3.5 in OECD countries generally. While dealing with 20.7 5.6 this subject may I correct the outrageous untruth 8.6 2.5 contained in the speech of the honourable mem3.1 1.4 ber for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in this de8.5 2.4 1.4 1.3 bate. He asserted at the outset of his speech that 13.2 3.3 since the Labor Government had been in power 10.0 2.4 the value of money had depreciated by appro8.2 2.5 ximately 40 per cent. This is an enormous exag4.9 1.9 geration of the fact. If the honourable member 9.3 2.4 meant that prices had increased by 40 per cent 7.5 1.9 1.8 1.2 since Labor came to office that is completely 3.7 1.6 false, as the actual increase in the price index 9.0 2.2 since the December quarter of 1972 was 20.7 per 27.4 7.2 cent. That is about half thefigureasserted by the 34.1 4.5 1.6 1.2 honourable member for Wannon. But if he 15.2 2.4 meant what he said, that is, that the value of 6.9 1.8 money had fallen by 40 per cent since Labor 2.4 1.4 came to office, it would imply that in his opinion 3.1 1.5 prices had increased by 67 per cent since Labor 10.4 1.7 came to power. If honourable members opposite have difficulty in understanding that, I suggest 8.6 2.8 that they consider a situation in which prices rose by 100 per cent. That clearly would mean that the value of money had halved; that is, had been reduced by 50 per cent. By the same arithmetical if one says that the value of money has fallen by 40 per cent one is implying a 66.7 per It cent rise in prices. However, I suspect that such are beyond the honourable member for Wannon and that he really meant that prices avhave increased by 40 per cent since Labor took office, in which case, as I have already said, he exaggerating the factual position to the enormous extent of virtually doubling the rate of of inflaincrease that has occurred. These incredible mis-statements of the facts on our inflation rate by senior members of the Opaverposition signify the desperation of the Oppoto cash in on what it sees as a politically advantageous position, without making any concessions to the reahties of the world in which the Australian economy is now operating, without worrying too much about sticking to the facts and without bothering to explain how its rag-bag of alternative pohcies would improve in any way the situation in which we now find ourselves. The fact is that the economy of almost every developed capitalist country in the world is plagued by growing inflation, as I have shown, and by growing unemployment and high interest rates. Indeed, a general state of recession and rapid inflation exists throughout all the countries in which the market system operates. That even includes one communist country-Yugoslavia which, although it has the world's most developed system of worker control, also has a competitive market economy similar to that operating in capitalist countries. The world is thus faced with a malaise of the competitive market system. It is absurd in the extreme for members of the Opposition to claim, as they have done in this debate, that the economic troubles of this country are due in some way to mismanagement by the present Government, to increased government spending or to some other action of the present Government. The fact that the rest of the capitalist world is in similar straits surely proves that the present Government cannot be held responsible for the deteriorating economic situation in Australia. I do not have time in which to analyse in any great detail how the world-wide malaise in the economic system has developed. But, put briefly, it has much to do with the simultanous boom in economic activity that occurred throughout most of the developed capitalist countries last year and the consequent tremendous boom in world commodity prices. The prices of practically all internationally traded commodities rocketed up last year as world demand substantially exceeded world supply. That had a consequential effect on the internal price level of the various nations, particularly the developed nations which were the purchasers of those commodities. Added to that was the tremendous increase in oil prices last year as a result of the decision of the petroleum producing countries to Uft oU prices by a prodigious amount. In fact, Middle East oU prices have increased four-fold in the last 2 years. Although Australia has been protected from that to some degree by our indigenous od suppUes, it has nevertheless increased the cost of the 30 per cent of our oU suppUes that we import and raised freight rates as well as increased directly the cost of our imports from other countries which have been fuUy affected by the oU price rise. The result of aU this is that inevitably been Ufted up the inflation scale along with everyone else. Commodity prices have now policies faUen on world markets as demand for them has been reduced in aU the developed countries as they have taken action to offset their inflation by introducing credit restrictions and tightening their fiscal policies. The results of those actions, however, have not been so much to reduce the rate of inflation-indeed , it has tended to gather steam-bu t rather to increase unemployment and introduce a world-wide recession. Countries such as the United States and Canada have inflation rates that over the last 12 months have been about 3 per cent below our 14.4 per cent, but their unemployment rates have edged up and up. The United States now has an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent and Canada of over 6 per cent. Germany, which for decades has rarely had more than a 1 per cent unemployment rate, has now edged up to 2.3 per cent, and that it not counting the tens of thousands of guest workers whom it sent back to Turkey, Greece and Yugoslavia. Britain and Italy are in an appalling state, with inflation rates well above ours, much higher interest rates, unemployment levels much higher than ours and acute balance of payments problems. I could go on and on with the list, but I think that reference to the countries I have mentioned is sufficient to prove the point. It is clear that we are caught up in an international crisis that creates enormous difficulties for the government of the day. The economists in this country, as elsewhere, are hopelessly divided as to what action should be taken for the best. In these circumstances it seems to me that certam basic objectives should be kept clearly in mind. The fact that it is an international problem indicates that it will require international action to solve the problem and co-operation to overcome it. We should be strongly advocating such cooperation at international monetary forums, and in particular urging other governments hot to choose the unemployment path to cure inflation. If they do, it will create an acute world depression which will be far worse than the discomfort of international inflation. The Labor Government in this Budget has adopted a strategy that conforms to the approach of rejecting the unemployment path, despite substantial advice to introduce a tough Budget in an endeavour to cure inflation by the traditional approach. The Government rejected that option and has introduced a mildly expansionary Budget. At the same time the credit squeeze is being eased in a number of ways, and the devaluation will further accentuate that easwe have ing. Although unemployment is increasing at present, the Government is currently pursuing which will soon reverse that trend unless the international recession continues to worsen, in which case it will be extraordinarily difficult to stop unemployment from increasing in Australia. Having rejected the Draconian method of curing inflation by creating massive unemployment, the Government's task now is to bring inflation under control by other measures. No one suggests that this will be easy. A further tax cut, reduced government spending or a national conference of unions, governments and employers, such as is advocated by the Opposition, would not be anything like a solution. It is simply not enough to state those propositions without pursuing or elaborating them in any way. If they were elaborated their synthetic nature would soon be obvious to the people of this country. What is needed now is a guarantee to all wage and salary earners that their real incomes will be protected against inflation, so that they do not make wage claims that anticipate some higher rate of inflation and thereby help to bring it about. Indexation will not solve inflation but it will do much to stop it from getting worse unless international inflation accelerates further. The process of obtaining indexation is not easy for the Government because it does not have the powers to legislate directly for indexation of wages and salaries or any other incomes in this country. We sought at the end of last year powers to control incomes, but this was denied us by the Australian people. If that referendum had been passed we could now have legislated for indexation and given to all wage and salary earners of this country a guarantee that their wages would be maintained in real terms. Because we have not that power we have had to pursue the process by means of the conference of unions and employers before Mr Justice Moore of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The process is proving extremely difficult. The employers are rigid in their opposition to indexation of wages. In those circumstances it appears likely that the unions will have to go to arbitration to try to get a decision for indexation. If they do, the Government will support them, I would imagine, as we are certainly supporting indexation before the Moore conference. I believe that apart from indexing just wages we should also give close consideration to indexation of the tax schedule. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) advanced in this debate such a system and seems to tlunk that he originated the idea. I would like to assure him that the trade unions have talked about it for years. It has been discussed on side of the House for as long as I have been member of this Parliament, that is since December 1972. The attraction behind the idea is that wage earners will be assured that their after tax wages will go up by the same proportion as their gross wages. If we do not index the tax schedule, their after tax wages do not increase at the same rate as gross incomes. It is claimed that this could well be an accelerating factor in wage claims and therefore a factor in the inflationary process. I personally think that there is probably something in this and that the Government should give close considerations to indexing the tax schedule. Finally, may I say that we will need substantial co-operation from the whole of the community if we are to solve the difficult situation we are in at the moment, a situation which has not been the creation of this Government but a creation of the whole system. I think the people of Australia and indeed the members of the Opposition should bear in mind that in the period this Government has been in office the international factors have been infinitely more difficult than ever they were, certainly in the 2 decades prior to the Labor Government coming into office. We had the difficult problem last year of the tremendous boom in international prices; we had the difficult crisis of disruption of the international monetary system, which began in the early 1970s and 1971 and has become worse since. We have now got the even more difficult international factor of growing international recession. None of these factors operated in the previous Liberal Government's term of over 20 years. They have been factors with which this Government has been trying to cope in the less than 2 years in which it has been in office. It has also had to cope with the mismanagement of the economy in 1972 when the Liberal Government allowed the money supply to increase at an enormous rate-1 7 per cent in the last 6 months of 1972because of its refusal to revalue the currency, a pigheaded refusal for which the Labor Government has had to pay in dealing with a more difficult economic situation than would have been the case had sensible measures been applied in 1972 by the previous government. In fact, keeping the money supply under control has been one of the most difficult problems facing this Government in the 134 years it has been in office because of the mad acceleration of the last 6 months of 1972 and the very difficult economic circumstances that have applied in that 1 % years. I have said we will need the co-operation of this the people. To solve inflation and recession in a this country and throughout the world we will need co-operation within the country and without. We need international co-operation to prevent international recession. Within the country we need the co-operation of wage earners with the Government. I am not suggesting that the wage earners should be called upon to make sacrifices which are unreasonable. One certainly asserts that they should be entitled to have their incomes maintained in real terms and to share in increased productivity, but if they pursue claims beyond that to any marked degree they will make it extremely difncult for this Government to retain full employment and difncult for this Government to remain in office. I suggest that this Budget is a good Budget in the circumstances and that certainly it should be supported by the House.",79
173,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"The capacity for self-delusion on the part of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) is rather beyond belief. The ability to keep on blaming adverse circumstances on those who were in government previously forgets 2 things. It forgets that conditions are worsening in terms of all the economic criteria the further this Government gets away from 1971 and 1972. Everything is worsening. The long and tedious explanation of what inflation is in Australia and what it is not has been given in terms of the consumer price index, but everybody knows that for at least five very valid reasons the consumer price index seriously understates the real rate of inflation in Australia.",82
174,Mr WILLIS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,It probably does it everywhere else too.,82
175,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I was hoping the honourable member was going to engage in some self-examining honesty in respect of this. The implicit price deflator accelerated beyond belief during the last quarters of the 1973-74 financial year and a reversion to the past is not always justified. I was particularly interested in the reference by the honourable member for GelUbrand to full employment, because when John Dedman, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, in 1945 introduced the White Paper on fuU employment in Australia he did not have any excuses. He did not make any ahbis. He was clear and unequivocal. The words he uttered on that occasion are very appropriate to Australia today. They were brave, courageous words and were a guarantee. John Dedman said: The policy of full employment is the Government's positive contribution to the security of the individual. Full employment spells opponunity and opponunity opens the way for achievement. At the same time the Government recognises that this needs to be measures which protect the less fonunate from hardship and supplement the standards of thing of those in greatest need. Mr Kelly-Who said that?",82
176,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"John Dedman. He made no equivocal guarantees in this matter, no aUbis and no attempts at self-delusion. What ought to be remembered by the Australian people is that the social contract-it was a social contract-of that day has been broken by this Labor Government. Dedman's policies for curing fuU employment are now a Uttle out of date. They were envisaged only in terms of pubUc authority expenditure. Over the years a much more lively and vibrant private enterprise sector of the economy has grown up. It is easier, therefore, in these days to secure full employment with reasonable price stabUity than it was when the guarantee was given in 1945.",82
177,Mr JAMES,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,What did you do in 1971 ?,82
178,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"That is merely a speck on the market compared with what the Government is doing now. If the honourable member listens I will Ulustrate my point. An unalterable social obUgation was made but it was to be done never by excluding common sense. It was never to be done by doubting what in fact full employment was. I am not going to go through the range of percentages of those registered for unemployment as a proportion of the work force to Ulustrate my point. What is quite clear now is that we are sUding further into grave unemployment and sliding more steeply than has ever been recorded in Australia since World War II. Unemployment is sliding at such a rate that it is far in excess of the unemployment which occurred in 1952. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham) well remembers those days. He will remember the late Sir Arthur Fadden introducing a budget in those days-the famous credit squeeze. That credit squeeze looks Uke a gentle embrace compared with what has been proposed in this Budget. In the first 2 months of the financial year in 1952 an extra 20,000 people were put out of work. In the first few months of the new financial year in 1961 an extra several thousand became unemployed. This year not only has the seasonal pattern been broken but also in the first 2 months of this financial year 30,000 people were unemployed. One cannot evade that data, regardless of the statistics. But in all this, a deal of courage is appropriate. A lot of academic economists and journalists have dealt with this matter. I think some credit must be given to Kenneth Davidson who writes for the Melbourne 'Age' who, with a good deal of courage, has outlined the alternatives which are available to the Government. His judgment, supplemented by social security based on facts and reason, has led him to certain conclusions. Mr Kelly-Eccle s was in that league.",82
179,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I am told that Eccles in was in that league also. I acknowledge that fact. In times such as this inflation is the responsibility of all, including a government and an opposition. The Opposition does not believe that we should make political capital out of the fact that present Government is making a mess of the economy. The Opposition does not take that attidecUned. tude and I would not be a party to it. I disagree with some of the propositions that have been forward. It has been stated quite categorically that Australia is in a state of stagflation. 'Stagflaitems tion' is a lovely word-it brings to mind the words 'depression' and 'recession'. The honourchocolate able member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) used another word yesterday in a very fine speech. He used the word 'slumpflation'. Now we cast another word on the waves which I think might more precisely prescribe the situation. Australia is in a unique economic situation. It one of negfiation, which is described in this way: We are in a state of absolute decline in proproduction duction growth. In the last quarter of the last financial year, at current prices, non-farm prodproposition, ucts decreased by $490m. In fact, during that last quarter there was actually a negative productivity growth. However uncertain the production measurements are, it was certainly worse than minus 2 per cent. We have not experienced that before. Negative productivity, negative growth, together with seriously rising prices and the steepest slide into unemployment ever measured-al l those things add up to negfiation. The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) in his latest analysis of the problems-h e has given a variety of analyses-sai d quite clearly and quite correctly that we have to work our out of it. Australia has to work its way out of it, but it cannot work its way out of it with rising living standards unless measurements of proBudget. ductivity are the key. There is an old saying in terms of Uving standards and economics that there is no such thing as a free lunch. If body is to be given something by the Governexpansionary. ment it comes from someone else, whether it from corporations, from income tax, from people who save-fro m wherever you like. In terms rising Uving standards over any long period of time there is no such thing as a free lunch. The only way it can be engineered is through raising real rates of growth in productivity, and negfiation does not aUow that to occur. I believe that is appreciated by many in the Government at thistime.Whether they have the will to deal with it or whether they do not is a matter for their own consciences. The present state of the economy is Ulustrated another way, a curious way. The vital catalytic elements that are needed in an economy to push living standards up are not in fact growmg. Last week a production analysis of 34 items was put out by the Commonwealth Statistician. That prethe Uminary assesment for August made it quite clear that of the 34 items production of 27 had It is a long time since that has occurred. But much more interestingly it is appropriate to put ask which items are showing an increase of a most persistent and constructive nature. The which showed the greatest increase for several months under this Government were three, lolUes, beer and cigarettes. I like pleasure as much as anyone else does, and I am sure that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) who is sitting at the table does. But in terms of common sense and in terms of the production of basic wealth in the community is through which Uving standardsrise,is it a proud thing to say that the most constantly advancing in the ecomomy is in chocolate loUies, beer and cigarettes? Common sense rejects that as it ought to reject the proposition. So for 3 reasons the economy is decreasing its in an absolute sense. It decreased its productivity in the last quarter by about 2.5 per cent, and increases in production are not occurring in the areas in which they should. Years ago accusations used to be made that Australia had a mUk bar economy because it was being propped up by some pubUc investment. This expression was invented, I understand, by the late Professor Copland. We do not have a mUk bar economy; we have gone beyond that today. We have an artificial ersatz coffee economy, and that will not way secure constantlyrisingstandards of living. One thing has to be said in honesty about the If this analysis is correct, including the analysis of the last quarter of the 1973-74 financial year, it was appropriate for the Government someto introduce a Budget which was somewhat That is appropriate. It was a Budis get which decided that the expansionary elements in the economy were to be developed in of the pubUc authority sector, and were not to be developed in the private enterprise sector. It is fair to say that for an interventionist government, a sociaUst government, it was according to its phUosophy. I do not argue with the expansive elements of the Budget but I do argue about the effects that the Government's interventionist attitude with respect to the economy is having on the right of the people to have full employmem without inflation and real rising standards of Uving. I return to where I began: FuU employment is an article of faith in the Australian economy, and it ought to be an article of faith. I well a campaign waged years ago in 1949 wherein we were accused of trying to create Professor Hytbetween ten's pool of unemployment. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), no doubt these through his researches, would remember it; he would be too young to have experienced it. well remembers accusations made about a advantage. former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies. Honourable members will remember that it used seat to be said: 'You wiU aU be cool in Menzies' pool'. I am almost moved to tears when I remember how two or three years ago the honourable occasion member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), who lately has been promoted, was concerned that under the Liberal Party Government in issue 1971 and 1972 a lot of married women were position going to work. He looked at the social effects this movement. At that time he said: 'What is greater for a young person growing have the affection and care ofhis mother?' He indicated that his own gentle nature derived from the care of his mother for him. Accusing the Liberal-Country Party Government at that own time-the honourable member for MackeUar will remember this, as he does nearly everything-th honourable member for Hindmarsh asked: societies What would be more disastrous than for such situation to be deUberately engineered by government? The illustration used by the honourable member for Hindmarsh remains in my mind. He referred to a child who returns from school, rushes into the front door of his home and, as said, throws his bag on the floor-tha happens in his household and it might happen elsewhere. The chUd then rushes into the kitchen and says: 'Mum, can I have a piece of bread and jam?' But mum is not there because she has been sent out to work by the Liberal-Country Party Government. What does that chUd do today? comes homefromschool and is concerned for mother's love. He throws his bag on the floor the bed, whichever it is, rushes mto the kitchen and says: 'Can I have a piece of bread and jam?' His mother says: 'No, you cannot'. The chUd says: 'Why?' She repUes: 'Because your father out of work. He is getting cool in Cameron's pool.'",83
180,Mr WENTWORTH,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Camero n was priding himself on the fact that more women had been sent out to work.,84
181,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"He is Uable to change his attitude according to circumstances. In these present circumstances an Opposition has a responsibUity to assist. It should not merely play the a l t e r n at i v e s of in f l at i o n or remember unemployment-n o matter how academics might argue otherwise, there is a certain effect the two-on e against the other, in order to gain political advantage. Responsibility in areas has to be based on fair judgment and knowledge. I am not one of those interested in One making events worse just to gain a political I say that as a person in the Opposition who holds the most marginal and dicey in my State. In difficult times Uke this, one of the saddest things to do is to read the debates during the last depression years. On that the Opposition, I believe not due to UI will but to a lack of knowledge, refused the famous Treasurer Theodore's fiduciary notes legislation. That was a mistake. But the Optoday does not adopt an incorrect and irof responsible attitude. No body would want to repeat that kind of history. I certainly would not up than to want to do so. I want to return to something a Uttle out of context. It concerns the monetary situation in my State. It has now been disclosed that a quite serious run has been generated as a result of pese simism about the circumstances of building in Queensland. That run has to be cona sidered in the circumstance that a few days ago a the Acting Treasurer (Mr Hayden) indicated that he was not interested in assuming controls, which he can now legitimately assume, with respect to buUding societies-presumabl y because he did not judge them to be sufficiently Uquid to be able to direct the investment of their he assets. But in today's circumstances that kind of t is what excuse is unsatisfactory. The Financial Corporations Act has made it quite clear that, even though it is only an enabling Act, this Federal Government wants to take a direct interest in the activities of fringe He financial corporations and certainly buUding his societies in Queensland. I suggest that the or Reserve Bank-eve n though it has never defined its powers in this respect; it always works by gende persuasion and by talk-ha s the powers of lender of last resort to act with respect to those is buUding societies, and has those powers now. I believe that it ought to indicate that it has those powers. Section 8 of subsection (c) of the Reserve Bank Act reads: The Bank has such powers as are necessary for the purposes of this Act and, in particular, and in addiuon to any other powers conferred on it by this Act, has power . . . to lend money. It has power to lend money to corporations such as building societies. I ask the Acting Treasurer whether in those discussions that occurred between the Government and the Reserve Bank, the Bank has been explicitly instructed not to utilise that power with respect to building societies which are concerning many people in my own State. If the Government contends that it has not that power, it certainly has the power under regulations which it could bring down pursuant to the Reserve Bank Act and possibly even in relation to the Financial Corporations Act. The incredible thing is that this interventionist Government, this socialist Government, that has sought to intervene nearly everywhere else in the economy where it has a right to intervene and where it is foolish to intervene, refrains from taking action under this section in an area where I believe it has explicit and clear power to act. I ask the Acting Treasurer to reply to this matter during the hours that remain of the Budget debate. This matter concerns many people. It concerns many honourable members from my own State and throughout Australia. There are hundreds of thousands of people with modest savings in these corporations. The Government should, under the reference powers or the discussion powers it has with the Reserve Bank, direct the Bank to utilise what authority it has under section 8 subsection (c) of the Reserve Bank Act to prop up those institutions and make it clear to people that their savings are not placed at risk. It has a litde time in which to do it but it has the opportunity during several hours of debate tonight to indicate that it is interested not only in devaluation but also in the stability of the currency available to ordinary modest citizens of Australia with modest savings accounts.",84
182,Mr INNES,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"At the outset I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) on his maiden speech this evening and also to extend my sympathy to him and his family on their sad loss. I support the Bill and oppose the amendment. As the Treasurer (Mr Crean) said, the Budget is not only an economic document; it is a political document. The Budget presented by the Treasurer in afinespeech on 17 September is designed to comply with the philosophy of my Party-that is, to redistribute the burden on the wage earner to the more affluent people in our society, those who have a greater capacity to carry it. The main thrust of the Budget is directed to continuing the programs in social welfare, health, urban and regional development and many other areas. The program is contained in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) for which the Australian Labor Party received a mandate from the Australian people at 2 elections-in December 1972 and as late as May of this year. It is a good Budget. It deserves the support of all people who have benefited by the implementation of the policies of the Austrahan Labor Party and who will benefit as a result of the allocations made in the Budget. Before I turn to one or two sections of the Budget. I shall take the opporunity to congratulate Mr Ian Macphee, the honourable member for Balaclava, on his maiden speech. I am sure he will contribute a great deal to the deliberations of this Parhament in the future on matters concerning labour and industry. He will lift the level of understanding of the Opposition on matters of industrial relations as he is the only person on that side of the House who has any understanding of the requirements necessaiy to achieve a high degree of efficiency and responsibility in that area. It is pleasing to hear the honourable member for Balaclava support the notion of amalgamation of industrial organisations as being a desirable concept. I agree with him that it is desirable that there should be minimal intrusion by any government into industrial disputes, except to encourage co-operation, negotiation and conciliation. I subscribe to the view that in the main the larger and more powerful industrial organisations have acted in a more efficient and responsible way than most of the smaller, fragmented organisations. The Budget provides for an allocation of $ 17.8m for the national employment and training system in the years 1974-75. This system will further extend its program of assistance to industry and commerce to encourage a training consciousness in the private sector. A sum of $452,000 has been allocated for the training of training officers in order to give effect to the scheme. There will be an increase of $8.8m in the amount provided for apprenticeship training. I am glad to see that these provisions did not go unnoticed by the Honourable F. M. Hewitt, MLC, who is the Minister for Labor and Industry in New South Wales. Mr Hewitt stated: I am really very pleased with the generous increases provided by the Federal Government. Subsidies for metropolitan employers have almost doubled from $260 a year to $460 a year for each eligible first year apprentice. Country employers will also receive $460 a year. Where employers are providing special initial off-the-job training for apprentices in their own workshops or at technical colleges the subsidy has been increased by $4 per week to $20 per week. That acknowledgement by the Minister of those provisions is richly deserved. Progress has been made in this area. One or two other points were not mentioned in the letter. There has also been an increase in the living away from home allowance to be paid to country apprentices who are in full time training. This allowance will move from $10 a week to $12.60. All second year apprentices will be paid $5 a week. As has already been indicated, as from 1 October 1974 a wages subsidy covering both metropolitan and country apprentices of $460 will be paid. One of the causes ofrisingcosts, particularly the building industry, is the acute shortage of skilled personnel. For this the previous Governmoments. ment and a whole range of employers must stand condemned. Compames would not take on apprentices. Each year over the past seven or eight years thousands of lads throughout the country were turned away when they made application for the very few apprenticeships which were available. A classic example involves the electriintroduced cal contracting industry in Victoria which was most unstable section of the electrical industry. was training 95 per cent of the electrical mechGeUibrand anics. Of course the contracts in this industry varied from time to time.On many occasions lads were placed in the position of having their indentures cancelled because the industry did not have work for them. It was well known thattimethat due to technological changes other factors it would probably be necessary in the future for individuals to be trained at least twice during their working Uves. The Liberalment Country Party Government was either totaUy obUvious of the situation, due to its incomperisy. tence, or simply prepared to ignore the fate individuals who would become redundant as result of changes in the mode of production. that sort of program been initiated at about time we would not be in the difficulty we today in supplying skUled personnel. In order to have an effective retraining program and appretaken ticeship training as well as finding a formula for some of the economic difficulties we now conHe also said: front, it will be necessary to have the cooperation of efficient and responsible organisations from both sides of the industrial fence. particular The Government's poUcies have played their could part in providing such a result, that the ConcUiation and Arbitration Bill successfully mutilated by the professional obstructionists in the other place. It is a pity that the honourable member for Balaclava was here at the time to talk a bit of sense into some of Australia his coUeagues. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) must have a hide Uke a rhinoceros. He had the audacity to stand in this chamber as though butter would not melt in his mouth and move some phoney amendment that reeks of hyprocisy and is indicative of the cynical, empty contributions we have learned to expect from the white hope of the Liberals. Thank God he belongs to them. This was the man who, as Treasurer, introduced the Budget that set in train the inflationary spiral we are now experiencing. The level of inflation has been kept at the level it is now at only by action taken by this Labor Government. As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUUs) in observed, inflation is an international problem. I will have more to say about this aspect in a few We frequently hear the cry from the Opposition that the Labor Government has done nothing about inflation; that it has taken no steps to combat it. The Labor Government has revalued our currency, provided tariff cuts, restrictive trade practices legislation a and initiated the Moore conference. I subscribe It to the view of the honourable member for that there will necessarily have to be a lot of co-operation by the 3 areas involved-the employers, the unions and the Government-to overcome some of the difficulties that arise because of the obstructionist attitude of the Oppoat sition. We also hear from the Opposition comand ments about what we should be doing about inflation, but when it had the opportunity to provide the constitutional authority for the Governto come to grips with prices and incomes it supported the opposition. That was sheer hypocOf course, this is the view of Government of supporters, but it might be noted that Mr Alan a Woods, the Economic Editor of the 'Sydney Had Morning Herald '-a journal not famous for its that support of the Labor Government-hi s simUar are in ideas, because in November 1973 he said: There is good reason to believe that, without the acuons by the Government, the current rate of inflation would be a good deal higher than even the present 10 per cent. It is also true that the successive revaluations and in the 25 per cent tarirT cuts were economically necessaiy actions that a Liberal-Country Party Government never have taken because of the influence of the Coundespite the fact try Party. was Dr M. Porter, of the International Monetary Fund, in November 1973 said that if the not Government had not revalued the dollar would have faced an inflation rate of 20 per cent in a short time. A leading management consultant is reported to have said: The Federal Government is not to blame for the present rate of inflation. Melbourne managing director, Mr J. Young, is quoted as saving: Australia is caught up in and there's very litde the Australian Government can do about it. This supports the contention of previous speakers that inflation, by nature, is international and that factor directly affects our capacity to come to grips with it. It has also been the cry of the Opposition and those who run with it that inflation emerged as a problem in Australia only after the elecuon of the Labor Government in December 1972. What a lot of rubbish! Let us look at the history of economic matters through the 1960s. In common with most developed countries, Australia suffered a sharp increase in the rate of inflation. It was sent off in a spiral by the incredible budget strategy of the MCMahon Government in 1971. The honourable member for Lilley spoke of the unemployment that exists today. There is a sharp difference between unemployment today and unemployment in 1971. The unemployment being experienced today was not created by the budget strategy of the Labor Government. But the unemployment of 1971-72, which set this in train, was dehberately created by the Liberal-Country Party Government.",85
183,Mr GRAHAM,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,How ?,87
184,Mr INNES,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I will tell you how. It is worth repeating that the then government received its riding instructions from an individual who was then the retiring chairman of Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, Sir Colin Syme. On 14 April 1971, he said: Inflation in Australia is reaching danger level. We should regard the situation as very serious and encourage the Government to take steps to control it. We should then put up with what the Government does without too much whinthe geing. One necessary measure seems to be to reduce over-full employment. The demand-depressing acdon taken in the 1971 budget when there was no real indication of a demand recovery and the continued assertion in that Budget that wage increases were the basic cause of inflation led to the situation that developed. I might add that the then Treasurer, Mr Snedden, who is now the heir apparent, on 22 January 1972 answered certain questions from the 'Australian' newspaper. This was mentioned by the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Riordan) in his address. When commenting on the latest unemployment figures, which showed that 120,574 were registered for employment in December 1971, the then Treasurer said: We have achieved what we set out to do in that we have created an environment in which over-award payments are depressed. Mr Riordan-He was answering his master's voice. a wave of international inflauon",87
185,Mr INNES,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Of course he was. The policy followed by the Government was a ruthless tightening of the monetary screws. It brought economic growth to a jarring stop. A large pool of unemployed was created in which there was the human misery and frustration associated with that development.,87
186,Mr LUSHER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Is that the sort of unemployment that your Government has created?,87
187,Mr INNES,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"You have never worked in your life, so you would not know. Other individuals subscribe to the view that I have expressed. They are people who do not commonly support the pohcies of the Australian Labor Party. I refer first to Professor J. W. Nevile, Professor of Economics at the University of New South Wales, who said: In common with most developed countries, Australia suffered a sharp increase in the rate of inflation at the end of the '60s. Also, Professor Michael Parkin, Visting Research Economist and Professor of Economics at Manchester University, speaking on 'Monday Conference'in November 1973 said: I think to explain your present inflation you have to . . . go back to, really back to the middle '60s, as early as 1966 . . . it's been built up over quite a long period, almost- well getting close to- a decade, now. I turn again to our friend Alan Woods of the 'Sydney Morning Herald' who stated: The extraordinary rate of growth is a major factor in the present high level of inflation in the economy, and it was a situation that Labor inherited from its predecessors. The misguided 1971 Budget and the subsequent easy-money policy that followed it, the over-expansionary 1972 Budget and previous Government's failure to act effectively on the exchange rate and capital inflow all led up to the explosive growth in the money supply. In the course of the contribution of the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUUs) some remarks came from the Opposition when he spoke about inflation being an international phenomenon. Once again I will quote from one of the experts in this field, Professor Galbraith, who said: In all countries, the higher price of imports is cited as an important factor in inflation. In other words, the disease is international. There are many other quotations, but I think we can rely on Professor Galbraith to put forward an authentic view. I think he would be regarded as an expert. What about the vague and negative contributions that have been made by honourable members opposite? Have we heard any alternatives from them? No, we have heard just completely negative contributions that mean absolutely nothing. Of course, the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) believed that that was the case, because he is quoted in the 'National Times' of 10 November 1973 as saying: If the Liberal Party won an election tomorrow, wouldn't be able to reduce prices. Once again I am relying heavily on the 'Sydney Morning Herald'. This is what it said about the heir apparent, the alternative Prime Minister, after his televised appeal for a prices and incomes freeze-it indicates the opinion which people held of him at that time: Altogether the Opposidon leader appears to have little real understanding of the Australian economy he did when, as Liberal Treasurer, he got it so produce the worse unemployment for a decade together with a totally unnecessary recession . . . On the evidence of last night's broadcast and his earlier statements, he still imagines uiat wage rises are simple cause of inflation, when it is abundantly obviousto everybody except the Leader of the Oppositionthat the bulk of the present problem of rising prices the importation of overseas inflation in primary ties. Another quotation reads: Mr Snedden's own anti-inflation program is contradictory and on such an important point as how he would cut Govern-tatives ment spending, it is vague. He has never been more vague than he is today. believe I have exposed honourable members posite for what they are- a phoney bunch of individuals, masquerading as people who are different from those who were thrown out of office because of their complete incompetence. They are the very people who created the cUmate for the economic problems which we face today. They are professional knockers who do not have a positive contribution to make. Despite what has been said by the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), basicaUy the economy is sound. I do not know how the honourable member arrived at his ngures, but my information is that, compared with the posthat ition in 1971-72, the value of exports of rural gin has increased by 33 per cent, and over the same period the gross value of rural production has increased by 59 per cent. effort which the honourable member for LUley has made in trying to hoodwink the Australian people into believing that honourable members opposite are a real alternative government. ing the past 12 months the gross national product has increased by more than 5 per cent. The prophets of doom in the Opposition are acting in a completely irresponsible manner, and this is a time when objective reasoning and co-operation from aU sections of the community are absolutely necessary in order to get us out of our present difficulties.",87
188,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I join with other members in we extanding congratulations to the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) who has just made his maiden speech. I think that all of us in this House admire greatly the intestinal fortitude that he displayed in making his speech to this chamber on this occasion after the tragic loss of his son. All of us express to the honourable member, to Mrs Sullivan and to their famUy our about as profound grief in their bereavement. I also today as extend my congratulations to all the other fouled up as tohonourable members who have made their maiden speeches either in the Budget debate or in other debates. I think the fact that so many the sole and maiden speeches have been made indicates something of the vicissitudes of poltiical life. It is remarkable to those of us who have been in this House for some time. I have not been is due to here for very many years-ho w many new faces commodicome into this chamber at the beginning of each Parliament, and even during the Ufe of each Parliament. Of course, this is what democracy is all about. The changing voice and face of represenensures that the changmg face of the electorate is itself adequately and efficiently I represented. It is only tragic when those in opgovernment lose touch with the people whom they are supposed to represent. Tragically the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes), who succeeds one of the redoubtablefiguresof the Labor Party, has demonstrated, even in the brieftimehe has been in this Parliament, that he has got out of touch. If anyone thought that the Ministry were in touch, they need to have been Ustening only to the incredible reply given by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) at question time this morning. The reply indicated that he has in no way recognised the cost pressures and the industrial pressures have completely destroyed the vitality of the oribuUding industry in this country. Yet he came in and initiaUy said that things were all right in the buUding mdustry, but then he did say they were So I wonder at the a bit patchy.",88
189,Mr HUNT,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Who does he think he is kidding?,88
190,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I wonder, as my honourable Durfriend from Gwydir says, 'Who does he think he is kidding? Unfortunately the only person he is kidding is himself. It is that which, in this Budget, demonstrates the tragedy of what is happening to this country today. For the country itself is drifting, not only because of the intentional actions ofthose in government, but also because those in government are no longer in touch with what is happening out in the paddocks, in the streets and the highways and the byways of this nation. For the honourable member for Melbourne to talk about unemployment as though it is something that happened in the last 10 years but is not currently with us, and to talk as some members of the Government have talked about inflation being contained and that really it is an inherited world problem, is regrettably just another illustration of their complete failure to recognise the symptoms of what this country is about. As far as inflation is concerned let me briefly refer to Professor Hogan's analysis of the reasons why the problems of inflation in this country can be completely distinguished from those of other countries. First of all we are significantly dependent upon indigenous sources of fuel. In other words the accelerated cost to the industrial countries-Japan , Germany and other European countries-of crude oil has not in any way affected costs in Austraha. Mr Riordan-What nonsense.",88
191,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"'What nonsense' he says, demonstrating how little the honourable reduction member knows of what is going on. We import very minimal percentage of crude into this counabroad try. The percentage which we import relates principally to the heavier fractionated parts the crude and those products are, in fact, at the moment in almost negligible supply. They are in negligible supply because the Prices Justification Tribunal has failed to give to importing panies a price to compensate them for the adAustraUa ditional cost of landing it here. Because of this, fuel is not available. Mr Whan-Com e on.",89
192,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I am glad to hear that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is chamber. I might add that he is one of the few Government members who are here. It is of interest that in northern New South Wales the wheat harvest at the moment is likely to be seriously affected because of the inaction of this Government in trying to help to get fuel supphes to country areas. In my own home town of worth, of the nine principal oil distributors have no distillate supphes available at all. other three have at the very maximum 2 days supply available. A very similar and not much better position apphes to gasoline. Here we have a Budget. Let us talk about the degree to which the economy itself is running away with the very vitality of this nation. We are at a record level of unemployment. With inflation the economy is being destroyed in such a way in any area-whethe r it be the building industry, home ownership or private investment-that this country is in a worse position than it has been at any stage since the war and the blame lies entirely with this Government. This Budget is designed to correct these deficiencies. This it does not do. After the suspension of the sitting for dinner perhaps I will identify the reasons why I believe the Budget might well have been framed in an entirely different way.",89
193,Unknown,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,89
194,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was talking about the impact of inflation. I referred to Professor Hogan's reasons for the separation of the causes of inflation in Australia from those abroad. I suggested that the first reason advanced by Professor Hogan was that we in Australia are significantly dependent upon indigenous sources of crude and are therefore not prejudiced by the way in which the Arab oil exporting countries have advanced the price of crude and have therefore affected the price of crude in so many other countries. The second reason advanced, of course, is the significant in import duties, in tariffs, which has a meant that we have been able to buy goods from at prices significantly lower than many other countries can and that therefore the claim of that we are importing their inflation is denied. The third reason advanced, of course, is in relation to currency revaluation which, until the last devaluation, had put Australian currency at such coma point that goods could be imported into at a significantly lower price than other countries could import them, because of the rate at which the cost factor was moving up in those other countries. Therefore the cost to the consumer in Australia, if the relative currency parity were passed on, should be the same as it was in the prior to the inflationary impact. I mention inflation and I am delighted to see that the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor), who was to be the Acting Prime Minister, is in the chamber because it is of tremendous importance to the Australian people to realise Tamthe farcical manner in which this Government six pursues its administration. Those people who are The hstening to the debate, including the very few Government members who are in the chamber, must have listened with some extraordinary amazement to an announcement that some uniform discrepancy between members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Chinese Government has precluded the Deputy Prime Minister, the present Acting Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns), from embarking on his visit which was to have begun tomorrow morning. I am sure that all of us have not been unconscious of a Cabinet meeting which apparendy took place- I do not know whether this is true, but rumour has it-in the absence of the Minister for Minerals and Energy this afternoon in order to determine whether or not the Cabinet, or those who attended the meeting, were prepared to accept the leadership of the Minister in a period of economic crises which the policies of the Labor Party have induced. But Labor supporters say, as they did this afternoon: 'But our policies have nothing to do with it. Inflation has been induced by those big bad boys in the Liberal and Country Parties 2 years ago'. Have honourable members opposite not read their Budget? Have they not heard about a thing called a property surcharge, or were they not at the Caucus meeting the other day? The surcharge on unearned income is a tax savings. We on this side of the House believe we should encourage the community to save. Indeed, we introduced a homes savings grant scheme not only to encourage private investment in housing but also to encourage own their own homes and to set aside money-to wit, savings-durin g those working years of their lives before marriage, in order that at the time of marriage they might be better able to finance the purchase of their homes. This Government has done nothing but destroy the opportunity of home ownership in our community. This ged Government has created the circumstance of unoutside certainty in economy. The Labor Premier of South Australia pursued a tactic which was puradmission sued by another Labor Premier of New South Wales back in the depression days when he found it necessary to go out into the streets teU the people of his State not to worry about poUcies that his Federal Labor colleagues were pursuing. I believe that Australia has a sound future. believe in the future of permanent buUding Corporation societies. I believe in savings. I deplore the introduced in this Budget, about which this bate is taking place, which penaUses people savings. It is a tax by which the Government to the retired people of our community: ' If you have put money aside in order to help you to maintain your standard of Uving when you retire we wiU tax you on that. We will not just tax you at the normal rate that appUes to somebody who is able to go out and earn his Uving by physical exertion; we will add to it a penal surcharge. You are really hurting our community. You are doing a terrible thing.' That is what the Government is saying. This is the Government which is now saymg: 'Oh, but it is the Liberal-Country Party that has really induced inflauon. It is the Liberal Country Party that is creating uncertainty in our nnancial institutions.' If I may say so, I have never heard more arrant nonsense. That, of course, is the problem. This Government is incompetent, irresponsible and has no confidence even in the men who are Ministers. The man who is No. 3 in the hierarchy is to be denied the opponunity, as he should be-bu t that of course is an expression of view which comes from the Opposition and according to the Government is to be discounted-of being the Acting Prime Mmister at a time when there is economic uncertainty. If the Deputy Prime Minister were genuine in his belief and his expressions ofhis point of view, would he resort to the devious device of saying that the Royal Australian Air Force uniforms are not acceptable in on Communist China? Mr Speaker, have you ever that heard anything more nonsensical? I have honestly never heard a more blatant admission of irresponsibiUty than that which came out of the mouth of the Acting Prime Minister of this young people to country tonight. This Budget regrettably is another manifestation of irresponsibUity. This Budget, produced as it was at the beginning of this new session of Parliament, now 2Vi weeks ago, has been chanby actions of this Government inside and the Parliament on almost every day since the Budget was introduced. What more blatant of incompetence could one have of the Government than that even the day after the Budget was introduced there was an admission and that because of the policies of the honourable the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) and the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson), who is sitting in the front bench opposite, the wool market had collapsed and it was thereI fore necessary to bolster the Australian Wool in its buying policies. The Minister tax for Northern Development and the honourable demember for Eden-Monaro came out and said with that 300c a kUo is too much and that no wool says grower deserves to survive in a circumstance where inflation is eroding his ability to maintain his standard of living by comparison with the wage earner. They said that a floor price of 300c a kilo for wool and the maintenance of wool buying at that rate by the Australian Wool Corporation was irresponsible. Those were the statements by the Minister for Northern Development and the honourable member for Eden Monaro. However, the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) in another place had more sense. He said: ' I have confidence in the commercial judgment of the members of the Australian Wool Corporation. They are acting in accordance with their charter. They are discussing the base price upon which they are purchasing wool with me and officers of the Treasury in accordance with the requirements of the Act. Therefore, I do not beheve that the statements by my colleagues are accurate'. The Minister for Northern Development and the honourable member for Eden Monaro stand condemned because of the way by which they have eroded the returns of every Australian wool grower. Let no Australian be mistaken, the income that our agricultural exports generate still serves as the bulwark behind which this country survives. The erosion that those 2 honourable members have made qn payments that might otherwise have been generated from abroad is the vehicle by which the standard of living of every Australian, be he wage earner or employer, whether he Uves in the city or the country, is being debased. That is what these 2 people have done. I think it is also necessary to look at the Budget and see those other things that have been changed. The Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) shortly after the introduction of the Budget-no t in the Parliament because these men have given away the concept of making poUcy statements in the Parliament; these men no longer regard the Parliament as significant-decide d that in excess of $600m over the next 3 years, or $200m a year, for the construction of pubUc health facUties or hospitals will be spent by this Government. This is not included in the Budget and not referred to in the Parliament, but specificaUy it is placing an additional outlay on the Budget which the Treasurer himself, on page 3 of his Budget Speech, estimated as providing for an additional 32.4 per cent of outlay or $3,980m in 1974-75.",89
195,Mr COHEN,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Pu t some pep mto it. We are getting bored.,91
196,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Order! Interjections are out of order.,91
197,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Mr Speaker, I need no protection from these men. In other words, only 2 nights after the presentation of the Budget, outside the Parliament, without any reference to the people's representatives",91
198,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Order! Interjections will cease. I caU the honourable member for New England.,91
199,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Than k you, Mr Speaker. Outside the Parliament, an additional outlay of $600m was announced over the course of the next 3 years. Then, of course, we had the devaluation decision. Did the Ministers or those who are advising the Ministers-the departmental officers-kno w of the devaluation decision? Of course they did not. Yet the Budget was predicated on a valuation of the Australian currency which was 12 per cent different from that which was current one week after its introduction. You know, Mr Speaker, it is rather fascinating that even last night the Acting Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) and the Acting Treasurer (Mr Hayden) seemed to me to be determining the nnancial policy of this country in a way which one would believe would be more becoming of those who are the permanent incumbents of those positions. They are doing this to the point at which one wonders how permanent their incumbency might be. If ever there has been a palace revolt in Australia, perhaps it was apparent in the reasons, which were revealed to be false, for the Deputy Prime Minister remaining in Australia. The farcical reason given for this was that the uniforms of the Royal Australian Air Force officers on the aircraft were not acceptable to the Peoples' RepubUc of China. This has been used as the reason to hide the fact that these men are incompetent to govern. Tonight we have heard the reason why this BudgetMr Armitage- Mr Speaker, I rise to order. My point of order is that the Deputy Leader of the Country Party is reflecting on the integrity of the Acting Prime Minister. I think that his remarks are in breach of the Standing Orders.",91
200,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Order! I do not think that was intended. I cannot see that any point of order arises. I caU the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party.,91
201,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I think that the honourable member has just served me well. He has Ulustrated how litde respect he has for the excuse which the Acting Prime Minister has announced pubUcly as the reason for his non-visit to China. I would agree that if that was a vaUd reason, perhaps it might be acceptable to the people of Australia that he should remain in Australia. But let us acknowledge the fact that he has no confidence in the man who is standing behind him, the man who supposedly was going to be the Acting Prime Minister. But the reason that the present Acting Prime Minister is remaining in Australia is not because of the exaggerated, nonsensical excuse that he has given; it is because he is concerned about the state of the economy, and well he should be. Mr Speaker, I notice that mytimefor speaking has nearly expired. This Budget is ineffective, firstly, because it has destroyed confidence in the private economy. The Acting Prime Minister has said that we need confidence and yet this Budget destroys it. The Acting Prime Minister has said that we must produce our way out of inflation. Yet, he has denied the ability of every sector of the economy so to do. The Prime Minister of Australia is predicating his future and our country's future on his status in the United Nations and on our ability to equate ourselves with other men and with other countries who are doing just what the Deputy Prime Minister says we should do. Australia is a land of traditional ability and competence. It is a land of tremendous potential. But, this Budget, by itsfinancialimposition on the average citizen, by its destruction of incentive, by its excessive expenditure in the public sector, by its denial of the right of the private sector to employ people, by its destruction of the confidence of every citizen in those traditional avenues of investment, has turned the page backward in a way which this generation will not forget.",91
202,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,92
203,Mr MATHEWS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"People lisThe tening to this debate tonight can dismayed by the destructive note on which it commenced. If Australia's economic problems outlook are to be overcome it might be an idea for this trade House to stop knocking everything that the (estimated Government is doing about them and give the impact countiy a chance to go about its business without try scaring it to death. Before people go on predicthigher ing increases in inflation or unemployment they conditions ought to remember how easy it is for predictions Although of this sort to be self-fulfilling. Anybody who instability thinks that something is done for pubhc conbility of fidence by calling on somebody to restore it had slump-hav better give some thought to the queues which virtually formed this afternoon outside building in Brisbane and Adelaide. Scoring of political points and pushing of party barrows activities of which we can be proud at a time when all around us the economies of countries the very like our own are sliding down into chaos. If we country do not wake up to ourselves soon, being the a national lucky country is an idea we will have to give away. In thefirst6 months of this year the annual rates of inflation recorded by the monthly Consumer Price Index of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development rose to 7.2 per cent in West Germany, 10.3 per cent in New Zealand, 11 per cent in Canada, 13.5 per cent in France, 13.6 per cent in Australia, 15.9 per cent in Britain, 16.1 per cent in Italy, 16.3 per cent in Spain, 18.1 per cent in Finland, 19 per cent in Turkey, 23.2 per cent in Japan, 26.6 per cent in Portugal and 31.9 per cent in Greece. Over the same period the output of the world's 7 largest industrial countries fell at an annual rate of 1 V4 per cent in what the OECD has called 'the most exceptional deceleration of growth ever experienced'. Six million people are going to be out of work in Europe before the end of the year. Five per cent of America's work force is unemployed already and before long thatfiguremay rise to 8 per cent. The risk of the world to which Australia belongs finding itself in a hyper-inflationary slump is confirmed by every reputable economic authority. The London 'Economist' pointed out on 27 July: Economies have become too interdependent for any but governments of the largest countries to be able to control their own destiny, while politically countries remain too independent to be willing to co-operate in controlling the reemerging trade cycle . . . Businesses are cutting their forward investment plans while many governments ar: saying they must follow sterner budgetary policies. If business and government decisions move simultaneously in the same deflationary direction all over the world, the cumulative effect will be a crash. 'Australian Economic Review' noted in its only have been second issue for 1974: The forces underlying this deteriorating . . . include the destabilising effects of massive deficits for the oil importing countries as a whole at some $60 billion for the OECD countries); the widespread cost inflationary pressure which intensifies the of any credit restrictions and tempts most countries to deflationary measures; and the deflationary impact of oil prices, of continued cost inflation in tight credit and of world wide measures to contain inflation. these three problems-the threat of chronic imbalances in international payments with consequent in the international financial system, the possiaccelerating cost inflation and the threat of a world e been evident since the beginning of this year, nothing of a constructive nature has been achieved societies towards their solution. In the same issue the 'Australian Economic are not Review' concluded: In 1974-75 Australia faces, for thefirsttime in its history, real possibility of a developing hyper-inflation. The faces the most serious economic situation since the Depression days of the 1930s and there is an urgent need for consensus in the face of the economic threat. We are not going to overcome that threat obtain the necessary consensus without a assurance measure of commitment on the part of all the interest groups which make up our community. There are at least 4 matters over which we must do better as a community than we have ever inflation done before. Bringing down inflation involves better appreciation on the part of the community as a whole that if restraint is required it can achieved only on the basis of equality of sacrifice. Bringing down inflation involves a better standing of the importance of productivity and better arrangements to stimulate increases in it by rewarding the work force immediately and has proportionately in the wages and salaries that are paid. Bringing down inflation involves better standards of job satisfaction which can be to achieved only if capital and labour accept one another as equal partners in the process of duction. Bringing down inflation involves strikpermission ing a better balance in the allocation of our resources between immediate personal consumption, investment in the plant and through which our future wealth will be generated and spending on the community facilities and services which determine so overwhelmingly the quahty of our lives. The demand inflation which was triggered by the 1972 Budget and the 1972 Uquidity explosion was brought under control early in 1974 by measures such as revaluation of the Australian doUar, tariff reform and the estabhshment of the Prices Justification Tribunal. This tapering off of demand inflation characterised by too much money chasing too few goods was signaUed by the lower rate of increase in the consumer price index for the March quarter. Unfortunately it was foUowed immediately by the onset of a vicious cost inflation as income earners of aU sorts scrambled to maintain their purchasing power in the face of repeated price increases generated during the demand phase. The Government has been urged by many people to attack this cost mflation by budgeting for a massive surplus and generating unemployment on a massive scale, but it has chosen instead to use this Budget as the foundation for a social contract through which inflation can be brought under control without resort to the brutal alternative of unemployment. The Government has been encouraged in this beUef by the overwhelming majority of reputable economic commentators who regard the idea of bringing down mflation through unemployment as ineffectual, inappropriate and unacceptable. In these circumstances we have a Budget which is designed to enlist the co-operation of or the trade union movement through a reto trade union members that they will not lose out by seeking real rather than illusory increases in wages and salaries and will not be asked to contribute more to the fight against than is expected of other sections of the a community. This Budget is designed to draw an equal contribution in the form of tax reductions be forgone and the payment of a capital gains tax and a property income surcharge from people underwhose incomes are derived from high level salaries, professional fees, dividends, rent and interest. If it is too soon to say that this approach been successful, it can be said at least that the signs are promising. At their meeting 2 weeks ago in Sydney, the unions responded positively the Budget with a declaration which, I regret, has not been published in full in any newspaper prothroughout Australia and which therefore I seek to have incorporated in Hansard.",92
204,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Is leave granted? There being machinery no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)This Conference declares that the two problems of increasing inflation and rising unemployment are not unique to Australia but are apparent throughout the economic system of which we are a part; they are to be found in the other 23 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The trade union movement, neither here nor in these other countries can sensibly be blamed for the endemic problems of the capitalist system. This does not mean that we do not have a responsibility to examine the current situation in Australia and to make proposals aimed at securing a more stable efficient and equitable society. Conference expresses its general support for the social concepts and economic strategy contained in the Budget in 1974-75. Particularly on the expenditure side we welcome the significantly increased outlays, for instance, upon education, health, welfare and urban and regional development. On the receipts side, we congratulate the Government for certain initiatives towards greater equity, for the first time tax cuts mean more in money terms to low and middle than to high income earners. However, Conference, in endorsing these submissions put by the ACTU officers to the Government in pre-Budget discussions, assert that until indexation of taxation is introduced, there could be no adequate protection against the erosive effects of inflation on real after-tax incomes. This effect has continued to be a significant factor in the level of wage and salary demands. While we congratulate the Government on its rejection of Treasury budgetary strategy aimed at the early creation of massive unemployment, Conference expresses real concern at the existing level and trend of unemployment. The Government must be prepared to introduce supplementary measures directed towards the restoration of full employment. These measures should include the degree of quantative restrictions on imports necessary to provide assistance to industries, such as clothing, textiles, footwear and 'white' goods, which are currently suffering reductions in activity and employment well beyond that even contemplated in July 1973. Such measures should be supplemented by direct assistance to sections of industries in particular need and consideration should also be given to increased direct Government participation in industry. The Government should, at the earliest opportunity, seek to achieve a lowering in rates munity. Cuts in indirect tax would also have a stimulatory activity as well as being equitable in terms of relevant income distribution. Such cuts in indirect taxes would also have a direct impact in reducing the price level. As a further direct measure to reduce prices, the Australian Government should consider the introduction reduce charges in service industries, which enter into the cost ofliving. Conference declares that co-existent with action by the Government along the above lines, the objective of the trade union movement to secure wage and salary justice would be pursued in the following manner (a) Automatic quarterly adjustment for cost of living changes (indexation) of award'wages; (b) annual adj ustment for national productivity changes; and (c) within individual awards and determinations, changes in work value and other relevant considerations. Contrary to those commentators and sections of the media who have sought to confuse this important issue by dehberate misrepresentations, the implementation of this total package will not constitute 'wage restraint' but will provide a sound basis for real improvements in wage and salary standards. Conference also expresses its concern at the effects of inflation on pensioners and others on fixed incomes and urges the Government to constantly review pension rates and other social service benefits in accordance with ACTU policy. Conference believes that the fundamental prerequisite of the co-operation envisaged and continuing consultation between the Government and the trade union movement on all matters affecting the level and direction of economic activity and the social welfare of the community. The trade union movement stands ready to participate in such consultations with Government and, indeed, with other important sections of the Australian community. In putting many proposals for action by Government in the past, the trade union movement has repeatedly come up against the assertion of lack of constitutional powers. Should it appear to Government in consultations with the trade union movement that it is confronted by a lack of appropriate powers which it would wish to exercise to achieve these objectives, the trade union movement will give sympathetic consideration to supporting attempts by the Government to acquire these powers.",93
205,Mr MATHEWS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"That declaration and the Budget which made it possible are both prelimisince nary statements of positions which can provide a basis for future negotiation. The criticisms that have been made of the Budget and of the declarbarely ation, in such form as it was published in the newspapers and publicised by the media, missed the point. These are preUminary statements of the position on which the process of negotiation will continue until a solution-a n arrangement acceptable to both sides-ca n be reached. With goodwUl on both sides we are going to estabUsh a social contract which will provide enduring protection against the difficulties caused by greedy and irresponsible economic behaviour in the past. Preserving and enhancing still further the of interest throughout the comprospects of this contract is a task that demands effect on responsibiUty on the part of not only this Parliament but also all of Australia's media. In normal times, scepticism towards governments on the part of the media serves the best interests of a democratic society. Normally it is fair enough for of special grants to States to newsworthiness to determine what the media disseminate and for sensation to be the stuff of which media profits are made. But we are all media consumers now and even the most sceptical of us are influenced in our moods, and attitudes and actions by what the media give us to read and hear and see. The media cannot credibly or consistently go on expressing alarm about an economic situation which they seem to be determined to worsen. If the various sections of the media cannot bring themselves to praise the many good things contained in the Budget, they should at least give the community information about them with a minimum of destructive and dismaying commentary. The media could remain sceptical about the overtures that the Government has made and the response those overtures have drawn from the unions without doing everything in their power to deny to the community the hope on which, after all, confidence depends. The fear which prompted in this Resolution is full Roosevelt's famous warning was not all a product of direct personal experience on the part of the Americans to whom it was addressed. Much of it was manufactured in the process of the media of the day marketing their news. That is not something that we can afford to allow to happen in this country. Over and beyond the problem of reaching the sort of accommodation between interest groups in society of which the social contract is afirstexpression there looms the problem of a more adequate level of productivity. The Acting Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) said correctly enough on Monday-som e speakers in this debate have confirmed it-that the only lasting solution for the inflation by which our society is gripped is for us to produce our way out of it. Australia has begun to appreciate the enormous gains that are waiting to be won from the people who contribute labour to industry and the people who contribute capital working together on the basis of an equal partnership. The idea of sharing not only the earnings of an industry but also the decisions which make them possible is one we have be able to as yet barely begun to explore. Our faUure to achieve reasonable levels of productivity is a failure not so much of vigour as of vision. We have failed so far to see beyond crudities of piecework and incentive payments a situation in which the best is given to enterprises which people working in them recogto nise as their own. It should be a considerable relief to our community that for thefirsttime attention of management consultants, academics specialising in industrial relations and govern to ment departments is being turned towards this approach to the increase of productivity. were previously in a blind alley. We kept repeating the same old slogans and getting noductivity where. Tne breakout in this area is being made and it is integral to the whole problem of inflain tion. There cannot be a lasting solution to inflawhich uon-socia l contract or not-unles s we can come up with arrangements under which industrial relations can be harmonised and productivity can be maximised. That is the goal towards which we should be working, not as separate interest groups but as interest groups with some idea of the things that bind us together as nation and a community. The day after the Budthe get the 'Australian Financial Review', in a leadthe ing article, concluded: The Government has made its own poltiical decided it can defuse the pressures onstrating to the trade unions its intention of restructuring society along lines which will benefit them. It is now up to those Mr Hawke represents to declare themselves. be a short sighted Australian who did not wish the succeed at this level. Those Mr Hawke represents have declared themselves. The declaration has come forward from the meeting of unions that was held in ney. The process of bringing inflation under conworld. trol by negotiation between the trade union movement and the Government, which other nations might envy, is under way. The question now is: How many Australians are short sighted, and how many Australians in fact are capable of taking the national view and of discerning where the national interest Ues these crucial matters. The signs, as we have them in the media and heard them in this debate, are not encouraging. Australians hstening night would have good reason to be dismayed. For many other countries less fortunate than ours in their resources and less manageable than sociaUy, serious economic difficulties avoidable. For Australia this is not the case. The Parliament and the media through which the community learns about the thinking of its government must shoulder heavy responsibuiway ties. If we puU together, the problems which face us are not insuperable. If we go on the way are going, we are down the drain. the Mr VINER (Stirling) (8.34)-The speeches to made in this House by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews) are always interesting Usten to, but I regret to say that I am never quite sure where they lead us. I think that can be the said of the honourable member's speech on the Budget. He called for an aUegiance of the Press the Government, an allegiance of the Press to the social contract of the unions and an alWe legiance of the unions to the Government. He on caUed for such things as good will and proin the community as a solution to inflation. All of those things were mentioned and yet the end I was puzzled as to the direction in he would want to take Australia, and this is the centre of the great debate at the present time. The Opposition and the Government certainly have different views on the direction in which Australia should be taken and the methods by which it should be taken in that direction; but at least one thing is certain, and that a is that the present Government knows neither direction in which Australia should go nor method by which it should be taken there in that direction. That is abundantly clear from the Budget itself and from the speeches on the Budjudgment and get from the Government side. of cost inflation by demI heard earher today in the speeches from It would honourable gentlemen on the Government side Budget to criticism of any member of the Opposition who even suggested that there was an element of despair or gloom pervading the economy of Australia. Yet we have the honourable member for Casey really forecasting a situation of doom Sydand despair not only in Australia but in the It is very good of him to call for good will on aU sides because certainly, above all things, other countries of the western world have found that good will and a unity of purpose are what is required to defeat inflation, but when the honourable gendeman speaks of good will I would endeavour to inject a note of practicality into the debate. Good will is a fine sounding senon timent, but in the world of economics what is readneeded above all is sound economic management. If one thing is sure it is that we have not tohad sound economic management from this Government since it has been in office. There is no need for me to catalogue the series of fiscal ours and monetary changes of pace that have occurmay be unred since December 1972. My colleague the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) in a most eloquent last night in a penetrating speech analysed the criticism of stop-go poUcies and showed how we stop-go policies are the very epitome of the actions of this Government. He coined a phrase that might well be used more often in this House and outside: Slumflation. We have heard of stagflation; we have heard tonight of hyperinflation, but the honourable member might well have coined one of those words that will Uve for a long time-slumflation . That is a quite accurate description of the situation in which we might well find ourselves in Australia within a short time. But let me go back to the 1973 Budget. Before that Budget we were told 2 things by the fact Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the Prime Minister taining (Mr Whidam). Firsdy, we were told by the Treasurer that the Budget was only one the Government's overaU economic strategy to manage the economy. We know fuU well that the other parts of the economic strategy simply have not worked. Secondly, we were told by the Prime Minister that inflation was the most serious omic matter commanding the attention of the Government. That was said before the 1973 Budget. It took an election on 18 May this year persuade the Prime Minister that inflation was real issue within the community. that election by a reduced majority, the result of the election compeUed the Prime Minister to acknowledge as a serious matter what he was only prepared before to flirt with in words. But having won the election, spoken to the people and ackabroad. nowledged mflation the Prime Minister very promptly in this Budget abandoned the idea that inflation was a real problem. In the 12 months which have passed since that 1973 Budget it obvious that this Government has no strategy managing the economy and it does not reaUy tainty regard inflation as a serious matter. Rather the Government feeds off inflation andtinkerswith the economy as each shift in prices, wages, unof employment or money supply occurs. In other days this was condemned by the Government when it was in Opposition as stop-go poUcy. Today the economic gyrations of this Governindustrial ment are recognised as the consequence of abject abandonment of any pretence to economic leadworld. ership. There is no economic strategy exercised by this Government. There is no leadership-let alone economic leadership-in this Government. Above aU, there is no real commitment to fight inflation. One has only to read the Budget Speech to recognise that. There is no commitwhich ment at aU by the Treasurer to fight inflation. Rather, there is only a frightened group of twitching in response to every economic pressure in the country. It is a group of men led by leader who is more concerned about tripping recognise overseas with his pubUc relations entourage try to get Senator WUlesee elected president the United Nations. I wonder whether the people of Australia are more concerned about the election of Senator WUlesee as president of the United Nations than they are about fighting inflation. I do not think that the people of Australia give a damn whether Senator WUlesee is elected President of the United Nations. I do believe they give a damn about the state of the economy of their country. This is a matter of paramount importance to Australia today. Unless the Prime Minister of Australia realises that he has no hope within his own Party of sushis leadership of that Party and he has no hope within the country of sustaining his purpart of ported leadership of the nation. The people of Australia sense that they are living in the shadows of a world economic crisis of proportions not faced since the depression years econof the 1930s. The people know this. They may not be able to articulate it because they are not aU academics, neither are they ail economists. to But many of them are ordinary Australians with a a common sense appreciation of how to manage Having won their own household. Today, in the affairs of our great countiy, I say without any hesitation that the Prime Minister ought to be here at home and not playing about The economic affairs of this nation are of much greater importance today than is speech making at the United Nations, however important the United Nations may be in bringing is about some order in the international comfor munity. We are Uving in times of great uncerin the world. As I look upon it, the world is at a watershed in its post-war economic history. There has been a fundamental shift in the wealth the western world resulting from the actions of the Arab oU producers late last year. In one massive stroke they have syphoned off from the western world tens of bUlions if not hundreds of bUUons, of dollars which once financed the expansion of Europe, Japan, North America and other countries of the western There is no need for me to turn to statistics Uke an economic technician tojustify this point. I tliink it is observable by anybody who wants to look at what has happened. The Arabs gave the international monetary system a shove from it cannot recover either in the short term or perhaps in the long term, at least without a funmen damental adjustment of the world monetary system. The balance of economic power in the a world will not be the same again. Australia must this quickly and adjust itself to the new to world economic order, because Australia must of find its place in the new world economy. All the outpourings of the Government about multinational corporations will be old hat, because if the Government would only recognise it the multinationals of the world do not have the liquidity that they had a few years ago. Therefore, they cannot move their income or their wealth around the world as they could before. The multinationals have gone home; they have taken their money back to their home countries because their home countries are in dire need ofit. What Australia has to look to is the way in which it can, in the nauonai interest, take advantage of the money which has been siphoned off from the western world into the Arab nations by way of the petro-dollar. It is interesting that the present Government has been dealing with the Shah of Iran, but at the same time it has been denying any sentiment towards economic nationalism. It has been denying any sentiment towards resources diplomacy. At the same time through the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor), it is using the weapon of economic nationalism to the hilt and using the weapon of resources diplomacy to the hilt. But Australia cannot find its place in the new world economy which is to come without clear headed economic thinking and unmistakable political leadership. Regrettably we are having neither of those things from within the ranks of the Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has abandoned any pretence to economic leadership, let alone pohtical leadership of his own Party. He has abdicated responsibility for economic affairs to the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Caims). The poor Treasurer (Mr Crean) has been left only to deliver his annual Uttle boy monologue at Budgettime.Waiting in the wings of the Australian Labor Party is the President of the Australian Labor Party and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bob Hawke. One can recognise the unmistakable stance of a feline animal waiting to pounce when the next election comes and the Prime Minister loses his head. But Australia cannot wait for these things to happen within the Australian Labor Party because Australia cannot find its place in this new world economic order without controIUng the situation at home. We must, as a nation, have a blueprint for the future and a battle plan for the present. This Australian Labor Party Government has neither. There is no doubt that the dominant subject for poltiical debate in Australia in 1974 is mflation. Yet, as I said, one finds no word of that the Treasurer's Budget Speech. But if inflation dominant in many ways, it is a strange and quixotic thing. The Government does not recognise it and the Opposition wants to debate it. All of these things must leave the public rather perplexed. Maybe this is one of the deficiencies of our party system of government. It takes the people longer to decide which side of the argument to accept-the Government's side or the Opposition's side. Which side they accept in the end is very largely dependent upon the turn of economic events and then one or other of the sides of the argument can say: ' I told you so'. In contrast we find, when we look to some of the other western nations and in particular the United States of America, that there is a commitment to defeat inflation. President Ford has declared inflation to be pubUc enemy number one, and so it is. What a heartening thing it would be if we had the Prime Mmister, the Treasurer or the Deputy Prime Minister declare that inflation in Australia is public enemy number one. That is what it is and that is what it must be recognised to be. With an inflation rate approaching something of the order of 20 per cent as against the United States inflation rate of something of the order of 11 per cent, how much more sure it is that it is public enemy number one in this country. Having identified it for what it is the American nation has set itself upon a path of pubUc debate and public involvement by all sectors of the community to see how this enemy can be defeated. Labour, business and agriculture are aU drawn mto the battle, along with the academic economists and the practical politicians. In Australia there is no identification of inflation as an enemy of the community. There is no leadership within the Government and there is no wiU within the Government to defeat inflation. If only those 3 things would appear how much better off Australia would be. We hear so many conflicting statements from these 3 people within the Government, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer, at a time when we have inflation running at a much faster rate of growth increase than ever there was in those 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Government. How well we remember Bob Hawke condemning the MCMahon Government as an evU government because unemployment was iurining at the rate of 120,000. Mr Mathews-Because it was created deUberately.",94
206,Mr VINER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"When we compare that figure in with the presentfigures,which are running in the is order of 180,000-thes e are not myfiguresbut those of the Deputy Prime Minister-wha t would the honourable member for Casey say if we concreate demned the Whitlam Government as an evil establishing government for promoting unemployment? We have only to look at the statements of the Deputy Prime Minister who acknowledges that in July the Government was advised that its policies its acuons would lead to an increase in unemnot ployment. Both inflation and unemployment are evils. For the benefit of honourable members the Government side, I draw upon the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequor of the United Kingdom, who recendy referred to the twin evils of unemployment and inflation, for that is they are; unemployment so degrading of human dignity, a waste of human resources and debilithe tating to the economy; inflation the standard of living, rendering savings if not worthless then seriously depleted and setting despair amongst the community. We have only to look at the movement of inflation rates in Australia since December 1972, it. from somewhere around 4V4 per cent, to Budget time in 1973, somewhere around 12 per cent 13 per cent. Now the rate is somewhere around 20 per cent. What all this indicates, is the dearth of both political and economic leadership in Australia at the present time. We the Prime Minister away from the country, the Deputy Prime Minister about to go to China, and the Treasurer also out of the country. We have talk, which is not unreal, of, if not a run, at least rapid withdrawal of funds from building sociement. ties, pressure on the banks, and the Reserve Bank being asked to stave off this run on the financial institutions of the country. If the Deputy Prime Minister leaves this country tomorrow for China, throughout next week, represents. which will be a critical time in the country, we will have as Acting Prime MinisterHeaven forbid-the Minister for Minerals Energy. Anyone who has studied the affairs that Minister's portfolio will know what a time we are in for under him.",97
207,Mr SPEAKER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Order! The honourable the member's time has expired.,98
208,Mr MORRIS,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"The prethe vious speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner), followed the course folindustrialised lowed by the Opposition since it came to this place in December 1972 and again in May this year, a course of deUberately setting about frighten people, to scare individuals, to underthey mine public confidence and to undermine busiof ness confidence. I have said it before and I say again: The greatest enemies of business are representatives in this place. They have set about on a course of underrnining pubhc confidence, division and unrest in the community. If better relations with our trading partners is playing about abroad, that is the definition of the previous speaker. If seeking new major markets for our produce, which is someand thing the Opposition when in government could do, is playing about abroad, that again is the definition of the previous speaker. He represents on in this place an ideology which is based on divisivness and on setting one Australian against another.

That is the kind of ideology that the previous speaker That is all I have to say about it. The affairs of this matter speaks for itself. and It is unfortunate that the Opposition's apof proach to this debate has in the main been a dire negative one. Honourable members opposite have chosen to continue to carp and criticise rather than to offer constructive alternatives to propositions put forward by the Australian Labor Government. Their constant harping on difficultiesflowingfrom the inflationary situation which exists in Australia and in all the non-communist countries is proof of their negative attitude to thefinancialproblems that confront our nation and our trading to partners. They deUberately ignore the fact that in government, and particularly the Leader the Opposition (Mr Snedden) as Treasurer in it 1971-72, foUowed a course offinancialirresponits sibility that generated the inflation that now affects Australia. The present excess inflation to had its beginnings in Australia in 1971. Will anyone forget the 72-hour cliff-hanger in December 1971 when the Leader of the Opposition as Treasurer fought and lost out to the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) in an attempt to revalue the Australian dollar? In the 2 years that followed, as a result of that dereliction of duty by the then Treasurer, the Right Honourable Billy Mackie Snedden, over $2,000m more was earned from exports, and about $3,000m of capital or, should I say, hot money came in from overseas. Australian banks and fringe institutions created another $2,000m or more. It was in that upsurge of money in the private sector that our domestic inflation had its beginnings. It is all very well for the Opposition to forget its past nnancial policies, particularly its exchange rate pohcies, but it is patently dishonestforthe Opposition to criticise this Government's anti-inflation policies when in fact this Government inherited a greatly over-heated economy from the Opposition. The public should be reminded that every step-eve n the prices and incomes referendum last December-that this Government has taken to control inflation since December 1972 has been blindly opposed by those who sit opposite. Like their obstructionist colleagues in another place-the Senate-whateve r the Australian Labor Government proposes, they are 'agin' it even before they have heard the proposal. Inflation is the most serious problem facing the industrialised nations of the world since World War II. As the previous speaker said, President Ford of the United States of America recently declared inflation as pubhc enemy No. 1 in the United States. He stated at the opening of the recent ference to find solutions to inflation in the States of America that 'there is no miracle ution' to inflation and other problems. That statement needs to be driven home particularly to the Opposition and to every responsible citizen in our land. There is no miracle solution to tion; no simple, easy answer. Honourable schedules members opposite who attempt to lead people to believe that there is a simple, painless remedy inflation are deceiving our nation, are building up false expectations and, by their refusal to the reality of the situation, are sabotaging best interests of the Austrahan people. To reap the longer term benefits of a lesser rate of inflaappUances tion we must be prepared to endure the short term pain of corrective action. However, this Government will not accept solution which embodies long term massive uncapital employment. That is the package deal or, should I say, the Snedden 'snack pack' which the Opposition proposes. Inflation is an international disease which afflicts all our trading partners. Its ultimate world solution will demand international co-operation, an international approach, and a system of international financial arrangements. As a major earner of energy resources we are in a favourable position compared with many of our neighbours. However, if Australia and other western nations pursue a 'begger thy neighbour' monetary policy, much more difficulttimeslie ahead for the western nations. We will not be able to remain forever an impregnable island in an international nnancial sea. Our neighbours' attitudes and approaches to inflation must affect the success or otherwise of Australia's efforts to regulate inflation. The decision of oil producing countries to quadruple the price of oil has posed the greatest threat for over a generation to the economy and to the pohtical stability of the industrialised nations. The increase in the oil prices by the oil producers is the equivalent of the levying of an annual tax on the rest of the world of approximately US$70 billion. Unless of this money is put back into the economies from which it has been extracted in the form of consumer and capital expenditure, it must have a contractionary effect on the economy. Australia is yet to feel the full effect of the increased oil price on its trading customers. The solution to international inflation lies not in individual financial policies of the nations concerned but in a joint pohtical and financial solution evolved in co-operation with all induscontrialised nations and oil producing nations. What United we need in Australia is a joint effort by the solGovernment and by the private sector to develop a consensus of approach to the international financial scene. The Treasurer (Mr Crean) in his Budget Speech said that the keynote of the Budinflaget was social progress. An examination of its proves the truth of that statement. For example, there was an increase of 78 per cent in for expenditure on education; $7Sm was provided for pre-school and child care programs; $28m face was made available to commence the constructhe tion of new hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane; provision was made for home dialysis free of charge; additional funds were provided for nursing homes and for the national drug education program; a further step has been taken in the abolition of the means test for pensioners; increased rent assistance has been given a to pensioners; there has been a doubling of the subsidy available under the Aged Persons Homes Act; a new handicapped chUds aUowance of $ 10 a week is to be paid to parents and guardopposed ians in respea of a child under 16 years of who is cared for at home and who, because of severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attendon; a 34 per cent increase, which is $67m, is to be made available in grants States for welfare housing and there is the possibility of further grants should circumstances rant. These are but a few of the many items vided for in the 1974-75 Budget which make truly one of social progress. I turn now specifically to the benefits provided works to local government in this Budget. In New ible South Wales for almost 30 years local governsaid but ment associations have fought for recognition of replace the principle that local government should recouncUs.existing ceive a share from the common When local government was established councils revenues so as to were called upon to provide only basic services satisfaaoiy range which were related to property. However, in the grants are to be spent years since World War II councils called upon to provide an increasing range of cultural, recreational and community services which benefit all people while revenue capacity has been limited to the collection of rates levied on property. Local government was caught in vice of limited revenue capacity and arisingpubbased, lic expectation of service. It is useful to remember that in over 23 years of successive LiberalcouncUs Country Party Adrrunistrations the debt of local government multiplied 12times.Local governby ment authorities are borrowing more each year now than was the total amount of their outstandthat ing debt ofjust over 20 years ago. Our opponents opposite, who regularly 'centralism', deliberately refused to recognise the desperate financial plight of councils. For years local government was hamstrung by the Liberal-Country Party Administration in office. This Labor Government, committed to the sparse upgrading of the status of local government, implemented, with maximum speed, its premany election promises of financial assistance to counprojeas cils under several headings. The Budget provides $56.3m in 'no strings attached' grants to 807 councils, or 92 per cent of the applicant local government bodies in Australia. The purpose these grants is to assist councUs to provide a dard of services comparable with the services enjoyed by other communities in Australia. They are not intended to replace existing State governWales, ment grants or rates collected by councUs. They are intended to help Uft the standards of less favoured areas to a parity with average stannot dards. Following the expansion of the Australian poltiical Grants Commission last year-anothe r proposal by the Opposition, which even opposed age at the polls the referendum relating to local the government-87 6 councUs made submissions to the Australian Grants Cornmission and 807 of them wiU receive assistance ranging from $3,000 to the up to $2m, the average grant being about $64,000. I am particularly pleased that in my warown electorate of Shortland, Lake Macquarie proShire Council will receive $870,000 and Newit casde City Council $716,000. These grants will enable those councUs to carry out expanded programs, thus providing much needed services years sooner than would have been possfor the actions of this Government. As I earUer, the grants are not intended to State grants or rates charged by It needs to be made clear that the grants pool of taxation. are designed equalise or top up councU to aUow the councUs to provide a and level of services. The at the discretion of the have been councUs concerned. The assessment of the amount of the grants the was made by the Grants Commission and was firsdy, on the revenue capacity of each applicant councU as compared with constituent in the relevant region, consideration being given to the actual revenue being collected the council; secondly, the required expenditure of the appUcant councU as compared with of brother constituent councUs in the region to provide a quaUty of services comparable with the services of brother councUs within the region cry and as compared with other regions; and, thirdly, the degree of disabUity or deficiency 23 suffered by the councU in the form of a physical nature, such as area, topography or distances and disabUity in the form of population, such as population or dense population requiring has a greater intensity of pubUc services. Whilst councUs made submissions setting out they needed to be carried out, such projects were not a major factor in the assessment of the disabUity and/or deficiency of the councUs. The adoption by this Government of the Ausof traUan Grants Commission's recommendations stanfor 1974-75 is the greatest boost local government has received since Federation. It is unfortunate that some outgoing councUs in New South in some cases at the final meeting of their 1971-74 term of office, saw fit to allocate expenditure of their grants aware that the grants canbe legally available to projects before December this year. They did this to try to gain local kudos at the recent New South Wales government elections. Mr Speaker, the funds for local government in this Budget, as recommended by the Australian Grants Commission, are only the beginning. The Grants Commission, commenting on the poor quality of information submitted by some of the apphcant councils, said at page 37 of its first report: The recommendations should not, therefore, be taken necessarily representing the relativities that will apply future when the Commission has the benefit of more reliable data and better knowledge of local conditions. Anotherfirstfor local government in this Budget is the allocation of $ 14.1m for thefirstyear of 3-year area improvement program spread over the 13 regions identified by the Department Urban and Regional Development. Applications in respect of this program have tended to fused by councils with appUcations and subsquare missions to the Australian Grants Commission. needs to be pointed out also that appUcations under the area improvement program are for specific projects only whereas apphcations to Grants Comniission are for assistance by way of equaUsation or by the topping up offinancialasdependence sistance. The types of projects which have been apcisions proved under the areas improvement program are projects that have long been needed in many local government areas. The grant to the Hunter region, which comprises 18 local government bodies, representation of which I share with coUeagues, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock), the honourable member for Patat terson (Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), of education. is approximately $lm. This grant will be much appreciated and will enable projects to be underI taken and services to be provided there much sooner than otherwise would have been the case. The Budget, in one word, for local government a milestone.",98

214,Mr BUNGEY,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES," I am proud to represent the electorate of Canning in this House. I follow Mr Jack HaUett who represented Canning in this Parliament for some 11 years. as Like Mr Hallett, my prime interest is in agriculin the ture. Again in common with Mr HaUett, I have a vital interest in the wool industry although many of my views on the need for comprehensive wool marketing reform differ markedly from the views a he often expressed. I pay tribute to Mr Hallett's contribution to this Parliament and his contribuof tion to the electorate of Canning. be conCanning is an electorate of some 49,000 miles-the ninth largest in AustraliaIt covering outer metropolitan areas within 16 mUes of Perth and stretching through the agricultural areas of Western Australia to Esperance the some 500 mUes from Perth. Sixty per cent of people in the electorate Uve in rural areas. Their is directly or indirectly on agriculture. I wiU be largely concentrating on the impact of this Budget and of other Government deon agriculture, on country towns, and on the economic and social welfare of rural people. The remaining electors of Canning live in the near metropolitan shires of Arnadale-Kelmscott, Rockingham and Mandurah. Government demy cisions on shipbuUding and manufacturing at Kwinana, and on bauxite mining and processing Pinjarra vitally affect them. Also, being rapidly growing residential areas, they are concerned with policies on housing, sewerage, provision of community and sporting facUities and first wish to express my concern at the growing division between the metropoUtan areas and rural areas. On too many occasions, the relais tionship between city and country appears to be expressed in the terms of a grandfinalfootball match: That only one side can win; and that a concession or benefit given to one side must to the other result in a disadvantage or penalty side. This division is fostered not but also by union leaders themselves. It is and city, rural and that has a vital part to play in the growth of the the document 'Rural Policy in Australia' is its examination of rural policy within a context of policy, to be judged by its contribution to overall economic and social objectives. Whilst the country-city division is promoted by politicians of all pohucal panies for shon term poltiical gains, I want to comment particularly on the attitude of farmer leaders. Too often, I feel, farmers rely on the views of the eighteenth century French plulosophers and embryo economists known as the physiocrats. The physiocrats saw land as the ultimate source of wealth, and agriculture as the only fruitful labour. Trade, commerce and industry were regarded as sterile, merely tramforrning the products of agriculture. By promoting such views Australian farmer leaders are ignoring the inter-dependence of aU sectors necessary for the development of a strong, vital Australian economy. Acceptance of the inter-dependence of sectors does not place agriculture at a disadvantage. It is stiU vitaUy imponant both in its contribution to the total Australian productive effon and in its contribution to Australian trade and overseas earnings. Promotion by farmer leaders and farmer organisations of demonstrations and retaUatory action against governments or unions can only be self defeating. Such demonstrations and retaUatory action can give internal soUdarity to an organisation, but the net result is that they widen and give permanence to the existing gulf between farmers and the rest of the community. The resources of farmer organisations can be used much more effectively. Farmer bodies are now operating within a different framework in which there is an Industries Assistance Commission, and in which submissions on rural matters to Government will be reviewed critically within the national context. This is not a phenomenon of the Labor Government, the same was developing under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government and would, I expect, continue under the next Liberal-Country Party Government. Submissions to government and submissions to the Industries Assistance Commission must be of a high order, more professional, more logicaUy argued and better supported by facts and statistics than have been many rural submissions in the past. I see this as the greatest challenge now facing farmer organisations, and it is pleasing to note the number that have already responded to this chaUenge. Farmer leaders and farmer organisations a vital part to play, too, in making effective positive contributions in many other areas. Presaid: sumably, the Green Paper report has to be adapted to become a set of guideUnes for rural poUcy, and I would hope that vital changes are to be initiated in wool marketing. Although on Paper occasions in the past the Labor Government has shown scant concern for consultation with after farmer organisations, I would hope that in the future it and subsequent governments will accept the need for thorough and detaUed consultation. Farmer organisations have a further responsibiUty to put forward experienced and capable representatives for marketing boards and the Uke, especially in view of the claim by the cunent Government that it will choose the best man avaUable, although I am afraid this often merely means a union official rather than a rural producer. The Government has been inconsistent in its decisions on rural industries. Many Government members have used the Green Paper to support Government decisions but faU to take account of a number of decisions which run counter to the recommendations and spirit of the Green Paper. Many of the Government's decisions on agriculture appeared to be based on the facUe slogan 'You've never had it so good'. At thetimeit was made it may have been superficially true, but the author of that slogan took a very shallow view and made no serious attempt to evaluate trends in the costs of agricultural inputs or of the market outlook for a number of agricultural commodities. Is it any wonder that there was afiercereaction by farmers and by poltiical Parties on this side of the House, who take a genuine interest in agriculture, particularly when the slogan appears in many cases to be the sole justification for many rural policy decisions? The slogan certainly has no vaUdity in the current rural situation. Whilst the outlook for sugar and grain may be bright, the outlook for beef, sheep meats and wool is far from being so. Cost pressures are severe because of uncontrolled inflation, and when this is coupled with a tight credit market the picture, long or short term, is not cheerful. If the Government justifies many of its decisions of 1973 by the buoyancy of the rural sector at thetime,it would appear logical and consistent to expect a reversal of such poUcies and a reinstatement of some concessions, maybe in a different form, in the current poor situation of farmers. This Budget does not do so, and in fact the contribution being paid by farmers by way of levies and taxes is greater than ever behave fore. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), adand dressing the National Press Club on 4 July 1974, The objective of the Government inrequestinga Green indicates our general approach to the making of decisions in the rural sector and indeed for other industries, lt shows the way a Labor Government will make decisionsfull public inquiry and Tree public debate. I need only point to the case of the superphosphate bounty to show the inconsisGovernment. tency between the spoken word and Governoutlays ment action. The removal of the superphosphate bounty was an arbitrary decision, not discussed and not investigated. The current reference to Industries Assistance Commission concerning superphosphate is a narrow reference relating only to new land farmers in Western Australia. The view recently expressed in this House, that the reference will enable an overall review bounty, does not accord with fact. The original request by the Farmers Union of Western Australia was for an overall investigation, the Government determined that the inquiry should be limited solely to new land farmers. Further inconsistencies are shown in the Government's treatment of the nitrogenous fertigrowers liser subsidy. The arguments for and against both the fertiliser subsidy and the compared superphosphate subsidy would appear to be identical, yet the Government has made 2 widely different decisions. The inconsistency is even more blatant when we realise that sugar be prospects are good and that the apphcation of superphosphate does have residual benefit on soil fertility. Rural credit is another vital which members of the Government Party have much talked large and acted small. One recalls their promises of 1972 to provide long term, low interest loans for farmers. In effect, they have merely continued credit facilities existing on entry to office; no significant initiatives have been made. The Green Paper saw no the family farmer, if there was adequate flexibility in the supply and availability of rural tiesThe credit. The 1972 Bureau of Agricultural omics paper 'Rural Credit in Australia' pointed out deficiencies in rural credit. In effect, this Government has acted concountiy versely and, bytighteningcredit through monedation. tary restrictions, by increasing interest rates, lessening the amount allocated for rural reconmany, struction and, in this Budget, by introducing capital gains tax, has gravely weakened the ition of the family farmer. With a capital gains tax making no allowances for inflation, it will particularly severe on farming estates, where assets are illiquid. The capital another vulture, joining the vultures of death and probate duties at the death Lack of action on promises to provide means of $150 reactsfor stabilising rural incomes to counteract fluctuations places the family farmer at a further schools who are required todistance disadvantage. In the House last week a Government member attempted to prove that agriculture was receiving more support today than under the previous He grouped under government all expenditure, whetherfinancedby agricultural producers or whether in the form of loans to the agricultural sector. This total outlay the figure is misleading. Government outlay on wool this year is shown in the Budget Papers as $ 102m, to which a Government supporter would probably add $150m being the loan to the Australian Wool Corporation for marketing support. of the Growers will contribute $71.7m this year through levies on wool sold. Of the total of $252m claimed as Government outlay on wool, but only some 9 per cent or $22.9m is aid to the industry not to be repaid or not to be paid by grower contribution. Wheat outlays are shown at $1.8m, but $1.5m will be paid by grower levy. A further payment of $39m is expected from wheat for the stabUisation fund. The true picture shows Government expenditure of $0.3m, with a grower contribution of $40.5m. Examination shows sinular results for such items as inspection services, rural reconstruction and certain irrigation projects. In fact, the amount to extracted from producers this financial year by way of wool tax and other levies is $ 162.3m, as against $64.5m last year- a rise of 150 per area in cent or, in money terms, $84m. Additionally, of the other outlay forecast is in the form of interest bearing, repayable loans and cannot be counted as a permanent burden on the taxpayer. their I wish to touch on the social and economic welfare of people Uving in rural areas. The Green threat to Paper recommended as follows: aim of policy should continue to be to reduce dispariin the provision of public service and amenities, between Econurban and rural areas. Government charges for telephone installation in country areas and the cost of telephone calls in areas hardly accord with this recommenWhilst the Budget proposal to abolish by television and radio licence fees may appeal to the decision in effect taxes those people in a outlying areas who do not have a television serposvice. It worries me that so many people are enthusiastic about the introduction of colour telebe vision when significant areas of my electorate are stiU unable to receive a black and white telegains tax is vision service. The Budget decision to reduce the education of the family farmer. concession taxation purposes from $400 to harshly on some country people. seasonal Parents who live some board from high their chUdren wiU be severely affected. Boarding costs at government hostels in Western Australia are about $ 1,185 a year. A fanuly can receive $350 a year under the isolated children scheme. Ignoring other costs such as fares, pocket money, uniforms, etc., the net expenditure of $835 by the parents can be offset only by a claim of $ 150 as a taxation deduction. This position is compounded if more than one child is involved. Much the same picture emerges even if the parents combined income is below $6,300- a figure very close to the average weekly earnings-and they qualify for the additional boarding allowance. I am referring to children attending state high schools and staving at high school hostels, not those attending private boarding schools. Similar disabilities apply to country people in getting medical or specialist treatment. Taxation concessions do not apply to the cost of transport to and from treatment, even though in many cases transport costs far outweigh the cost of treatment. In the pubUcation 'This Land-Labor' s Rural Program', Senator Wriedt says: One in 4 families in country towns live in poverty poverty conditions. There are more Australia's small country towns Melbourne combined. This means that the incidence erty in country towns is almost twice the level in those Our country poor must receive a better deal. This is another Labor undertaking on which no real action has been initiated. In fact the position worse because current economic conditions in rural areas do not even assure continuity of ployment in country towns or on farms. If the Government is serious in its attack on poverty, wiU not solve the overall problem transferring poverty from the urban areas to the rural areas. Lastly, I wish to touch on the wool mdustry. welcome the Government's decision to put a floor in the market and the granting of additional finance and powers to the Australian Wool Cormakes poration. I dispute the level ofthefloorprice feel that a level of 300c per kUo, more truly fit the current cost structures of the wool industry and would take account of the views of overseas wool users who have stated that they could Uve with that price. But whatever seated? criticisms I make ofthefloorprice level, they do not detract from my appreciation of both the Government's decision and the readiness of the sense. wool industry to make a substantial contribution to its own stabUity and future. WhUst I acknowlwould edge the assistance given to the wool industry a previous Liberal-Country Party Government bleat during the period of stress several years ago, have often outside this House, criticised that Government for its faUure to take decisive action on wool marketing. In my view it was a forlorn hope to expect a flexible reserve price with severe Umitations of the powers of the Corporation to make a significant contribution to the problem of wool marketing. This Government's decision is to have effect for one year only. It still has to consider wool marketing in the long term and determine its reactions to the Corporation's marketing recommendations. These recommendations provide a sound base for future action. I hope that the Government realises that its current short term decision does not absolve it from the responsibUity of making a long term decision. Such a decision must recognise the need to integrate marketing, promotion and research; to reduce costs inherent in current wool selling and handling procedures; to better equate supply with demand; to better service the needs of wool users; and to provide a sound, stable return to wool growers. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the House for giving me a fair hearing. I support the or near amendment moved by the Leader of the Oppopoor families in sition (Mr Snedden). than there are in Sydney and of pov Mr WHAN (Eden-Monaro) (9.29)-I address cities. myself tonight to the Budget. It is a Budget which reflects in every sense of the word the concern this Government has for the people it serves. The Budget is aU the more significant because the is way in which it is attacked is by innuendo and by myth. The arguments are not hard. The facts are emnot there. One can see these fear creating myths circulating around the countryside and being it encouraged by the honourable members on the by merely Opposition benches. We can divide these into a number of areas. The favourite area, of course, and the one that I has been worked on ad nauseam in this place is the rural area. In spite of what the previous speaker said, the fact remains that this Budget grants of a record nature to agricultural and industries. This Budget provides $487.6m for clean, would agricultural industries.",101

They estabUshed the basis of fear which is eroding the confidence of the people. There is no question where that basis comes from. The hard scheme, facts are that in this area",104
218,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable prices overseas. member has accused other people of causing a great deal of fear in relation to rural industries when he knows that he was the initiator",105
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,Order! There is no point of order involved in that interjection.,105
220,Mr WHAN,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall deal with that particular aspect in a moment. The facts are that this Budget contains $487.6m for agricultural industries compared with $329.5m in the last Budget brought down by the previous Government. It provides $309.2m net assistance after levies and taxes from agriculture are never deducted, compared with $283.9m provided by the last Budget of the previous Government. This $309.2m includes those loans and other grants which are loanable to agricultural industry to tide it over a particular crisis. The figure compared with the figure in the Budget of the previous Government, which included an amount for loans to the agricultural industry rural reconstruction and other activities. Budget figures are comparable. There is only one conclusion: This Government has provided more for agricultural industries and enterprises any previous government in the history of Australia. Those facts are hard to swallow those who go around the countryside creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty about the Government. We heard the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) condemning the GovernpoUtical ment for not taking heed of the Green Paper, which he himself labelled as a document which would create political vandalism in the agriculThat tural community. Consider the changingtidesof the opmion of the honourable member for New England. During the last election campaign in May he said that it was a document that would wreak pohtical vandalism on the agricultural sector. As recently as last week he snouted praises and condemned the Government bemechanism cause we took no notice of it. Let us look at facts there. This Green Paper emphasised the difficulties the agricultural industries experidevelop enced because of variable incomes. In recent months this Government has taken 3 significant steps as direct answers to this problem of variprice able incomes and its effect on agriculture. First, we introduced the wheat stabilisation plan, the first price plan that had a provision in it cushions the agricultural community from the sudden shocks of changes in overseas prices. wheat stabilisation plan is indeed an historic document. Incidentally, it is thefirstplan which has a mathematical formula to cushion the wheat industry against the shock of changing wheat Mr King-Jus t a cushion; no stabilisation.",105
221,Mr WHAN,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"' A cushion', as we have heard from one of the Country Party myth makers, a cushion against the shocks and variations in incomes from agriculture. We acknowledge that the variations exist. The Green Paper made a feature of them. The second step we have taken to cushion agriculture against shock is the introduction of the reserve price plan for wool-a n action the previous Government would take when it was in office. It refused resolutely to put a fixed reserve price into the wool market. Now, they are trying to get cheap poltiical capital out of this matter by braying about 300c a kilo. The fact is that the Australian Wool may be Corporation recommended thefigureof 250c to the Government. This is the body that we look to for advice on this matter. We also heard the for honourable member for New England and the The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser) trying to score a pomt on the aspect that both I and the Minister for Northern Developthan ment and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) raised. That was the fact that 3 by members of the Australian Wool Corporation were prepared, at least in conversation, to use the Corporation as a tool against the Crovernment. I do not retract in any way from what I said at that stage. It has nothing to do with my opinion as to where thefloorprice should be. The principle of interference and using such corporations for political interference must be opposed by all responsible members of the Parliament. was the principle that was at issue. Of course, we are also developing the concept of long term contracts. These long term contracts will be invaluable in cushioning the shock of agricultural income for perishable products such its as meat. It is easy to be able to develop a for products such as wool, wheat and the sugar which are storable commodities. It is very difficult-in fact it is almost impossible-to the same sort of shock mechanism for commodities such as meat. The only way we can insulate ourselves against these variations in for perishable commodities is by developing long term trading arrangements with countries that are prepared to honour their position in that those arrangements when things get tough for the producer and, equally, they are contracts This which have to be honoured by countries such as Australia-the producing countries-whe n things get tough for the consumer. In other words, when prices are high, we will be dehvering meat to our contractual partners at lower prices than the international market would stand. Obviously, the time to have negotiated a contract for beef would have been last year. The fact that the members of the Australian Country Party were able to create an atmosphere of fear at that time probably took away from the beef industry and the meat industry a very good opportunity to negotiate such contracts. Who was it who spread the scandalous rumour that the Government was going to put export taxes on the sale of beef? It was none other than the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony). This was demonstrated time and time again by his quotations in the HouseMr King-You tried pretty hard to do it, though.",105
222,Mr WHAN,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Look , we have the admission. The honourable member for Wimmera said: 'You tried pretty hard to do it though'. He has acknowledged that it was his own leader who spread the scandalous rumour. There can be no question about that. Another area in which there has been myth making which has eroded the confidence of the people in the democratic processes-that , in fact is what has happened-is an area in which there has not actually been an attack on this Government. There have been scandalous attacks on democratic government as a principle. Honourable members opposite prefer to use the myth of fear rather than the facts in representing their case to the electorate. There is no real mystery as to why they do this. They have absolutely no policy, they have no facts and they have no hard arguments to present to the electorate. Let us look at this second area in which this Government is constantly under attack. That is in its relationship to the States. I will take one example, that of Mr Askin who brought down a State Budget condemning this Government because he said it never gave assistance to the States. The facts are that revenue for this Government increased by 32 per cent and our grants to the States have increased by 36 per cent. In the last year that the previous Government was in power, it paid $521.9m to the State of New South Wales in financial assistance grants. In this Budget the present Government paid $723.4m which was $200m more than the previous Government paid in its last Budget. The story is repeated time after time. I look at the position in regard to the tied grants paid to the States, we find that the grand total assistance being paid to the States in this is $6,033m compared with $3,614m in the Budget presented by the previous Government. When we look at the nature of these grants to the States, we realise exactly what this Government is all about. It has a social concience. Every member on this side of the Parliament is proud to acknowledge it. If this is what socialism means, we are proud to hold up the sociaUst banner. We have a social conscience which has been lacking in government for 23 years. The record is here for all to see. In the last Budget of the previous Government $259m was allocated for education. In this Budget $1,172 m has been allocated for education. Honourable members should consider some of the other items. The last Budget of the previous Government gave $771 m by way of grants for senior citizen centres. Perhaps some people might consider that this is a minor area. But this Government, in the Budget has aUocated $ 1,650m to senior citizens. This is the response of a Government with a social conscience. One could go right through the Budget and time aftertimefind examples of the response from this Government to the needs of the community. When we look a little more closely at the myths that are created by the Opposition to put insecurity in the minds of the electorate we find out what they mean. We are told by the Opposition and by various people in private enterprise that they are over taxed. But let us consider for a moment a document entitled 'The Level and Composition of Taxation in Australia '-Treasur y Taxation Paper No. 2 which was recently released. This document shows Australia's ranking with countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We find that out of 23 countries we rank 18th. Australians pay 26.1 per cent of their gross national product in taxation. This compares with 25.6 per cent in Denmark. Countries mcluding the United States of America, France, Switzerland, Japan and the United Kingdom are above us on the Ust. We are about three-quarters of the way down the list in terms of our contributions to taxation, including social security contributions, as a proportion of gross national product. More importantly we find that up to 1971 5.5 per cent of the gross national product was paid out by Australian governments in cash benefits to pensioners, including invaUd pensioners, and f we to the physically weaker people in the community. This was the lowest percentage paid out of to pensioners of all the countries compared in the Budget document. The United States, the United last Kingdom, Sweden, France and Canada are countries which paid more in terms of welfare payments than Australia. Australia was once again at the bottom of the list in thefieldof cation. In this instance 3.8 per cent of our gross sition. nauonai product was spent on educauon. This was the lowest percentage of the countries that were compared by the OECD. The United States spent 6.8 per cent of its gross nadonal product education. As I have pointed out, under those people in the Opposition who have no social conexactly science whatsoever 3.8 per cent-the lowest the lot-wa s spent on education. We have a Budget that we are proud to stand behind because for thefirsttime in 23 years it response to the national need. It is a Budget reflects a government with a social conscience. Notwithstanding all of the compassion and the reflection contained in the Budget, it is still Budget which is well down in world terms regard to taxadon. The document to which have just referred shows that this country has relatively low level of taxation. Yet the Oppoof sition is prepared to stir up fear by its myththe creating activities around the countryside peoples minds away from the real need of elderly, the sick and the children in the cominfluenced munity. Mr Hewson-What rubbish.",106
223,Mr WHAN,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"'What rubbish', they say. that Members of the Opposition are about the elderly and the children. They beheve that this Budget is rubbish-this Budget that cerns itself with these needs. Honourable Caucus members opposite want a restoration of the sort of philosophy that they represented so well in 23 years in government of directing people's tion to the extra dollar that they could get and creating an atmosphere of greed and avarice among the community. They stand up here and condemn the trade union movement but forget that in the life of this Government it was the doctors who led the race in avarice and greed, closely followed by the sections that are strongly represented on the Opposition benches. But they zero in on the weaker elements of the community and the people who earn average weekly earnpeople-al ings or something less. Always the Opposition is prepared to go into batde for the doctors and the groups which enjoy a high standard of Uving and always it uses as its fall guy the weaker ement in the community. If it is short of argustantly ments and cannot directly approach the subject of paying more money to pensioners and the unthem employed the Opposition dismisses them, as the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) did last night, with an unparUamentary word. One could develop a whole area of myth-making regard to the States. One could contrast the compassionate social conscience of this Government eduwith the avarice-creating myths of the OppoLet me turn to another important area of myth-making, and that is the use of the word on 'Caucus'. We hear the Opposition gently condemning the Caucus and it is useful to realise what it is that the Opposition is gently of condemning. It is condemning the principle of democracy. It is condemning the principle that government should come from the elected members of the government party. Let us face it; is anobody else belongs to Caucus. Every member that of the Labor Caucus has been elected to this House or to the Senate. They are the people who have been given a mandate to govern. We hear a this system gendy criticised. We hear the great in myth of Caucus being a threat to government I engendered and developed by the Opposition. a Of course, the Opposition is not used to the type government that allows the participation of back bencher. It has always had a dictatorial taking method of government. It has always had the government by a Cabinet which is strongly by the bureaucracy in the Public Service. It is relatively easy for the bureaucracy to govern when the elected members of Parliament have no say in the Government, and it is true that is the model which the Opposition set when not concerned it was in Government. conIt is important when we hear this attack on that the electorate reaUses that the real attack is against the principle that the people they, as electors, put into this Parliament should attenhave some say in what the Government does. This is the very essence of the Caucus procedures adopted by this Government. We have nothing to be ashamed of in providing government by those people who were elected to govern.",107
224,Mr GRAHAM,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,That is nonsense.,107
225,Mr WHAN,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"It is nonsense, we hear. The Opposition perpetuates this myth even now. It says it is nonsense to have government by the l the people-wh o are elected to govern and that it is sensible to have government for only by that smaU group of people put into Cabinet which is so strongly influenced by the PubUc elService. Again we find that the Opposition conreturns to the hackneyed words and the hackneyed phrases. There is no need to explain and ifit was asked to explain them it could not. I speak of words like 'socialism' and 'communism'. There is the innuendo rather than the argument, the innuendo that characterises the in Opposition's entire approach to government. There is no need to argue if one can create a fear and associate it with a word. There is no need to put your case. There is no need to think. There is no need to address yourself to the real needs of the community if you can constantly create fear by an inane repetition of the words 'socialism' and 'communism' and any other words which can generate this atmosphere of fright. This Budget is a response from the government with a social conscience to needs which have grown and festered during 23 years of neglect by the Opposition when it was in government-2 3 years in which the fear tactic was refined and prefected. Today the electorate reaps the whirlwind of these fears as the Opposition presses its repetitive words to create an image in the minds of the electorate. This is a Budget which will establish this Government firmly and forever in office.",107
226,Mr KATTER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I shall make just one or two comments about the speech made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan). I am rather fascinated by ments though they are the ordinary sort of comments we hear regarding Caucus and the cratic structure of this body. I do not know whether they are completely in accord with a statement made to, I understand, the 'Courierthere Mail' by the Acting Prime Minister, Dr. J. Cairns, in which, talking about the super tax unearned income, he expressed grave concern that Caucus could override the decision of Cabinet. So much for Caucus or cactus or whatConnor. ever it is. Another very brief comment I would like to make is that the honourable member for too. Eden-Monaro obviously adheres to the rather fascinating theory of the Australian Labor Party that the measure of its success is how much money it spends. I suppose he would say that trips overseas, including the grand tour on which the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) is now his embarked, are tremendous successes. However, one grand tour is apparently not going to come off. I have in front of me a Press statement which has been issued by the Acting Prime Minister and which says: The Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Overseas Trade . . . said tonight that his propsed visit People's Republic of China had unfortunately to poned. He said a misunderstanding had apparendy arisen. He stated that he had been informed that the Royal tralian Air Force personnel manning the BAC-111 service aircraft could not wear uniforms whilst on a visit That in itself is a very remarkable statement insofar as they tell us what we can wear and what we cannot wear. The Press statement continues: Dr Cairns said that he felt this misunderstanding should be cleared up and had informed the Embassy of the People's Republic of China accordingly. Dr Caims said he felt it was very likely that the problem which had arisen could soon be cleared up. That is pure and utter, unadulterated, 5-star hogwash because when a Murray grey bull was sent to China it was taken there by the Royal Australian Ah Force and the members of the Air Force who took it did not have to strip off and get into a pair of BVDs or anything when they arrived in China. Nixon went to China in 'Air Force One' with the United States Air Force and its members wore uniforms over there. There is a rather nasty rumour around the House that there was absolute uproar in Cabinet tonight. The nation has another crisis on its hands-at least there could be another one by now, I have not checked the newspapers during the last hour. Mr Enderby- I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for the honourable member for Kennedy to mislead the people and the House? I am a member of the Cabinet.

It is a rather nasty one, A non-Budget has been presented to this nation. It is a Budget which is utterly devoid of any effective measures to control inflation and a the Budget which reveals a contempt for the wage earner in 2 categories that affect him the mostsecurity of employment and his capacity to borrow for his house, car and the educauon ofhis chUdren at a reasonable rate of interest. It reveals clearly and finally the destructive and humiliating poUcies of the power drunk people who sit opposite. They are rapidly bringing the nation to its knees and building up a pollution of poverty to the and despair throughout the land. I say that the be postpoUcies are destructive because the Government has started on a process aimed at finally destroying the two most important and most critical Ausincentives on which the survival, the growth and the pride of any nation depend, that is, the incento China. tive to produce and the incentive to work. The dropout, the parasite, the loafer has found his seventh heaven. He is provided for. He is the VIP in the context of this appalling Budget. Do not let me mislead the House. I have a deep compassion, as my whole life style can testify, for the unfortunate who, through illness or sheer bad luck, is out of work and is in need. Our social welfare provisions should ensure that he never will be threatened with poverty or insecurity. But the sheer irresponsibility of the present Government is such that if an out and out loafer, his wife and three late-teenage loafer dren care to lead the idle life they can between them get a handout of over $5,000 each year. It is litde wonder that the miner who sweats underground, the fetder who swings a pick in a searing heat of 40 degrees and the self-educated student who burns the midnight oil to make his mark and add to the achievement of our people, have found out now that this Government, obsessed to a degree almost of insanity in forcing its fascisttype State controls on them, is now their enemy? It is little wonder that a community deeply dedicated to true Labor principles sought revenge on this so-called Labor Party. The community offine,outback people in Broken Hill threw out every Labor member on their local council. A gallup poll showed recently a huge swing against these Australian Labor Party wreckers. I mean that they are wrecking the ALP as it was once constituted. It is revealed that if election was held now we would come back with a majority of 37 seats. That was last week. What will it be after tonight's occurrence? Mr King-What happened in Canberra on violence Saturday?",108
229,Mr KATTER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Jus t be patient. The people of the city of Canberra-particularl y our public sermore vants-prove d last weekend that they have now Minister for realised that they were used as the pensioners, the Minister for the Aborigines and the school teachers were used. They have been subjected to a pre-election flirtation that was based on a serious miscalculafallacy, tion-that the average Australian can be brainThis is humbug washed, can be bought. Once again there was a figures for ruraland huge drop in support for the so-caUed Labor Party. To my mind one of the saddest spectacles we see today is the cruel manner in which the include people occupying the treasury bench use and descheme, ceive Labor supporters into beUeving that they in are giving their aUegiance to a workers' party. With a few exceptions-worth y exceptions, must admit-thos e sitting opposite have sold out every decent, genuine Labor principle. The great objective of the Labor movement was social justice based on the freedom of the individual. whole phUosophy of the Prime Minister and his storm troopers is to wipe out the freedom of the individual and to bring every phase of his Ufe under control. Power unUmited was given to Dr Coombs and his task force to frame recommendations. Thefinisheddocument was a classic. It was a blueprint for national decUne and disintegration. It was a poltiical document framed to deceive people into beUeving that there were 2 groups of Australians in conflict-thos e who lived in metropolitan areas and the rest. To my mind, the acceptance of this attitude by the chil- Prime Minister and his vassals was the most treacherous blow ever inflicted on this nation. It was designed with utter dishonesty to convince city people that out yonder were people who had been spoon-fed and subsidised at their expense. It openly abandoned rural communities and, to a lesser extent, those living in provincial cities. This alone indelibly brands this Government as treacherous. In direct contrast we recognise the interdependence of our city and country people. We are proud of our great cities and the industrious people Uving in them. In return we ask that we who produce 77.7 per cent of Australia's overseas earnings be recognised as being what we are-Australian s who do the yakka work and extract wealth from the soU, in most cases far away from the comfort and advantage of city life. Our an people are angry with the uncontrolled prejudice that this Government with arrogance and obvious satisfaction levels against them. There is a stirring throughout the land, a reaction to this treatment. There are groups organising not for or anything even approaching it, but for concerted and decisive action which will hurl this Government out of office. Firstly, let us examine closely what this Budget does not do and, secondly, some of the deceits it contains. The Transport (Mr Charles Jones) and Northern Development (Dr Patterson) wiU try to argue, on a basis of absolute that more money than previously is avaUable for rural roads through this Budget. they know it. They quote road development, conveniently faUing to point out that the amount quoted allocations for the national roads which, by the way, had been evolved and accepted in principle by our coaUtion when government. It is obvious to anyone even remotely interested in the development of roads I in the country that the effective development of important rural roads has been set back to a staggering degree by the advent of this Government. The The Government constantly brags about what it has done for pensioners. The purchasing power of the pensioner's current pay cheque is far less than it was during our term in office. I would point out that these people who crow about their benevolent hand-outs find it convenient to ignore the special problems of pensioners living in remote areas, pensioners who have to meet both thefinancialand emotional strains of living in such areas. For example, if a pensioner in a country area is ill and has to seek specialist ment he has to meet many expenses. He may get free travel but that is only a part There is still the problem of accommodation, the problem of making provision for someone to the look after his home while he is away, the emotional experience of an aged person having to move to some other area to seek medical attention. Tbis is the emotional strain. The financial strain is very, very evident indeed, because pensioners live in areas where, because of freight and other charges, the cost of hving is infinitely higher than it is in more favoured coastal areas.the They get not one cent to compensate for these charges. There are western aUowances, there are northern parities, there are all sorts of industrial awards to compensate everyone but the penrules sioner, and the Government crows about how concerned it is. Another infliction which is coming up- I do not know whether it has yet reached its cUmax - is what is nothing less than an imperial edict that has gone out to almost every local authority in Australia that local authorities wiU have to their own airports from here on in. Ifl could giveofficers just one example: In my own State Queensland there will remain only two airports which will be controUed by the Department of Transport-Brisban e and TownsviUe. I am inforperience med that TownsviUe has remained under the re-industries. sponsibUity of the Commonwealth Government only because it is a defence base. You should seeexisting the defence that is there. If a Mosquitoflewover they could not shoot it down. I would Uke to touch briefly on the unsympa-standstill. thetic treatment of this Government vision of television services. I think in all the blame should be put on the Australian Broadcasting Control Board rather than on the various Ministers. We have been waiting year after year for TV instaUations. The honourable member for the Northern Tenitory (Mr Calder), the member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) and I sick and tired of lodging requests for an amenityphoney which the people on the coast have had for 1S or 16 years. The Government says it is a matter finance. Was it a matter offinancewhen the Government decided to buy WUlem de Koontician ing's 'Woman V for $646,000? Is it a matter finance that it is now organising the purchase of a 17S0 rococo ceUing by Giambattista $ 1.35m? How in all sincerity can this Government claim to be responsible when young people are not able to buy a home because of crippling interest rates, when it pays this son of money, at least in one case for a second-rate painting that I treat-believe was origmaUy purchased for $3,500? What an anogant contempt for the tens of thouof the deal. sands of unemployed! I am in an electorate which I suppose is one of most significant niining areas in the nation. I would Uke to say that staunch Labor supporters are concerned at the damage being done to the nation by the minerals and energy pohcy of the Mmister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Connor. The Australian people have not been told the truth. They were led up the garden path completely by the FitzGerald report. They know that Minister has been aUowed a free rem without any real sobering restraint at all since he was appointed to that position in that tragic month of destiny, December 1972. His disregard for the seems to extend to Labor's declared platform. Among other things, the Minister has done nothing towards establishing the promised fuel and energy commission. He tried to have legislation passed to estabUsh this commission but the Opposition found that it was fuU of traps. Having no love for advice from people who rununderstand, the Mmister stUl has not spoken with of the Bureau of Mineral Resources from of his permanent Secretary down. He has appointed 30 or more advisers and assistant secretaries with Uttle or no quaUfications or exrelevant to the mineral or petroleum It is Uttle wonder that this industry has come almost to a standstill. Had there not been contracts and had there not been existing operations, this huge industry which is of such tremendousfinancialand economic importance to this nation would have been brought to a able I know that my colleague, the honourmember for the Northern Tenitory (Mr in the proCalder) will have fairness particular area. much to say regarding that I would just Uke to comment very briefly on the result of the election for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. It will clearly indicate that the Territorians, Uke their colleagues in the areAustralian Capital Territory, will reject this Labor Government. Prices under a halfbaked price control system are such that the avoferage pubUc servant in the Territory has to be a super-manager. His wife has to be a mathemaof untold abUity to balance a budget in of that part of the world. Again, the Government shows its contempt for people who Uve in these Tiepolo forremote areas. I would like to say also that the present Government made a very grand gesture to win the support of local authorities throughout this country. It gave them handouts but I do not think one single local authority has been duped by the Government's attempt to buy their support. They, of all people, are federalists and they realise that these people who would establish full control in Canberra would soon whittle away any authority for making decisions that they may have. We have certain members of the Labor Party both in Cabinet and on the back benches who purport to represent rural areas. There are exceptions. I would say there are two in this House to whom my remarks do not refer. Mr Enderby-Nam e them.",109
230,Mr KATTER,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"I will name them. They are the honourable member for Darling (Mr Fitzpatrick) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti). The Government's proposed policy is to use jack boot tactics in regard to the many measures the Government is inflicting on country people. I will mention one or two of these: There is the phasing out of any serious concern for water conservation; the withdrawal of the subsidy on petrol-wha t a dreadful infliction that was; and the termination of the freight subsidies in the Northern Territory. If members of the Labor Party and Ministers do not show evidence that they are opposed to the above measures and are genuinely working to counter them and other anti-rural measures many of which are still contained in the Coombs' recommendation-that diabohcal documentthey have abandoned their electorates, they have betrayed the people they supposedly represent and they should get out because, whether they like it or not, they will go out come the next election.",111
231,Mr ENDERBY,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES," Mr Speaker, one listened with amusement to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). One cannot help but compare the type of speech he elected to give with the type of speech given by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan). They represent different parties. Mr O'Keefe-And different areas too.",111
232,Mr ENDERBY,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"And different areas. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) represents the Austrahan Country Party and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro represents the Australian Labor Party. While they are still fresh in our minds, it is interesting to reflect on the things about which the 2 honourable members chose to speak in this Budget debate. The Labor member chose to speak about social consciousness, social issues and the democracy that exists fundamentally in the Labor Party. He also mentioned the Caucus. I tried to jot down the key words of the harangue by the honourable member for Kennedy. I suggest to honourable members and to listeners that it was little more than a harangue. He made a general criticism of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) being in New York to represent this country at the United Nations and being in Washington, the capital of the United States of America. He also tried to make capital out of the fact that the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns) was taking the point of view that the Chinese people might be wrong in saying that Royal Australian Air Force officers should not wear their uniforms when they visit China. What is wrong with that? That is asserting the Australian point of view. Yet the honourable member for Kennedy tries to twist it. We are trying to insist on therightof Australian servicemen to wear their uniform. The honourable member for Kennedy used deceit. He took the fact that an Austrahan Minister asserts the right of Austrahan officers to wear their uniforms when abroad and he turned it against the Minister. If that is not deceit, I leave it to honourable members to make up their own minds about it. The honourable member for Kennedy used such words as 'hogwash'. He said that many meetings of Cabinet took place today. They did not. I am a member of the Cabinet. I tell this House and the people of Australia that there were no meetings of Cabinet today. There were not even the suggestions of any meetings of Cabinet today. Utterances go forth telUng the people of Australia that things have happened when they have not happened. There is Uttle opportunity for people to put the recordright,but one can only try. The honourable member talked of arrogance, stormtroopers and vassals. It is interesting, because he was talking in the context of the Caucus. We know what the Caucus is in this Parliament. We know the fundamental structural difference between the parties in the Opposition-the Liberal and Country Partiesand the Labor Party. The Labor Party allows its fundamental decisions to be made by the Parliamentary Party, which is known as the Caucus; that is our name for it. It is true that it is widely misunderstood outside this place. It is true that some people listening to me talking now think that non-members of Parliament belong to Caucus. Members of the Opposition feed on the misunderstanding and to profit from it They put forward the word 'Caucus' because they rely on the fact that people do not understand it. The Opposition its own caucus, but it chooses not to call it by name. I say to the listeners that Caucus consists only of the people they send to the Parliament. includes no outsiders, and members of the Oppoists sition know it and I know it. Mr Katter-What about Bob Hawke and to others?",111
233,Mr ENDERBY,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"They are not members of the Caucus, and the honourable member knows it. cause Yet he relies on this nusunderstanding and petuates it He spreads fear and panic. spreads deceit, confusion and uncertainty. That is all he has to offer the people of Australia. Many of the situations that this country faces now can be traced direcdy to the influence of Opposition on affairs. Opposition members-Rubbish .",112
234,Mr ENDERBY,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"Let us examine the facts. Let us examine what honourable members opposite have done in Opposition. Let us go back to election of December 1972 when the people Australia believed that they were electing a government for 3 years. They did not know the workings of the Senate, which the Opposition controlled. They did not know the Opposition's frustration or the depth ofit. They did not know the depth of its pent-up feelings or the arrogance which would not allow honourable members opthey posite to acceptremainingin 3 years but which forced them, out of chagrin and pique, to refuse Supply, to turn off the tap the fundamental source of money that all governments need to pay their pubhc servants. They did not know that and the Opposition ties knew that they did not know it. The OppoKelly). sition relies on that ignorance because it basically rests its case on ignorance. The Opposition opposed our measures for increased allocation of funds for education. says that the Government, because it is doing right thing, has become unpopular. Then it says:turned 'Now is our chance'. The Opposition took chance in May because it could in Opposition for 3 years. It is talking about it . again. If it had its way, because it has the the numbers in the Senate, its arrogance and tactics through of that sort would result in this country having togram go through an election every set of plans, no set of proposals, no set of reforms and no management could ever be implemented because no government would ever be able to plan more than two or three months ahead. try The Opposition Parties will not tolerate the verdict of the people of Australia. That fact comes through in everything they have done in has this place and everything they have done when that its members go out to the people. What nonsense honourable members opposite talk. One speaker It on the Opposition side calls us a bunch of socialand the next says we are fascists. According to my understanding of the terms they are diametrically opposed. The crux of what I want say by way of criticism of what the honourable member for Kennedy said can be summed up in the word 'Caucus'. Let us grasp the nettle beit is important that the people of Australia perunderstand what the word 'Caucus' means. The He honourable member for Kennedy said that Caucus can overrule Cabinet. Of course it can and it is quiterightthat it should be able to do so. the Mr Katter-You are supposed to be our Ministers. You are supposed to be the government of the countiy.",112
235,Mr ENDERBY,CONSUMER PRICES IN OECD COUNTRIES,"It is well known, although not widely enough known, that under a Labor Government Cabinet is the executive of the the members of the Parliament who are members of of the Labor Party. Members of the Party choose their Cabinet as their executive. But the members of the Parhament are the ultimate basic decision makers, not like in the Liberal Party where there is a fuehrer principle. Members of the Liberal Party elect a leader and say it is all a matter for him. Then they generally shut up except when throw abuse at us because of our democratic Opposition for even tendencies. of I came into the House not intending to speak. I brought with me a book by a very great author, John Maynard Keynes, who would be known to Parthe honourable member for Wakefield (Mr He wrote on the subject 'Am I a Liberal?'. I speak to the honourable member for Wakefield when I say this because he claims to be a Liberal, I am sure. John Maynard Keynes wrote this in 1925 on why he then thought he It should be a Liberal and not a member of the Brithe tish Labour Party. What did he say about why he away from Labour? I appreciate that this its argument can be used against me but it is not stand being interesting. He said: . . there are differences between the several parties in degree to which the party machine is democratised and through and the preparation of the party prodemocratised in its details. In this respect the Con6 months or so. No servative PartyHe was talking about the British Conservative Party but this could be applied to the Liberal Party of Australia because we all know that it is a conservative party. is in much the best position. The inner ring of the Substitute the Liberal Party of Australiacan almost dictate the details and technique of policy. Substitute fuehrer principle. He continued: Traditionally the management of the Liberal PartyKeynes was a Liberal himselfwas also sufficiently autocratic. He spoke of that with approval. He went on to say that what he found lacking in the Labour Party was that it was in a far weaker position because it was democratic. Democracy may well have its problems but let no one make any mistake about where the Labor Party stands on its structural make-up. It is the most fundamentally democratic. I see the honourable member for Wakefield nodding in approval and I thank him because he is an honest man even though he does not belong to our Party. Democracy does pose problems but the fundamental point to make at this stage is not whether democracy is good or bad. Most people would argue that it is good. Everyone knows that the Labor Party is democratic and that it is the most democratic party because it has the Caucus system. The iniquitous and deceitful situation that must be continually exposed is that the Liberal and Country Party Opposition conservative pohticians rely on the misunderstanding of people as to what the word 'Caucus' means. They say: 'The Labor Party is run by a bunch of outsiders. It is not democratic. There is something called a Caucus that runs it.' The honourable member for Wakefield knows what the Caucus is. The honourable member for Kennedy knows what the Caucus is. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) knows what the Caucus is. But I have been in this Parliament for 4 years and I have never heard honourable members opposite speak of it in a sense that did not rest firmly and squarely on a basis of deceit they try to confuse people. The question of freedom of the indivdual mentioned. Let us talk about that. When did conservative parties of this country ever try restore free competition, as the Labor Party tried to restore it through its restrictive trade practices legislation? When did the conservative parties of this country-the Liberal and Country Parties-eve r try to give encouragement to small businesses by setting up something like the business bureau as the Labour Party has done? When did the conservative parties of this counsites. try-the Liberal and Country parties-eve r talk about passing legislation that would enshrine the principles of a bill of rights, of personal and human rights, in the Australian system of law? party- They never did it. They reject the concept. The Government does not reject it; it embraces the concept. The legislation is at present before the Senate. But who in the Senate will oppose this attempt by us to enshrine basic principles of human dignity, anti-racist principles and principles of human freedom? Who will oppose it? On arguments based upon deceit the conservative parties of Australia-the Liberal and Country Parties-wil l oppose it. So much for the argument of who supports human individual freedom. The honourable member for Kennedy mentioned storm troopers. Whom did he choose to give as an example of storm troopers? None other than Nugget' Coombs-D r Coombs, the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, ex-Governor of the Reserve Bank. What is the objection to Dr Coombs, to the well known and lovable 'Nugget'? What is the objection? Is it that he was asked to lead a team of inquiry to advise the Labor Party when it came to office 18 months or so ago about what was wrong with the spending patterns in terms of social justice and equity and about what was wrong with them as they had been laid down by the previous Government-the conservative government-so that we could put the priorities right and so that we could do what I heard and what we all heard the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Whan) say with pride in his voice that we have done? We have redressed or begun to redress the imbalance. We have begun to put education on to the plane, the plateau, the level on which it deserves to be. The increase in expenditure on education in this countiy since we came to office has been nearly 400 per cent, or nearly 5 times what the previous Government chose to spend on it, if one allows for, say, a diminution in the value of the doUar by 20 per cent in that same time of 18 months or 20 months-the y are was unrelated, because we know what caused inflathe tion and the honourable member for Wakefield to knows what caused the situation we inherited. has The percentage movement of resources towards what we caU the needy and the provision of facUities for opportunity, to provide equality of opportunity so that people can benefit from the good things of this life, can be seen.

251,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"I should like to raise 2 matters of some importance. The first concerns the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, the Chairman of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and his visit to Perth earher this week. This was a well publicised visit Mr Hawke made a very intemperate-on e could almost say an inflammatory-speec h to the crowds assembled in Perth in Western Austraha. This speech was the subject of a great deal of licity. However, what I should like to know- I should like a member of the Government to tell me if it is possible-is how did Mr Hawke get back to Sydney. I am told by reUable sources that Mr Hawke chatered a plane from Swan Brewery Co. Ltd. I am quite sure that the Swan Brewery did not pay for the plane, but he chartered this plane from the Swan Brewery at a cost of $1,800.I am not at aU sure whether the return flight to Western Australia was filled. If it wasfiUedthe additional $1,800 would have been paid by somebody else, but if the charter planeflewfrom Perth to Sydney and back again and Mr Hawke was responsible for the payment for that trip it would result in a total houses. cost of $3,600. Who paid that amount? Mr Whan-What business is it of yours?",115
252,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"I should Uke to know. What are you concealing? The Trades and Labour Council in Western Australia has denied payment of that amount. AU I am asking is for somebody to said: teU me who paid this $3,600.I ask a simple quesThere tion and it seems to ehcit some response from porters of the Government. If they wiU be grateful, and the Australian people will be grateful to know. The principal evening concerns the reply of the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) to a question asked of him by Mr Dawkins last week. That question concerned the matter of migrant nominations by development companies in Westone ern Australia. In the Minister's reply were inflammatory statements- I believe some unfair statements. In the course ofhis answer tember the Minister mentioned that a conference of Ministers for Immigration in November 1973 agreed on South Australian rules respecting nomination of migrants. He said it was agreed that they should be introduced throughout the States. He gave the clear impression that this had been agreed to and was put into practice by the States, including Western Australia. Mr Speaker, I have some information here which suggests that this agreement which the Minister spoke about was not put into operation Western Australia before the change of government which occurred there earUer this year. However, that is one point I do not want to dwell on; I want to dweU on the statements that the Minister made respecting a particular pubUc company. I make it clear before speaking about this company that I have no association with the Landall Construction and Development Co Pty Ltd. I do not know personaUy any of the people connected with pub- LandaU's and I have never met Mr Clark. I have spoken with Mr Clark on the telephone and I have received some letters from hun. I think it most important that we look into the statements made by the Minister in his reply to the question in this House so I quote from page 1640 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 24 September. The Mmister said: I had this mattei thoroughly investigated. He said this in response to some queries about the company. He also said: We found that there were serious allegauons about the company's handling offinancialarrangements for the sale of It was involved also in the sale to migrants of second hand cars which proved to be not worth the money that they were made to pay for them under terms which prompted serious complaints . . . That is a serious charge and, of course, it was made under privUege in this House and cannot be answered by the company. Perhaps I should say it may be answered by the company, but the Minister cannot be held to account for it. The Minister is little doubt that the Landall company was supengaged in some very questionable activities. can teU me IA little later he said: The Landall company is quite a questionable one in more matter I raise this ways than one. I am sure you, Mr Speaker, wiU agree that these are very serious allegations to make about a pubUc company. They could result in a serious effect on the business in which that company engages. If makes these aUegations I think they should be some backed up by some evidence. No evidence was produced by the Minister for Labor and Immigraon 24 Seption to back up these statements. I believe that this is a shameful abuse of the high the responsibuities which a Minister of the Crown must bear. The Minister, within the confines of this House and with the privUege of this House, pubUcly abused a company in such a way that people outside this Parliament are led to believe that this company is not a bona fide company and has not been operating as one would expect a pubUc company to operate. I do not think that is very fair at all, and the Mmister has a very real case to answer. Let me refer to 2 aspects of the matter. The first in concerns the bonafidesof the Western Australian Minister for Immigration, Mr Grayden. On 26 September 1974, in answer to a quesuon from me, the Minister for Labor and Immigration said: A meeting of Ministers had been which it was agreed that conditions would be attached sponsorship schemes in Western Australia in line South Australian conditions. Accordingly, two new rules were adopted-rule s 10 and 11. That answer gives the clear indication that those rules were adopted and were in force. I refer next to a telegram from the Minister for Immigration in Western Australia. It is dated 2 October 1974. The telegram states in part: Following instructions by the former Minister for Immigration a review of these conditions was undertakenI stress these words: . . .and a draft prepared for consideration. This draft was inadvertently distributed after the change of Government and without my approval before emphasised that this was a draft prepared for consideration only. In other words, quite contrary to the impUcations . contained in the Minister's answer to me in this House, these measures had not come into effect. Later, in his answer to my question, the Minister went on to say: . . . Mr Grayden wrote these wordsThe Minister then read some words He continued: I cannot read (4) properly, but it looks like-it is Grayden's handwriting. In response to that statement, Mr Grayden sent Minister for Labor and Immigration a telegram and he sent a copy of it to me also. In it he said the Minister. . . . the information you have given to the House Representatives is not factual. The telegram continues: . . . the letter that you have quoted was unlawfully removed from files in my Depanment and I request that make it available to the Western Australian police to aid them in their investigations into missing documents, from Western Australia depanmental files. equivocal statement that the marginal notes to which you refer are in my handwriting it is not so. Any handwriting must perforce be that of a depanmental officer. Request correct wrong impression which you have created. The Minister for Labor and Immigration has not done that. If the Minister were a man of honour he would forthwith correct the very wrong impression he has given. I now return to the question of the LandaU company. This matter raises some very real questions and some very real concern. Why, Mr Speaker, if an investigation was carried out at the direction of the Minister did the investigating officer not discuss the matter with LandaU? LandaU offered to co-operate fuUy with the immigration task force operating in Western Australia. I have a copy of a letter signed by the Chairman of that company in held on this matter at which he states: to the I would welcome the chance of meeting the Committee with the and personally explaining any detail . . . That letter is from the Chairman of Landall to the Chairman of the task force. The Chairman of Landall, Mr Clark, wrote also to the Minister for Labor and Immigration on 19 August. This is what Mr Clark said: As my company's name was mentioned in the anicle, following allegations made in the State Parliament by Mr M. Bryce, M.L.A. I am writing to seek your assurance that the oflicer concernedI add these words 'in the investigation': . . . will, as pan of his investigations, contact the Company to obtain its answers to Mr Bryce's allegations and to see at first hand how our sponsorship scheme is adminisa decision was made. It is tered. Later in this letter, Mr Clark says: . . the Company will do anything in its power to assist the Depanmental Officer in his investigation. I put this question to the House, Mr Speaker: Is this the action of a company which, in the words of the Minister for Labor and Immigration, was engaged in some very questionable activities or was a questionable company in more ways than to the House. one? It certainly is not. Why was the State department which was inin Mr volved in the original investigation not consulted by the investigating officer? How did the Minister the get access to a document which was allegedly stolen from the departmental files in Western to Australia? Why did not the Minister mention the additional protection given by rules 12 and 13 in of the new rules brought down by the new Minister for Immigration in Western Australia. This affair raises some very real questions. I believe that a pubUc company has been quite unfairly castigated you and brought into some disrepute in this House.",115
253,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleContrary to your unman'stimehas expired.,116
254,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, I you propose to raise tonight a subject which to the best of my knowledge has not been ventilated before in this Parliament. It is the question of the need for plant breeders rights. It is interesting to note that if you invent a machine for harvesting plants, that machine can be patented, but there is no legislation in Australia which aUows the patenting of the plant itself. Australia has been slow to take up the question of plant breeders rights, but the same cannot be said for other countries of the world. Plant breeders' protection is now law in many countries, particularly in the Common Market countries. This legislation is in existence in France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The legislation in these countries is very sinular and is based on the 1961 Paris Convention which forms the basis of the Union for Protection of Plant Varieties. South Africa and the United States of America have plant patent Acts and New Zealand has a Bill drawn up ready for presentation to the Parliament. Austria, Poland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and some other East European countries also have arrangements in operation for the protection of plant breeders. There are many reasons why plant breeders rights legislation is necessary, but I will quote a few. I believe legislation an adequate reward for the skills, effort and capital employed in plant breeding. It is also necessary to ensure the continuing viabUity of the agricultural and horticultural industries. In addition, the necessary encouragement must be given which not will aUow Australian breeding in aU agricultural and horticultural areas. The point which amazes me is that plant varieties breeders have not been recognised in Australia fore this when this recognition has already been granted in other countries. Surely thetimeis ripe for recognition of this section of the horticulthese tural and agricultural industry. If it is right for inventor to be recognised in is surely right to legislate for plant breeders' rights. Up to date, plant breeding in Australia has largely been carried out by government departvarieties ments, universities and instrumentaUties such the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and then only on a smaU scale. Consequently, Australia has had to rely very heavUy on imports from overseas for most of necessary strains for crop inmprovement. important areas-vegetable s and fruit-the United States of America has been the main source of such new strains. But many of these new varieties are no longer avaUable to Australia because of lack of the necessary protective legislation, possible. namely, legislation to protect the rights of plant breeders. New strains are vital for economic cropping, disease resistance, and so on. Australia is doing nothing tofiUthe vacuum caused by the lack of these new strains. On a conservative estimate, experts in this field maintain that even if the money were avaUable to engage in plant breeding activities, it would take at least 10 years tofiUthe vacuum. Industry must have access to new strains of plants and urgent legislation is necessary to remedy this situation. In the long term, encouragement must be given to Australian plant breeders to develop strains suitable to our own local conditions which vary from State to State and within each State. Members of this Parliament may not know that tomato plants grown in Australia are mainly from the United States of America, and these plants are not completely suitable for Australian conditions. Under Australian conditions the plants grow much larger and traU a great deal. The fruit ripens over a long period, and in wet conditions the yield is extremely low. At present there is a tomato sauce scarcity in Australia and at the present time it is necessary to import the ingredients for tomato only sauce. What a catastrophe for Australia's national is necessary so as to give dish. Australia is at least 15 years behind thetimesin its types and varieties of apples, pears, grapes, and so on being grown. The reason is that Australia has the access to overseas varieties and strains of plants and trees. One of the reasons why Australia has difficulty in disposing of our apple crop overseas is that we cannot compete with the newer which are grown in other countries. This beshould be of importance to honourable members from Tasmania. I see many of them present in the now House tonight. The reason why we cannot obtain overseas strains is that Australia has no rethe ciprocal legislation to guarantee the rights of secondary industry, it breeders. In regard to grapes, it is interesting to know that in overseas countries there are avaUable tropical which produce 2 crops a year. I notice as that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr SulUvan) is not present, but he has had his problems and I did not tell him I intended raising this subject. What an effect those varieties would have the on our own grape and wine industries. If the In 2 honourable member for Angas (Mr GUes) were here I am certain he would be interested in this subject also. I ask the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) to use his best endeavours to have plant the breeders'rightslegislation introduced as soon as To do this I think it is appropriate that an independent committee of inquiry should be set up to advise the Government on the most appropriate type of legislation for Australian conditions, the committee of mquiry to comprise government and industry personnel. I trust that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass), will consider the points raised by me tonight. Possibly an inter-departmental committee has the matter in hand. If it has, it has been in its hands for a long time as the previous government did nothing on this issue. I grant that it was in office for only 23 years. I hope the present GovernSavings ment will do something and do it soon.",116
255,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ADJOURNMENT,"The wealth building society movement has developed since the late 1950s and has surprised very many tralians. In the late 1950s Dr Coombs wondered, appreciatively, at the growth in its strength and support for its activities during its early years. the years subsequent to that statement the societies have developed and have been trusted by the Australian people because they are strong and because requirements have been put on them with respect ties? to their own asset structures. It is common knowlQueensland, edge that in one State of Australia, Queensland, concern has developed among a number of people for a variety of reasons which has caused them attempt to take or to take their deposits out of the buUding societies. That is not necessary. But there is also a very grave obUgation on the part of Government to see that these societies are supare ported. It is a very grave obUgation because, ceraverage tainly in Queensland, which is the cerned, the buUding societies have fulfilled a role with respect to the requirements ofhousing finance made vacant by the withdrawal of the savings banks, especiaUy the Commonwealth Savings role Bank, in regard to their own requirements to port housing in Australia and in Queensland. This is essential background. It is to be argued that to the extent that they have fulfilled that especiaUy in the past year, there is upon the Reserve Bank and upon the Treasurer (Mr Crean) a very grave moral, and I believe on the Reserve Bank. Bank a statutory, obUgation to accord the societies direct support-no t statements, which are indirect support. Let me Ulustrate. During the past year Queensland the Commonwealth Savings Bank very which was set up with one of its principal aims being to assist small borrowers, especiaUy respect to housing, has not operated with its funds in the best interests of its own customers. In fact, pose over the year the Commonwealth Savings Bank other lent an average of only 26 per cent of its assets for housing purposes. During the same period it went into the bond market to an unprecedented extent in supporting Commonwealth Government bonds and effectively attempting to prop up the bond market; in fact, to indicate that there was a mand for bonds when the demand was slackening. The annual report of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation contains one very significant sentence on page 34, which reads: Existing monetary requirements are such that banks large amounts of Australian Government securities. Existing requirements dictated to the Commonfare wealth Banking Corporation, and especiaUy to Bank, through the Reserve Bank, that it should support the bond market to an extent which it had never previously done. The CommonSavings Bank was not set up to support the bond market. Other banks engage in monetary Ausmanagement, but the Commonwealth Savings Bank does not have that role. At the sametimeprithe vate savings banks increased their assets in housIn ing and in fact divested themselves of bonds. I give that information by way of background. In what way does this involve the buUding socieIt involves the buUding societies, especially in where there has been a very great demand for housing due to the high rate of growth and development. In the year ended 30 June and to mto July the buUding societies lent an average of 27 per cent of all the funds avaUable for housing in that State; that is from the trading banks, finance the corporations buUding societies and so on. Those the major lenders. The savings banks lent an of only 10 per cent of the funds avaUable State confor housing in that State. Since the Commonwealth Savings Bank, which is much closer to the Reserve Bank in responses to its dictates than are other banks, has a dominant in that State, just as it has a dominant role in supNew South Wales, the buUding societies quite clearly have fulfilled their purpose and have taken up a slack which has been imposed on the banks, role, certainly through the Reserve Bank and, I would say, certainly through the discussions which take place between the Treasurer and the Reserve Under these circumstances, therefore, when there have been reports of a run on the buUding in societies, even though they are strong and have a high ratio of Uquid assets, the Reserve Bank has a quite special obligation under section 8 of the with Reserve Bank Act. Section 8 reads: The Bank has such powers as are necessary for the purof this Act, and, in particular, and in addition to any powers conferred on it by this Act, has power(a) to receive money on deposit; (b) to borrow money; (c) to lend money . . . That proposition involves the Reserve Bank diderecdy with building societies under these circumstances. Section 10 of the Reserve Bank Act states that the Board has the duty within its powers to operate its own poUcies- I will not go through this in detaU-and to operate them in such a way that they contribute to 3 matters, the first of which is hold the stabUity of the currency of Australia and the third of which is the economic prosperity and welof the people of Australia. Those principles the ought to guide the Reserve Bank now in terms of its relations with the Queensland building societies. I believe that, with the unreasoning fear that develops, the Reserve Bank has a direct obUgation to give support in this area. There should not be indirect statements, such as we heard from the Acting Treasurer (Mr Hayden) last night when he talked about the trading banks lending a sympathetic ear with respect to support for building societies. It ought to be a direct obUgation. There also ought to be a direct statement from the Treasurer or the Acting Prime Minister of this country indicating those points. I believe that the Reserve Bank, were it not to inhibited by this Government, would give that rect support- I have no precise reason for that-in its own common-sense judgment of what is appropriate for the economy. It also ought in those circumstances to announce quite direcdy that it will be a lender of last resort with respect these institutions. After all, by doing so it will doing a sound and very great job for the people who have their savings in these bodies. It would certainly be against the best mterests of the people for the Reserve Bank to refrain from its obUgation and to do anything foolish. That means, basically, that it has a pre-eminent obUgation in these cumstances to restore confidence. I hope that wiU be done. I think it should be done. If common sense prevaUs it will be done, especiaUy as there a moral obUgation on the Bank to help those sources of funds which over the past year have stepped into take up the artificial slack developed as a result of the Commonwealth Banking Corporis ation's and Commonwealth Savings Bank's activiwhether ties during the past year.",118
256,Dr CASS,ADJOURNMENT, I rise simply to. make some brief comments on the points raised by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin) and to assure him that the matter has brought to my notice and that interest has been taken in the matter of plant growers' problems terms of patent rights and so on. This does not come within my responsibiUty but I assure honourable member that I shall draw the attention of the Minister for Sdence (Mr Morrison) to assure the honourable member that the Minister for Sdence will give him his views on the tions made.,119
257,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," unless Yesterday in the House I asked the Acting Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) what rate was charged meeting. by the Reserve Bank to the various member banks for faciUties of lender of last resort. The Acting Prime Minister was good enough to reply to me in these words: I am not specificaUy aware of the rate of interest that is charged but I will have that checked and inform the honourable member. This is recorded in Hansard. So far I have not received that information. On several occasions I have rung the Private Secretary of the Acting Prime Minister and I have asked whether the information could be provided. On each occasion he has said that it was being compUed and that it would be made avaUable to me. It does not take be very much to have this information compiled. It is dia simple case of compiling half a dozen ngures stating which are definite and well known. I can well imagine that the Acting Prime Minister has been a Uttle engaged in other things today and perhaps- I do not want to press the to matter too hard-h e may not have been in a posbe ition to check the answer and send it through to me. But I do say this: It is a very simple matter for him to fulfil the promise that he gave. I am very anxious to get thesefiguresas soon as possible. It is a matter of some considerable disappointment to me that I have not been able to get them before the cirHouse rises for this recess. They arefiguresof that tremendous importance to the Australian community at present. Tales are going around- I am is not in a position to say whether they are true or untrue-that the banking Uquidity crisis has been caused by the Reserve Bank's charging these quite exorbitant rates to the member banks and that this a fundamental error in poUcy. I do not know or not this is true because I have not the figures. Mr Riordan-Well , why say it?",119
258,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,I asked the Acting Prime Minister for the figures and I am trying to get been them. When I get them. I shall then know whether or not it is true. I ask the Acting Prime Minister in once again whether he will let me have these figures without delay. He has promised to do so. the The question is recorded in Hansard. They are figures which the whole of the community in it. I Australia would be very interested in seeing.,119

These courses are run at various levels and in a number of subject areas, and many included elements relevant to the honourable member's question. The Board's 1973 Annual Report also included a statistical item on Study Assistance which indicated that a substantial number of officers had either completed or were engaged in in external studies in accountancy and related fields. This sort of information appears regularly in the Board's depanments are engaged Annual Reports. In the Prime Minister'sreplyof 24 July 1974 to an identical question Le.

SheU Australian Domestic Airlines: One-class Fare Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: Does the Government intend to give approval to the abolition of two-class travel on Australian domestic airUnes. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: No request has been received lines for approval for only a one class fare. If an airline, in its own commercial judgement, wishes to submit such a proposition to me, you may be assured that it will be carefully considered.

263,Mr WHITLAM,CHARTER FLIGHTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1,2 and 3. Australian personnel are engaged as aid experts under the following programs: BUateral Schemes Colombo Plan Commonwealth Co-operation (CCE) in Education Special Commonwealth African (SCAAP) Assistance Plan South Pacific Aid Program Estimated Cost $ 11.3.73 Canberra/Grafton/Canberra 550.00 13.4.73 Canberra/Bourke/Sydney/ 330.00 Canberra 16,18 Melbourne/La Trobe VaUey/ 675.00 Colac/Hamilton/ Portland/Canberra 5.S.73 Bargara/Bundaberg 100.00 17.2.74 Rockhampton/Blackwater/Mackay 761.00 1,4 Tour of Northern Queensland 1,517.00 27.11.73 Canberra/Melbourne/Canberra 100.00 August Tour Queensland 660.00 1974 (Question No. 574) Australian-Asian Universities (AAUCS) Co-operation Scheme Multilateral Schemes International Rice Research (IRRI) Institute, Philippines from the major domestic airSouth East Asian Ministers for (SEAMEO) Education Organisation The numbers of Australian experts or advisers serving in various countries under these schemes as at 31 July 1974 are as follows: (Question No. 696) NUMBER OF AUSTRALIANS AT 31 JULY 1974 Country By Country By Scheme Bilateral Project Botswana 1 I CCE British Solomon Is 6 3 SPAP Protectorate 3 CCE Bangladesh 2 2 CP Fiji 13 7 SPAP 6 CCE (CP) GUbenandEIUcels 2 2 SPAP Colony India 10 10 CP (SPAP) Indonesia 61 60 CP 1 AAUCS Country By Country Kenya 1 1 Khmer Republic 2 2 Korea 5 5 Laos 8 8 Malaysia 16 16 Nepal 6 6 New Hebrides 1 1 Pakistan 2 2 Philippines 5 5 Singapore 1 1 South Viet-Nam 10 10 Thailand Tonga 2 2 Western Samoa Zambia Malaysia 3 3 SEAMEO Philippines 1 1 IRRI Singapore 1 I SEAMEO Coober Pedy: Airstrip Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: Have any arrangements been made between the Civil Aviation section of your Department and the Progress and Mining Association at Coober Pedy to raise the standard of the airstrip at Coober Pedy. If so, what are those arrangements. Mr Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There have been a series of discussions between my Department and the Coober Pedy Progress Association. The South Australian Lands Department has assisted in reserving land for the development of the local airstrip to aerodrome licensing standards. However, there remains the problem of a local Government authority or its equivalent accepting the responsibility of an aerodrome licensee, firstly to entitle Coober Pedy to 50 per cent Australian Government grants for the economic development and maintenance of their aerodrome, and secondly to report the current state of the aerodrome for air safety purposes. The Coober Pedy Progress Association has not yet decided whether it feels equal to that commitment as an aerodrome licensee.

CP CP Australian Public Service: Fellowship Scheme CP 52 52 CP (Question No. 738) SPAP Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon 2 1 SPAP notice: 1 CCE 4 4 CCE (1) Is it intended to establish a fellowship scheme in each Department to enable academics to work during study leave Multilateral Projects with the Department. (2) Which Departments have introduced the concept to date. (3) What steps have been taken to arrange a reciprocal scheme for public servants to undertake fellowships on paid study leave at academic institutions. (Question No. 707) Mr Whitlam - I am advised by the Public Service Board that the answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no intention to establish a fellowship scheme in each department. Where a department has a special requirement best met by a fellowship scheme, it will consider establishing a scheme. (2) In order to meet a special requirement, the Depanment of Urban and Regional Development has introduced a fellowship scheme for academics. (3) Opportunities for public servants to undertake research studies at Australian and overseas academic institutions are provided by fellowships at the Australian full National University and by postgraduate scholarships and financial assistance awards. Details of the kind of schemes referred to have been provided in the Public Service Board's 1971 Annual Report (pp. 82 and 83) and statistics of the numbers of persons benefiting appear in successive Annual Repons. The more recent statistics are at page 193 of the Board's 1974 Annual Repon. Australian Government: Departmental Vehicles (Question No. 740) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Will he provide a list indicating the number of 4Departments cylinder, 6-cyhnder and 8-cylinder vehicles owned by Government Depanments. (Question No. 737) (2) Does the Government intend to reduce the proportion of 6-cylinder and 8-cylinder vehicles purchased.",138
264,Mr WHITLAM,CHARTER FLIGHTS,"The answer to the right honourClerical able member's question is as follows: May 1974 that he would introduce (1) The number of vehicles owned by the Australian Government, for use by Depanments, as at the end of August was: 4-cylinder 2,576 . 6-cylinder 7,727 8-cylinder 302 These figures exclude vehicles purchased for the Defence Force and Government vehicles located at Australian posts and missions overseas. Details of the latter are not readily available. Vehicles used for special purposes have also been excluded. (2) The Department of Manufacturing Industry, which operates the main passenger fleets in the States for Australian Government purposes, has been reducing the proportion of 6 and 8-cylinder vehicles in the fleet over recent years. I am advised that this trend will continue. I am also informed that the intermediate 8-cylinder sedan used in the car pools is also being progressively replaced by a 6-cylinder sedan. In 1973-74 there was consequently a 30 per cent reduction in 8-cylinder vehicles. Legal Aid Offices: Volunteer Workers Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) How many volunteer workers have offered to work in conjunction with, or within, each of the legal aid offices presently in operation.

For example, in the Brunswick office that opened on 19 July 1974, some 36 people have volunteered to assist and fifteen of these have indicated that they would be available for varying periods to staff a night and Saturday moming service. The 36 volunteers comprise seventeen solicitors, one clergyman, three social workers, a welfare officer, an employment officer, three typist/secretaries, one law clerk, one law student, three members of the Citizens Advice Bureau, one interpreter, and four persons who have volunteered to give general assistance, including a member of the State Parliament.

265,Dr EVERINGHAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the right honourable members question is as follows: (a) The Governor General has appointed Miss Mary Patten, a Secretary of the Royal as a part-time Commissioner or the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. (b) I am currently considering the appointment of an eminent lay woman to the Nauonai Health and Medical Research Council. Department of Services and Property: Research and Development Staff Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Services and Property, upon notice: (1) How many officers or employees of his Department, or of authorities under his control, are employed on research and development work. (2) Where are they employed. (3) What is the nature of the work being undertaken. (4) What is the total expenditure per annum in maintaining this research and development program. (5) Who decides the nature of the programs or projects included in this research and development work. Mr Daly-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Five (S) officers of my Department are engaged in work that could be described as 'Research and Development' as this expression is normally used. A number of officers in my Department and the Australian Electoral Office who are engaged in positions designated as 'Research Officers' have not been included in this reply. (2) Australian Survey Office. (3) and (S) Research is undertaken into the use of photogram-metric plotters and computers for the adjustment of XYZ co-ordinates in the production of digital terrain models and also into the use of computers and plotting systems to produce a completed map or plan. This work is under the direction of an Assistant Surveyor-General. (4) The annual expenditure on salaries of the officers involved in this type of duties would amount to $60,000. Other expenditure on research and development work is minimal. Australian Government Departments: Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Which sections, branches, divisions and authorities which were part of the former Department of Supply have been transferred to the newly formed Depanment of Manufacturing Industry. (2) Which sections, branches, divisions, and authorities which were part of the former Department of Supply have been transferred since its abolition to the Department of Defence. (3) Is it intended that the Department of Manufacturing Industry, as presently composed, will continue in that form. (4) If not, which sections, branches, divisions and authorities are subject to considerauon with a view to being transferred to other departments. (S) Will he ensure that any further restructuring that may be under considerauon is announced as early as possible to remove uncertainties for officers and employees as to their future employment. Australian Nursing Federation,",142
266,Mr WHITLAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"I have received advice from the Public Service Board and the answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) All sections, branches, divisions and authorities which were part of the former Department of Supply have been formally transferred to the Department of Manufacturing Industry. (2) None. Formal transfers cannot be made before the (Question No. 868) relevant legislation has been amended. In the meantime, administrative and operational control of the Research and Development Division of the former Department of Supply has been transferred to the Department of Defence. (3) No. (4) The functions of the American Projects Branch and the Stores and Transport Branch of the former Department of Supply are under consideration for transfer to other Departments. The purchasing and disposals functions are to be transferred to the proposed Australian Government Purchasing Commission. (5) Yes; announcements on restructuring will be made as soon as it is practicable to do so. Foreign Fishermen (Question No. 987) Mr Malcolm Fraser asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Can he say whether or not foreign fishing vessels off the northern and western Australian coast often carry goats and animals which themselves could be carriers of foot and mouth disease. (2) Is there any evidence of any person from these vessels temporarily camping on the Australian coast. (3) Is there any evidence of any animals from these vessels being landed temporarily on the Australian mainland. (4) What action does he intend to take to prevent the danger of foot and mouth disease entering Australia.",142
267,Dr EVERINGHAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Occasional reports have been received that foreign fishing vessels off the northern and western Australian coast carry goats and animals which could be carriers of foot and Restructuring mouth disease. It is only very rarely that such reports have (Question No. 889) been substantiated. (2) Yes. (3) No. (4) My Department is working in close liaison with other interested Departments to prevent intrusions of foreign fishermen on Australian mainland and waters. When reports of alleged landings of foreign fishermen are received, the Western Australian Division of the Quarantine Service sends out aircraft for surveillance. Regular flights also have been undertaken during the traditional fishing season when overseas fishing vessels are likely to be in the area. If landings are confirmed, a helicopter service is arranged. These flights are in addition to patrols made by the Departments of Customs and Excise and Defence, which are mounting near continuous patrols in and around the highest risk areas during the August to October and March to May periods when the majority of intrusions occur. Quarantine Deficiencies Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon nodce: (1) Did the depanmental committee which investigated quarantine in Western Australia in March 1974 repon any quarantine deficiencies (a) at Fremantle, (b) at Penh Airpon, (c) at ports in the north west of Western Australia, (d) at aerodromes in the nonh west of Western Australia, (e) at Kwinana or (f) in the examination of overseas mail arriving in Western Australia. (2) If so, what were the deficiencies, and what subsequent corrective action has been taken.",142
268,Dr EVERINGHAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: . (l ) (a ) Yes. (b) Yes. (c) No. (d) No. (e) No. (f) No. (2) (a) Fremantle. The Committee was informed that there had been several recent occasions over week-ends when masters of vessels in pon had allowed small quantities of garbage to be left standing uncollected on the wharves and the bins containing the garbage had either been overturned or the contents spilt, thus constituting a quarantine risk. It was recommended that ships' masters should be required fectant over the garbage to make it unattractive to birds and unsuitable for feeding to animals. It was also recommended that Quarantine Assistants should visit wharves daily (including week-ends and holidays), and arrange for collection by a Pon Authority truck if garbage collection was overdue. These measures have been implemented. (b) Penh Airport. The lack of an adequate incinerator at Penh Airport was seen by the Committee to constitute a serious quarantine deficiency. This deficiency has cern to my Depanment, and for some years it has recognised the need for the installation of a new incinerator that would be capable of destroying all galley refuse from overseas aircraft at the Airpon. The incinerator has not yet been supplied and its provision is still under discussion. The Committee arranged that, until better incineration facilities are provided, the ashesremainingafter usage of the present small inadequate incinerators should not be removed for burial until a Quarantine Assistant is satisfied that effective incineration has taken place and has authorised their removal. This supervision is now effective. The Committee further recommended that there should be two Quarantine Assistants to supervise collection of food scraps and refuse in the Qantas Kitchen at Perth Airport when refuse was being collected from an overseas 747 aircraft or when two overseas aircraft were being serviced at the same time. Hitherto one Quarantine Assistant was assigned this duty. The recommendation has been implemented. The Committee also considered that, because of the ease with which they are torn, plastic bags containing refuse should be placed in bins for storage and transfer to the incinerator. It was also recommended that, to make galley refuse unattractive for unauthorised removal, a disinfectant containing diluted phenols should be added to the waste. These measures are being carried out. Department of Health: Officers Engaged in (QuestionNo. 1027) Quarantine Duties (Question No. 1028) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: What is the quarantine experience and training applicable to quarantine of each officer or employee ofhis Department employed in quarantine duties in Western Australia.",143
269,Dr EVERINGHAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Officers engaged in quarantine duties throughout the Department are given on-the-job training and instruction to facUitate their part in the discharge of the quarantine function. Formal training courses are currently in progress at which each officer will attend in progression. Imported Brushware: Louse Eggs (Question No. 1030) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Have louse eggs been detected in recent shipments of boar bristle brushes imported from Austria. (2) If so, what action has been taken. (3) Have any of these brushes already been sold to the pubUc.",143

(2) Formerly consignments of imported brushes were released if they were accompanied by a satisfactory certificate of disinfection issued by the health authority of the country of origin. Since discovery of louse eggs on some brushware, consignments are also inspected and, if they contain louse eggs, delivery is withheld. The consignee is given the option of returning the brushes to the exporter or destroying them locally. Examinations of louse eggs have shown them to be sterile and incapable of transmitting disease. been a matter of increasing con(3) It is possible that some imported brushes containing louse eggs were sold to the public prior to the introduction of inspection on arrival. Ashmore Reef (Question No. 1032) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Has his Department received any information in respect of Ashmore Reef indicating (a) use of the Reef as an Indonesian camping site, (b) the presence of animal offal and/or grain or (c) the presence of graves on any island in the Reef. (2 ) If so, what action has been taken.",143
271,Dr EVERINGHAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a)Yes;(b)Yes;(c)Yes. (2) HMAS Diamantina visited Ashmore Reef on 8 July 1974, following a report that Indonesianfishermenwere living on the Reef. My Department received a signal from the vessel confirming that Indonesians were using the Reef as a base, that there were nine graves on the Reef, that there were present kegs of corn and also the head of a cow (about two weeks dead). My Department in liaison with the RAN sent a patrol boat to the area immediately. Included in the parry were the Chief Quarantine Officer (Animals) and a Wild Life Officer, both stationed at Darwin, Northern Territory. When the patrol reached Ashmore Reef, the fishermen had left and there was no sign of plant or animal residues on the Reef. I understand that talks have been held and will be continued with the Indonesian Government on intrusions by fishermen into Australian waters and that a near continuous patrol system has already been introduced by the RAN to operate in the highest risk areas during the August to October and March to May periods when the majority of intrusions occur. Numerous vessels have already been escorted from Australian waters since the patrol system was commenced. Playgroup Association of New South Wales",143

273,Mr BEAZLEY,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There were discussions between members of the Executive of the NSW Playgroup Association and officers of the Department of Education on 2 August 1974. These discussions were suggested by me in my reply to an earlier letter from the NSW Playgroup Association. At these discussions a statement setting out assistance proposals was submitted. (2) (a) The proposals put forward at that meeting sought financial assistance (i) to establish some regional resource centres, (ii) to cover the cost of some publications, (iii) to employ playgroup advisers, (iv) to employ playgroup leaders to start groups in needy areas, (v) to develop a parent education program, and (vi) to develop new playgroups. The estimated cost of the assistance sought on the basis of a minimal capital outlay was $26,363 initial capital and $209,230 per annum for recurrent costs. (b) No aid has been given to the NSW Playgroup Association by the Australian Government. However, playgroups are seen as making an important contribution towards the Government's policy objective of integrated and comprehensive early childhood services. Playgroups are specifically referred to in the Terms of Reference for the Interim Committee for the Children's Commission. These Terms of Reference are included in the statement tabled by the Honourable Lionel Bowen in the House of Representatives on 19September 1974. Department of Customs and Excise: Inter-departmental Committees Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise, upon notice: Will the Minister provide a list of the inter-departmental committees, which have been established since 2 December 1972, of which officers of the Department of Customs and Excise are members.",144

(Question No. 279) Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The document to which the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition refers is undergoing pre-publication editing and its issue is imminent. Supporting technical documentation is well advanced and should be issued within a few weeks. Implementation of the procedures for protection and testing of persons exposed to risk of hearing damage, for specification of noise emission limits in equipments and buildings, for training of Noise Control and Hearing Conservauon Officers is almost complete in anticipation of the issue of the documentation. The major staff associations affected have agreed with the principles and most of the details of our program and have agreed to assist us with implementation if required. An employee training course designed to educate noise-exposed persons to the hazards of noise and to methods of prevention of hearing damage is in an advanced stage or preparation.

The return for 1973-74 will accordingly be tabled in the current session of Parliament.

Eight hundred and ninety-two titles were involved in South Australia in 1972-73. Regular maintenance of a consolidated list of titles appearing on individual claim forms is not an operational necessity. Preparation of the record now sought would thus impose a significant and-it is felt-unjus tified workload on the Depanment's South Australian office.

(2) Does he intend to revise the expedition program so that women may be included in it.",147
284,Mr MORRISON,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In principle it is possible for women to join Australian expeditions to the Antarctic Continent. However, this is not the present practice. Firstly, conditions and facilities at our stations are not suitable at the present time for women to spend the winter in the Antarctic. Secondly, for summer visits, whilst it would be possible for women to sleep on board and make brief visits in the vicinity of the stations during the annual relief voyages, the obstacle to this course is the shonage of ship berths and their arrangement in 4-berth Committees cabins. (Question No. 303) Similar difficulties as at stations on the Antarcuc continent confront women who wish to winter at Macquarie Island. Berths, however, are sometimes more readily available on the Macquarie Island voyages and women have visited the island for a few days in summer to undertake short-term projects. Priorities for such visits are usually determined by the Tasmanian Government Advisory Committee on Macquarie Island. (2) It is unlikely that the situation regarding wintering with Australian expeditions can be altered in the next few years but this will not preclude consideration being given to women making brief visits during the annual summer relief operations if their proposals have sufficient merit on the basis of scientific or other considerations. Consumer Advice Booklets (Question No. 589) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Science, upon notice: (1) Does the Government plan to prepare consumer advice booklets which detail purchasing features of various items of equipment.

(3) The method of distribution shall be appropriate to the subject matter e.g. theflammabilitybrochure was distributed through the Royal Melbourne Childrens Hospital and the then Department of Immigration: the buyers guide for colour television will be distributed through the Australian Government Bookshops.

Western Australia: Quarantine Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Did the depanmental committee which investigated quarantine in Western Australia in March 1974 repon any deficiencies in the (a) training, (b) experience, (c) administration of quarantine staff in Western Australia, or (d) in the safety procedures applied in the quarantine secuon in Western Australia. (2) If so, what were the deficiencies, and what subsequent corrective action has been taken.",147
286,Dr EVERINGHAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Yes. (b) No. (c) Yes. (d) Yes. (2) (a) Training. The Depanmental Committee concluded that better training would lead to improved confidence, motivation and performance among quarantine staff. received only on-the-job training. A formal training program on a national basis was subsequently instituted for all levels of quarantine personnel. Consideration further recommendation of the Committee that an in-service qualification-as distinct from the present Health Surveyor qualification-shoul d be developed. (c) Administration. The Committee was satisfied that the quarantine service for the Port of Fremantle and for Penh Airport is adequately staffed, and that most, if not all, of the matters that come to attention could be overcome by improved communication to and from the Perth office, by a speedier attention to matters the introduction of a more positive training program. The recommended improvements have been initiated. An earlier instruction of the Director-General of Health that the responsibility for technical tine should be transferred from the Assistant Director (Executive Services) to the Assistant Director (Medical) is now fully effective. (d) Safety Procedures. The Committee found that there was a failure for some years to have gas masks on issue to quarantine staff periodically checked by Defence Standards Laboratories as required in departmental instructions. These masks are used by personnel supervising fumigations. The Committee was informed that staff had, within the previous twelve months, been issued with new gas masks and that these masks will be tested regularly in the required manner. Chinese Shaving Brushes (QuestionNo. 1026) (Question No. 1029) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Have there been instances of shaving brushes imponed from China, which have not fully met quarantine requirements, being released for sale. (2) If so, how many were involved, where were they released, and what action has been taken.",148
287,Dr EVERINGHAM,CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT MAJOR AIRPORTS,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) 315 dozen brushes were released in Sydney in 1972 and 1973 and 3,600 dozen brushes were released in Adelaide in the same years. The attention of all quarantine staff has been drawn to the improper entry of these brushes and to the need for strict conformity with import prohibitions prescribed in quarantine legislation. However, anthrax is the main disease entering into quarantine concern with shaving brushes and it is considered that the risk of human infection by this means is almost negligible. Anthrax already occurs in livestock in Australia. The quarantine legislation which prohibits imports of shaving brushes from many countries including China, is at present under review to take into account modem manufacturing technology methods which may have diminished the risk of anthrax transmission. Hitherto quarantine staff had One Arm Point: Smallpox Vaccinations (Question No. 1031) is also being given to a Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: Has any action been taken by his Department to vaccinate Aboriginals at One Arm Point against smallpox following visits by Indonesian fishermen.",148

It was agreed that credit may be extended for periods in excess of 12 months in exceptional cases and the Government would, in such cases, bear the additional cost to the wheat industry'.
