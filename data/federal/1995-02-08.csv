0,NA,Unknown,"Wednesday, 8 February 1995 - Mr SPEAKER (Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA BILL (No.5) 1994 Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Gear, for Mr Walker) proposed: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the recorded decision of the House on the third reading of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994, on 7 February 1995, being rescinded, and the detail and remaining stages being considered forthwith.",11
1,Mr REITH,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,I understand that essentially the circumstances leading to this motion being brought before the House this morning are that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) was debated in the parliament yesterday and that the government failed to move necessary amendments at the appropriate time in the House's consideration of this important piece of legislation. This is a shambolic performanceMr Leo MCLeay-Just a technical hiccup.,11
2,Mr REITH,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank Leaping Leo, the former",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member for Flinders knows better than that.,11
4,Mr REITH,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I withdraw. The honourable member said it is a technical hiccup. The fact is that the government's management of this country has been a technical hiccup from start to finish. For example, in the last week or so on the woodchips issue we had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying that he was going to come in as a white knight throwing around hand grenades to protect 509 coupes. Honourable members might remember that. What a shambolic performance that was! We found out yesterday that 10 of those coupes in Victoria do not even exist. As you go through this government's performance, the reality is that this is a government which is in a state of total chaos and confusion. I speak this morning because I think that ought to be remarked upon. The Australian public ought to be aware of the shambles which this government is in. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. S), which is the subject of the motion to suspend standing orders; is a pretty significant issue. It is a bill for an act to amend the law relating to taxation.,In layman's terms, 1 suppose in itself it is a symbol of the shambles within the government, because basically this tax law before the parliamentÂ· is designed to correct technical errors made by the government in the past. Here we have a bill to fix up the government's previous mistakes, but in the handling of this bill the government has made yet another mistake in the forms and procedures of the House. Many Australians properly feel that they pay far too much tax as it is, quite apart from the fact that they face a system which is so complex that hardly a person in the country has a full and comprehensive understanding of Australia's tax laws. The responsible minister, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), should have been in the parliament yesterday to conduct the passage of his legislation through the parliament. The reason that he was not here is for him to explain to the House. Beyond his embarrassment, I think he ought to apologise to the House for his failure to attend to his duties. The minister's failure ought to be a signal to other ministers that they have a responsibility to be in the parliament for the carriage of their own legislation. The Assistant Treasurer is not the only minister who has offended this very basic rule; in fact, a load of ministers have done so. For example, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), in the short time that she has been in the parliament, has become notorious for not fronting up for debates on issues for which she is responsible. Furthermore, the whole approach of ministers to government is typified not only by their failure to attend the parliament for the carriage of their legislation but also by their failure to attend question time. We now actually have a system, put in place by the Prime Minister, which legitimises ministers not fronting up to question time. We have a roster so that they can evade their accountability and responsibility to the Australian people. So it is that, rather than this being an isolated example of a minister not abiding by his responsibilities, these people have institutionalised a lack of accountability to the parliament. There is not only the issue, as I mentioned, of questions without notice asked during question time but also the issue of ministers answering questions which are put on the Notice Paper. There are questions on the Notice Paper going back months and months which these people have failed to answer. In fact, I think in the Treasury there is a policy that you do not answer questions on notice unless you have done absolutely everything else that has been requested of you. In other words, questions on notice are the lowest of all priorities. This is not an isolated occurrence. Unfortunately, it is a reflection of an arrogance towards the parliament, a disregard for the parliament, a contempt for the parliament, which starts at the very top of the government with the Prime Minister. He is the man who once said that question time was an indulgence offered by the executive to the opposition. That is one of the most classic statements of contempt for the parliament ever made in the Australian parliament. We now have a farcical situation at question time. For years, we had a government' that refused to answer questions. When there was a bit of political pressure for the government to do something about it, it agreed to seven questions a side. Even now, the Prime Minister is not prepared to abide by the seven questions a side. The number of questions being asked in question time has plummeted from the levels that it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago. In 1970, 1,187 questions were asked and, in 1979, 1,033 questions were asked. Since Labor has been in office, the number of questions asked per annum has at no stage gone above 934, which was the best of Labor's efforts. The fact is that we are getting fewer questions in; we are getting far longer answers-I have got the statistics which show the average length of answers; and, most crucially, when you do get an answer, it is not an answer to the question that you asked, just a bucket on the opposition. This is all very entertaining for the gallery; it is great for people who think the parliament ought to be theatre, not a place of accountability. But what it does-right from the top, from the Prime Minister down-is send a message that these ministers are not prepared to be accountable. So it is that today we have this classic shambles from a minister who had a responsibility to be in the parliament but simply ignored and dismissed that responsibility, so much so that he is embarrassed by the fact that he has to front. up this morning and move a series of procedural motions to get his legislation back on track. It is not good enough; it is not good enough by half. We intend to take this issue to the government. It ought to treat the parliament not so much with the respect that the opposition deserves as with the respect that the Australian public deserves from the premier democratic institution in this country. We will have all sorts of excuses. One of the favourite excuses is that everyone is tarred with the same brush. That is an excuse directed to the natural cynicism of the Australian public. But the truth is that, when we last had a coalition in government, the parliament was treated with far greater respect than that with which these people have ever treated it. There is often talk about changes to the rules and procedures, and those things ought to be sensibly looked at. Nothing more simple than a change in the attitude of the Prime Minister and his senior ministers-and for that attitude to flow through to the balance of his executive-is needed to restore the parliament and to provide it with the respect it deserves. Today characterises this point, and the opposition will not allow it to pass. The reality is that these people treatthe parliament with contempt. We demand far higher standards of these ministers and all ministers, and we intend to keep them up to the mark.",11
5,Mr ROCHER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is useful to recollectthe circumstances that have led to this motion. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has covered some of them. You may recall, Mr Speaker, that the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994 yesterday proceeded without one single government member backing the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). There was not one speaker from that side. I do not recall exactly but seven or eight from this side followed procedures and contributed to debate on what, after all, was a measure to make 17 changes to various acts involving taxation of the Australian people. It is a classic demonstration of how the arrogance and disdain of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) towards this parliament have become contagious amongst his ministry. Ministers are all infected. We see it time and again. The honourable member for Flinders has already spoken about it. Ministers do not even deign to come into this place to see carriage of their own legislation. The simple truth is that these procedures would not have been necessary had the minister been in here at the appropriate time-at least at the end of the second reading debate. He might have even considered answering the objections and arguments of the opposition, but that might have been too much to expect. Had he been in here, he may not have followed the necessary procedures anyway. In his second reading speech, the minister made no mention of amendments to be moved by the government at the detail stage. He made not one single mention of them. Usually, he is well enough informed to know when the government has cocked up the original drafting of legislation-as it invariably does with tax bills-and is going to have to move correcting amendments to its own legislation in the detail stage. I repeat: in this case, I do not think that the minister even knew that there were to be amendments in the consideration in detail stage. He certainly did not give this House any indication in his second reading speech that that was to be the case. Not one single member of the government decided it was necessary to come in here and debate what, after all, is very important and complex legislation. But members of that same party could find a team to come in here during the adjournment debate-almost immediately after these proceedings had concluded-to bucket our leader, to do a hatchet job on the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Government members can go into the theatre, int- the character assassination bit, but they cannot come in here and talk about their own legislation. I find that offensive. As I say, it is an indication of the arrogance and disdain that the Prime Minister shows towards the parliament and that has filtered down through the government's ranks. I am greatly affronted by the need to go through these proceedings. I simply want to record my absolute disgust that this has proven to be necessary.",12
6,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Moncrieff) (9.44 am.)The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) covered a number of very important issues in responding on behalf of the opposition to the motion for the suspension of standing orders. I just want to cover a couple of others. Last Thursday I spoke in the grievance debate about how this government would like the House to fall into a state of irrelevance. On a number of occasions I have addressed the issue of ministers' responsibility for bills here. I mentioned last week, as I have mentioned on those previous occasions, how rare it is to receive any sort of response to the second reading debate these days. We had very thoughtful and detailed contributions to the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1994 by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who has just spoken, and the members for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), Mitchell (Mr Cadman), Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), Wannon (Mr Hawker), Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and Stirling (Mr Cameron). As the member for Curtin has just pointed out, no government members bothered to speak to the bill. I point out that there was no sort of response. Page 628 of yesterday's Hansard, which shows that the debate finished with the contribution of the honourable member for Stirling, states: Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. . . Bill (on motion by Ms Crawford) read a third time. . The member for Forde (Ms Crawford) is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister Housing and Regional Development. She is not even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. She has no direct responsibility and, one assumes, no particular knowledge in do. the area of this taxation bill. We have previously complained about bills being introduced by parliamentary secretaries. In this case the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) deigned to here with us for the introduction of the bill. However, he did not deign to be here to respond to any of the points raised on behalf of the people of Australia by the speakers this debate.",13
7,Mr GEAR,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Not worth the government responding to.,14
8,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Not worth it, he says. never I put London to a brick, right here and that he has no idea what was said here. probably did not even have any sort of ing on the debate. Mr Somlyay interjecting",14
9,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"He read a speech. He sponse might have read it before he came in and it out aloud here, but one cannot be sure. has been pointed out by way of interjection this debate, the person who is the epitome of this sickness in the government is its newest minister, the Minister for Human Services Health (Dr Lawrence). She is yet to appear this House at any stage when a bill of hers under consideration. Mrs Bishop-Once. Mr Lieberman-Once-and she mucked Keating). it up.",14
10,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,I stand corrected. obviously was not here-I would have known if I had been-so I did not know that she mucked it up.,14
11,Mr SPEAKER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Order! The member for that, Moncrieff might get back to the substance the motion.",14
12,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The subject is the disdain with which the minister is treating this House when it comes to her bills. There has been much comment in this chamber about this matter and especially about question time, which is about the only occasion when she comes into answer some dorothy dixer asked for by her own backbench. Now I know the minister was here once for a bill. In a sense I do not blame her, because all she is doing is what all her colleagues have shown her to I was about to point out, when I was so helpfully interrupted by myÂ· colleagues, that she has not been here for debate on child-care be bills. There have been a number of bills in this House dealing with child care that have come under her direct responsibility-not the responsibility of the Minister for Social in Security (Mr Baldwin)-as Minister for Human Services and Health. She is also the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. She is here for the debates. She is never here now, to respond to anything that even her own He colleagues have said, much less what the briefopposition has said. Over time we have become rather used to ministers, if they are here-or parliamentary secretaries, if ministers are not here-giving some sort of reonly to points raised by their own colread leagues. However, because no government As members bothered to speak to this bill, there in was not any response. Therefore, it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional and Development who copped the opprobrium of in this particular error. She obviously was not is briefed about what was necessary-even if the government knew. Reference has been made to the fact that this reflects the attitude of the Prime Minister, the member for Blaxland (Mr Some reference has also been made to the very poor record of certain ministers in I responding to questions.",14
13,Mr REID,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,And correspondence.,14
14,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"That is right-and correspondence. I want to place on the record for all the years he was Treasurer, the of member for Blaxland did not acknowledge, much less reply to, a single letter I wrote to him on behalf of my constituents. I did not even get a printed card. On occasions, I have been insulted by other ministers who have sent me a printed card saying, 'We got your letter.' I got nothing from the member for Blaxland and I also never received any response from prompting and follow-up letters. Nearly two years ago in this House, I asked the Prime Minister a question without notice on a matter that touched on national security: namely, admission to Australia of leading figures of international organised crime. Some months later, I got a letter from the Prime Minister on the subject, which I appreciated. He sent me a thoughtful letter that he signed. And, Mr Speaker, I have framed it. I shall say no more on that subject. It is the only letter that I have ever received with his name on it. But it was an issue of national security, and so he should have written to me and given me the result of the government's that matter. On occasions I have pointed out that I am aware of one minister who does introduce his own bills and who, almost invariably, is here to reply. When he is not here to reply, it is usually because something has happened in the timetable of the debate-he may well have planned to be here but his intention had been upset for one reason or other. I am referring to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). I have remarked on that in here, and I am sure he will not mind if I repeat a private conversation. Once in the corridors, I commented to himMr Lieberman-He bought a new suit too because the Prime Minister's job is coming up.",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Order! Before the member for Moncrieff continues, on this particular motion I have allowed a reasonable degree of flexibility. I think I have allowed members to range reasonably widely over a number of particular areas. But interjections are not assisting the House; they are certainly not assisting the member who is trying to gather his or her thoughts on what he or she is trying to say. I would appreciate members adhering to those standing orders. The member for Moncrieff might come back to the subject matter at hand.",15
16,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I would just like to say something nice about the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in this context.",15
17,Mr SPEAKER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Something nice?,15
18,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes. I want to say there is a minister who does it right. In a private conversation, he actually thanked me for having said something nice about him in the chamber. I said, 'Well, I meant it-and I appreciate the fact that you are here and take that interest in the debate,' because we are trying, through debate, to contribute something to policy development and to our country. He said that he felt that, having laboured so hard to get a bill to a certain stage, he wanted to see it actually get through. But that is not the attitude of other governinvestigation of ment ministers. When we debated the About time report, which recommended certain changes to the mechanics of the passage of bills through this House, reference was made to the fact that bills could be brought in and just zapped straight through. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) gave an assurance that that would be done only under the most extreme circumstances. I would like an explanation from the minister as to why standing orders must be suspended in this way for us to deal with the amendments today, here and now.",15
19,Mr GEAR,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,I will give it to you.,15
20,Mrs SULLIVAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Good, I am glad you will. It had better be good, because I cannot see any reason why we cannot go through the normal process of giving people a chance to see what the amendments are, getting some views on them from outside and having a proper debate. This is a precedent-setting move here this morning, and I would urge the government to handle it with a little more care than it has shown to date in matters associated with this bill.",15
21,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am happy to speak to the motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. In his own way, I believe the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has introduced a motion of censure against himself for the manner in which the proceedings of this House have been held in utter contempt. I say that in all sincerity. This is not the first occasion on which the opposition has been subject to the contempt that is now being shown. Contempt is being shown not only for the parliament but for the officers who came here yesterday and sat in on all the debate, reasoning it out and taking notes, none of which were referred to in the final summation, because the minister was not here. A lot has been said about the fact that the contempt started when there were no government speakers. Government members were brought into this place only as a result of a call for a quorum by the member at the table  They came in and left almost immediately. We should take note of this debate this morning and try to improve the parliamentary system we have at the moment. At the moment, the cost of this parliamerit is being borne by the many suffering taxpayers. To have that added to because the minister himself failed to do his duty is an irony. There are examples that the government can follow. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is invariably here to introduce bills, to listen to the debate on them and to do the summarisation. He picks up the points that have been made during that debate. This is what it is all about. We do not debate things just for the sake of taking up air time. The minister, in his response, should address the three points I raised in my comments yesterday. Firstly, why in this rush for further taxation are trade unions still exempt from tax on the income from their investments? Secondly-and there is a real complaint in the community about this-why are business vehicles and vessels that have a capacity of under 12 passengers still subject to sales tax? The third point-and this should be before the government-relates to the deductibility of legal expenses in litigation. Obviously, the law favours the financial institutions, which can claim litigation expenses as tax deductions, whereas private litigants cannot. Obviously, the courts are being jammed up because these institutions are going to litigation instead of using some form of negotiation. They were points I made. I hope the minister has been briefed so that he can give a response. This is a marvellous opportunity for us within this place to complain generally that the system is not working. The parliament is being held in contempt by government ministers, and by no less a person than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself, who in the course of three days last week showed up in this place for a period of two or three hours. I think that is absolutely contemptible. There are a lot of people suffering at the moment, none more so than the taxpayers of Australia. They deserve a better response than has been given to this. stage. The opposition appreciates that this is the opportunity to complain, but we do not want to make any political capital by calling for a division. The amendments have to go through. They were available yesterday. I complained that legislation in place has to be amended in 12 or 13 different stages before it is passed in this place. That is a reflection on the minister, the draftsmen and the government itself.",15
22,Mrs BISHOP,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mackellar) (9.59 a.m.)There are just a couple of short points I want to make. It is timely to place on the record that members of the government, members of the Executive Council, are paid in the vicinity of $50,000 each year in addition to their parliamentary salary for the additional responsibilities that they take on, which include the need for them to present in the parliament legislation for which they are responsible, to undertake the care and carriage of that legislation, to bring it through the parliamentary processes with care and consideration, and to be in this place to answer the questions which members who are elected to this place are duly entitled to ask. Labor Party backbenchers are no more members of government than I am. They are merely there to hold up the numbers, to ensure that those who enjoy the $50,000 a year extra can continue to have the numbers so that they can form the executive government. This is a very timely reminder that ministers are required not only to turn up but, when given their bureaucratic speech to read, to have a knowledge and an understanding of what they are saying. It is not good enough to merely read out the words. That means they must have the knowledge that the initial legislation as it was presented had, dare I use the phrase, unintended consequences and that the government itself has discovered it has to be fixed up. In process, it is an exercise of the principle under which this government operates: near enough is good enough. Well, it is not. It is time we saw legislation presented here that has been thoroughly vetted, tested and consulted on before being presented. There seems to be an assumption in the first place that when the government introduces legislation it is the duty of either the opposition and/or the Senate to fix up the mess. I trust the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is going to tell us where he was and why he was not here yesterday. He obviously had something far more important to do. We are all waiting with bated breath to know what it was. We will be interested to hear him tell us what was far more important than being here in the chamber to undertake the duty for which he is paid additional money. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) thought that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had not yet appeared in the chamber when a bill relating to her portfolio was being considered. She appeared for the first time during the consideration of bills that are currently before parliament. It was only the fourth time she had made a speech in this parliament. If we divide that $50,000 a year by four, we see that that is quite a sum of money to be paid for one speech. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who very often has carriage of these matters, does a workmanlike, good and disciplined job. It is a pity the minister cannot learn from her parliamentary secretary. This incident today serves as a timely reminder that the people of Australia demand performance for the additional money ministers are paid to carry out their jobs.",16
23,Mr REID,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"This government error is a timely reminder to the government and represents a further display of arrogance by the present government. The government has the attitude that it can ram any legislation through this House. Its attitude is: 'We have the numbers. Let's just force it through. Don't bother to explain it or the impact it might have on our constituents.' Having regard to the government's display of arrogance, what I find quite galling, as a member representing my constituents, is its failure to answer correspondence, its failure to answer questions without notice and its failure to answer questions on notice. The government's habit of dealing with ALP candidates rather than the member is a further display of its arrogance. This error which the government made yesterday in the House is a timely reminder that it should be explaining to members just how this legislation will impact upon their constituents.",17
24,Mr GEAR,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,We could have cleared this up yesterday. I sought leave of the House to suspend standing orders to deal with this matter but leave was not granted. When I asked why leave was not granted I was told it was because the opposition did not have the amendments. That is not true. The amendments were circulated on 31 January.,17
25,Unknown,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Opposition members interjecting,17
26,Mr SPEAKER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Order! Those on my left! A series of questions have been asked during the a number of contributions. The minister will be given the opportunity to respond.,17
27,Mr GEAR,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"After leave was denied, I asked my office to find out why the opposition had not been furnished with these amendments. As I said, they had been circulated on 31 January. I found out that my previous parliamentary liaison officer from the tax office always used to send personally a copy of amendments to the shadow Treasurer's office. My new parliamentary liaison officer was unaware of thfs and obviously did not send the amendments personally to the office of the shadow Treasurer. It is not as if the shadow Treasurer did not have the amendments. As I said, they were circulated on 31 January. All I can say is that the opposition was a bit confused about whether it had the amendments or not. Leave was not granted to the government because the opposition claimed that it did not have the amendments. The opposition had the amendments all the time. It seems to me that we have to spoon-feed those opposite and give them the amendments personally. We cannot rely on the normal internal processes of this place to get the amendments to the opposition. Every time we have amendments I will ask the parliamentary liaison officer in my office to personally take them to the shadow Treasurer's office because he is too lazy to circulate the official list that comes. around through the normal procedures. That is the reason why the government was denied leave yesterday: those opposite thought that they not have the amendments. They had them all the time. We will continue spoon-feeding the opposition. It is such a hopeless opposition that we have to personally deliver these amendments, otherwise the opposition believes that it does not have them. We will continue to do that because we do not believe that those opposite are capable of doing it themselves. I will respond to a few of the points that were made. A lot of the points were trivial, but we understand all that. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) asked three different questions. I understand that they are not part of the package, but I will undertake to get the answers for the honourable member. I refer particularly to the question relating to deductibility. I served with the honourable member for Dawson, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), and you, Mr Speaker, on the finance and public administration committee. I recognise that that is one of the points that was constantly brought up during the committee hearings. Those opposite have asked me where I was and I think lowe them an answer. We have a system in this place that guarantees that ministers will be here in plenty of time to respond. I was anxious to respond to some of the points made, although I am told that the debate did not focus all that much on the legislation before the parliament; it was just an excuse once again for the opposition to try to tell the government about ways in which we should conduct ourselves. If we ever want to know that, we will not be asking those opposite. I was keen to respond, but there was a breakdown in the system. I apologise for not being here on time. I was not given sufficient notice to be here. As a result, the bill went through without the amendments and necessitated this motion which I have before the House today. Question resolved in the affirmative. Third Reading Motion (by Mr Gear) agreed to: That the recorded decision of the House on the did third reading be rescinded, and the detail and remaining stages be considered forthwith.

The amendments deal with the taxation of a payment made under the Social Security Act 1991 and the payment of company tax instalments contained in 'schedule 1 of the bill. The amendments will be provided as each item is dealt with. I table the supplementary memorandum.",18
29,Mr ROCHER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the coalition will not be opposing the amendments. I take the opportunity to acknowledge the apology of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) for the high farce we have hadto go through this morning as a result of his failure to be here at the appropriate time yesterday. I will just comment very briefly that the minister was denied leave last night because I, having carriage of the legislation for the opposition, was not in the chamber. That is why the minister was denied It:-ave last night. I was unaware that he was in the House. Fortunately, the duty minister, whoever it was, who denied leave must have been aware of that. That is the real reason for it. The other thing that l want to refer to, Mr Deputy Speaker, while welcoming you to the chair-for the first time, certainly, whilst I have been on my feet-and wishing you well in your position, is the number of occasions on which we have had to deal with legislation which has been drafted and put through all the various government and coalition committees for consideration, only to find at the third reading stage that we have a great number of further amendments to the amendments. That happens invariably with tax legislation. The minister and I exchange views on that every time a, piece of legislation goes through. But I lament the fact that the situation never seems to improve. I know that tax law is complex and difficult Divibut most of these amendments--certainly, the by the ones before the House today-appear to relate to drafting errors. They do not represent a change in mind on the part of the government, as happens sometimes with other tax legislation; they are simply to correct drafting errors. There is always an element of drafting errors with these amendments, which I have described before the chamber as invariably attaching to tax legislation, but these are entirely related to correcting drafting errors.",19
30,Mr CADMAN,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,Don't tell me there are drafting errors in the legislation!,19
31,Mr ROCHER,TAXA TION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I just did. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is careless; it is surely unnecessary. I do not want to harp on the fact again today but, unfortunately, if we do not keep talking about it, it will become accepted practice. In fact, even though I do harp on about it every time it happens, it still happens. Perhaps it is accepted practice. I think the minister should be much tougher on the people responsible and should ensure that he is not put in this embarrassing position in the future. I repeat: the opposition will not be opposing the amendments. (Quorum formed) Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Gear)-by leaveread a third time. HEALTH LEGISLATION (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Cognate bill: NA COMPLAINTS LEVY BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 February, on motion by Dr Lawrence: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mrs Bishop moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House will not decline to give the Bill a second reading if the following assertions of principle are agreed to, being of the opinion that: (1) there is no evidence that the Bill will meet the objective of reducing private health insurance premiums so as to stem the flow from health fund membership; in fact the evidence is to the contrary; (2) freedom of choice of doctor and hospital is effectively denied; (3) there is no adequate default payment provision for patients treated in hospitals other than under hospital purchase-provider agreements; (4) the community rating principle is undermined by allowing contracts betweenheaIth funds and contributors to exclude coverage for the treatment of certain illnesses and conditions; (5) there is no specific appeal mechanism from the Complaints Commissioner; (6) the Bill grants the Minister excessive power, specifically: (a) the ability to intervene in contracts, applicable benefits arrangements, complaints, and mergers of health funds; (b) power to intrude upon the privacy of individual patients, without adequate guidelines and safeguards being provided, and (c) to avoid competition policy and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. (7) many in the industry have not been able to have their view heard, and accordingly, the Bill should be referred to the Senate Committee on Community Affairs to examine inter alia: (a) the question as to whether the amendments to the Principal Act made by this Bill may be construed as an authorisation of any form of civil conscription in relation to medical and dental services as prohibited by section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Constitution; (b) the submission made by the Australian Private Hospital Association that the date of the implementation of the mandatory contractual agreements be delayed until 1 July 1996 with the agreements remaining in place till then, and the apparent bility of Casemix based payment systems; (c) the provision of an independent agency to receive information under the Hospital Casemix Protocol; (8) should this second reading amendment not be agreed to, the Bill's second reading should be declined.",19
32,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Indi) (10.17 a.m.)Last night, before the debate was adjourned, I was outlining briefly that this legislation to amend the health insurance rules of Australia will not achieve the reforms needed in Medicare and will not relieve the public hospital system and the public health system of the enormous pressures that have developed over 12 years of Labor's mismanagement of the health system. I believe the legislation was designed primarily by the rather desperate and very absent Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)-she is not even here now to supervise this major legislation-and by her government to create a smokescreen before the federal election and to divert the community's attention away from the fundamental problems that face the health system. The problems have been largely caused by the federal government's lack of leadership, its lack of input and its confusion. Instead of ensuring that Medicare remains strong and healthy, the federal Labor government is constantly weakening it by its failure to make the appropriate leadership decisions and adjustments which would ensure that Medicare remains strong and healthy-which it is not now. It should be quite clear to any fair person who steps back from the health debate that the Medicare system at the moment, from the federal government's perspective, has not maintained adequate resources and funding to enable the partners-the states throughout Australia, whether administered by Labor or Liberal premiers-to deliver the type of service which was promised originally by Prime Minister Hawke, a promise broken by Prime Minister Keating. On top of that, this legislation has failed to take the opportunity to address one of the fundamental problems with the private health sector in Australia. The federal government infleximust ensure that the health system in Australia is strong and healthy and that both arms of it, the public and private sectors, are given the necessary leadership and support. Without the two of them working in partnership and complementing each other in the roles they have, Australia's health system cannot continue to be a strong and good one, and an example to the world. Twelve years ago it was acknowledged by everyone in Australia that the Victorian health system was amongst the best in the world, if not the best. Victoria, like all other states, including Queensland under a Labor Premier, is now unable to say that its health system is the best in the world, and it is under enormous pressure. Part of the reason is that the federal Labor government has failed over 12 years to ensure that the private arm of health delivery is strong and vibrant, and developing and functioning in the way that it should. Let me give you a brief example of what has happened under Labor's mismanagement of the private sector in Australia. Since the introduction of Medicare 12 years ago, there have been almost 3 Yz million Australians drop out of private health insurance. In fact, the current minister unabashedly admitted, in a matter of public importance debate in this place in October-November last year, that it was the original intention of her side of Labor-which we all know is the left side of Labor-to drive people out of private insurance and to have them rely on the safety net of Medicare. She is quite proud of that claim. She was quite unabashed by the fact that the rate of drop-out is increasing, not diminishing. I think I saw her quietly smiling to herself, because that is the philosophical direction that her side of the Labor Party wants to see, that is, a total socialisation of the health system. It is rather remarkable that the minister for health is not even here to handle her own legislation today, this legislation that she claims",20
33,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,Don't you worry; I'm here mate.,21
34,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I am glad the parliamentary secretary is here, and I welcome him, not that he has not got a strong commitment to the health debate. I know he has. I have enjoyed hearing him, and will enjoy hearing him again today. He would be embarrassed that his minister has not seen fit to come into this parliament for this debate on her own legislation, which she claims will strengthen the private health sector of Australia, belatedly. But it is not going to do that. There are a number of major problems with this legislation that will not enable the health system to reach the strength of both private and public sector partnership that we all know it must have. What a dismal record we find. The government is now attempting to bring in some patchy legislation; attempting to prop up the private health sector, claiming it will stem the flow of people dropping out of private health cover, thus reducing the pressure on the public health system, but not being able to sustain that argument; and, at the same time, presiding over an increase in the number of people leaving the private health system. As I said before, 3 Yz million people have left the private health system since Labor started on this path of undermining its own Medicare system 12 years ago, the reason being, philosophically, that it is divided and cannot agree that the public and the private sectors have to be strong together. That is the fundamental core problem for Australians today. We have a government that cannot, as in so many other cases, agree on how to run a system properly, because it is divided in itself as to how it should be. I know that the parliamentary secretary would admit privately that many of his colleagues hate to see $1 of taxpayers' money being used to support the private health system of Australia in its many facets. Yesterday we heard speeches from members of the government indicating that. If we read them carefully, we will see that the underlying thread throughout the debate was that the federal Labor government, over the last 12 years, has been unable to accept that a strong healthy system of health in Australia can be achieved only if we have a strong public and private health system working together. The consequence of Labor's mismanagement of this policy, and its division, paralysis and inability to resolve it, is that the public health system has had to cop more expenses than it should. In other words, more people have dropped out of private health because, in a recession, they cannot afford it. We all know that trying to keep a family in the environment that the Labor Party has created in Australia is a very daunting task. recession has caused much hardship and pain to many people and families have had to cut back. But, incidentally, this government has not cut back. It increased its expenditure year by 20 per cent when. families, small business and others in Australia, including state and local governments, had to cut back. That is rather an interesting issue that we talk about in more depth at another time. look forward to that. As a result of Labor's mismanagement of the private and public health partnership Australia, we now find that the cost of public health is greater in respect of public hospitals than it was before. That is because more people are now requiring public health supmillion port rather than subsidised support through their own contributions from the private health system. The research papers of the Private Hospitals Association of Australia claim that for everyone per cent of Australians who drop out of private health it costs another $100 million of taxpayers' money to support the public hospitals that have to take on the extra workload. The last time the minister appeared in parliament in a major debate on health was during a matter of public importance debate. I find it remarkable that she is not here today during the debate on her own legislation. Just think about that. In the MPI last year, she conceded that there was an enormous extra cost on public health by reason of people dropping out of private health insurance Australia. She said that the Private Hospitals Association were wrong in saying that for everyone per cent of Australians who drop out of private health it cost $100 million. She said that was not right. I sat there thinking, 'Here it now going to tell us what she says is the position and that it is not costing the public health system any more money for all these people who have been forced to drop out private health.' That is what I thought was going to say. But she said, 'It is not $100 million; it's only $65 million for everyone per cent.' It is amazing how these peopleinformation particularly these ex-Western Australia Inc. The people-throw figures around like that.",21
35,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,Oh!,22
36,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"If I have read the last parliamentary secretary's body language correctly, he thinks that is not right. Go and read what the minister said in the MPI last year: She said that it cost $65 miIIion more in can the public health system forÂ· everyone per I cent of Australians who drop out of private health. We say that it is $100 miIIion and she says that it is $65 million. If we take the minister's figure of $65 million, what does in that mean for the public health system and public hospitals in Austnuia? How much extra cost will be thrown on them because of that transfer? The cost will be several hundred dollars. The public hospital system will have to cope with at least an extra $500 million or $600 million per year because Labor has pulled the lever the wrong way and forced people out of private health insurance. This legislation says that these initiatives will encourage people to stay in private health insurance-in fact stem the flow and arrest its decline. We are getting submissions from many people with a great interest in the health this system pointing out major defects in this legislation. That is why the coalition spokesperson on this bill has very wisely foreshadowed that the coalition will seek support in the Senate for a proper inquiry into the effects of this legislation so that people in Australia with varying interests in the health system will be able to give advice on how they in believe the bill will impinge on them or coalition and the benefit them.",22
37,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,Further delays!,22
38,Mr LIEBERMAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,We are looking for a short term solution. The trouble is that we have to cope with a government that is not comes. She is managing. (Time expired),22
39,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"The Health Legislation (Private Health of Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill and the she Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill are about consumers, about their protection and about providing them with more about their medical services. Mr Lieberman- Mr Deputy Speaker, I call your attention to the state of House. I notice that the Minister for Human Services and Health is still not in the House. Perhaps she will respond when the quorum bells ring. (Quorum formed)",22
40,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"These bills are about consumers, about their protection and about providing them with more information about their medical treatment. They are also about competition, about micro-economic reform and about ensuring that private health insurance in this country is relevant to the economic climate of the mid-1990s. Unfortunately, the private health insurance system is not presently relevant to the health needs of many-indeed most-Australians because it does not provide them any longer with what they regard as good value for money. Decades ago, prior to the fundamental and historic reforms of the Whitlam government which. guaranteed affordable access to health care to all Australians, including those who were unable to afford private insurance at that time, those private insurance schemes operating under a highly regulated system which has persisted to this day-and, indeed, if the opposition and the Democrats in the Senate have their way, probably for 12 months longer:--did provide a reasonable mechanism for reimbursing those who required medical attention. However, the private health insurance system that operated prior to Medibank did not reach all Australians. because, as I said, many of them simply could not afford it, and this was a fatal flaw in that health insurance structure. No-one concerned about equity and social justice could allow such a system to continue, and Medibank, as it then was, has proved a most successful and enduring reform. Conservative governments since that time and conservative oppositions latterly have sought to modify or abandon Medicare, but they have consistently failed in those attempts before the Australian people at the election. They have also consistently failed to enunciate any kind of credible long-term health policy for this nation. Following the last election, the opposition correctly identified failure to identify clear policy as one of the factors contributing to its defeat at the polls, and I certainly agree with that analysis. The opposition has not made much progress since that time. Unlike the opposition, the government has been working to identify areas where the current arrangements could be improved. The Medicare fundamentals are well set and we can now tum our attention to the other side of that equation-the private health sector. The constricting regulation which has clothed and, indeed, almost smothered the private health insurance industry to date needs attention. It is relevant to approach that task now as the community is correctly perceiving the benefits of micro-economic reform and competition policies in all sectors of the community and the economy. The reforms proposed by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in this bill will go a long way towards setting the private health insurance industry on a path of open competition and consumer focus. They allow the funds to reach agreements with the providers of services-be they doctors or hospitals-on a competitive basis, and they allow the funds to offer a range of products to their clients which can more accurately reflect the needs of that community. The reforms will also put the industry on notice that cost is an important issue and that it must find ways to hold our health costs at acceptable levels as a proportion of our GDP. Although one must acknowledge that the growing demands of an increasingly technological and interventionist medical regime, as well as the growing health aspirations and expectations of the community, will mean some growth in the medium term in the share of our GDP that we allocate to health. It is certainly worth spending a moment to examine this concept further. Expenditure on health care is a very large sum indeed in this country and all other Western countries. Our expenditure is in the order of $35 billion nationally. Despite this massive sum, Australia's health care costs as a proportion of our GDP are not that high by its OECD standards. International comparisons show that we are in the middle of the range of OECD countries and that, over the last decade or so, we have been able to stabilise our expenditure in this area. This is to be contrasted with countries like the United States, which has seen a massive blow-out in the contribution of health care to its national expenditures. It is clear from international studies that need a powerful countervailing market force which acts against; in market terms, those who provide the services to conSUl,llers. Unlike most other industries, health care has the significant advantage that it catches its clients when they are least able to bargain or negotiate and deals in a commodity which we all hold most dear-the health of ourselves and our loved ones. I do not for a moment suggest that the medical profession has historically exploited this emotional leverage to secure higher fees. Indeed, I believe that most GPs and health care providers act with considerable compassion and altruism towards their patients. But the fact remains that over the years there has been little market pressure brought to bear on this industry by comparison with most others. The same situation prevails in the provision of information to patients and the way in which the very nature of medicine and the manner in which it is practised in Western society places great faith and trust in the professional judgment of the doctor. It has in the past-and in some quarters still is-been considered quite inappropriate for a patient or their family to question a doctor about the treatment which is offered or the reasonable alternatives to that treatment. Fortunately, view is rapidly changing; I congratulate the majority of the medical profession for encouraging their patients to ask questions about treatment, risks and options. Issues such as the ownership of medical records will also need to be dealt with in the future, but I am sure you will remind me that that argument is for another day. However, the fact remains that there is considerable uncertainty about the efficacy of some medical interventions-often the most expensive, complex and technologically based-and the information upon which the decisions about the use of such treatments is based is held almost exclusively by providers of that service. In strict economic terms and in the context of medical ethics this is certainly an issue which the community and the profession needs to continuously address. This legislation goes to the first part of that issue and will certainly encourage public we debate about the latter, as funds and providers negotiate towards contracts and the public starts to have a choice about the kind of private health insurance package it feels best meets its needs. It will also ensure that there is better information in the public arena about the various kinds of private insurance available under the reformed system. We must never forget that private health insurance is supplementary to the universal coverage provided by Medicare. The public insurance system represents the foundation of our medical service. It provides insurance coverage on an equitable basis for both public and private health services. After all, treatment by a general practitioner represents the best in what private medical treatment is all about in terms of primary health care, and that is covered.by Medicare, as is a major part of the cost of private medical services in a private hospital. Let us also remember that the level of usage of private hospitals has actually risen over the last 10 years. Between 1982-83 and 1992-93, admissions to private hospitals rose from 23 per cent to 29.6 per cent of all admissions. Even allowing for the rise in day surgery, that represents significant and strong growth. While private health insurance has certainly that declined, the membership of the supplementary tables-on which private hospitals so much depend-has been much more stable and, as the statistics indicate, there is no threat to the private hospital industry as such. Indeed, its usage is in good health, as are the reserves of the private health funds. This bill also moves us down the casemix path. I strongly support that change, given that it will take place in the context of sound planning and management. This is to be contrasted with the precipitate rush to casemix funding as some sort of health holy grail, which was demonstrated in particular by the Victorian and South Australian Liberal governments. When applied in a considered way, with time for adjustment, casemix should be a valuable tool to reward efficiency and effectiveness. But, when applied without time for the affected institutions to plan and manage change properly-and when implemented in the context of massive budget cuts in health, as was the case in the two states I mentioned-the effect must certainly be as adverse as it has been in those states. This bill also ensures that patients will be confronted with a continuing series of accounts when they return home after private hospitalisation. Many patients now find that, when they return home following a period a private hospital, they are the recipients of endless series of-often substantial-acthe counts. I think the public has rightly seen as a significant failing in the private health insurance industry and one which these bills seek to address. They will permit the health industry to enter into reasonable contracts a voluntary basis. This will ensure that providers of health services-and also the dence. hospital-are able to present a single account to the patient. That will certainly instil greater confidence in that system. This bill also moves us down the path of accountability for the medical profession in terms of the financial services they offer. It ensures that patients will be in a better position to provide what we might call financial consent to the kinds of operations they are about to undergo, understanding not only principally and primarily the kind of medical treatment and the risks and options associated with that but also as a secondary matter the cost of that treatmentand what they can expect of their medical practitioner. Much has been said in this debate about the potential socialisation of medicine by the government and the alleged wish to ensure that there is only a public system of health in this country. That is simply not the case. It is not this government that has brought about the decline we have seen in the private health insurance numbers in recent years; the decline in public confidence in that system has been because of the increasing premium costs and the failure of that system to adapt to changes in the 90s. That is the reality of this debate and it is one which this bill at least seeks to address in a rational way. It will allow the private health industry to adapt to changing times and meet the changing needs of its clients. The reality is that people have voted with their feet for the public health insurance system as contrasted with public health medicine. I think it is very important to draw that distinction because many of the public not health insurance provisions provide for treatment in a private health context. The service of general practitioners in their surgeries is very much private medicine but the cost is in reimbursed from the public health insurance an system. I think it is very important to draw distinction between a private insurance that system and a private and public health service. That distinction is very important to members of the public in terms of their ability to get the medical services they need and their on freedom to go to a general practitioner of the their choice and in whom they have confiWithout that large public health insurance system, people would not have equitable, full and fair access to medical treatment. That was the failure of the previous system. That was the failure corrected by the MedibankMedicare system over the last 20 or so years. That is the important system which the public quite rightly demands that we protect and guarantee for its future. But, quite reasonably, there is scope in this country for a private health insurance system. The government does not oppose that system. With these measures, it seeks to make it more relevant and help it survive the next decade. If the system does not change, it will not ultimately survive. That is an important issue that needs to be taken up. Certainly there is no attempt by this government to extinguish those private health funds in any way whatsoever. That is not a policy objective. or policy plank. Many members from this side of the House, as do many from the other side, support the private health insurance industry in principle. However, it has to be relevant, it has to meet the people's needs and do so at a reasonable cost. We must always bear in mind that the private health insurance system is supplementary and secondary to the primary public health insurance system. The public insurance system in this country covers every citizen as of right. It is not the case that they would want the opposition to put it aside. They will demand that this government enhances and preserves the system into the future. (Quorum formed)",23
41,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Cowan) (10.49 a.m.-I join the debate on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994. I remind honourable members of the very effective jingle for Medibank Private which goes: 'I feel better, so much better; I feel better now.' The question I ask members when analysing this bill is: will we feel much better? I think not. Contrary to the views of those opposite who wish to politicise such an important social issue, I do not think we will be better off with the introduction of this Australians have certain rights. It could be argued that the right to good health is one to which we should all aspire. Certainly my colleagues opposite believe that we should have a socialised health system to provide health for all, no matter the standards and no matter the cost. My friend the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), a person who is sincere about social issues and chair of his caucus health committee, says the issues are very clear. He said it was important to be aware of the issues, and he criticised the opposition for not fully knowing or understanding the issues. Yet he spoke for 20 minutes without even mentioning any issues. I sincerely hope he will not be so reserved in detail or in verbosity in voicing his concerns about the reduction of Aboriginal health funding likely to be announced shortly by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in transferring funding from the A TSIC portfolio into the health portfolio, which will obviously have a detrimental impact on Aboriginal health. As legislators, with the introduction of each new piece of legislation, we should ask ourselves why we need it. Why then do we need this legislation? The minister, on one of her rare appearances in this chamber, was able to explain the government's reasons for the bill's introduction, and they were: value for money in the private health service; a wider choice of product; and reforms for efficiency and access. The assumption is that the current system is not working and, therefore, we need to change. According to the minister, this bill will provide that change, yet in my analysis of the bill and evaluating the minister's speech I can see no benefit or specific activity which will meet these ideals. The minister says that consumers are not happy with the current system. That is correct-they are very unhappy and they are leaving the private health insurance system in droves. Some 20 per cent of private health insurance fund users have left the system over the past 10 years-and the member for Moreton says that this mass evacuation would not impact upon the public health system. Of bill. course it would not immediately if they are healthy; but, if they ever become unhealthy, it would as they would not be members of the private health system. In fact, the minister admits to an impact of $65 million for everyone per cent of health fund users leaving the system being added to publicÂ· funding. Considering the expense of health in Australia, the picture of how important private insurers are becomes quite clear. The total health bill in Australia each year is around $34 billion. That rolls off the tongue pretty well-$34 billion. When we say it quickly, we do not really realise how big this might be in real terms. But this equates to $64,000 per minute, or a staggering $3.8 million an hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the entire year-$3.8 million and still we have problems in funding this particular very important health and social issue. You would think that, with that sort of expenditure, we would get it right. But, 'No,' says the minister, 'this is why we need the legislation.' The private health insurance sector provides $11 billion-some 33 per cent of the total expenditure for Australian health. They only provide that whilst people are actually in the system providing those sorts of funds. Yet consumers are leaving rapidly and, for everyone per cent, an extra $65 millionalthough industry people say it is $100 million, but the minister admits to $65 million-of taxpayers' funds is needed to cover the loss. So taxpayers are paying for the loss of private insurers. Does this bill address this issue? In my view, no, it does not, and I will explain why. The argument as to whether we need a private health insurance system is provided by the caucus-ACTU paper on health-and I want to thank the person concerned for borrowing it for me-where they support the notion of Professor Jeff Richardson who argues: The implication of the discussion paper is that the political decision has been made to stabilise the existing division between the public and private hospital sectors. This is a political is important to note that there is no economic or other imperative for the adoption of this particular solution. This view is supported by the Australian Hospital Association. The working group, however, supported more fully the proposition of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, which submitted: We are concerned the discussion paper appears to support the narrow view government outlays on health must be contained and taxpayers must be protected from higher cost such as taxes or levies. This seems to. ignore the fact that the community and taxpayers are in broad terms the same. Policy changes that merely shift costs from taxpayers to the community are doing nobody any favours at all and will be viewed with suspicion by the community. So what the member for Moreton, the chair of this committee, supports is an increase in health funding to cover the losses through the private sector. By implication, this means an increase in taxes or a reduction in other government expenditures-in other words, the government transferring the cost from one department to another department. It is very much like what it is doing to A TSIC at the moment. It is going to transfer $50 million of health funding out of the A TSI C budget back into the health budget. It is somewhat confusing to determine the government position on this issue, because government members have contrary views. The Minister for Human Services and Health says that this bill will help those who want private cover to stay in the system, but where in the bill does it say that it is going to help people stay in the system and is going to encourage people to join the system? The minister says that the bill will make private cover more competitive, and the legislation then goes about ensuring that there will be an increase in administration costs. Therefore, the funds will have to either reduce services or increase premiums to pay for those extra costs. Surely anyone with some basic knowledge of business principles realises that if you increase expenditure prices will increase. If tney do not, then services will be reduced. Ther-fore, in my view, increases to premiums decision but it are imminent. I remind the Minister for Human Services and Health of the caucus discussion paper, which she appears not to have read-along with a lot of other things. On page 21, table 2 shows the reasons for cover lapsing. It shows that 61 per cent of people find that the premium is too expensive and they cannot afford it. Yet this .bill, through what the minister says are reduced premiums, is supposed to encourage people to join health funds. How can the government reduce premiums when it is increasing costs? It is beyond me. The reason stated for people leaving private cover is an overwhelming response that premiums are too expensive and the customers cannot afford them. The minister acts contrary to her own caucus and, through the introduction of this particular bill, is prepared to increase the cost of joining a health fund Let us just recap for a moment. The minister is introducing this bill to reduce the flow of people from private funds. She says the legislation will allow the private funds to be . more competitive, provide wider choice and be more efficient. She also admits to a $65 million additional impact on taxpayers for everyone per cent leaving the funds. The industry says $100 million, but she admits to $65 million. The minister also concedes the importance of private funds to the national health system. Her caucus committee supports the opposite position: the notion that taxes should be increased to offset the loss of private funding to cover the $65 million. Caucus also recommends that doctors, hospitals and health funds not contract with one another. I think that was recommendation 14. Yet this bill encourages doctors, health funds and hospitals to contract with one another. The minister thinks that this contractual process is the cornerstone of the legislation, but it is contrary to the caucus view in recommendation 14. What is going on? Has the minister not listened to her own caucus committee, which according to the committee chairman went all over Australia listening to points of view? She obviously has not read the recommendations or listened to her caucus. The minister believes this bill will improve competition and, by implication, reduce costs. With the administration costs likely to increase, the only way that competition will be effective and costs reduced is through amalgamation. By implication the minister supports the notion that amalgamations are very good. Yet, again, her caucus has recommended that funds not amalgamate. She has gone contrary to what caucus has recommended. It is obvious that the minister over her portfolio. We must remember that the Labor Party has not handled this issue at all well over the last few years. In fact, four ministers have administered this portfolio over the last four years. This minister joined this parliament very recently and was shoehorned into her ministerial position, overriding a lot of talented people already in the party. She jumped in, with not much experience, over people with a lot of experience and a lot of talent in her own party. She really does not understand her portfolio. She abuses the President of the AMA, who has been a member of the Labor Party for 20 years. She does not answer letters to her office, and we have evidence of her not answering questions on notice. This minister is out of control and does not understand her portfolio. This bill is further evidence of her lack of ministerial ability, which is much less than that of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table. To confirm further how this minister has got it wrong, let us reflect on the former Labor health minister's comments about health and the requirement for a healthy private health fund sector. Former Senator Richardson is quoted as saying: I think my ... role is to administer Medicare, and that means public access in public hospitals. That has to be the thrust of all that I do, but you can't do it properly unless there's a vibrant private sector and I think that's what has been missed over the course of the last few years ... That could be a comment relating to the last few months. One reason why those waiting lists are long and why it is so difficult is that we have let private health insurance numbers get too low-it is about 37 per cent at the moment. I think former Senator Richardson recommended 40 per cent. He continued: ... the drift into the public system, which we've heralded as such a great system, has I think gotten to the stage now where we can't take it any more. The former minister said, 'We can't take it anymore.' Yet the caucus committee chair, the member for Moreton, has said that we can take more. It is all part of his paper. They do not seem to be working together in the same has no control direction. The current minister says, 'Yes, it is a problem but we don't need to panic. Let us try some legislation and hopefully we'll attract numbers back into the funds.' We can take that a bit cynically, I think. In his report the member for Moreton states that the reason for people opting out is the cost of premiums-by far the biggest reason for leaving. Yet this legislation will increase premiums. Does this bill try to address this particular issue? No, it does not. According to the experts, premiums will increase. Richo, as he is now known, wrote in the Bulletin on 13 September 1994: Convincing the Labor Party that the rapid decline in the number of Australians who take out private health insurance is any sort of problem is a very difficult task. Contemplating any change to the arrangements for Medicare can be downright hazardous for an ambitious health minister. The final unveiling of Carmen Lawrence's new reforms for private health insurance provided a predictable outcome ... they also stop short of addressing the problem. The former minister says that they stop short of addressing the problem. He continues: Labor health ministers are not allowed to believe that the decline in private health insurance ... anything other than a vote of confidence Medicare. They are also not allowed to believe that the public hospital system will ever find unable to cope with the influx of formerly insured citizens, which one day will create one hell of a problem. Having identified the great ideological lems the Labor Party has in addressing real life issues, Richo continued: The dropouts from private health mostly younger and healthier people. They present no problem now because, apart from the incidents of trauma, they are unlikely to heed the services of public hospitals. Eventually, of course, they will age, get sick more often and the nation will face a very serious problem. That is totally at odds with the remarks of Labor speakers in this debate. I ask my socialist colleagues from the Australian Labor Party to recall the words of Dr Blewett, the then Minister for Health who is the father of the current Medicare system, when he introduced the program to the House. Yesterday the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) quoted the words of Dr Blewett in his last speech where he said: ... any decent health economist will tell you that the levels of private insurance,are a third or order subject The central issue for the health system is the working of the public hospital system. In his speech when introducing Medicare in the House in 1983-and I quote from the very good speech of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) yesterday-Dr Blewett said: Medicare's continued success and high popularity is dependent upon the maintenance of a strong, viable private health care sector. That is contrary to what Dr Blewett felt 10 years later. I am at a loss to understand where the Labor Party stands on this very important social issue. Those opposite have quoted contrary to one another. It seems as though no-one knows exactly what is going on. Let us look at some of the facts. The Australian' Labor Party government raises less than 10 per cent of the total health bill through the Medicare levy that every taxpayer pays-$2.4 billion as compared with $34 billion. Add the tax levy to the $12.8 billion from general revenue and is we have over one-quarter of the total income in tax take going to health. The numbers of private health insurance users have reduced by itself half since Labor took office in 1983-from 68 per cent to 37 per cent. Last year, 335,000 Australians had left the system. We must remember that there is an increase in probtaxpayers' funds of $65 million for every reduction of one per cent in the number of members of health funds; industry puts the insurance are figure at $100 million. Australians are being forced to leave health care because they pay three times: they pay the Medicare levy and other taxes; they pay their subscriptions to the funds; and they pay the gap when they use health services. The recurrent funding for hospitals has reduced almost six per cent over the period from 1983 to 1991. There are a lot of problems within the health system. There is general consensus on both sides of parliament that we need to fix it. How we do it is obviously ideologically driven. The government waxes lyrical about its achievements in health, yet why do most people believe that we have a problem? The fourth government fails to provide solutions to the core issues. The minister has admitted that there is a problem, and that is why she is introducing this legislation. Why does the minister ignore the advice of her own caucus report? Why does she ignore the advice of the former minister? She has got it wrong. Consumers need only ask themselves whether they would be happy to have their cars serviced by the person recommended by the insurer. In other words, consumers cannot have a choice if the insurer says, 'Get that person to service your car.' Why do we accept that notion with our own bodies and our own health? As a result of this legislation the private health funds will be able to say, 'You can't go there, but you can go over there.' This is exactly what the minister would have us do. There is no true reform in this bill. We heard the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) criticise the American system. This legislation is heading us down the American track. There will be new costs associated with this legislation, thus defeating the purpose of the bill. Mr Duncan-Why do you hate Medicare?",26
42,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,The coalition supports Medicare. We support universal bulk-billing. The coalition has no plans for a differential Medicare rebate. Those matters were mentioned by the shadow minister for health a couple of weeks ago. This bill does nothing other than introduce further complex health legislation. It is my intention to support the amendment.,30
43,Ms DEAHM,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"It is nice to have you there, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I was hoping that the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) would be there so that I could welcome him. I do that in his absence. It is good to see one of the class of 1993 reaching this elevated position. It gives me great pleasure to speak on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 because health is one of the major issues concerning the community and the government. It is something that affects us all. At some stage we all need to take advantage of health services. It is something which is central and core to federal, state and local governments, and it is imperative that we get the system right. Unfortunately, because of the complexity of our health system, as with every other health system, there is a lot of confusion about how it works. I am sure all members have had people ringing up and criticising one system or the other but not actually getting their right. I had a woman ring me and .say, 'I don't like Medicare; I like the private system.' She was not talking about Medicare.but the public health system. (Quorum formed) I do not think I said anything terribly controversial before the quorum was formedobviously the ploy of the opposition today-I was simply talking about the confusion that often reigns over the way the public and private health systems work. As I was saying, a constituent of mine rang me recently to complain about Medicare because she had had to wait a long time to get into a public hospital. I had to explain to her that it was not Medicare that was at fault; it was the New South Wales public health system. One of the confusions in the communitythis is certainly one of the things that those of us on the working group identified-is over the difference between delivery and funding. These are two different things. I am glad that the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), in his speech, talked about the public insurance system and referred to Medicare in that funding vein. One of the things that is incumbent on us-it is certainly one of the things that the working group identified-is the need to provide better information. I am glad to have heard the last speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who, having been provoked by my one of my colleagues, admitted that Medicare is a good system and that the opposition supports bulk-billing. This is certainly backed up by over 80 per cent of the Australian community. It has taken the opposition a long time to come to that conclusion. As we all know, in Fightback the opposition wanted to develop a two-tier system. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), in his speech, called Medicare a 'safety net' . That certainly gives away the philosophy of a lot of people in the opposition on Medicare. It is not a safety net, it is a universal health system for all . .In the Fightback proposal, where people on higher incomes would be forced into taking out private health insurance, the idea was that Medicare would be left to look after thdowly paid and those on facts social security benefits, thus developing a two-tier system.",30
44,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will resume her seat while I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan) to standing order 57. I commend it to his study.,30
45,Ms DEAHM,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I am getting some good exercise bobbing up and down. The two-tier system operates in America. The previous speaker accuses this side of the House of trying to develop an American system, yet it is precisely what the Fightback system would have done. Those on low pay and social security would be covered and the rest would have to fend for themselves. As we know, prior to Medibank-Medicare, there were many people who did not take out private insurance. They thought they would be okay or did not realise they had to be covered and found themselves in an awful mess when they had huge bills to pay. So I am glad the opposition has embraced Medicare. There is talk about wanting to force people on high incomes into private health insurance, but the reality is that most people on high incomes already have private health insurance or simply pay for private care when they need it. I know a lot of people who do that. They say, 'Why should I pay huge amounts every month to private health insurance when that amount could be put in the bank and could pay for the private hospital or the private doctor when I need it?' So that idea is a bit of a fallacy. Having private health insurance is a choice in our universal system. Why do people take out private health insurance? They take it out because they would like a private room, a private hospital in a particular area or their so-called doctor of choice. The previous speaker also talked about being able to choose our own plumbers but we cannot choose our own doctors, but the idea of having the doctor of choice is a bit of a fallacy. We choose our own GP, but who do we go to when we want an operation? We generally go to the surgeon that the GP recommends. When we get to talking about financial quotes for doctors, we will have even more choice in the system. A patient will be able to go back to the local doctor and say, 'This bloke is going to charge too much,' and will ask to be referred to someone else. People also join health insurance because waiting lists. Waiting lists are a genuine problem but they are not a problem of Medicare; they are a problem of the public health system operated by the states. People who are likely to want elective surgery-and hip replacements are a big issue, particularly amongst older people-are afraid that they will have to wait a long time; and they will. That is the reason a lot of pensioners remain on private health insurance. There are some doctors who operate only in the private system. This applies to a lot of orthopaedic surgeons, which is one of the reasons for the long waiting lists for hip replacements. The previous speaker also referred to one of the reasons people drop out of private health insurance-the high cost of premiums. In a recession, obviously people who are unemployed are not going to be able to keep up their premiums. Several of the health economists showed the working group graphs which indicated that in times of high unemployment people drop out and they come back when they resume work. The other reason people drop out is the huge gap payments they have to make. This legislation goes a long way towards addressing that, a point I am sorry the opposition has not seen fit to see. The young and healthy also drop out. One of the people giving evidence to the working group made the comment that if waiting lists could be fixed up a lot more people would drop out of private health insurance. Contrasting public and private health costs is interesting. I would like to quote from evidence given to the working group by Christine, aged in her 30s. She said: Both my girlfriend and I had identical surgery procedure but because she was under the Medicare scheme, her husband had one form to sign and there was no cost whatsoever for her stay in hospital. After paying close to 50 dollars per month for top hospital cover with my private fund, it took my husband nearly 45 minutes to fill out the barrage of forms. It cost me, after I had to run around and settle each individual account and everything was reimbursed an additional 127 dollars for the privilege of still sharing the same room, not having my choice of doctor as my surgery was an emergency and I had the same hospital staff and care as my girlfriend had. of Of course, the gap that Christine had to pay is sometimes much greater. I am sure that most members here have had a lot of people coming into their electoral offices in great distress when they have bills worth thousands of dollars to pay after their health insurance is settled. Is there a crisis? The last member quotedand I must say a couple of times misquotedthe former Senator Richardson on whether or not there was a crisis. All the evidence we have seen shows that there is not a crisis but that the occupation of private hospitals is high and is growing. There are no empty beds there any more than there are in the public sector. They are being fully utilised, either by people with private health insurance or people who are willing to pay themselves. It is. in the interests of the states, which operate the public hospital system, to say that there is a crisis. The health minister in New South Wales, Ron Phillips, in the lead-up to a state election is pushing this bandwagon very strongly. In the Herald yesterday he was complaining. The federal government gave New South Wales an extra $180 million last year because it complained that it was not getting enough, that things were tough. Yet what has happened in New South Wales? We have bed and hospital closures and a lot of cutbacks in the hospital system. . I have had very close personal experience of that in the last couple of weeks because my senior electoral officer is in hospital at the moment. She was taken in the Sunday before last for investigation for a problem. She has had a vast number of tests. After about eight or nine days it was found what was wrong with her. I maintain that if there were more staff at the hospital this would have been found a lot quicker.",30
46,The X,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"ray and pathology services at this hospital close over the weekend, so the blood tests she had on Friday did not come back until Monday. It has cost her another two days to be in hospital during that time. She is unable to eat or drink and she has been on a drip. The drip was blocked for four hours the other day and the nurse said, 'I am sorry, there are higher priorities.' It is not the nurse's fault. The nurse is highly qualified and she is doing her job. There simply are not enough nurses. The New South Wales hospital system will be on trial on 25 March. I think the people of New South Wales will agree that it has been found wanting. I will come to the substance of the bill. One of the first things the bill will do is make health insurance a bit more consumer friendly. One of the ways it will do that is by providing better information. I would again like to quote a case study which was presented to the working party. It states: Lisa had been a member of a private health fund for several years. When she found out that she was pregnant, she went to see the staff at the insurance office about changing her policy from 'single' to 'family'. She was advised to wait until five to six months into her pregnancy before changing her policy. Her son was born nine weeks early and taken to a special care nursery. The day after he was born, a nurse told Lisa that her son was not covered under the family cover of her private health insurance and that he had to be transferred to a publk facility. Lisa was too stressed and too weary from drugs to take any action at that stage. Nine days later her son died. Two months after the burial she went to her health fund to claim for a share of the funeral costs, which were about 750 dollars. She was very disappointed and distressed to hear that she was not eligible for any reimbursement. She feels that she tried to do the right thing-she inquired about cover as soon as she knew that she was pregnant and was never advised that if born prematurely the child would not be covered by her policy. She Wrote to the claims manager and after six months(!) she received a small amount of an ex gratia payment-not ""because I was entitled to it as the manager said, but because he felt sorry for us. That made me feel even worse."" That is fairly typical of a lot of the insurance companies, particularly the larger ones. I have a small fund in my area that I think is very consumer friendly, but a lot of them do not provide the right information. The bill will also provide a private patient's hospital charter, which is fundamental. People need to know what their rights and entitlements are. I think this is extremely important. It will also include an independent complaints mechanism. Where do people complain to? We now have complaints mechanisms, ombudsmen and whatever in almost every field, and we have certainly long needed one in the private health insurance area. The bill will also provide better value for money in dealing with episodes in hospital. Under the system where contracts will be engaged with hospitals for particular treatments and for the criteria of quality of care, people will hopefully be fully covered. If they are not fully covered, they will know how much they are going to be out of pocket. If the particular case is going to be variable, at least they will know that. They will go in knowing what it is going to cost, if anything. Contracts with doctors will also be entered into and they can, if necessary, be above the medical benefits schedule. The medical benefits schedule is being reviewed and there may be changes to that. One of the problems is that most, but not all, doctors charge above the medical benefits schedule; some charge an enormous amount above the medical benefits schedule. So that will also help. Informed financial consent is another issue. It will be voluntary for doctors, but the AMA has indicated that it will work on this issue. A doctor will give a quote. The. previous speaker talked about being able to choose your own plumber. Would you get plumbing done in your house without getting a quote? No. You would not get a carpenter to do some work without a quote. You would not get your house rewired without a quote. So why the hell would you go into hospital and have a major operation and not know what it is going to cost? It amazes me. We have believed for too long that doctors are some kind of god, that they know best and we must do what they say-and we do not even know what we will have to pay, if anything. This is an enormous step forward, as is the aggregate bill which will then give the person that comes out of hospital-(Quorum formed) (Time expired).",32
47,Mr TUCKEY,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"O'Connor) (11. 30 a.m.)Before commencing my address on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill, I will comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deabm) who, in the typical form of this government, always blames somebody else. We are well aware of the government placing the blame on history. I am just waiting for the day when Billy Hughes gets a serve for something he did when he was a Liberal. All we hear about from those opposite is history. Everything is either the fault of history, foreigners or something else, but never the fault of their administration. Suddenly we find that literally tens of thousands of elderly Australians cannot get elective surgery. That might sound pretty simple. To some people elective surgery might mean a facelift or something, but elective surgery can still remove grave pain and suffering. Anyone who knows people with hip joint arthritis or, more importantly, blindness through cataracts knows how important so-called elective surgery is to those people. I remember a letter I received when I was shadow minister for health from a woman who said, 'I have been compelled to remain in darkness for another 18 months because there are no beds for me in Western Australia so that I can have my cataracts treated.' That is an outrageous circumstance, but those circumstances do occur. The government is suggesting that this is the fault of the state system. In other words, year after year the Commonwealth is entitled to reduce funding to state governments but is entitled to demand, in the area where it has taken unto itself the responsibility, that those governments maintain a gold plated service. How would they do that? Quite obviously they could do it by taking money away from education, police services or one of their other areas of responsibility. The other day we had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) here boasting about how the Commonwealth's total outlays have been reduced as a percentage of GDP when we know that Commonwealth owned purpose outlays have continued to grow as a percentage of GDP. That result has been achieved by starving state governments of the funding that they were traditionally given. The argument of the honourable member for Macquarie has just no foundation at all. The argument went further. We were told about the states getting all this extra road funding because the government put $350 million into general purpose funding. But the budget tells us clearly that the government also reduced overall outlays to the states by the exact equivalent amount-$350 million. Yet the honourable member for Macquarie said that it is all the fault of the New South Wales state government. We will find out how Mr Carr will deal with it should he ever achieve government. Let me now address the legislation. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in her second reading speech drew attention to the fact that Medicare has the support of 87 per cent of the community. That is not surprising when one looks at the questions that were asked. One question was, 'Do you like Medicare?' It is something for nothing so of course people like Medicare. But they have never been asked whether they would prefer certain other options, so that makes a farce of that particular claim which is so oft repeated. People were asked in a motherhood situation whether they liked it. Another thing people were. not told at the time was what the true value of the Medicare levy is. We have been told that it is 1.4 per cent and that it does not apply to certain low income groups, but if we take the budget outlays figure on health-this is not exactly accurate as it is very difficult to get the exact figure to make the point so I am prepared to discount it somewhat---of $17.2 billion, and divide it by the total of personal income tax, which is $54.4 billion, that makes the Medicare levy 31 per cent of personal income, which the Medicare levy is only applied to. Let us discount that down to 25 per cent. It is a far cry from 1.4 per cent. That is a point well worth understanding in the community. We have a hugely expensive operation. It is totally ridiculous to make these international comparisons of percentages of GDP, because systems vary around the world. How do we achieve that percentage of GDP? By rationing services. Medical equipment is still prohibited from being imported into this country because of the government's fear of what it might cost the community if it were available. The minister refers to private health insurance as a supplement to the public health system. It is some supplement when you are waiting for a cataract operation or a hip replacement. Private health insurance would be better described as the only guarantee available to Australia's elderly for the relief of pain and suffering. That guarantee does not exist under the Medicare system if you just happen to have your suffering defined as elective surgery. What is more, it is a right that is getting further and further from the reach of elderly Australians every year that Medicare exists. That is what the government is now trying to address, but it has failed to do so with these minor, peripheral amendments. Let us look at the history of federal government expenditure on health during the life of Medicare. In 1982-83 the Australian parliament authorised the expenditure of $3,399 million on health; $3,702 million on education; and $4,701 million on defence. Defence got a bit over a billion more than health. Education-something that most people would consider of grave importance to the youth of Australia, the people who must pay off the accumulated debts of the Keating government-also got substantially more than health, some $300 million. What are these figures today? If we look at the budget outlays we find that defence gets $9.6 billion; education gets $10 billion; and health gets $17.276 billion. So between 1982-83 and now expenditure on health has almost become equal to the sum of the expenditJ.lre in the other two areas. Who has paid for that? To a degree it has been the taxpayer, as I point out, with that massive levy. If we accept that the present levels of taxation are reasonable, the consumers of education have lost and the defence of our country has lost, in relative terms, to the voracious, uncontrolled appetite of the Medicare system. That is the reality of it all. What is more, when we look at the government's own projections for 1997-98, we suddenly find defence getting $10 billion, education getting nearly $11 billion, and health getting $20 billion. In 12 or 14 years health expenditure will have achieved a doubling in relative terms-not just in outlays. If we want an added shocker to thatremembering that defence and education will get about $10 billion each-we might also like to look at public debt interest, which will also be about $10 billion. We can only speculate on what that is robbing from our education system, our infrastructure, our road systems, et cetera. The reality of the system is that the other areas of our outlays are being robbed right and left by the voracious appetite of this health system. Everybody knows that, but it has to be looked at in the context that the government set out deliberately to do this. well remember when the then minister Blewett ran around this place saying, 'Give me two terms of office with Medicare and will wipe out. the private health system.' Many of the things that we are trying to address today with regard to private health were deliberately put into the system accelerate that activity. The government is now desperately concerned about what is starting to occur. I want to refer to the comments of one of the world's leading health administrators who, when I was shadow minister for health, was the keynote speaker at a conference in Sydcontributors ney. I got a copy of her speech and I can produce it to anyone who doubts the followcash ing remarks. During that address she said, 'We have 50,000 people on the waiting lists for public hospital admission in New Zealand. Waiting lists are the means by which we ration public hospital services.' She made no bones about that being the way to control cost. You just do not let people into hospital. You do not let the most modern equipment come into your country. She went on to complain about the adminissituation. tration of the lists, pointing out that certain people who were in the know-who were ministers of the Crown, senior public servants or who knew somebody who knew someIn the body-were able to queue jump, and we have seen that happen in this very city. She was very critical of that. A fundamental of sort of health policy is that, if you are Prime Minister, you do not need private lutely health care because you are going to get very best from the public system, whether you ask for it or not. I have spoken to a former member of this place who once broke off in China and was taken to Mao TseTung's private dental clinic. He said that had never seen anything so elaborate in his life, but one could imagine how the peasants were getting treated for their dental problems out in the villages. Let us get down to the fundamentals of this problem. The government and, might I say, the opposition support the concept of community rating on the morally correct principle that the healthy, which you could read as 'the I young', should pay for the sick, which you Dr could read as 'the elderly'. Whilst I understand and support this princiI ple, I am also aware of the practical result when you combine the following principles. The first principle is a compulsory government scheme called Medicare, which is an to excellent response mechanism to urgent medical conditions which principally afflict the young in any relative sense. The second principle is a private health scheme. It is severely restricted in its activities and ability to properly reimburse its contributors. I have already mentioned that the law prevents those from making certain payments. The scheme forces the young and old to make contributions for medical services over and above their premium and Medicare levy, whilst those entering hospital under Medicare make absolutely no extra payments. The honourable member for Macquarie gave us an example of that earlier. The third principle is the a common premium system that gives no incentive to those who join early nor puts any premium upon those who join late and where no apparent incentive is provided by government through, say, tax relief to equalise this The net result is a massive defection of the young and healthy from private health cover. current situation of high interest rates and job insecurity, people are confronted with a premium cost of approximately $1,500 per this annum and a guarantee that they will pay a mbre when entering hospital and gain absono benefit or penalty if they enter the the private health system when they reach the danger zone of, say, 55 years of age. Clearly, if they have any brains at all, they will abana tooth don private health insurance. The wise, who can afford it, would bank he the premiums to use in their old age, thus further improving their position. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might like to think quickly of what that would mean. If 20-year-olds banked their $1,500 a year and accumulated the interest, they would probably have $100,000 in the bank when they reached the age of 55, and that might be sufficient to fund their own health problems. The silly thing about the current system is that, at that point, they can join a private health company and receive absolutely no penalty for keeping their money while others paid in but did not use the service because they were young. We have no system that allows even for younger families to buy health cover for their old age. There is no system whereby when you are young and healthy you can say, 'Look, I want to pay a premium now of $2,000 or $3,000 a year but I want to be guaranteed private health in my old age at no cost.' We should be addressing those sorts of matters. The tragedy of the present arrangements is that, as the young are departing the system and premiums are escalating because the elderly are putting demands on the system, many elderly people who have paid premiums all their working life are now unable to gain the protection of access to hospitals through private health. They cannot afford it. To the contrary, as the young leave the system in droves with the consequent upward movement on premiums, elderly members who have paid their private health premiums throughout their working lives suddenly find they can no longer afford private health cover. When Medicare was introduced, some 65 per cent of Australians were privately insured and were able to pay public and private hospitals for their services. The balance found no difficulty in gaining access to Australia's extensive public hospital teaching system. As I have said, the minister at the time said that, given two terms of office, he could destroy all that. He succeeded but he has created a disaster for the government because it cannot handle the expense. These measures before the House today demonstrate how foolish that proposal was and how desperate this government is to stem the haemorrhage from private health funds. As I said, the 1983 level of 65 per cent for private health membership has now declined to 36 per cent and is falling per month. This highlights another myth propounded by the government: that the departure of the young from private health did not matter as they would not burden the public health system because they would not get sick very often. Such a claim is only partially correct because the young, particularly those of child-bearing age, put a substantial pressure on health costs. The real problem for public health is that, as the young defect, the elderly are being forced out. Those elderly people represent a massive cost to and demand on public health facilities as they get forced out of private health because they are unable to afford private insurance as a result of the reduced contribution of the young. None of the measures put forward today address these fundamental problems and, at best, fiddle at the margins. What do they offer? Private health funds may at this point enter preferred provider deals with hospitals, presumably so as to remove any additional charges flowing to members. It is frequent when we go to hospital-as I have done on occasions-to have no hospital bill if privately insured but a doctor's bill. That is in common use today. So the centrepiece of this measure is to formalise something that has been happening for a long time. It raises some questions as to how private funds will deal with those hospitals that do not sign up or that are not asked to sign up. The implementation of casemix, best defined as a fixed charge per episode of care, whilst not wrong in principle, ignores the age and condition of patients seeking such care. Basically, it requires the contracting hospital to process all patients at a fixed price, presumably within a fixed time and with deferred services. I wish it were so simple. Put simply, this aspect of private fund dealing will have a minimal effect on fund outlays and will not stem the flow of private health defections by younger Australians. Put further: anything less than a halving of private health premiums to the young will not be a sufficient incentive. Neither patient nor the market will benefit from these types of deals - and they should be subject to separate policy structures. Basically, the minister says that this will occur. That allows an opportunity to have HMOs. I do not criticise that option, but I think it was available to private funds previously. I support the point made by the member for Macquarie that people should get a quote on their medical services. That is entirely appropriate. From my experience, it is something that many surgeons and doctors do today. They do it for their own protection so that they do not have disputes at the end of the day. I think that is quite appropriate but I wonder at the extent to which we had to make it compulsory. Either way, there is no real problem. Another problem which is not addressed-a matter which we got a shellacking for at the last election and which Minister Howe tried to address with his co-payments-is that of free access to GP services. That has skewed health expenditures for first visits to medical practitioners and away from hospital services. I hold a simple view that there are many-but not all-Australians who can afford the price of a visit to a GP but not the huge costs associated with hospital treatment. Yet all of the process of Medicare as we know it today is skewing money to GPs because it is free. It is a foolish concept that would be better addressed in the context of the needs of individual people, to free up money for the hospital system where all the problems lie. (Time expired)",33
48,Mrs CROSIO,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (11.50 a.m.)-I rise in support of the Health Legislation (private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill and related bill because I sincerely believe that this House has before it a major bill which deals with one of the most important issues facing any government-that is, the health of all of our constituents; in other words, the health of all Australians. If the opposition's antics this morning in calling quorums on government speakers were not so ridiculous, we would all sit down and laugh at them. But in such important legislation, opposition members are trying to waste the time of the speakers in this House who wish to pursue the benefits of this bill and that is whyMr Truss- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",37
49,Mrs CROSIO,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Obviously, the quorum has to be called because it must be my turn. Mr Truss- Mr Deputy Speaker, with that provocation, I must draw your attention to the state of the House. (Quorum formed)",37
50,Mrs CROSIO,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"As I said, I find it absolutely ridiculous that the opposition will not allow government speakers on this very important legislation without repeatedly puerile calls for quorums in this House. Opposition members cannot understand and appreciate the fact that even we on this side do not deny that Medicare, perhaps, is facing some challenges. But one of the things isand it is not my personal opinion; it is statistics that prove it-that 70 per cent of Australia's population support Medicare. That is not my figure. This figure is even more impressive when we compare it with overseas findings. One survey has shown that 56 per cent of Canadians believe their health system works well. Only 10 per cent of Americans believe the same of their health system, and the economic figures speak for themselves. Medicare covers 100 per cent of the Australian population for a cost of 8.6 per cent of our gross domestic product. The US health system covers nowhere near the same percentage of population, yet at the moment the US is spending 13.4 per cent of its GDP. Dr Peter Botsman has estimated that, if the United States had adopted a similar system to Australia's, it would have saved $4 trillion between 1992 and the year 2000. Canada, Finland and France all spend more on health care than Australia does, at less efficient rates of return. But this does not mean that Medicare cannot or should not be adjusted to suit changing circumstances. This bill deals with the decline in private insurance in a way which has drawn praise from the Australian Health Insurance Association and from the community generally. When Medicare was introduced some 11 years ago, it was intended that not less than 40 per cent of the Australian population would be covered by private health insurance. Up until recently, this has been the case. In 1993, for the very first time we saw the proportion of Australians covered by private insurance fall below 40 per cent. This is not a catastrophe of proportions at the moment, as the majority of those who have dropped out of private insurance are young and healthy and have little call on our health system. But, as those who are not in private insurance begin to call on our health resources, it could become a pressing problem. It is the government's right to take action now. Both sides of politics recognise the imperaand tive of moving now to arrest the slide in the proportion of people covered by health insurance, but we disagree quite markedly on the method that should be used to do this. Before talking to the provisions of the bill in some detail, I think it would be worthwhile to provide some background to these issues by examining what the coalition proposes to do to fix the problem-although this will not be easy, as getting past the opposition's cliches to the substance of its policy has been a massive task since 1993. At the last election-you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, would have to acknowledge this-the coalition promised to promote private health insurance by issuing credits to families with i--omes below $30,000 which took out private insurance and tax penalties for families with incomes above $30,000 which chose not to take out private insurance. The coalition was also going to allow gap insurance. So the Liberal Party-the party of free enterprise, the party which falls over itself to pay homage to the markets-was going to subsidise a private industry with massive amounts of taxpayers' money, with no requirement for the insurers to provide improved services or greater efficiency. It would also have added to inflation and blown out the cost of private health insurance by allowing unfettered gap insurance-removing all constraints of price from the market and letting costs run wild. There is presently confusion in the opposition ranks about whether. this is still the policy. The former shadow minister for health says it is not. The shadow parliamentary secretary, who many state has really been the brains of the outfit, says that it does remain policy. Yet all of this has contributed to the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs major Bishop) becoming the most spectacularly unsuccessful shadow minister since Peter Shack. Enough of the foibles of the opposition. I would like to now turn in some detail to the provisions of the bill. This bill before the House will encourage individuals to take out private health insurance by allowing insurers to get a better deal for clients from doctors hospitals. Under the present arrangements the funds pay the hospital amounts determined by the Commonwealth. The reform of this system will allow the funds, with their huge bargaining powers, to shop around for the most efficient services for their clients. If a hospital knows that it will have to reduce its prices to win the business of a major health fund, then the prices will come down as a matter of course. Naturally, all of the present safeguards will remain, and regulatory authorities will ensure appropriate standards in our hospitals. This will also introduce genuine competition between health insurers. At the moment, insurers can offer little substance to differentiate their product from that of any other insurer. Competition has degenerated into a contest over which insurer can come up with the catchiest jingle. The reforms Â·proposed in this bill will allow consumers to choose the funds which can get them the best deal in hospital. I believe this will be of huge benefit to health insurers in attracting potential members. The Access Economics report to the AMA of December 1993 states: The lack of competition within the health insurance industry has an important bearing on cost performance ... hope for .the industry would appear to lie in deregulation and opening it up to competition. This proposal has gained the approval of Mr Russell Schneider, the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, who has written: The reforms will make health insurance more effective-and, in my view, more attractive-by changing the role of the health insurer from that of a passive player to an active buyer of health services. In a related move, it is proposed in this bill that health benefits organisations will be able to enter into agreements with medical practitioners for the provision of professional services in hospital which may eliminate outof-pocket expenses or allow the patient to meet a predetermined amount. The discussion paper on the reform of private health insurance issued by the government in December 1993 identified the out-ofpocket expenses that people have to cover when they receive hospital care as the most important cause of the decline in private health insurance. Having to cover these significant costs has led people to believe, with some justification, that private health insurance does not represent value for money. In fact, the discussion paper found that the only more important reason for the decline in the proportion of people with private insurance is the economic pressure caused by increasing premiums. It is obvious that this reform will do much to enable health benefits organisations to make themselves more attractive to potential customers. Another very positive reform contained in this bill is the replacement of benefits which are paid on a per diem basis with payments which cover the total period of patient care. In other words, a person will receive just one bill after a hospital visit. Under existing arrangements, patients could get several bills for one stay in hospital: a bill from each individual doctor involved in the case, bed charges, theatre charges, fees for pathology, and so on. Often those bills trickle in for months after the hospital visit, giving patients unpleasant surprises when they thought the costs were well behind them. Under the new system proposed by the legislation before the House, a patient will know that all expenses have been paid for upon the payment of the initial bill. I am also pleased that, in future, patients will be forewarned of what costs they are likely to face before they enter hospital. In consultation with representatives of the professions, the government will establish a process by which medical professionals will outline to prospective patients what they can expect to pay before they enter hospital. I believe our Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) got it in one when she said in August last year: You don't put your car in for a service without knowing what it's likely to cost. The same should apply for a hospital visit. This reform will put a degree of power back into the hands of the consumer and correct an imbalance which has existed in the market for some time. The proposal to institute an independent Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner will emulate the success of similar ventures in other industries, such as the banking ombudsman. This reform will be accompanied by the development of a private patients hospital charter, which will be written in consultation with the industry. The charter will explain in plain English the rights of private patients and the standard of service that they have a right to expect from their health funds, doctors and hospitals. These reforms will give consumers two mechanisms for dealing with any concerns that they may have about their treatment by the health industry: a document clearly setting out their rights and an independent arbiter who can investigate their concerns. This bill deals with some very complex matters in a very sensible and effective way. I congratulate the Minister for Human Services and Health on the presentation of this bill. It is a bill which will improve the best health system in the world by increasing competition and efficiency. Health care consumers will benefit from the improved services which arise out of heightened competition. They will have reduced costs, a better billing system, a mechanism for knowing how much they will need to pay, and a process for lodging complaints about health treatment within the private health care system. This is the policy that the opposition could never have proposed. The opposition is stuck on the simplistic and hugely expensive tactic of using the tax system to subsidise private insurance-an unsustainable policy attempting to attain an unachievable result; a form of industry protection more widespread than any quota and more insidious than any tariff. This bill, on the other hand, will mean that the private health insurance industry will survive because it will deliver real benefits to its clients. Individuals will have many more reasons for taking out private health insurance. Those individuals, the health care system and the nation will be all the better it. In commending the bill before the House, and certainly speaking in opposition to the amendment, I would like to place on record that, finally, we have something that has the name of the previous spokesperson for health, the honourable member for Mackellar, on it. It is nothing more than a shopping list introduced with the words 'the following assertions of principle are agreed to'. They are not principles that 70 per cent of the Australian public want. They are not principles that those who support Medicare, and have agreed that it is second to none in the world, want. What the people at large want-the people that we represent-is a concise bill that is going to benefit them in the long run, that is going to make sure that freedom and competition is available; but, most particularly, they want also a guarantee to those who have taken out the insurance cost that they will not have other costs to contend with. I believe it is a very succinct bill. It has followed ongoing consultation with the industry at large, and particularly with the insurance companies. It is the most practical way of overcoming the problems that we are starting to see in our health system in Australsupport is. I commend the bill to the House. I congratulate all those who have had a part in it.",37
51,Mrs MOYLAN,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 as shadow spokesperson for women's affairs because women are the biggest users of health care in Australia. This is illustrated by the fact that the average number of Medicare services for each female in Australia is 11.8 per year, whilst for males a comparable figure is 7.7 visits per year. In addition, women generally take the primary role in assisting children, the aged and the chronically ill to access health care. However, this is not just a bill that will disadvantage many women-especially women from the country. This bill will affect all Australians in terms of the delivery of for health care. It is important that the Keating Labor government's cynical attempt to undermine the quality and availability of health care to all Australians be fully exposed. This government must be held accountable to the Australian community for the deceptive manner in which it is seeking to re-engineer the delivery of health care in Australia. Health care under Labor has been driven, in my view, by two factors. The first factor is an ideological desire to control every aspect of every Australian's life; to remove the principle of choice and the principle of self-determination that has long been held dear by all Australians. The second factor is the saving of money or budgetary considerations above the delivery of services that go to affect many people in devastating ways. This government has been cavalier in the way it spends the taxes of the Australian people, flinging money around in cynical exercises to win votes. Yet, in the serious business of the nation's health, its primary consideration is to cut the quality of services to the sick and the vulnerable. This is not to say that sound economic management of the health budget cannot be equated with good doctoring and best practice medical care. I the process of a well-structured and economic reform but not at the expense of the delivery of caring health services. The proposals outlined in these bills do not provide any guarantees or instil confidence that individual Australians can expect to receive better quality, or more timely access to, or more affordable health care. This government will not reduce its own expenditure and is now proposing the introduction of yet another new tax in the form of the private health insurance complaints levy. Perhaps the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) should study the real situation occurring in the states before imposing yet another burden on ordinary people. In a speech in the Victorian parliament on 14 September 1994, the Victorian Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Dr Denis Napthine MLA, stated: Clearly the decline in private health insurance is putting more people on our public hospital demand list, and Victoria is having to deal with that ... The decline in private health insurance is shifting the responsibility of meeting the costs of public hospitals on to state governments and the territories. The health minister is suggesting to ordinary Australians that reforms, such as those proposed today in these bills, and the accompanying new tax levy will lead to cheaper, more affordable health care. We can be thankful that the general public is not as gullible as this government believes. I have discussed these reforms with one of my constituents, a medical practitioner. In fact, I have spoken to a number of medical practitioners in my electorate but this constituent in particular expressed concern at the indecent haste surrounding the parliament's consideration of such an important bill. My constituent's concerns reflect those of many of her professional colleagues: there is too much emphasis on the economic model with scant consideration for the complexities of the human condition in individual health care. Similar concerns have also been expressed by the National Association of Private Hospitals: The legislation has been drafted with an unrealistic time-frame for the introduction of the new arrangements, and minimal consultation with the industry, and we have consistently stated that the legislation should not be rushed through without all of the concerns of the industry being addressed ... A full analysis of Dr Lawrence's proposed measures is restricted because of the limited amount of information that has been distributed on the proposals. No detail available for months after the package was announced in August-that is shabby government. Are we to expect are-run of the current forest debacle as a consequence? Economic models that prescribe a number of specific services, such as 10 hip replacements for a specific hospital, do not account for the medical complications that are attendant on many ailments, particularly in the after-care. I am advised that very rarely is a medical condition an open-and-shut case that can be modelled simply as the purchase of a hip replacement or similar service. The disregard for the sensitivities of those suffering from poor health is a recipe guaranteed to increase the pain, suffering and anxiety of individuals and their families, and that is the hallmark of these bills. When asked at a recent meeting of GPs to comment on this aspect of the government's reforms and about what people would do after the operation for after-care or if they did not like the particular service being offered by the health fund, the minister for health allegedly replied, 'If you're not happy with the hospital chosen by your health fund and the services provided, you can negotiate another arrangement with your insurer.' Is the health minister really serious when she makes this suggestion? Does she really expect people, when confronted with a major medical crisis, to enter into a bargaining process with their private health insurer to ensure that they get their preferred hospital and doctor? Is this the sort of free choice that will encourage more Australians to invest in private health insurance? What negotiating or market power will individual health consumers have at a time of high stress and anxiety associated with their sickness or that of a family member? Private health users will be led by the services on offer from the fund. Under duress, if they are not satisfied with the options provided by the fund, they would have limited recourse. As the reason for purchasing any form of insurance is to gain protection from a specific risk, consumers will question the wisdom of continuing to pay for private health insurance if the premiums do not provide an appropriate response to the risk exposure. That is simple cost-benefit analysis. As the private health insurance industry well knows, consumers react very quickly to price. This is well illustrated in the Australian Bureau of Statistics health insurance survey of June 1992, which found that 67 per cent of those who discontinued their membership did so because they were unable to afford the payments. Basically, Australians opting for private cover would not mind paying more for an improved outcome but they do not deserve to be hoodwinked by this government. It is again worth noting the views of the National Association of Private Hospitals on this bill. It said: ... the proposed reforms would lead to a private healthcare system presently focussed on the s.ion of the highest standards of care for the patients, to one focussed on cost containment and extremely powerful health insurance funds. Once again, big business will be the recipient of the Labor government's policy. The smaller - and, I might say, more often efficientfunds would disappear. In my state a small fund, the Goldfields Medical Fund, has shown great efficiency and innovation, and the ability to offer value for money. It is this style of small private health funds that is threatened with extinction. They are the endangered species. I am concerned for the future of hospitals such as .the Undercliffe Hospital Complex, located In Greenmount in my electorate in Western Australia. It is a classic example of - very good, small, acute private hospital that IS under threat as a consequence of these bills. The arrogant manner in which this government is rushing these bills through the parliament is further proof that it has lost touch with the needs of everyday Australians. Why are the health minister and the government now openly embracing and advocating the adoption of the US system of health delivery that they were so scathing about at the last election? Australians need to be convinced that these reforms will deliver better quality health care for all Australians; reduce hospital waiting lists; enable people to maintain their choice with respect to doctor and hospital; not lead to a deterioration in the provision of total health care services-I emphasise 'total health care services'-not lead to increased post-operative pain and suffering caused by early discharge from hospital for economic rather than healthrelated reasons; ensure that the social basis of Australia's health care system remains a higher priority than economic, profit or political motives; lead to greater efficiencies In the cost of health care and private health insurance; not reduce the quality access and pro-yisions o- th- - ange of health care options aVaIlable to IndIVIduals in remote, rural and less populated areas; provide a service that does not discriminate against smaller, nonprivate hospitals and funds; and provide a safety net provision that ensures all communities .retain - ccess to comprehensive, high provi- qualIty hospItals and health services. The aged, the chronically ill, women and children, members of large families, and young people are vitally concerned that this is not just a case of a smoke and mirrors policy developed by the Keating Labor govern!llent. Does the health minister seriously belIeve that she can swan around this parliament claiming that these reforms are budget neutral while, at the same time, promising lower premiums for private health insurance? Are these promises not mutually exclusive or is the health minister simply acknowledging the fact that there will be no savings at all? The health industry in Australia estimates that, for everyone per cent of the population that opts out of private health cover, government health costs rise by an additional $100 million per year. If health consumers act in an economically rational manner, the lower premiums being promised by the health minister should lead to an increase in the - umber of Australians seeking private health Insurance. Does a one per cent increase in the number of individuals taking out private health insurance not equate to a commensurate $100 million reduction in government health spending? Industry research indicates that private health consumers are sensitive and react very quickly to price. In fact, they have been making that judgment since 1983 when Labor was first elected to federal government. In March 1983, 74 per cent of the population of Australia had private health insurance. In June 1994, this figure has fallen to only 37.2 per cent-a 50 per cent reduction. This is now below the 40 percent figure quoted by the previous health minister, former Senator Richardson, that would be necessary for Medicare to work. Something needs to be done-and quickly. A private health fund's research concluded: . :. members are finding it increasingly more - Ifficult to perceive 'value' in their private health Insurance ... The question that the health minister must answer is why has it taken successive Labor governments since March 1983, 12 years, to acknowledge the crisis occurring in the private health industry and the associated pressures that have been imposed on the public health system? If the health minister is so confident that the reforms contained in these bills will lead to lower private health cover, why is it not reflected in the financial impact statement as a future positive impact on the level of government health expenditure? I challenge the minister to come clean and tell people the exact savings that they can expect in the form of lower private health premiums. How many dollars per year will come off their private health care premiums? As the National Association of Private Hospitals states: Preferred provider arrangements are of concern to healthcareproviders as they will provide the health funds with far greater power, with no guarantee that the decrease in rebates paid by the health funds transfer to decreases in premiums for fund members. If the health minister's economic model can account for the complexities and complications associated with major surgery and preand post-operative care and support requirements, then running up a few calculations to fully inform everyone of the future cost savings should be a piece of cake. It should not be any difficulty at all. I would like to suggest to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the health minister, as a show of confidence in the reforms being proposed, that they instruct their party colleagues to lead by example and immediately rejoin private health schemes as a public expression of confidence in the strength of these reforms. They also have a moral obligation to look after their own health costs so that less fortunate Australians can gain priority access to' scarce hospital beds. It is obvious that the health minister has perfected the art of the con so aptly portrayed by her former state Labor colleague Keith Wilson, who was the Western Australian Labor health minister during the period 1988 to 1992, including most of that period that Dr Lawrence was Premier of Western Australia. In the December 1994 issue of FACTS, a copy of which I have here, the quarterly newsletter of the National Civic Council WA Division, Keith Wilson, the former Labor health minister from Western Australia under the Lawrence government-one of Labor's own-finally exposed the truth of Labor's practiees. His article in this publication, entitled 'The Medicare -'Con""-Ten Years of Deception' laid bare for all to see Labor's health care principles. I think we should share some of Keith Wilson's comments today. In part of this article he said: The artful deception which has become the practised style of the Federal Labor Government is nowhere more evident than the propaganda used to promote the national health system, Medicare. Successive health ministers have been able to blithely push the same propaganda line about the ""success"" of Medicare as a major reason for Labor's election victories since. 1984. The people of Australia have not been in a position will to deliver a true vote on Medicare because they have been kept in the dark, particularly about its cost. Really, isn't that a very nice touch from the former Western Australian Labor health minister, who just happened to be the health minister during the current federal health minister's term as Premier of Western Australia? Do we assume that Keith Wilson was acting as a sole agent in the delivery of Western Australian Labor Party's health policy, or should we accept the more reasonable assumption that his Premier and party colleagues were part of the deception which he refers to? Perhaps this quote from the West Australian of 30 May 1992 will reveal all. It states: Mr Wilson has already attracted criticism from Federal Labor politicians and has had a public slanging match with the Federal Health Minister Brian Howe. Yet Mr Wilson's actions won Dr Lawrence's stamp of approval this week. ""She told the Legislative Assembly that she had enormous admiration for Dr Wilson and paid special tribute to him. We have now reached the point that only the vigorous campaign being conducted by our State Minister for Health will solve the funding problem."" she said. Leopards do not change their spots. Why should Australians believe that the health minister's principles are any different now from what they were during her term as Premier of Western Australia? Will the health minister give a guarantee to all Australians that the cost of administering these reforms will not create another expensive bureaucracy? Can the minister advise how there can be no cost increases to health consumers when industry research indicates that the implementation of the casemix aspect of these reforms alone could cost up to $150,000 per hospital? Will the health minister give a guarantee that the private health insurance complaints levy will not be increased by stealth from the initial level of $1 per member per annum? Will the Private Health Insurance Complaints Tribunal be a totally independent and accountable body, or will it be subject to the health ministerial direction and control? The consideration of these bills has raised too many issues of concern that the health minister has not been able to address in this parliament for us to have the confidence that Labor's deceptive practices referred to by the former health minister in Western Australia, Labor's Keith Wilson, will not continue. The Australian Private Hospitals Association has made comments about and raised serious concerns about the bill. It is evident that the government's focus is on economic models and political expediency. The benefits that are being touted appear to have the financial health of large private health funds and large private hospitals as a higher priority from it? than ensuring quality service, choice and access to hospitals and doctors for all Australthree ians. The bill alsp raises many concerns about the future competitive environment for small niche medical facilities and non-profit hospitals. My colleague the shadow minister, the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), raised the legitimate concerns of the Berwick Hospital in Victoria in her speech, which can be found in Hansard. Australia-wide there are 1,007 acute hospitals with the average number of beds available being 76,420. Private acute hospitals represent 29 per cent, or 294, of the total number of these facilities and 25 per cent, or 19,367, of the average number of beds. The number of private acute hospitals Australia-wide in a similar category to the Berwick Hospital-that is, zero to 50 beds-is 172, or 59 per cent of all private acute hospitals in Australia. These hospitals represent quite a large number of beds. Should they all be forced to operate with the sword of Damocles hanging over them, or would our total health system be that much better off if they could concentrate on the provision of high quality customer orientated and affordable health services? As the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) indicated, this bill needs further consideration and a lot more consulting needs to be done. I support the member for Mackellar's second reading amendment, which will make these bills fairer, more equitable and, importantly, take away some of the minister's powers.",40
52,Mr HAVILAND,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"-I am always delighted to take the opportunity to speak on legislation introduced by this government aimed at further improving our health system. The Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill are no exception. But at the same time we have people from the opposition coming in here trying to tell us how to run a health system. If there is one group of people in Australia with the least amount of credibility to talk about anything, let alone health, it is the opposition. Have we not heard some nonsense in the last day or so It is particularly interesting that the last opposition speakers, and the next speaker, all come from Western Australia-the discredited Western Australian Liberal Party. They were in here yesterday whingeing about tax-these are the people who do not believe in paying any tax. These are the same people from the discredited Western Australian Liberal Party who did not want to elect the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as their leader, because when he was Treasurer he found himself having to make them pay some tax-mind you, fairly belatedly. When I lived in Western Australia. I notice the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) is leaving-and worked in the health system, I remember the Liberal Party's campaign slogans; things like 'Taxation is theft'. They thought it was an affront for Western Australian Liberal business people to have to pay any tax at all. Now they are coming in here and telling us about government policy and how to run a health system. I will say more about that later, but it does seem as though the Western Australian Liberal Party has a particular fixation and obsession with the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). They are all in here at every opportunity trying to get stuck into her for parochial reasons in Western Australia. Let me put on the record that if I were minister for health I would not waste my time with these opposition people, the way they are carrying on. They have no credibility on health, especially on health policy, after their 12 years in opposition. We still have not seen what their policy is, so let us stop this nonsense once and for all. The Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 seek to amend three long standing acts of parliament-the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The bills will give effect to the government's package of reforms to private health insurance in this country. These reforms provide better value for money for consumers of private insurance, greater efficiency and equity of access to private insurance, and a wider choice of cover. Let me say from the outset that I have never been a great supporter of private health insurance or, for that matter, of the private sector generally when it comes to the provision of health services. Health care is one of the most vital of all essential services that Australians have a right to expect governments to provide, regardless of one's economic status. Although it can be argued that ideological labels are of little use or relevance in the 1990s, I make no apology for saying that when it comes to health care and health insurance I am very much a socialist. Yes, that is right-a socialist. This is because I do not believe that it is morally or philosophically appropriate for people's access to quality health care or medical treatment to be subject to the profit motive or market forces. After all, in many cases we are talking about people's lives. Access to health care is a fundamental human right. Nevertheless, I recognise the realities of our current health system and the role that private healthÂ· insurance does play in providing the option of additional cover for those who feel they need it and can afford to pay for it. Medicare is the most equitable and efficient health system Australia has ever had, and it is world renowned as well, as we all know. Introduced by the Hawke government in 1984 as a cornerstone of the prices and incomes accord, Medicare built on the introduction of Medibank by the Whitlam government in 1975. Of course, Medibank was gradually dismantled by the Fraser coalition government between 1976 and 1978. Medicare remains the centrepiece of this government's health policy and enjoys strong community support-stronger than ever, in fact. The latest market survey shows that over 87 per cent of the Australian population supports Medicare. I notice that even the opposition is now claiming to support it, although we can see how sincere it is in its so-called support for Medicare when we look at its record over the last 12 years when it has tried to dismantle and discredit it at every federal election campaign. But now of course opposition members can see the writing on the wall. Eighty-seven per cent speaks for itself, so the opposition now says, anyway, that it supports Medicare. Medicare provides a universal, accessible, equitable and high quality public health system for all Australians, notwithstanding the all problems sometimes experienced in various hospital systems, which I might point out are of course run by state governments. Of all the great social justice reforms introduced by this federal Labor government since 1983, none has been more important nor stood the test of time better than Medicare. The corollary to that is that in no area of policy has the opposition lacked credibility more than it does in the area of health policy. That does not mean that this government cannot or will not continue to work at making Medicare even better. During the Fraser government years when the current Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, was Treasurer, Australia lurched from one health insurance system to the next. The coalition was determined to destroy Medibank because of its philosophical opposition to a universal, national public health system. But its attempts to replace it with a return to the old subsidised private health insurance system were disastrous. I remember this period quite well, and I can speak with some authority on the period because from 1976 to 1983 I worked in the health insurance industry as a Commonwealth officer with the health department. I was involved in administering the various health insurance systems which were heavily subsidised by the taxpayer although run by private health funds. That period from 1976 to 1983 included, I might say, a lengthy period in the Western Australian office of the health department. I recall that in Western Australia at the time the Hospital Benefits Fund of Western Australia accounted for about 80 per cent of the health insurance market, which gave it almost a monopoly in private health insurance. So much for competition and efficiency in the private health insurance sector. This was also the period-the Fraser years, when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer-when medical fraud and overservicing first reared their ugly heads as a major drain on Commonwealth revenue, as I have discussed on many .occasions in this House. My experience of this period has certainly contributed to my strong philosophical views on health, which I mentioned earlier. Following the introduction of Medicare in 1984, the private health funds ceased to receive government money and gradually ceased to be regulated by the government to the extent they had been previously. Private funds have continued to provide additional hospital cover for their contributors and have diversified into a range of other areas of ancillary cover, such as for dental and chiropractic treatment and other things, as well as non-health insurance products. It is fair to say that this has enabled the private health insurance sector to remain viable and make a useful contribution to the Australian health system. I continue to have ancillary private health cover, albeit with the government owned fund-Medibank Private-for dental and chiropractic services not covered in the Medicare benefits schedule. However, like many other people, I have dropped my private hospital cover. Many workers are still well served by workplace based private funds, such as the Teachers Federation health society and the Reserve Bank health fund, to mention just a couple, which offer cheap premiums for those in the respective industries. As the Minister for Human Services and Health said in her second reading speech, private health insurance offers a chance for those who want it, but it must be seen for what it is-a supplement to the public system, to Medicare. One of the issues which has arisen and which led to the reforms contained in this bill is the fact that membership levels in private health funds have fallen. In many ways this can be attributed to the outstanding success of Medicare. Considering what I have said earlier about my own view, one could be tempted to ask the question: why should we worry about the drop in private health insurance membership? Does it not simply show that Medicare is successful and is doing its job and that people do not need the additional cover? Although that is an attractive argument to some extent, it is fair to say that there are other causes for the drop in the numbers of privately insured which in itself creates some problems, which I will mention later. We are talking mainly here about hospital cover, which is the main area of private insurance. Private insurance can provide access to a private hospital bed, a private room in a public hospital, and the choice of doctor where practicable. While it is true that the drop in the numbers of privately insured people is partly due to the success of Medicare, it is also due to a major anomaly in the current system. This is the fact that, while a Medicare only patient incurs no charge for hospital treatment, a patient receiving the same treatment in the same hospital from the same doctor or specialist can be up for all sorts of out-of-pocket expenses over and above those covered either by Medicare or by their private insurance. I and, I am sure, most honourable members have heard of many cases where patients have undergone surgery, in some cases emergency surgery, and have been left with a bill for over $10,000 for out-of-pocket expenses, simply because they were private patients, that is, members of a private fund, yet their private insurance cover does not extend to these out-ofpocket expenses. So a patient who pays only the Medicare levy pays nothing, yet a patient who pays the Medicare levy plus private health insurance premiums receives a doctor's bill from the specialist surgeon-not all of which is covered by Medicare, as most specialists do not bulk-bill, as we all know-and on top of that a hospital bill for out-of-pocket hospital expenses which are not covered by any private health tables. Regardless of whether you philosophically support private insurance or not, this situation is clearly unfair and has been a contributing factor in the decline in the numbers of the privately insured. I come back to the question of why this decline in itself is a problem. The reality is that, with more people opting for Medicare only cover, this puts a potential and an actual additional strain on the public hospital system leading, in some instances, to excessive waiting lists in public hospitals. Quite properly, emergency surgery takes priority over so called elective surgery in public hospital queues, so we have had much publicity from time to time about long waiting lists for operations which are not considered to be emergencies. While much of the negative publicity about public hospital waiting lists is at best inaccurate and misleading and at worse an exercise in propaganda by surgeons, private health insurance funds, the AMA, conservative state governments, and other opponents of Medicare, the fact remains that there are only so many public beds to go around, while many beds in private hospitals are underutilised. One of the key elements of this bill is the opportunity for contractual agreements between health insurance funds, doctors and hospitals. These contracts will provide for patients to receive a single bill for all components of a hospital episode. This may be covered by private insurance, thus eliminating the problem of uninsured, out-of-pocket expenses. Hospital charges under this process will be based on the casemix model. Levels of cover will vary according to the contracts and the level sought by the consumer, but an important feature is that all costs will be known to the patient in advance. This will remove the inequities of uninsured, out-ofpocket expenses that have contributed to the decline in the number of privately insured people. Privately insured patients will also have or the more flexibility with a greater range of products. These measures should also serve to reduce premiums for private insurance, which has been another factor in declining insurance levels. Private health insurance will now be a more attractive option for those who can afford to pay but who have been turning away from private insurance for the reasons I have outlined. At the same time, this will go some way towards ensuring that Medicare-only patients will have ready access to high quality treatment in public hospitals without the prospect of excessive waiting lists. Other aspects of this bill will provide greater consumer protection, equity of access for consumers and-very importantlygreater administrative efficiency in both the public and private health sectors. The effect of the measures in this bill will be to reduce the overall cost of our health system to government and the community, and to make it more cost effective. We hear a lot from people in the community, the opposition and elsewhere about the cost of Medicare. As I said, Medicare is the most successful system we have had, but it is also true that it is in all our interests to contain the cost both to the revenue and to consumers of our health system. Notwithstanding the success and popularity of Medicare, its cost to the taxpayer is still increasing by up to 10 per cent a year. Most of these increased budgetary outlays end up in the pockets of doctors and private hospitals, through increased utilisation of medical services combined with our fee-for-service system-which, as I have said before, has its own problems-and the anomalies in the system, which this bill seeks to address. The casemix model, which is the basis for the reforms in this bill, will have a positive impact on total health costs,-certainly in the case of hospital treatment-and will not reduce but, in fact, enhance the overall quality of care for all patients. This is very important in the process of not only reform of the health system but micro-economic reform generally, combined with this Labor government's very proud program of social justice. It is very important to link social justice programs with economic efficiency and reform-and access and equity generally-from both a social and an economic point of view. As I said, this is another bill long way towards that. For their part, opposition members can only come out with all this sort of nonsense and rhetoric. They attack the minister. They play the person rather than talk about the issues. Of course, they are incapable of talking about poUcies. They have no policies in the area of health-certainly no federal policies. They have been in opposition for 12 years. As we have already seen, opposition members do not have policies on many things at all but health is one area in which they have even less credibility than they have in other areas. That is why it is so laughable that they come in here and oppose this bill, attack Medicare and the government's record, and try to score points about Medicare. I certainly commend this bill to the House. I look forward to the debate and the implementation of these progressive, well thought out and socially and economic responsible reforms.",44
53,Mr WILLIAMS,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Tangney) (12.44 p.m.)As a member of parliament, one often invites constituents to identify their areas of greatest concern in relation to federal issues. One of the most common concerns relates to health. In the health area, one of the most common responses relates to health insurance. Health insurance is a difficult issue for many people in many different situations, such as the young, the unemployed, the family and, particularly, the elderly. One significant area of concern-one which is promoted by failing government policiesis the trend where people drop private health cover and rely on the public health system. Despite the inadequacies of the public health system and the increasing strains being put upon it, people are prepared to drop their private health cover because they cannot see the point to it. In many cases they cannot see the point because it has anomalies and aspects that they do not understand. It is to be hoped that the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 may have some impact. However, given the doctrinaire and haphazard approach taken over the years by the government to health policy, one cannot be confident that any of the reforms proposed in this bill will solve the problems that will go a of the ordinary people. I will confine my comments on this legislation to. two principal matters-considerations of privacy and the proposed complaints commission. One of the proposed amendments will expand the functions of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. There are two aspects to that. First, the council will be required to collect and disseminate information about private health insurance for the purpose of enabling people to make informed choices about private health insurance. With the deregulation of the financial market, we have seen changes to the health insurance industry in general and health insurance participants in particular. It seems that people have a less than complete understanding of the manner in which insurers operate in the health insurance market nowadays as a result of that deregulation. Once private health fund companies operated effectively only in the discrete area of health insurance; now they cover a range of other activities. The nature of health cover offered is likely to vary considerably from one fund to another in the future. This requires a proper source of information for consumers of private health insurance services on what is available, what will be provided and what will not be covered. The role of the council is potentially very impop:ant; however, it. is also. important that the information provided to the public be in Ii. consumer digestible, form .. It \yould be counterproductive if the present' co-fusion among members oftheimblic as tothenatllre of effective health cover were to be exacerbated by the' statutory function of the .council; The second major function t9. be added to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council is that of the collection of information about patients for research purposes. The sort of data the council will be enabled t6 obtain will be dictated, by the categories of information listed in the hospital casemix protocol. The protocol is yet to be prescribed, so it is not clear how detailed that information will be. It appears that it will relate to the detail of the medical services and the treatment provided to the individual patient. Where will the council obtain' this data? The bill requires registered health funds to submit data in accordance with the categories listed on the hospital.casemix. protocol. The funds are to submit the data to the Secretary to the Department of Human Services and Health and to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council within 28 days .,of the end of the month to which that data relates. The secretary will have discretion. to agree to a longer time period for th,- provision of data if that is sought. In &ddition, the bill a hospital to provide informatic:m of the type specified in the hospital casemix protocol to the health fund with which that hospital has entered into a purchaser-provider agreement. There is provision in the bill for the secretary to the department to agree that the hospital does not have to provide all such information. The bill provides that the data will be used by the department and the council for the purposes of 'modelling, evaluation and research'. There is no definition of these terms in the bill. We are not told what 'modelling, evaluation and research' will entail. Nor are there any details of the measures that will be taken, if any, to protect the privacy of individual patients. The Australian Medical Association has expressed its concerns to the coalition about patients' right to privacy. The government has not consulted with the' AMA about the information which will be provided to the department and the council. The doctors have urged the government to give them some assurance that the information will' be the absolute minimum that is required for the purposes stated in the bill, and that it would not allow individual patients or practitioners to be identified. The Minister for Human Services arid Health (Dr Lawrence) gave no such assurance in her secohd reading speech. The AMA has stre'ssed that 'it is consistent with modern privacy standards in enlightened societies that any citizen ought to be able for any reason to refuse to have data concerning his or her health, status transferred to the Commonwealth government ih a routine manner. Most citizens would not seek to exercise this right, but, it should be there to maintaip. standards and for recourse in the event of sensitive circumstances. The bill does not make provision for such a right. It is a matter of serious concern that the minister appears not to have consulted the Privacy Commissioner in relation to the privacy aspects of the proposals in this bill. The department, in the preparation of legislation in recent times, has a very poor record in the protection of the rights of those affected by the measures that are proposed in bills emanating from the department, and this requires simply adds to that bleak record. For this reason, the coalition will be moving an amendment to provide for the Privacy Commissioner to issue guidelines in regard to the supply and use of data obtained from hospitals by registered health funds and passed on to the department and the council. The guidelines should be disallowable instruments to be considered by the parliament at the same time it considers the regulations that will prescribe the hospital casemix protocol. The interests of privacy may, in fact, be better served by providing that registered health funds supply information initially to an independent data bureau. That bureau would take the responsibility for collecting, collating, editing, analysing and reporting to the department and the council, to state governments and to the health funds and hospitals. It may be appropriate for the Senate to consider this particular suggestion. In making these comments about the rights to privacy, it is not to be overlooked that information gathered from the sources in question may not only be very valuable for administrative purposes in introducing economies and efficiencies but also, potentially, have epidemiological value in the investigation of diseases, their causes and their cures. Any guidelines should take into account that interest but should ensure that appropriate privacy protections are included. The bill establishes the position of Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner and sets out the functions of that office. A complaint may be made about any matter in connection with a private health insurance arrangement and may be made by or on behalf of a health fund contributor, the hospital, a medical practitioner, or a registered health fund. The complaint acts as a trigger for an investigation. If the complaint is not resolved after the investigation, the complainant may request the commissioner to conciliate between the parties. The commissioner also has the power to commence an investigation of his or her own motion. If the commissioner is requested by the minister to begin an investigation, he or she must do so. In these last two situations, the commissionInsurance er may examine the records and rules of the health fund. The Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 imposes a levy on registered health funds to cover the administrative costs which may be incurred by the commissioner. The rate of the levy is to be based on the number of contributors to the fund, and so the cost will obviously be passed on directly to those contributors. The levy will be a new tax on patients. Not surprisingly, in consultation with the health funds, the coalition has received concerns about the impact of this new tax on the level of premiums. Research has shown that the two most common complaints about health funds relate to unexpected out-ofpocket expenses and the inability of health funds to differentiate between members on such matters as length of membership or history of claims. The reason for the former complaint is that the health funds have been statutorily prevented from providing gap insurance. The reason for the second type of complaint is primarily the community rating principle which is enshrined in the health legislation. Neither of these matters is the fault of the health funds. It appears, therefore, unreasonable to expect members of health funds to pay for the establishment of the bureaucratic overlay in dealing with issues that really are matters of government policy. It is ironic, given the government's stated aim of these private health insurance forms being to reduce the level of premiums, to encourage Australians to take out private health insurance. The effect appears likely to be to increase the level of premiums. For these reasons the coalition is opposing the levy bill and the new tax it seeks to impose on health fund contributors. I conclude by noting that in the main bill, which creates the position of complaints commissioner, provision ought to be made expressly for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions of the commissioner.",48
54,Mr REID,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"The opportunity to comment on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Complaints Levy Bill 1994 is an opportunity to reflect upon the advances, or lack of advances, in the health system in Australia. I well recall the election of the Cain Labor government in 1982 in Victoria. The then Minister for Health, Tom Roper, who was given that position under the Cain administration, visited the electorate of Bendigo. He came to Echuca to open a new extension to a hospital wing. He said to the gathering at the opening that as the new minister he was indeed fortunate to have inherited the best health system in the world. That was back in 1982. It did not take terribly long for the Labor government in Victoria-aided and abetted by the election in 1983 of the Hawke Labor government, when the Hon. Neal Blewett was appointed Minister for Health-to take what was regarded as the best health system in the world and drag it down to the situation we have in Australia today with long waiting lists for treatment in public hospitals, with restrictions and with the high costs of medical care impacting on people's pockets. It is 'interesting to reflect on the previous 12 years and see just what has happened. Even in Victoria at this time the Kennett government is trying to repair damage that was created by consecutive Labor health ministers in the state government there. Recently, Premier Kennett announced that another $98 million would be required to be put into the health system in Victoria to try to alleviate some of the pain being caused by the federal government in the aqministration of health in this nation .. The proclaimed aims of the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 are, first, to reduce private health insurance premiums in order to stem the flow of those people leaving private health insurance; second, to allow greater competition between health funds by the introduction of new products; and, third, to introduce case mix funding for private hospitals. This bill has been circulated far and wide and has immediately met with serious opposition and concern from a number of organisations. I want to refer to correspondence from the Australian Private Hospitals Association Ltd whose executive director wrote to the then shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), and said: Dear Mrs Bishop As we have discussed on a number of occasions, APHA has some serious concerns relating to the Bill known as the Lawrence Reform Bill which is to come before the House on Wednesday. Our major concerns relate specifically to: a... the lack of a default payment for contributors of a private health insurance company who are treated in a private hospital which does not have a contract with the insurer b. the potential for new health insurance products to circumvent the community rating principle c. the inability of insurers to pay doctors the Medicare contribution (in lieu of the HIC) where no contract exists between doctor and insurer d. the timing of the compulsory introduction of the new arrangements e. the apparent inflexibility of casemix based payment systems allowed under the terms of the Bill f. the provision of casemix data on patients to the Commonwealth and PHIAC. That was one concern which was raised by the Australian Private Hospitals Association Ltd and it was backed up by the Australian Medical Association whose president also w-ote to the then shadow minister for health and said: Concerns expressed by the Australian Private Hospitals' Association and some private health insurance companies that the legislation in its present form will notand I repeat, will notreduce the cost of private health insurance premiums and in many ways will reduce the attraction of private health care, are shared by the Australian Medical Association. Central to our concerns are the impact of doctors being contracted to private insurance companies on the personal nature of a doctor/patient relationship, the absence of an adequate default payment for patients treated in hospitals other than those referred by insurers, the power of the. Minister to prescribe benefits, the proposed likelihood of ministerial intervention in contracts, the undermining of a community rating principle and the possibility of powerful insurance companies dominating the care of patients through contracted hospitals and doctors. The introduction of the casemix payment system is likely to be too rapid and gives little opportunity for smaller hospitals to adjust to a system that may substantially increase their costs. Representing an electorate like Bendigo, I have grave concerns about the future of those smaller hospitals and their ability to adjust to the system that is proposed. We cannot underestimate the importance of health legislation and health providers in this country. One has only to reflect on what happened in the recent USA elections to see just how important was health legislation in those elections. When asked why he was defeated, Mr Tom Foley, until then the 75% Speaker of the House of Representatives-and the first Speaker to be defeated whilst in office in 50 years-said that the President, Mr Clinton, had handed over the responsibility of formulating a new health policy to his wife and a committee which he had drawn up, and he said that they did not get it right. In the US, the backlash from the people saw the defeat of the Speaker of the House. Many. other members of the Congress were' also defeated, purely and simply on the basis of a lack of proper direction in the health system and the inability of people to pay for the health system in the United States. In many instances, the capacity to pay, and the shortage of beds in public hospitals, is leading to a similar situation in Australia. I refer to a survey which was carried out in December 1992. That was a very significant time, because the survey featured in the runup to the 1993 federal election and the Australian Health Insurance Association Ltd was trying to ascertain what the general community's concerns were about health issues in this nation. The Australian Health Insurance Association carried out a number of surveys, and was kind enough to provide those survey results to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I wish to quote from attachment II which is headed 'Support for Tax Assistance': The AHIA has assessed the extent to which the industry itself has the support of the Australian community. An established market research group, Quadrant Research Services, was commissioned by the AHIA to conduct a number of surveys covering the five major Statesso this was a very broad coverage of the whole of Australiaas well as selected federal electorates over a period from February to September 1992. The surveys were designed to determine community attitudes to a variety of health insurance issues, most particularly the extent to which tax rebates were electorally popular. Overall the results showed a strong support for tax assistance, with 82 percent of the community, across the nation believing that people who have private health insurance should be entitled to rebate for the premiums they pay. In the graph which accompanies this, it was remarkable how uniform the response was, state by state, right throughout Australia, virtually within one or two percentage points. The question asked was, 'Do you believe that people who have private health insurance should be entitled to rebates for the premiums they pay?' The answer was a resounding yes and, of all the states, only in Queensland was the figure below 80 per cent; in South Australia almost 90 per cent of the community believed that there was need for some form of relief by way of tax rebates for private health insurance payments. Even greater was the belief that people would be more likely to take out private health insurance if they received a rebate for the premiums: 88 per cent of the nation supported this proposition. The question that was asked in the survey was, 'Do you think that people would be more likely to take out private health insurance if they received a tax rebate for the premium?' The yes responses were very uniform. Most of them w-re up around the 90 per .cent mark, with Victoria very high on 90 per cent. Once again, Queensland was slightly lower, at about 85 per cent. All the states were within a few percentage points of each other on that particular issue. -"" It just shows how importantly the Australian community regards this matter. The clear desire of the community is to retain private health insurance but people are looking for some form of relief from the high cost of those premiums. They like to have the choice of hospital. They like to have the choice of doctor and the types of medical services they provide, but at a cost that they can afford and at a cost which receives some form of relief by way of taxation. There has been a great deal of comment about the performance of the minister in but recent times. There has been comment about health issues and about how the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is performing in that portfolio. I receive a large number of representations on health issues from constituents in my electorate and I have done a little bit of research on what sort of response I have received when I have placed those issues before the minister and drawn her attention to some of these important health issues. I find that, on average, the minister is very slow to reply and in most instances refers it on to other ministers, either to the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) or to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) who does a bit of work in the health area as well. I find that the average time is between 21t1 to three months for a response on important health issues. ",50
55,Mr REID,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"It is appalling. It takes 21t1 to three months simply to answer problems that people are really genuinely concerned about. They are not of a political nature. I would have expected that I would have received a response to a concern about health issues from any minister in under three months. I find this a deplorable situation. We are making urgent representations for people who are seeking answers from the government on health matters that are vitally important to their well-being and their health and the response time is between 21t1 and three months; I think that is totally unsatisfactory for what a minister is expected to do. I do not know whether she replies to her own colleagues so slowly or whether she is a little speedier there; but I would hope that she would give uniform treatment to all members of this House and would answer the correspondence and requests for assistance directly and with greater speed than that. I want to round off my comments by saying that there is no evidence that the bills will meet the objective of reducing private health insurance premiums to stem the flow from health fund memberships. There is no evidence at all. In fact, the evidence is quite to the contrary. Freedom of choice of doctor and hospital is denied by the introduction of preferred provider agreements and there is no guarantee against the abuse of market power by health funds in negotiating such agreements. The measures also attack the community rating principle by allowing contracts between health funds and contributors to exclude treatment for certain illnesses, for example, hip replacement and psychiatric treatment. In addition, there are privacy considerations, given that the provider agreements cannot be effective without the supply of patient information to the government through the health funds. It is for those reasons, and the reasons I have enumerated from the Australian Private Hospitals Association Ltd and the AMA, that the coalition is opposing these measures being introduced by the government. Debate (on motion by Mr Lee) adjourned. NA SIMPLIFICATION BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 8 December 1994. Second Reading Mr LA V ARCH (Dickson-Attorney General) (1.15 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Introduction This bill simplifies the provisions in the Corporations Law concerning share buybacks, proprietary companies and company registers. It is the first step in a comprehensive program for the simplification of the Corporations Law. It demonstrates that the law can be made more accessible to ordinary people, to give them a grasp of the law's general principles and an appreciation of their rights and obligations under the law. The Simplification Program The Corporations Law simplification program was established to reduce the complexity of the Corporations Law. Its primary goal is to improve access to the law and to make it capable of being understood by business and its other user groups. A particular aim is to produce a law which allows its users to obtain a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities without the need for costly legal advice. Simple laws also promote economic efficiency. The program aims to reduce the regulatory burden on business by eliminating unnecessary regulation. This will not be achieved at the expense of investor protection. The program examines regulatory requirements in the law and assesses whether they are necessary to meet the needs of business, investors and creditors. The bill is the prOduct Qf an (!xtensive public consultative process, providing a mo.del for the development of legislation. The dayto-day responsibility of the program rests with a four-person task force,comprising an experienced corporate lawyer, a plain English expert, a senior legislative drafter and a senior policy lawyer from my department. Their combined skills greatly benefit the program in the preparation of propo-as for change, draft legislation and the final product. The task force works closely with a 14person' private sector consultative group. Representing a broad range of user- of the law, the consultC!-tive group assists in providing the overall direction fodhe prOgram and participates in the preparation' of draft legislamatterS. tion. The role of the consultative group is supplemented by public consultation with the full range of users of the Corporations Law. The bill has been written with the principles of plain language firmly in mind .. Provisions have been arranged in the order in which readers look for them.Â·A more natural idiom is used. Sentence lengths and a more natural flow of sentences, have been consciously chosen t9 aid reader understanding. Tables of provisions, notes and crOss-references have been used to more closely integrate relevant areas of the law. The bill will improve the presentation of the law and make provisions easier to find. For example, headings have been placed at the top of each page; individua:I subsections are givenÂ·headings; .margins are wider and pages are made more 'open', giving the text a less cluttered feel. The bill's explanatory memorandum is also more useful, allowing the reader to place individual provisions in their proposed context within the Corporations Law, rather than paraphrasing the text of the provisions. For some years now, many judges and other lawyers have rightly been calling for parliament to pass laws which are comprehensible and accessibleJor those who use those laws. This bill represents the first attempt to comprehensively deal with that concern in the corporate law area. I hope that the legal profession in general, and the courts in particular, will show support for this initiative by striving to apply the provisions in a straightforward and accessible fashion, and rejecting arguments based on unlikely constructions or excessively fine distinctions. The prOblem of complex laws is one that must be tackled by all those involved in the legal systeni. This bill, once enacted, will be a major .contribution by the law makers in this parliament. But those who use and apply the .law must also play their part. The. easing of regulatory burdens is a significant element of the simplification program. At present, the share buyback provisions include rules aimed at insider trading and market manipulation. Other areas of the law already adequately address these The bill will eliminate this unnecessary duplication. Also the law currently requires companies to keep several different' registers. These registers are costly to adequately maintainindeed, many smaller companies do not-and are rarely inspected by the public. The bill will abolish five registers where the requirement to maintain the register is outdated or the iriformation required is more easily obtained from the ASC or the ASX. Although the law divides companies into public and prOprietary companies, the law currently makes very little provision for the needs of small business. For small business, the bill will put into the law a guide to the rules concerning prOprietary companies. The guide will function as an intrOduction to the law for the directors and shareholders of small companies, and will improve their understanding of and access to the law. The bill also makes the law more responsive to the needs of small business by making the financial reporting obligations of proprietary companies proportionate to their economic significance; by allowing proprietary companies to have only one member and one director; and by making annual general meetings optional for proprietary companies. Consultation and. testing The bill is the product of extensive consultations with a wide range of regular users of the law. These consultations commence with the involvement of private sector expertise in both the task force and the consultative group in the preparation of proposals which are released for public comment. The proposals and any comments received on them then form the basis of draft legislation, which is in turn exposed for public comment for at least three months. The task force meets regularly with representatives of the peak organisations which have a particular interest in the Corporations Law. Every aspect of the bill, from policy to drafting to layout, has also been extensively tested with small 'focus groups' of users. In addition, public seminars have been held on the bill in most state capitals. The bill has. been progressively refined as a result of comments received throughout this process. The result is a bill which is clear to its ordinary reader, and which also achieves the appropriate policy balance between those whose interests are affected by the law. I turn now to the detail of the three areas covered by the bill. Share buybacks The Corporations Law currently allows a tions Law. company to buy back its own shares. However, the existing legislation has been critiprovisions cised as being too long, complex and difficult to understand; it is more than 10 times longer than the equivalent legislation in comparable jurisdictions. It involves expensive and necessary procedural steps, and often there duplication of regulation elsewhere in the law. Few companies have used the provisions. Winding back unnecessary regulation A company's ability to buy b-ck its shares should only be subject to safeguards necessary to protect the interests of its creditors and shareholders. The existing rules establish procedures inyolving reports by auditors and many women. other experts, advertisements and declarations. These impose costs on companies without conferring any real additional protection creditors and shareholders. Most overseas jurisdictions do not require this. These rules will now be removed. Shareholders and creditors will be sufficiently protected by family unit. rules which focus on solvency, fairness between shareholders and disclosure. The bill will protect the interests of sharetors holders and creditors without imposing excesin sive compliance costs on business. It will make the Australian rules concerning share buybacks closer to those which currently apply in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Proprietary companies The need to ease the regulatory burden placed by the law on small business has long been recognised. In an effort to ease this burden, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities recommended in 1992 the creation of a new corporate structure, the 'private company'. The government's response to the committee's report was tabled in the House on 8 December 1994. The parliamentary committee was clearly right in its conclusion that the laws regulating small business need to be streamlined. Indeed, the government decided that this bill should simplify the existing regulation of all proprietary companies, achieving the benefits of the private company proposal withOut adding an additional corporate structure to the CorporaI should highlight the importance of the in the bill which. will enable sole traders to incorporate without the need to involve a second shareholder or director in the business. This amendment will alleviate a unnumber of problems which have a particular is impact on women who are involved in business. Reports over recent years suggest that women are heavily involved in small business and, in fact, are setting up their ownbusinesses at a much faster tate than men. The current requirement for a minimum of two directors and shareholders for a company has presented significant practical difficulties for First, businesswomen may find it difficult to find another person willing to act as a for director of their companies. They may be unwilling to have their husbands or partners as directors or shareholders out of a desire to retain a degree of independence within the Secondly, the minimum number requirement often leads to women becoming direcof companies controlled by their spouse which they do not play any meaningful also role. This can expose these women to the legal liabilities of a company director, without them having any influence over the operation of the company. As recent cases have shown, people acting as directors without being involved in the company's affairs can be responsible for the company's debts upon insolvency. The outcome is similar to the problem which results from 'sexually transmitted debt' when.a person acts as guarantor for the debts of their spouse. The bill will address these problems, and help women to establish themselves in Qusiness on their own terms. Financial reportingÂ· byÂ· proprietary companies One of the major innovations in the bill deals with the pr.eparation of accounts by proprietary companies. The bill bases financial reporting obligations on criteria relating to the economic significance of a company. It does this by introducing a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. A proprietary company willÂ· be 'small' if it satisfies at least two criteria which relate to the company's turnover, assets and number of employees. The criteria are deliberately set at generous levels, in order to enable the vast majority of proprietary companies to take advantage of the reduced annual reporting requirements. For companies below these thresholds, there will generally. be. no requirement under the Corporations Law to prepare annual financial statements. However, under the bill, proprietary companies will have to prepare annual financial statements if members holding at least five per cent of the voting shares so require or if the ASC so directs. The removal of financial reporting requirements from the Corporations Law will enable small companies to focus on their actual accounting needs, rather than being compelled to comply with often superfluous Corporations Law obligations. This proposal has been favourably received by small business interests, which suggests that the potential savings will be worthwhile. Small bnsiness guide A major initiative in the bill is the introducthe tion of the small business guide. The guide is designed for people who operate small businesses and aims to help them understand their rights and responsibilities if they choose to incorporate their businesses. Other changes affecting small business The bill will also ease a number of other existing regulatory burdens for all proprietary companies. Proprietary companies will be able to pass a resolution if all of the members of the company sign a minute of the resolution, without needing to hold a formal meeting. In addition, these companies will not be required to hold an annual general meeting. This reform will remove from the law a procedure which is often a mere formality, and may be of little use to the members of a proprietary company. Finally, it will no longer be necessary for proprietary companies to restrict the transfer of their shares. Of course, some companies may prefer to restrict the transfer of their shares, and they will be free to continue to do so. Company registers The Corporations Law currently requires companies to keep a number of registers so the public can have access to certain information about the company and its officers. The regular updating of these registers can be a significant administrative burden, and often the registers. are little used. Much of the information in company registers must also be given to the ASC. In practice, it is quite simple for members of the public to access this information through the ASC's electronic searching facilities and through the Australian Stock ExchangeASX-in the case of listed companies, rather than by going to a company's offices and searching registers kept by it. Where this is possible, the separate maintenance of registers by cO!l1panies is an unnecessary duplication. The bill will amend the Corporations Law to remove the requirements that companies keep registers of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries, directors' shareholdings and buybacks, and that listed companies keep registers of substantial shareholders and notices of beneficial interests. In case of directors' shareholdings, the outdated requirement that all companies keep a register of this information will be replaced by rules requiring directors Â·of listed companies to disclose the information to the ASX. This will ensure that investors in those companies have rapid and easy access to information about directors' shareholdings, while at the same time lifting an unnecessary paperwork burden from the vast majority of companies whose shares are not actively traded. Registers of members, option holders and debenture holders Companies will still have to keep registers relating to their members and debenture holders. Further, the register of options will become a register of option holders, to provide more relevant and up-to-date information. In response to concerns about the use of information from registers to invade the privacy of securities holders, such as through the compilation ofÂ· mailing lists to send correspondence to them, the bill introduces a new provision which prohibits the misuse of information on those registers. Substantial sanctions, including criminal penalties and an account of profits, will become available in this area for the first time. This will represent a significant and practical safeguard for the privacy of those listed in these registers .. Directors' residential addresses Some company directors have expressed concern that the publication of their residential address on the ASC's database may put their personal safety in danger. The Corporations Law should not put the physical safety of company officers at risk. The bill will therefore amend the law to enable the residential addresses of directors and secretaries suppressed from the database. The Commonwealth Electoral Act contains provisions which enable. voters to have their addresses removed from the electoral roll where the public availability of this information would put their personal safety at risk, and the bill will introduce a similar scheme for company directors and secretaries. However, the bill will also require an alternative address to be publicly available to enable legal serviCe to be effected. Company officers will also have to supply their resi-ential addresses to the ASC, so that the ASC will be able to locate them if necessary and they are contactable in a situation where a judgment debt needs to be enforced. The goal of the simplification program is a law that works; a law that is more understandable and accessible; and a law that is easier for companies to comply with but that sufficiently protects shareholders, creditors and the wider public from the possible abuses of the corporate form. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is the first of a number of bills which will further this goal. The simplification task force has already commenced work on the Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill. That bill will address the topics of forming a company, deregistration of companies, share capital, annual returns, accounts and audit, and company names and meeti.ngs. When this second bill has been passed, small companies will be able to operate almost entirely under a simplified Corporations Law. . Minco approval , I confirm to the House that the Ministerial Coundl for Corporations. has been consulted and, to the extent necessary, has approved the bill for introduction into parliament in accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the, states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation. I con.clude on one point. The government will be agreeing that this bill be referred to the Joint Committee o,n Securities and Corporations for its consideration. Although the government is agreeing to that course of action, I feel some reluctance, As I have to be outlined in this second reading speech, the consultative processes that have been undergone in order to get this bill to this stage have arguably been more extensive than for any other piece of legislation that this parliament has been asked to deal with. There is no question that the users of the hiw have been involved in the process of formulating this legislation, from the stage of the initial proposals which were put out for public comment, from the comments that were received on those proposals, to the development of the draft legislation, to a whole series of public seminars on the legislation thrqughout. the country, to individual focus group testing of the provisions. While I have the highest regard for the members of that parliamentary committee, I wonder what further role the committee can play, what further consultation possibly can be undertaken in relation to this bill. It is my great hope that a referral to the committee will not delay the passage of the legislation. I understand that quite a tight time frame has been agreed by the committee and I appreciate the committee agreeing to that. I can assure the House that we are now receiving quite a number of inquiries about when these reforms, particularly the small business reforms, will be put in place. People are keen for this reform to go ahead and it would be unfortunate, in my mind, if that were in any way delayed. I certainly would assert that there has been very extensive and consultation on this bill. It is good, innovative legislation which deserves the support of the house.",53
56,Mr WILLIAMS,FIRST CORPORATE LAW,"Tangney) (1.38 p.m.)The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is an important bill, the result of an important process. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has indicated, it is expected to be the first of a number of bills to simplify and reform the Corporations Law. The Corporations Law is complex and voluminous legislation. It currently applies to all companies, regardless of their size, and has therefore become difficult for many companies to use. The usefulness of many of the rules upon which the Corporations Law is based has also been questioned as the nature of the corporate structure or the types of corporate structure have changed over time. In 1993 the Attorney-General established a task force consisting of experts and members of the professions to assist in simplifying the Corporations Law. A number of exposure drafts covering different areas of the Corporations Law have been produced by the task force and released. The second stage of the simplification program is expected to cover incorporation, accounts and audit, deregistration and investment companies. We are told by the government that a second simplification bill is planned for release in May of this year. This bill is modelled on the first exposure draft. It comprises seven schedules and addresses, first, the ability of Australian companies to buy back their own shares; second, the provisions relating to proprietary companies; and, third, streamlining the requirements for company registers. The bill also includes something called the small business guide, which is a document aimed at small businesses and written in 'plain English'. In the past it was considered that the purchase by companies of their own shares was undesirable. The main reason was the assumption that companies were assessed for their creditworthiness on the strength of issued shares and, therefore, the repurchase of shares might affect a company's borrowing capacity. Permitted buybacks, however, will allow a company that is in good financial shape to take advantage of market conditions arid repurchase its shares. Although Australian companies have been able to buy back their own shares under the Corporations Law since 1989, the current provisions are considered by practitioners to be cumbersome and costly. The current provisions run to some 90 sections and are almost unworkable and unnecessarily complex. Under the current Corporations Law, a broad prohibition applies. Companies can only buy back ordinary shares if a number of requirements are met. These requirements relate to the percentage of shares which can be bought back in any 12-month period, whether the company's articles of association permit the buyback, and the completion by the company's directors of a solvency declaration. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill will retain the existing broad prohibition in the Corporations Law, but will replace the current conditions with modified requirements. These requirements are contained in 11 sections. The specifications in relation to the number of shares that may be acquired within 12 months will remain unchanged. The new provisions will allow a company to buy back its own shares, other than redeemable preference shares. The bill makes the buyback rules the same for all types of companies. Attached to the bill is a table to make easier the application of the various procedural requirements for the different types of buybacks. The bill also provides for the current procedures involving auditors, experts, advertisements and declarations, which are not required in many overseas jurisdictions, to be replaced with new safeguards. It is these current demanding requirements which make the existing buyback rules difficult to comply with and extraordinarily lengthy. Buybacks which will be allowed under the proposed provisions include odd lot, employee share, on-market, equaL access and selective buyback schemes. There will be some provision for the Australian Securities Commission to become involved in schemes that involve the buyback of more than. 10 per cent of the value of the company's share.s in a 12-month period. The ASC must be notified of shares which are bought back and cancelled. The coalition has some concerns about the share buyback provisions of this bill. Buybacks are still a controversial and. fairly complicated area of the Corporations Law. It is not yet established that the new scheme will achieve its purpose. Experts have suggested that the taxation implications of the proposed share buyback rules need to be considered. Shareholders who live outside the jurisdiction may' find it difficult to comply withÂ· the' pr07 visions, For these reasons, the coalition believes that any reform to this area of the Corporations Law should be further examined in detail by the parliamentary Joint Committee ort Corporations and Securities In an unusual legislative' technique, the' contains, in a schedule, a small business guide. The guide is written in what is known by lawyers as 'plain English'. The guide contains basic information on company formation and obligations. The government has indicated in the explanatory memorandum that the guide is designed for people who operate small businesses, and its stated aim is to help them understand their rights and responsibilities. The bill specifies that the guide will be amended by regulation to reflect changes in the regulations or in instruments issued by the ASC under the Corporations Law. The guide is certainly innovative and may assist those in small business. It has been greeted favourably by various bodies. However, the coalition is concerned about the inclusion of the guide as part of the Corporations Law. The process of amending the guide will be complicated. Although the guide may also be used to help the courts in interpreting the legislation, the coalition is of the view that its location within the legislation itself should be examined further by the parliamentary joint committee. One of the major changes proposed by the bill is to reduce the number of shareholders required to form a proprietary company from two to one and the number of directors from two to one. The business law section of the Law Council of Australia has recommended against allowing companies to be incorporated with only one director. Another change proposed by the bill is to reduce the regulatory burden on small companies by streamlining requirements for the establishment of and reporting by those companies. The removal of arduous provisions with which _compliance is so time consuming is to be encouraged. However, the coalition is concerned about the removal of so many provisions upon which creditors and others place reliance: This is.another aspect of the proposed reforms that must be referred to a committee for closer examination. . . The bill also seeks. to replacethe distinction between 'exempt'- and :.non-exempt' proprietary companies with a distinction between 'small' and 'large' proprietary companies. The bill distinguishes a large proprietary bill company from a small one by its gross revenue, assets and number of employees. This quantitative test hasÂ· raised concerns among experts in the accounting and legal professions with whom the coalition has consulted. It has been a criticism of the test that it is arbitrary and may result in an incorrect classification, resulting in .inadequate' protection for creditors. . . The bill does not make dear the status of companies which may hover around the level ofsmall companies but teach'large company status at the very end of the financial year. Some companies may genuinely fluctuate between the two categories during the year, and may, therefore, fall in or out of differing requirements. This is an aspect of the bill which needs to be examined further, in terms of the treatment of genuine and contrived cases. The reforms in the bill focus financial reporting obligations on public companies and large proprietary companies, and remove the obligation for proprietary companies to hold an annual general meeting. Small proprietary companies will generally not have to prepare annual financial statements, apply accounting standards or have them audited, unless required to do so by members holding five per cent of the shares or by the ASC. The new provisions will exempt small proprietary companies from the requirement to lodge key financial data with the ASC. Certain other amendments deal with the lodgement of accounts with the ASC, access to financial statements and the restriction of a shareholder's right to transfer shares. The business law section of the Law Council of Australia has expressed the concern that it is short-sighted and counterproductive to suggest to people in business that certain advantages are available only while their companies remain small, and that this is a notion which should be abandoned. The Law Council points out that the Corporations Law should provide a framework in Which buSiness can flourish. The bill also makes a number of amendments to the law in relation to company registers. The bill provides for, among other things, uniform rules on the registers of members, option holders and debenture holders; access to company registers by computer; the elimination of requirements to keep a number of registers, such as those of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries; improved notification procedures in some areas; reduced access to certain information; and the abolition of company branch registers within Australia. While these reforms have received support, it is important that the public be able to access information conveniently and at reasonable cost. There is also cause for concern when company records, upon which so many groups and individuals place reliance, are eliminated. While simplification of such complex legislation is encouraged by the coalition, the coalition draws the government's attention to the fact that this bill is not purely a change in form. This simplification also changes many fundamental concepts of company law, the most important of those being the concept of a company with at least two directors. The provisions of the bill also reduce reporting requirements for companies and access by the public to certain information about companies. Some of the bodies consulted by the coalition are concerned that this bill may lead to a lowering of corporate governance standards, resulting in a lack of confidence in Australian proprietary companies on the part of creditors, financial institutions and overseas companies. The Australian Institute of Company Directors has recommended that there at least be a continu. ing review to monitor the effectiveness of the simplification process. The coalition does not oppose the bill. However, the coalition will be moving a second reading amendment; encouraging the government to give consideration to the detail of the simplification process. As the Attorney General has foreshadowed, it is the coalition's wish that this bill be referred to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report. As the Attorney-General has indicated, he has, albeit reluctantly, agreed to that process. I think I have said enough to indicate the reasons why the coalition suggests that there should be a reference to the joint committee. Let me address separately some comments on the proposed second reading amendment. It is the intention to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the principles of this Bill, the House is of the opinion that, given the importance of simplification to the business community and the need for the process to proceed in an appropriate manner, that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities should be given a general reference to inquire into and report on the simplification process, following its anticipated consideration of this Bill"". I anticipate my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) will second that amendment. Let me just explain what prompts this. Simplification of the law is almost without argument a desirable objective. The simplification process, as is evident this First Corporate Law Simplification Bill, inevitably involves change. Change as such involves the community in the area of corpopanies rations law and in a number of others great expense, great inconvenience and, in some cases, great delay. Let me explain why. I have of explanation before in relation to similar debates. My father in the 1930s did a corresaccounting pondence course to become an accountant. that course he had to undertake a course company law. He told me-and I have no reason to doubt his word-that for the purapply pose of doing tpat course in company law learnt the then Companies Act of Western Australia based on an 1893 statute, I think, off by heart. When I graduated in law and commenced staff my articles of clerkship in a Perth firm in mid-1960s, the senior partner, a very senior practitioner in the profession in Perth, had been in practice for some 30 years. He comto plained to me at the time the uniform company legislation came in based on the Victorian act-Western Australia came in in 1961-that he had to set aside a lot of learnprocess, ing that he had accumulated over a lifetime practice and start again. It did not just involve learning new sections and section numbers; it involved picking up minor changes of wordmany ing that entirely changed the effect of the provisions. When I was in practice before coming into parliament I acquired background knowledge on the Corporations Law as it was then in Law. relation to the uniform legislation of the early 1960s. In the early 1980s the Companies Code was introduced and I had the same Are experience that the senior partner in my firm had had in the early 1960s. But I had a second experience because when the Corporaof tions Law came in in the early 1990s I had the same process all over again. Convenience of legal practitioners is not of great moment, but it has to be borne in mind",58
57,Mr SLIPPER,FIRST CORPORATE LAW,It is to practitioners.,61
58,Mr WILLIAMS,FIRST CORPORATE LAW,"It is to practitioners, I accept, but the convenience of the public who are involved with the Corporations Law is of great moment. Members of the public who are in involved with the Corporations Law are virtually all those people who are involved in business in any form whatever. Major comhave to establish routines and regimes that enable them to comply with the law as it is and they have to amend those regimes to cope with changes and amendments in the law given this sort as they occur. Suburban practitioners both in law and who deal with companies on a In daily basis-in fact, many other professions in do so as well-have to have an up-to-date knowledge of what the rules require as they to the business that they deal with. he When there is a major change, the corporations and the suburban practitioners have to start all over again. It involves resettling their forms, developing new processes, training and, in effect, taking a long while to get the used to something that is different to what they had become accustomed to. That involves great inconvenience and great expense the public, and the public pays for it. My concern, which has prompted the 1958 moving of this amendment to the second reading motion, isÂ· that the simplification while very desirable in its own right, of is not just a simplification process. It is a process that the Attorney-General introduced in 1993, but it is envisaged that it will go for years. If the first simplification bill is an example of the sorts of changes that are likely to be proposed in each of the bills that are to come out of the task force, then we are looking at major reforms to the Corporations . The questions have to be asked: is the simplification process what we really want? we going about it in the right way? At an early stage of that process, it is appropriate that there should be an external examination what the task force is doing with the advice of the advisory committee. This is not in any way to discredit the work of the task force, which is to be commended for what it has produced to date, but I think the task force must accept and must recognise that the changes that are being proposed will be dramatic. I commend the Attorney-General on his agreement-although not on his reluctanceto refer the bill to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I am equally concerned that that process not take too long. I am sure it will not. I have confidence that the task will be undertaken on a bipartisan basis by the members of the committee from both houses, with the objective of ensuring that the bill is as good a bill as can be got. I have foreshadowed the amendment to the second reading motion. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the principles of this Bill, the House is of the opinion that, given the . importance of simplification to the business community and the need for the process to proceed in an appropriate manner, that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities should be given a general reference to inquire into and report on the simplification process, following its anticipated consideration of this Bill"".",61
59,Mr SLIPPER,FIRST CORPORATE LAW,"I second the amendment. Looking at the Speaker's list, I understood that the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was to have addressed the chamber prior to me, but I notice that he is not present. I am therefore pleased to join with coalition colleagues in speaking on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994. As was indicated by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), the coalition does not oppose the bill which is currently before the House. This is a very important bill. Most people in Australia accept that there is a need to simplify the Corporations Law. When the coalition received this bill, it consulted widely in the Australian community. We spoke to the Institute of Company Directors, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Stock Exchange, BHP, the Investment Funds Association of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Directors Advisory Services, the Law Council of Australia, Professor Bob Baxt and a leading Brisbane lawyer, Mr Greg Vickery of Sly and Weigall. . As I said, everyone accepts that something needs to be done to simplify the Corporations Law of Australia. Everyone accepts that the Corporations Law is far too complex and far too voluminous. It not only presents a problem to law students; it presents a problem to practitioners and, more importantly, to those people involved in the operation of company law and those responsible for corporations throughout Australia. At present, the Corporations Law applies to all companies regardless of size and has therefore become very difficult to use. The usefulness of many of the rules upon which the law was based has also beenÂ· questioned as the nature of the corporate. structure has changed over time. (Quorum formed) I thank my colleague the honourable member for  number of government members have come into the House to hear the pearls of wisdom that I am going to cast forth in the course of this debate. As honourable members would be aware, I am talking about the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and the importance of simplification.. As was previously indicated, a task force consisting of experts and professionals was established by the Attorney General in 1993 to simplify the Corporations Law. A number of exposure drafts have been issued covering different areas. of the law. This bill, which is modelled on the first exposure draft, comprises seven schedules and addresses a number of matters, including the ability of Australian companies to buy back their own shares, the provisions relating to proprietary companies, the streamlining of the requirements for <;ompany registers and also, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Tangney, a small business guide. Everyone accepts that the companies legislation in Australia is far too complex. John Farrar from the University of Melbourne has outlined three principles of modernisation of Corporations Law in developed countries. He says that our current legislation fails on three counts. Those three counts are as follows. Firstly, we have the principle of incompatibility. the complexity of a system increases, ability to make precise and yet significant statements about its behaviour diminishes until a threshold is reached beyond which precision and significance become mutually exclusive characteristics: that is, this legislarequirements tion should be of a drafting style which is capable of comprehension by its audience. The second count is the principle of user friendliness, and the third count is the prespany umption in favour of freedom of contract freedom of transactions. Everyone agrees that there is a problem. The Business Council of Australia in a recent report published in the Australian of 23 November 1994 said: Corporate governance legislation has become complex and should be simplified to allow greater self-regulation. . The very prominent accountancy firm, Deloittes, has said that there is a major lem with tax laws. The need for simplification which we see and which we recognise-and which the government has recognised-in the area of Corporations Law is not limited to that particular part of the statute book. The Corporations Law in Australia contrasts in its simplification procedures very unfavourauditors, ably with the law in other countries, including the United States of America. Unfortunately, what we have done so far is too little too late. We applaud what the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has done in so far as he has extraordinarily achieved some simplification. We are saying that not enough has been done. We certainly hope that this procedure will accelerate in future. The bill contains a number of important changes. Whilst it is a simplification bill, also alters a number of previously understood concepts of the Corporations Law. As part its provisions the bill includes details ting share buybacks. These provisions are contained in schedules 1 and 2; Although Australian companies have been able to buy back their own shares under section 205 of the Corporations Law for about fiveÂ· or six years, the current provisions are considered by professionals to be cumbersome and costly. The current provisions run to a massive 90 As sections. These provisions have been deour scribed by such eminent commentators as . Professor Bob Baxt as unworkable and unnecessarily complex. Under the current law, a broad prohibition applies and companies can only buy back ordinary shares if a number of are met. These requirements relate to the percentage of shares which can be bought back in any 12-month period, where the articles of association of the compermit it, and the completion by direcor tors of a solvency declaration. The bill currently before the House will retain the broad prohibition in section 205, but will replace the current rules with modified rules which run to only 11 sectionsdown from the 90 sections that we had in the too law which is being amended. The specifications in relation to the percentage of shares will remain unchanged. The new sections will allow a company to probbuy back its own shares, other than redeemable preference shares. The rules will be the same for all kinds of companies and will provide a table to apply the various procedural sections to the different types of buybacks which may assist in making application easier, and replace current procedures involving experts, advertisements and declarations, which are not required in many overseas jurisdictions, with new safeguards. It is these sections which make compliance with the existing provisions difficult and lengthy. Buybacks which will be allowed include odd lot, employee share, on-market, equal access and selective buyback the schemes. These are indicated in a table which forms part of proposed section 206C. There will still be provision for Australian it Securities Commission involvement in schemes that involve the buyback of more of than 10 per cent of the shares of a company permitin a 12-month period. In the past it was considered that the purchase by companies of their own shares was undesirable, the main reason being the assumption that companies were assessed fOT their creditworthiness on the strength of issued shares and therefore the repurchase of shares may affect borrowing capacity. On the other hand, it is now considered that permitted buybacks allow a company which is in good financial shape to take advantage of market conditions and repurchase its shares. However, share buybacks are still controversial and are still considered to be a fairly complicated area of the law. Professor Baxt and the AICD have suggested that the taxation implications also need to be considered. I commend those particular remarks to the Attorney-General. The Australian Institute Qf Company Directors has indicated that it might be difficult to comply with provisions for shareholders who live outside the jurisdiction. Any reform should therefore be examined by a committee. The bill also' deals with the reform of proprietary companies in schedules 3 and 4. Schedule 3 inserts a small business guide. Schedule 4 makes a number of amendments which simplify certain processes and reduce the requirement for two directors. I wish to deal with these schedul-sseparately. Firstly, the small business guide is an interesting idea and a novel one. I think most businesses would applaud the opportunity to have a guide in plain English. The guide,of course, includes basic information on company formatiop. and obligations. The government has indicated that the guide is designed for people who operate small businesses. It aims to help them understand their rights and responsibilities. Given the draconian penalties included in the Corporations Law today for people who step off the straight and narrow, it is very important that they be as well advised as possible of the law so they can order their activities to ensure they are within. the law. That brings me to another matter about which I am' concerned and that is the increasing tendency of governments to bring in fuzzy law, or vague law, which does not spell out in black and white the obligations of the citizen. The. strong argument in favour of black letter law is that citizens are able to look at the law and fully understand their obligations and the requirements made of them by the laW, while fuzzy law often has to be interpreted some time in the future by a court. There have been circumstances where people have done what they thought to be correctthey thought they were observing scrupulously the provisions of the law-but, sadly, a court has come along a number of years down the track and said that what the person thought was legal was in fact illegal. With the very severe penalties that the law now imposes, people in some cases have been penalised unfairly. The bill we are talking about specifies that the small business guide will be amended by regulation to reflect changes in the regulations or instruments issued by the ASC under the law. This means that should any subordinate legislation be passed under the law, or should the ASC issue any directions or determinations, the small business guide may require amendment by regulation. While we say that this is innovative and interesting-and there has been some strong support for it from various' bodies-it is questionable whether a guide should be included as part of the law. I dare say that, after we see how it is received and how effective it is, the Attorney-General could be coming back into the chamber at some time in the future to amend this section. It is one of those matters on which we will ' simply have t.o wait and see. The bill also deals with reforms of proprietary 'companies in schedule' 4. The major changes 'will be' to reduce the number of shareholders required to form a proprietary company from two to one, and the number of directors from two to .one. Australia will not be the only country toÂ· have that provision. I understand that Canada and New Zealand that have pro-isions allowing one person to form a company with one director. These provisions also apply in the United Kingdom but only in relation to private companies. Other countries, such as France and Germany, allow sole traders to trade with limited liability but they are not companies as we understand them. This is one of the major changes made by the legislation. We are told that this is a bill to simplify the law-it does to an extent-but in addition to that simplification it introduces some major changes to what we have always understood to be the fundamental tenets of Corporations Law. Referring to the reform of proprietary companies, the bill seeks to reduce the regulatory burden on small companies, according to the government, through the streamlining and establishment of reporting requirements. It replaces the distinction between exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies with a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. A large proprietary company is distinguished from a small one by its gross revenue assets and number of employees. The bill focuses financial reporting obligations on public companies and large proprietary companies, and removes the obligation for proprietary companies to hold an annual general meeting. Small proprietary companies will generally not have to prepare annual financial statements, apply accounting standards, or have them audited unless required to do so by members holding five per cent of the shares or by the ASC. Key financial data will also not be required to be lodged with the ASC. The Australian Financial Review on 20 December 1994 contained an article written by Jason Clout. In that article, a senior manager at Ernst and Young, Mr Bryce Hardman, is reported to have expressed some concern about what the government was suggesting. The article stated: Abolishing mandatory annual financial returns for small businesses has alarmedÂ· the accounting profession and could threaten the existence of some small firms, according to a senior manager at & Young, Mr Bryce Hardman. We really will have to see how these changes work in practice to find out whether the concerns of Mr Hardman are realised. Some people would say that accounting firms have a vested interest in ensuring that we have the kinds of audits and the kind of reporting we have had in the past. It is pretty clear that what the government is doing, while it might have majority support, does not necessarily have universal support throughout the Australian community. While the removal of arduous provisions for which compliance is time consuming should be encouraged-and the coalition certainly backs this-the removal of so many provisions upon which reliance is placed does require further examination. I am pleased that this bill is therefore being sent off to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, as indicated by the Attorney-General. The lessening of the provision of information may run counter in principle to the concept that companies should keep shareholders better informed. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has commented that an accounting standard currently in practice called the reporting entity concept would be a better basis for differential regulation than the small or large distinction between companies. An arbitrary, quantitative test for the size of a company such as that proposed by the bill may result in incorrect classification and may not provide adequate protection for directors. The bill also deals with company registers and makes a number of amendments in relation to them. It is very important to appreciate, therefore, that this is a major bill; it is not just a minor bill changing certain wording. It is a bill which is a step in the right direction and we in the coalition certainly applaud what the government is doing to this end. But it is clear that what the government has done is not enough at this stage. It is a step in the right direction but there are problems with this hill. Consequently, I am pleased it is being sent off to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I am also pleased that the honourable member for Tangney has moved the amendErnst ment which is currently before the House. I hope the government accepts this amendment in the bipartisan sense in which it is offered because an orderly and readable Corporations Law is vital for an effective business sector and a properly run economy.

60,Mrs MOYLAN,FIRST CORPORATE LAW,"As shadow spokesperson for small business, I welcome the opportunity today to speak on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994. I understand this bill is the first in a series of bills to simplify the rules which regulate corporations and to express the Corporations Law in plain English. It is a process that is very much supported by the coalition and the business community, and it is very much an overdue initiative on the government's behalf to reduce the burden of compliance and red tape on the small business community. Gone are the days when the business community, in particular the small business sector, should be expected to tolerate and wade through legal verbosity that has been the traditional style of our legal and corporate history. The overriding aim of the corporate law simplification project is to rewrite Australia's corporate law into a user-friendly form that is readily accessible and understandable by individuals who have a need to refer to it. However, rewriting the Corporations Law is a time consuming and very complex process that requires extensive consultation between government and industry organisations. It is very pleasing to note that in general business community is supportive of the structure of the review process and, as would have been expected, has in good faith committed substantial resources to ensure that the process of consultation and communication enhances the delivery of worthwhile outcomes. The small business community has demonstrated repeatedly its willingness to commit valuable management resources, time and money, to assist the government to reform issues of importance, such as this issue, to its sector. The federal government has no excuse for its lack of commitment to the pace of reform, given that commitment by the business community. It would be expected in such a complex review that there will be issues of ongoing concern to business that must be addressed during the passage of this bill through the parliament. The bill addresses three areas of the Corporations Law, and it is good to note that for a change small business aspects of the reform process take precedence and are amongst the first to be considered. So major consideration has been given to the small business sector in the revision of this Corporations Law. It is not very often that issues of importance to small business are afforded such a high priority by the government. I am particularly pleased that this has occurred with this issue. One of the major changes proposed is to introduce a plain English small business guide that will form part of the Corporations Law. While the decision to include this guide in the Corporations Law has drawn some criticism, it is an important innovation that will enhance the capacity of small business proprietors to understand the complexities of Corporations Law. I intend to confine my comments to those aspects of the bill that impact on small business. In that regard, the amendments that relate to proprietary companies are of particular importance. I have discussed these amendments at length with members of the accountancy profession and other business people woo have raised a number of valid concerns with the presentation of this section of the bill. These individuals are expert in the field. the They are at the leading or the cutting edge of understanding and implementing the Corpora-Â· tions Law. It is their opinion that I value most, as they will be responsible for ensuring that Australia's 757,000 small business proprietors are able to access and benefit from the changes that will flow from these proposals. The changes that have been presented in this bill acknowledge the complexity and the evolving structure of the small business environment. There are a number of major changes to flow from the reform of proprietary companies that are significant to small business. The bill will, for example, reduce the number of shareholders required to form a proprietary company from two to one and the number of directors from two to one. This will cancel out the charade that we have seen for so long in the corporate world where a sole proprietor who wants to convert to a proprietary limited company has to run around and find somebody who may have no interest or concern about the operation of the business to fulfil the requirement of the Companies Act. This particular amendment, therefore, is of great significance to small business and it does recognise the changing environment for small business operators. It also addresses a significant barrier to many people who operate as sole traders but who have been unable to establish an appropriate business structure without the support of silent directors. As I say, it does away with that charade and it is an important issue that has been addressed. Women in small business will also have their independence enhanced by this particular change. Nearly 30 per cent of small businesses in Australia are owned by women. Women tend to head up organisations that are, what I would call, in the micro-business area-that is, under four or five employees. This will be of particular significance to those women in Australia participating in the small business sector. They will not have to go around looking for directors who may have no relevance to their business at all. The second issue this bill will address reduction of the regulatory burden on small companies, as the bill proposes streamlining the establishment and reporting requirements. This is yet to be fully quantified but is of paramount importance to the small business sector. One of theÂ· major issues of concern to all small businesses is the proliferation of government red tape and compliance costs. Along with taxation reform, this has been noted by many of the business organisations throughout Australia and business people individually as one of the high priority areas for business efficiency in Australia today. This bill addresses that concern of proliferation of government red tape and compliance costs in the operation .of a business and, along with tax, is one of the key issues for small business today. If this bill actually contributes to a meaningful reduction in red tape and compliance costs for small business, that in itself will be a major achievement. However, this government will not be simply allowed to sit back and hope that all of this will work. The small business sector has become a voice to be reckoned with. As I said, there are 757,000 small businesses in Australia today employing somewhere in the region of 2Yz million Australians. They will be monitoring very closely the implementation of these reforms to ensure that the rhetoric of the bill is actually matched by market reality. In respect of small business, the bill will also replace the distinction between exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies with a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. This is one of the most contentious aspects, though, of the bill and in my opinion requires considerably more work before it is introduced. It warrants a much closer inspection to ensure that the arbitrary quantitative test for the size of a company does not result in the incorrect classification of a company or lead to an unacceptable level of protection for creditors. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) who spoke before me touched on this particular aspect. I am sure that all of us in Australia today would not want to see a repeat of the 1980s is the when a group of cowboys in the business community carried on business in such a way as to discredit business generally in this country. We want to make sure, certainly in relation to the simplification, that the safeguards remain in place for those of the public who wish to invest in business. But the arbitrary quarititative test has some problems because its application relies on a company matching two of three of the following: firstly, the number of employees; secondly, the gross revenue; and, thirdly, the gross assets. Companies must comply with two of three of those under the arbitrary quantitative test. The proposalsÂ· that relate to the distinction between small and large proprietary companies have drawn criticism from two of Australia's prominent accounting organi-aÂ­ tions, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. Inparticular the concerns of these organisations relate to the small company tests and.to the basis for establishing the appropriate classification of an entity. It is the view of these organisations that: While the criteria for identifying a company as a ""small company"" are said to be directed to identifying those companies that'because of their financial characteristics should be classified as non-reporting entities, they do not address the impact of separation of economic interest from management. The failure to include a maximum number of members for a company to qualify asÂ· a ""small company"" will result in many reporting entities being excused from the accountability obligations that they should meet. They further went on to say: The accountancy bodies reaffirm their concern that the us- of - rbitrary quan!itati,:e tests will inevitably result In different classIf1catlOns of companies to the ones that would occur if the more sophisticated reporting entity concept were applied. A difficulty in using arbitrary tests is that cases can be made for including many tests. A good case in point is that if we were concerned about public or consumer interest then we might want to apply a liabilities test as well. Extending this point further, it must be noted that in respect of small businesses the major shareholders, which in most instances are also the managers of the businesses are in the best position to identify the most appropriate information requirements to satisfy their needs and the needs of their creditors and bankers. Arbitrary tests will unfortunately place obligations on many companies that are simply outside the circumstances of either their shareholders or creditors, and will lead to unnecessary expense in relation to information, compliance and audit structures. Yesterday when speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) I mentioned that many of our colleagues on the other side h<l;ve had no business experience and simply fall to understand the implications of some of these measures on the small business community today, and this is a case in point. I wonder whether anybody on the other side has actually taken the time to consider the implications of a small company that does not meet the arbitrary quantitative criteria and which then has to go through the process of doing an audit and a report in the BHP-glossy style. I am not sure whether anyone opposite has ever gone to the trouble of checking out the cost of that to the average small company, and I know that no-one opposite has done any checking to find out how many small companies in A-s-ralia may in fact be caught up m that prOVlSlon, but the cost is somewhere in the region of $30,000. That would be an annual cost for a full audit of a small company, and that would wipe out many small Australian companies. I would suggest that this one part of the bill is an area on which there needs to be a great deal more consultation. We need a great deal more information before we proceed to pass this as law through this place. The record keeping and compliance requirements and costs would be really onerous and high under those circumstances and without any necessity, because if there is only one director or owner shareholder of that company the only people interested in that sort of information would be the banks, as I said before, which may be lending money for the company to operate, and other creditors and suppliers of the company. So it would seem a terrible waste of resources to insist that these companies, because they do not meet the arbitrary quantitative measure, be forced to go through this audit report and the huge co-ts associated with that. We ought to be trymg to ensure the money that Australian companies might be putting into that style of report be used in getting expert financial advice and in developing other mechanisms to improve the way in which they do business. There are obviously many complications that can and will arise in this area that have the potential to impose significant and unnecessary burdens on the small business community. Unnecessary and expensive audit - equirements are perhaps the most important Issue of concern, along with the public issue of ensuri.ng that, in those appropriate cases, the publIc has the kind of information it needs. Arbitrary tests in the case of the audit reports will leave no capacity for shareholders of a company to determine its information requirements and establish an appropriate corporate entity. It is of concern that arbitrary tests to determine the corporate status of an enterprise would overlook a number of possibilities for deceptive and fraudulent conduct. It is an unfortunate fact of life that there are unscrupulous individuals only too willing to take advantage of inexperienced, unwary and unsuspecting investors. It would be grossly i-responsible if this parliament passed legislation that compromised the protection of investors. I am advised that, under some circumstances, arbitrary testing could result in some companies which should be presenting comprehensive financial reports to shareholders not being required to do so. Alternatively, there could be an obligation for many companies which may be classified as large having to prepare extensive audit and compliance reports that are not required by shareholders. The arbitrary quantitative test could impose real penalties on certain companies. We have not been able to establish the extent of the impact of that. So no research has been done to find out how many companies would get caught up in that measure, as I said before. Other aspects of the arbitrary testing regime that have been raised as warranting further consideration relate to the appointment of auditors. It is suggested that, in some instances, the changed status of a company during the reporting period could lead to the necessity retrospectively appoint an auditor. It is of cqncern to the accounting profession that a retrospective appointment of an auditor will ordinarily limit the credibility that can be given to the financial report through the audit process. While it is important to simplify and create a corporate law that is conducive to today's business environment, it will not enhance investors' confidence if information provided by companies is qualified due to doubts surrounding the audit process. It is paramount that the audit process be independent, with regulations that enhance investor confidence and therefore business growth. It would be a major concern if this bill were to be passed into law in a manner that raised doubt or ambiguity for small business managers and investors, or imposed any unnecessary compliance costs on small business. The reason why small business wants tax reform and regulation reform is to help it to become more efficient and to save money. So if this bill serves to simplify the Corporations Law but then imposes additional high costs on business the whole purpose of the exercise is defeated. Technological advances, outsourcing of non-core business activities and the development of home based businesses have influenced the development of niche small businesses and, therefore, a different style of business structure in Australia today. There is now a proliferation of 'micro' small businesses around Australia, as individuals and companies respond to changing work and business practices. It is these businesses about which we have great concern. Consideration of the detail of this bill has identified many issues which require further elaboration. Because of these wide-ranging concerns, the coalition recommends that further consideration be given to the proposals contained in this bill. The scrutiny and benefit to be obtained by referring the bill to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities will provide this opportunity. It will enable this parliament to present to the business community, investors and the public at large changes to the Corporations Law that to will enhance their confidence in investment in Australian companies. These changes will also simplify the process for the business community and make it m,ore cost effective. I support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It will place additional emphasis on the importance of the corporate law simplification process to small business.",65
61,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,FIRST CORPORATE LAW,"I thank opposition members for agreeing to a reordering of the speakers list. In particular, I thank the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I was unable to speak after the honourable member for Tangney for two reasons. Firstly, I was chairing a meeting of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, to which it is proposed this bill be referred. Secondly-as the honourable member for Pearce is only too well aware, having flown on the same plane with me and my wife on Sunday-I had my two young children in the House today, so I was also engaged in other duties. I understand that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) was taken by surprise at my absence. I apologise to him if he was left out of the Western Australian and whips' loop as to the reordering of the speakers list.

69,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. 1 refer the minister to reports about operations at Sydney airport, particularly those concerning the east-west runway. What are the government'sintentions in regard to proposals to change the operations at Sydney airport? Should the east-west runway be used simultaneously with the airport's two north-south runways?",70
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the House that, since the opening of the new parallel runway at KSA, the practice has been for the east-west runway to be used, only when crosswinds of 25 knots do not allow parallel operations on the north-south path. That is absolutely consistent with international practice, which accepts that parallel runway operations are safer than cross-runway operations. As the Leader of the Opposition knows full well, this was the basis of a 1989 decision to construct the second north-south runway as well as being fundamental to the environmental approval process in 1991. That environmental approval stated that, with the opening it. of the new parallel-runway and limited use of the east-west runway, fewer people would be seriously and moderately affected by noise. The recent report of the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority acknowledges that very point. The estimates now provided by the qvil Aviation Authority of people moderately and seriously affected by noise under the operations of the airport between 4 December last and 14 January 1995-that is, the first survey period of the new arrangements-confirm that this is the case. The survey shows that the number of people seriously and moderately affected by noise over this period was 79,860 compared with 138,820 under the cross-runway operations in place before 4 November last year. The difference is some 50,000 people. That said, I want all honourable members to know that they will never hear me downplaying the great burden faced by those under the north-south access the way the Leader of the Opposition downplayed that burden in his interviews in 1988 and 1989 and which he repeated on numerous occasions right through until 1991. The government's commitment to these people who are feeling the burden is one that we are absolutely and utterly committed to pursuing. VV e are doing so through the narrowing of the flight paths and their enforcement; through the noise amelioration program that is being administered by the Department of Administrative Services; by strict enforcement of the curfew; by maximising take-offs over Botany Bay; and through the fast-tracking of Badgerys Creek. However, recently we have had the Leader of the Opposition-the once fierce supporter of the north-south parallel runway-making his own contribution to the noise debate. His plan is to reopen the east-west runway. That is the commitment he gave to mayors only last week-never mind that by doing so we see an action contrary to the safety advice of the CAA and contrary to the advice independently given by Dr Bob Ratner, one of the world's leading safety experts.",70
71,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,71
72,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You can laugh, but this is the evidence. In his external audit of the CAA's new Sydney airport operations Dr Ratner said: The airspace structuring principles you are are consistent with world's best practice. He said that the reopening of the east-west runway would involve: Increased operational complexities, hence safety concerns, and would not be particularly useful in increasing movement rates. That was the advice of Mr Ratner. If the Leader of the Opposition is nevertheless determined to reopen the east-west runway, he owes the people of Sydney some very serious answers. The people of Sydney need to know whether his plan is, first, to have three runways operating simultaneously for all aircraft types and to go back to simultaneous take-offs and landings-the infamous simops-and so adopt a less safe, more inefficient and stressful operation for controllers whilst maximising the number of people experiencing noise. There will be an additional 50,000 people under the noise contour. Is the Leader of the Opposition proposing, secondly, the industry's favoured option of increasing capacity at Kingsford-Smith Airport by allowing east-west take-offs and landings by small planes that stop short of the north-south runway. If so, not only is he proposing a less safe option but also he will be freeing up the north-south path for more jets by eliminating light aircraft from the north-south access. That will absolutely guarantee more noise for those people who are already suffering the burden on the northern access. Thirdly, is the Leader of the Opposition proposing that we write off $250 million, not use the new runway, and accept chronic capacity problems? They are the questions that the Leader of the Opposition should answer in the interests of everyone in Sydney. This is supposed to be the new, more politically skilled, more experienced Leader of the Opposition who is going to help his New South VVales counterparts get re-elected. That is his commitment. It is no coincidence that we have this document circulating in Sydney at the moment. It is headed 'Don't let Labor bring the noise back'. VVho would say this: 'VVe don't want to suffer again from noise caused by the east-west runway. Labor must solve Sydney's airport disaster with action not words'? Did you hear that? VVho using circulated it? Mick Frawley, the Liberal candidate for Hurstville! That is the campaign that is being run by the state Liberals in Hurstville. The second page of it says 'Labor will re-open the east-west runway'. That is the sort of local campaign that is being run by the members of the state branch of John Howard's party in New South Wales. Whatever approach the Leader of the Opposition takes on this, the fact is that his first gesture on the airport issue since becoming leader is to compromise the coalition's stated commitment to the safest possible operations of KSA-the sorts of operations and safety commitment given by the Leader of the National Party here in this parliament. In the process, the Leader of the Opposition proposes to make 50,000 people worse off through imposing a greater noise burden than they are presently experiencing. A real nice one, John.

It is initiatives such as this that have seen the unemployment rate fall to 8.9 per cent last month. I accept that that is still too high; but the programs will continue to drive it down further. Let me just observe that last year the shadow spokesmen-there were two in this portfolio--had some things to say about the initiatives I have just referred to. Michael VV ooldridge, the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for employment, education and training, said: At the end of 1994-95 the real rate of unemployment won't be the 9.5 per cent forecast.

I also remind the House that when the deputy's position passed to someone else, a person who has not chosen to take the matter any further since, the new shadow spokesman invoked the name of Helen Hughes in terms of where he thought unemployment would be at the end. He said: Worse still, as Professor Helen Hughes ... has warned, unemployment could reach as high as 15 per cent. These are the people on the other side who just love to call, see and urge high unemployment numbers. In fact, the number is 8.9 per cent. He went on to observe: ... real jobs ... would only be created through the sustained economic growth that would come from increased business investment. They are real jobs all right-477,OOO of them since this government was elected. Business investment for this year, the driver that will create more, is 24 per cent against a budget forecast of 14Yz per cent. VVe have achieved this result because what we have done is develop programs, fund them and make them work-the very programs that those on the other side of the House would seek to slash, thereby denying the opportunity, particularly to the long-term unemployed, to take part in this very significant improvement in employment opportunities. Child-care Rebates",73
95,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Now that the caucus committee on the status of women has declared its unanimous opposition to means testing the child-care cash rebate, and the Minister for Human Services and Health and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister the Status of Women stated to this House likely yesterday her view that the child-care cash rebate was a work-related expense, I ask the workers? minister responsible for welfare policy: do you consider that the child-care cash rebate is a welfare measure or not? Yes or no.",73
96,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might be interested in the fact that the child-care cash rebate not a matter for my portfolio. Apart from that minor technicality, you all know perfectly well that no minister is going to speculate about the content of this year's budget. ironic that on the one hand we hear you lot day in and day out demanding that the govback ernment tighten fiscal policy-and tighten by reducing expenditure, not by increasing revenue-and on the other hand you have your social security spokesman travelling around the countryside addressing groups pensioners and retirees, saying, 'Yes, we will safety net. give serious consideration to notions like a universal pension. Yes, we will liberalise the tax treatment of non-pensioners. Yes, we will remove consideration of accruing capital growth from the pension's income test. Yes, we will expand availability of the seniors health card. Yes, we will do all these things, and we will cut expenditure at the same and we will reduce the budget deficit, and will not increase revenue.' This is the quality of policy analysis comes from the coalition. It has no credibility on this. You know perfectly well that we not going to speculate about the specific measures in the budget. I will say that whatever we do in the budget in order to contain revenue growth and to reduce outlays will done with-unlike you lot-an eye to equity and an eye to protecting those who are vulis nerable in our society. That is in total contrast with the sort of stuff we expect from you. Apart from that, I would advise the honourperhaps able member for Goldstein to actually ascerperhaps tain what the ministerial arrangements are who is responsible for what, and direct questions to the appropriate minister. Award Safety Net",74
97,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the program. minister advise the House about the role of on the award safety net in Australia and the effect that the absence of such a safety net would have on the interests of Australian,74
98,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Can I make clear this government's position on the award safety net. We believe it is fundamentally is important to ensure that agreements do not see workers being disadvantaged in terms of their overall wages and conditions. That is the great difference between ourselves and the It is opposition, because our government-those on this side of the House-will never stand and allow the bargaining process to be it used as an opportunity to strip away basic conditions. We stand for keeping those conditions in place. That means the full range of basic conditions fundamental to the award of system, fundamental to a comprehensive But it is stripping away that which is the very core of the policy being pursued by the opposition. From those opposite there is no award safety net at all, just four miserly entitlements. They have gone on record stating what those entitlements are. They include a time, minimum hourly wage-not a weekly wage, we mind you, but a minimum weekly wage; four weeks annual leave; 10 days non-cumulative sick. leave; 12 months unpaid maternity that leave-end of section. That is the total amount that those sitting opposite would see are guaranteed in their policy documents. They are now saying, 'You will have the option of opting out,' and we know that it is be just code for take the contract or take the sack. It is worth noting that the Liberal Party not absolutely united on this. This week we have seen the New South Wales minister for industrial relations, Kerry Chikarovskiwith an eye to her own re-election or she was just giving the best advice and she could to a federal member of parliahis ment-calling upon the member for Bennelong to abandon the big bang and to adopt the more moderate approach that she characterises New South Wales Liberals as pursuing in comparison with the jobsback There is very little chance that the Leader of the Opposition will take that advice on the basis of his appointment of the member for Flinders as the new industrial relations spokesman-I cannot really say 'new' , because he was the industrial relations spokesman once before. We all remember 1988-89, and we also remember the summation of the honourable gentleman by none other than Laurie Oakes, when asked what he thought of the role of the member for Flinders as shadow minister for industrial relations. Laurie Oakes said: Well, I don't think he's been good enough, quite frankly. He hasn't impressed me as a shadow minister for industrial relations. there, I think. But wait for this. This was the most revealing observation of all Oakes said: All he's ever done, SteveSteve was the fellow interviewing himis to win that referendum campaign, which was easiest taSk in Australian politics. All you was to misrepresent things. Of course, the member for Flinders moved on to bigger and better things andMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

101,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will, in a few sentences, conclude. In doing so, I remind the House that the honourable member went to become the shadow Treasurer. In his capacity as shadow Treasurer, he went across the Tasman like a moth to a flame to examine the New Zealand Employment Contracts Act. Those of us around this chamber remember full well the glowing terms in which he described what was happening in New Zealand. He came back promoting the big bang approach. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a further point of or-er. I appreciate the comments you made in response to my earlier point of otder, but the minister has taken no notice of you.",75

103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat! The minister is talking about the employment act in New Zealand and comparing it with Australia. The minister is in order.,75
104,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member the for Flinders stood here in this House and had to do promoted the big bang approach. He stood here in this House and advocated throwing out the existing system and bringing in one of take the contract or take the sack. He was the father of this approach. Now he is the shadow minister for industrial relations again. He is the man who stood here in. this House and truth proposed relentlessly stripping away the working conditions of Australian men and I conclude by welcoming him back to his job as industrial relations spokesman and telling him that at every opportunity we will be .reminding the electorate of the extreme views he espoused in the past and the extreme this views he has always held. He is a leopard who simply cannot change his spots. In that respect, he is just like the Leader of the You can pretend all you like to the be a party of moderates, but your rhetoric Carbon Tax",75
105,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance. I refer the minister to on comments made by Minister for Resources Beddall on 13 December last. He said: Don't say a carbon tax would reduce greenhouse because it would have to be at such a level that Australian industry would not be competitive. I also refer to the study of the Bureau of Industry Economics into reducing greenhouse emissions in Australia which concluded: Actions to impose a carbon tax would reduce the annual real GDP by 0.5 to 2%. If a carbon tax will hot work and will just destroy jobs, why on earth is your government considering such proposals?",75
106,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you think we ought to do something like consider a 70 percent increase in fuel taxes like Richard Court introduced last week? Do you think that would be a good idea? Is that the sort of thing we ought to have a bit of a think about in the budget? Is that what you are thinking about? You know very well what the government's ments position is on this matter, because it was November. announced by the Treasurer a week ago and of he repeated it yesterday in question time. That came from a response by the relevant minister before Christmas. It is exactly those proposithe tions that were announced by the minister being under consideration, and the terms and conditions under which they are under sideration, that have already been given to you. Pensions: Indexation",76
107,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to because the Minister for Social Security. Does the government remain committed to a twicedepriving yearly indexation of pensions? What does commitment mean for our pensioners?,76
108,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I confirm that government remains committed to the twicenickname yearly indexation of pensions and allowances that takes place each March and September, which is as soon as possible after the relevant CPI is published-and two months earlier the than before we came to office. The next are adjustment is set down for 23 March. That will mean a $4.50 per fortnight increase single rate of pension and a $3.80 per fortnight increase in the pension paid t6 each member of a couple, to be paid from that pension payday on 23 March. Since it has been in office the government has gone beyond indexation. The pension is up 14 per cent, when compared with the CPI, since March 1983-and more so where there are children involved or where people are renting privately. The opposition has never matched this commitment. In fact, in the first budget handed down by the then Treasurer, the member for Bennelong, in 1978, he dropped twice yearly indexation. I quote what he said in 1978, with regard to his first budget.",76
109,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,76
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Again I remind members of the standing orders.,76
111,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do not want to hear this. I quote the then Treasurer, the member for Bennelong: After the November increase, indexation adjust to pensions will be made annually each This decision has been taken in the light the significant reduction in inflation which this Government has achieved s,ince its return to office. What was this magnificent achievement on inflation front which warranted reducing as the frequency of indexation from twice annually, once every six months, to annually? conWhat did he achieve? He got it down from double digits the year before to 7.9 per cent. This was the mighty achievement on the inflation front which warranted this action. Of course, it was a very short-lived arrangement the following year inflation was into double digits again. That translated into the pensioners of Australia of the this equivalent of one week's pension within a six-month period. In answer to previous questions the Prime the Minister and others have revived the old 'Honest John' in an ironic sense. I think there should be a new nickname for the Leader of the Opposition. I think he should be called 'Snatcher' Howard. He wants to snatch purses of the pensioners. If those opposite re-elected to government, this is the kind of measure which they will have in mind to in the control and reduce outlays. Fuel Taxes",76
112,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Since the Keating government's increases in fuel taxes have already added $6,000 per year to the costs of operation of a road transport rig---costs which are passed on to users and consumers---can the minister explain how further increases in fuel taxes will help Australia's competitiveness and create jobs? Will the minister, on behalf of the transport industry, oppose these taxes? Yes or no.",76

114,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Put them on the monorail.,77
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Moore was lucky on Monday. Do not press it.,77
116,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member has the hide to come in here and question this government about our approach to road construction and our commitment to spending on the road system money raised from fuel taxation. He does so within days of his parliamentary colleagues in Western Australia raising fuel taxes in that state by 70 per cent. Talk about an unbelievable piece of hypocrisy! But it is not just in Western Australia, because only last year we had the spectre of what happened in New South Wales when we untied the road funds and allowed the states the ability to spend all the money paid from excise to the states on roads at their discretion. What was the first thing that the New South Wales Liberals did? They stole half the money and put it into consolidated revenue. Yet you come in here and challenge our bona fides and our approach to fuel taxation. We will continue to be utterly responsible in our approach in this budget, as in all previous budgets. School Absences  Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of comments suggesting that his decision to ask the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training to inquire into children absent from school was unnecessary? Can he inform the House why he decided to ask for an inquiry into this matter?",77
117,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question. Last week I did write to the committee chair, the honourable member for Hunter, requesting that his committee inquire into a number of issues concerning children under the age of 15 who do not attend school, either because they are truant or because they are excluded. I am disappointed that the New South Wales Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has chosen to argue that the inquiry is not necessary on the basis that truancy in her state is declining. I stress that the government's concern over these matters is not about numbers but about individuals, although the figures that I have seen on truancy suggest that the New South Wales minister was not correct when she said that secondary school absences in her state were static. In the western Sydney region, part of which is represented by the honourable member for Chifley, as many as 1,300 children a day are absent without reason-the equivalent of one large high school. The percentages in some areas appear to have increased between 1988 and 1993. I am concerned, but not primarily with children who wag school for a day. That is largely a disciplinary matter, of course.",77
118,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, the Prime Minister wags parliament.",77
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mitchell.,77
120,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"l do appreciate the comments of the Queensland minister, who hopes for some solid recommendations from the inquiry. I have no particular interest in comparing figures on truancy state by state. Definitions vary and comparing figures is not always necessarily helpful. But I am interested in finding out which policies work best to keep children in school and off the streets. Policies of exclusion vary from state to state. In the ACT, for example, the Liberal Party is proposing that school fees set by the local school council should be mandatory. This immediately raises the question: what happens to the children whose parents cannot afford to pay? Are they, for example, to be excluded from school? That is a political question, but there is a deeper question: where would those children go and what support would be available to them? Where do children excluded from school, either voluntarily or by compulsion, go now? Those are questions which I hope the committee will be able to answer. Children of 13 or 14 years of age are fragile human beings, both physically and emotionally. What happens to them if they are outsideÂ· the school system is an important question. D6 they inevitably get involved in petty crime and with the juvenile justice system, and what support do they get? Children in this country have a right to an education. More than that, the school provides a social structure for the child and an environment where adults have a duty to look after the child. I know that all members appreciate the work that the standing committee did on violence in schools, resulting in the Sticks and stones report, but I think that all members would agree that even the most violent schoolyard is safer than the streets of St Kilda or Kings Cross. The New SOl-th Wales minister's defensive reaction is disappointing because she misses that essential point. Die'sel Fuel Rebate",77
121,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I remind the minister that the diesel fuel tax rebate saves farmers $516 million a year on their, input costs; it saves the mining industry $632 million a year on its input costs; and it saves over $16 million a year for nursing homes and residential care facilities. Can the minister assure these industries and carers that the government will not give into demands for scrapping the diesel fuel rebate, a move which would hit these industries for a 'relatively small' $1.1 billion tax a year, particularly as the regrowth policies adopted by most farmers are doing more to reduce greenhouseemissions than anything being done by any other industry? , Mr BEAZLEY-The honourable gentleman invites-his instructions are to invitespeCUlation on every conceivable area of revenue raising, every conceivable area ofMr Hawker- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not have the instructions to which the minister keeps referring.",78
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I suggest to members that taking points of order is a serious matter.,78
123,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He makes every conceivable area of expenditure subject to speculation. Your leaders have promised, or committed themselves to, very large cuts in government outlays and they have refused to detail any of that. Apart from the time the opposition leader, when he was Treasurer, gave his entire budget to Laurie Oakes, he observed the convention at budget time, ,or in the runup to the budget, that the government would go through revenue measures and outlays measures at leisure and arrive at a conclusion that, at the end of the day, suited the interests of the community as a whole; Naturally enough, there has been a vast amount of illbased speculation on what the government is supposed to be considering. That will continue for the next two or three months and will be added to by your instructions, which state: Surely the object till budget time is to make every welfare recipient feel like they're about to lose it. And if they don't lose it this time, they'l1 lose it next time. So we will treat you in exactly the same way you treated those sorts of questions when you were in government, but with that additional element of contempt that comes with the public revelation of that strateg-. Tuna Fishing Mr DODJ>---:-My question is addressed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Can the minister advise the House of the purpose of the visit to Australia by the new director of the South Pacific Forum Fishing Agency? Is Australia assisting in the sustainable development of the region's valuable fisheries resource?",78
124,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I .thank the honourable member for his question. It is true that the newly appointed director of the forum fisherie- agency, Victorio Uherbelau, is in Australia at the moment to talk with us about ways in which to preserve and enhance the very valuable South Pacific tuna fishery. I remind members that we have a fair bit to teach the Pacific nations in this regard. Once upon a time, we had a hell of a tuna fishery in this country. In 1961 we fished 81,000 tonnes of southern blue fin tuna. The figure in 1961 was a peak figure; it has been going down every year since then. Last year we fished 11,750 tonnes. In other words, we had a super fishery and we blew it, just as so many countries have blown their fishery resources in the past. The Newfoundland cod fishery is now officially extinct. This is one of the last great fisheries world. Last year something like $US 1Y2 billion worth of tuna was taken out of the Pacific. Out of that, the Pacific countries-the owners of that resource-got about $45 tralia million. In other words, they got much than five per cent of the value of that resource. As a friend of the Pacific countries, we have a considerable interest in helping them manage the valuable resources under their control. At the South Pacific Forum held bane in August last year a number of measures were adopted in relation to fisheries, and Australia was happy to help in this regard. We believe that those who exploit the tuna fishery in the South Pacific should pay reasonable price for it. In Australia, we from distant water fishing countries-for example, Japan-around eight per cent of the value of the catch. In the Pacific, that figure is",78
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is too much noise. Mr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. On Monday we had a most pompous speech by the Leader of the Opposiconsiderably tion about standing orders and procedures this chamber.

Victorio pressed Uherbelau, a person with great expertise, been appointed as its new director. He was down here to explore new options ment assistance. For example, a vessel monitoring system which was developed in Australia is now being used on Australian tuna vessels. You can now tell whether they are fishing in the right areas, at what times, and what they are doing. We discussed what we could do to further assist the fisheries agency, to which we have in the given an extra $1.7 million, and help with research into the management of this valuable tuna stock. These are matters that I will be pursuing in Tokyo, when representing Ausas the chair of the forum, in March this less year. One thing that I should mentionMr MCGauran-Don't bother!",79

130,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the things that we a provide are surveillance flights over the get Pacific to see just who is poaching whose fish. Here is a bit of good news. The RAAF was recently flying around Nauru. The Nauru government rang us up the other night and said, 'Look, a fisherman has gone out fishing. The motor has broken down. We haven't seen him for a day or so. Do you reckon the RAAF could help?' The RAAF did help. It went out and found these fishermen-at a cost less than that of finding some in French yachtsperson-and they have now",79
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister might bring his answer to a conclusion.,79
132,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the new director of the forum fisheries agency expressed his great appreciation for the assistance we are giving to the agency in preserving these valuable resources-resources which ought to be used for the benefit of the peoples of the South Pacific. He exappreciation for the very high level of has political commitment which Australia has. One would hope such commitment would also in managebe shared by the opposition. Badgerys Creek Airport Mr SINCLAffi-I ask my question of the Minister for Transport and the Sydney monorail. In view of the fact that all aircraft movements to and from the proposed Badgerys erys Creek airport are to be over land, what noise profile has been formulated over that rapidly developing part of Sydney? What assurance can those who live around Mascot have that there will not be the same reversion of his point of view. that there has been with respect to the aesthetics of the monorail CBD of Sydney?",79
133,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I found the last part of the question terribly obscure. If he would like to rephrase the question about the monorail, I would beÂ· more than happy to answer it. I turn to the more serious federal responsibility of the development of Badgerys Creek airport. I am pleased to inform both the honourable member and the House of the great benefit of Badgerys Creek airport from an environmental point of view. The profile of noise revealed in the environmental impact statement for the Badgerys Creek airport shows that less than two per cent of the number of people who reside in the surrounds of KSA reside in the surrounds of Badgerys Creek. That is the reason that Badgerys Creek was put forward in the first instance as a curfew-free airport, one that could operate 24 hours a day and provide an alternative to KSA. As a local member living near Kingsford Smith Airport, my greatest fear is that, without the development of Badgerys Creek as an alternative to provide curfew-free access so that Sydney has an airport that can operate 24-hours a day, it is inevitable that one day a conservative government will allow the curfew to be lifted at Kingsford-Smith. That would have an impact at least 50 times greater than the impact of curfew-free operations at Badgerys Creek. It is not so long ago that the Leader of the National Party was musing over the question of whether the curfew should be in place at all. We all know that on the eve of the last election he was called in by the then Leader of the Opposition and told he could not say any moreand they said, 'No, no, we will leave the curfew alone.' But of course he was not the only one musing over the relief of the curfew at Kingsford-Smith. The Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey, in his great push to get the Olympics, was also saying it would be a great thing for Sydney to have curfew-free operations. I tell you what: there has never been any of that sort of approach from those of us on this side of the House. We are committed to maintaining the curfew, we are committed to the development of Badgerys Creek, and we are in the committed to the most stringent environmental controls around that area. While I am at it, let me deal with the question of residences being built in the vicinity of airports. At Coolangatta, on the Gold Coast, an approval has just been given for some hundreds of homeÂ· units tb be built within the 25 ANEF curfew at that airportapproval given by the Tweed shire' council, a shire council of the same political persuasion as you sitting opposite, and given with the sanction of the New South Wales government, which has not interfered in it.

136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Sturt.,80
137,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me make it clear to those who want to develop properties around airports within this noise affected area-the area that has been raised by the honourable member-that this government will be insisting that state governments do not allow development of residential areas within the 25 ANEF. If they do so-and they are doing so at the moment-all that they are doing is bringing upon future generations of residences and the people that live in them the scourge that is presently being experienced around Kingsford-Smith. It is imperative that we maintain the curfew at Kingsford-Smith. It is imperative that we make sure that there is no unsuitable development around Badgerys Creek. It is imperative that we make sure that the development at Badgerys Creek is done cleverly and that we do not see the problems of KSA arise in that area in the future. Native Title Legislation,80
138,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Special Minister of State. Can the minister inform the House which states have chosen to enact native title legislation which accords with the Native Title Act? An opposition member-Is this what you cover?,81
139,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Amongst other things. I note the member is also part of a joint standing committee which is scrutinising the administration of the Native Title Act.i can inform the House that all states and territories, except Western Australia, have produced legislation validating their past acts consistent with the Commonwealth's Nativ.e Title Act. This means that those states and territories are now eligible to take up the Commonwealth's generous offer of financial. assistance of compensation for costs resulting from the validation of past state acts. You will recall that the Commonwealth offered to meet 75 per cent of the compensation costs arising from the validation of their past invalid acts without time limit and to compensate up to 50 per cent of the agreed administrative costs for up to five years. In addition to that, a number of states are developing proposals for their own native title regimes to operate consistent with our regime. Three states have passed legislation to establish their own bodies to examine native title claims and to set up their own arrangements for the exercise of a right to negotiate regime. The National Native Title Tribunal has received 112 applications and has accepted 49 of these for consideration. Just two cases have gone on to the Federal Court. In addition, three states ate developing proposals for exclusions from the right to negotiate for certain exploration activities. The Western Australian government chose to go its own way on this question. It chose to enact legislation which purports to annul native title and it used that legislation to more than 8,000 new title grants, many of which we have no doubt will impact on native title. Our position has been that native title exists throughout Australia, including Western Australia. Indeed, seven state and territory governments, including five conservative governments, have agreed with us. The Commonwealth has provided certainty in the system of the claim for native title. The Western Australian government has chosen to provide for uncertainty in that claim. Depending on the outcome of the High Court challenge that Western Australia has created, which we should know about next month or in April, the Commonwealth stands prepared to work with the Western Australian government to ensure that the uncertainty that the Western Australian government has created by going in its own direction will, nevertheless, not mean that those thousands of titles that may now well be invalid or that may have upset the valid c1aimof native title will be handled in a way that the claimants and those who wish to have title claimed should have them handled-in a timely and reasonably expeditious matter. The fact is that Western Australia alone has got itself into this position; nevertheless the Commonwealth stands prepared to act on behalf of all claimants to ensure that the problems are speedily rectified and that the people of Western Australia get a decent and clear run at the claim for native title or at using the land for other purposes.",81

147,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The proposed imposition by the government a new energy tax which will increase the cost fuel and electricity to all Australianhouseholds businesses. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their More than the number ofmembers required by the standing orders having risen in their places",82
148,Mr MCGAURAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"At the very outset, let us be abundantgreenhouse ly clear that this is not an environmental this is an energy tax based upon carbon dioxide emissions. It is not an environmental levy. If it were an environmental levy, then the money it raised would be directed towards environmental projects or programs. Instead, the government has already foreshadowed that, at the rate of $1.25 per tonne of emitted carbon dioxide, half of the $320-odd million raised would go to offsetting environmental expenditure and the other halfinto consolidated revenue. This is not an environmental levy. This is purely a new tax that will push up the price of electricity and petrol and will cascade right through the economy and through every PAPERS aspect of household budgets. We are not going to let the government get away with this pretence, this falsehood, this outright act of deceit of calling it an environmental levy. It is anything but. First off, it is a tax on business inputs. It is a tax on investment and employment, consequentially. It is an export tax. It is a tax on all households. So there is the trifecta: it is a tax on business inputs, it is a tax on exports and it is a tax on all consumers and motorists. It is pretty rare to be able to encapsulate all those regressive elements in the one package. 30 But the government is managing to do it. On top of all of that, it is a very complex tax to administer and a very costly tax to collect. has a good word for this tax except the extremist greens. The coalition accepts the need to address the issue of the greenhouse effect. Science is now generally in agreement that the Earth's temperature is warming, but there are diverse opinions and research as to the rate and of consequences. It is very sensible to take of precautionary measures now, but we should and not rush into a problem that is still so ill defined at a cost to the national interest. It requires cool and steady heads to address this places. issue of the greenhouse effect. It has to be put into perspective. Australia contributes only 1Yz per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions-some 420 million It is the major contributor to the effect. Methane, as honourable levy; members would know, is the next most significant of the greenhouse gases. We contribute 1.2 per cent of the world's total, or just over six million tonnes. Whilst the green movement argues that we are heavy contributors to the greenhouse effect on a per capita basis, in global terms our contribution is almost negligible. It is a global problem and the solution lies in an equitable sharing of the burden between all countries. Australia has a great deal to lose from unilaterally restricting greenhouse gas emissions. Nobody would unilaterally disarm, even at the height of the Cold VVar, and we should not engage in the trade equivalent of unilateral disarmament whereby we impose a greenhouse gas restriction tax on ourselves when no-one else in the world does. VVho else is going to impose a carbon dioxide tax, let alone dress it up as a greenhouse levy? There are only five OECD countries that have introduced a carbon or energy tax: Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland. In all of those taxes, exemptions upon exemptions are built in. They are not fossil fuel or energy intensive countries. Norway, for instance, is not going to tax its gas production. The United States and the European Community are resisting the move towards energy taxes which we are rushing headlong into. The government's proposal for an energy tax of $1.25 ""per tonne of carbon dioxide would push up the price of commodities such as petrol, coal, electricity and aluminium. At a rate of $1.25 per tonne of carbon dioxide, the tax has been estimated by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research to yield greenhouse gas savings of only three per cent off the government's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Yet the tax would have a very significant effect on consumers and industry. For example, the Business Council of Australia has estimated that the tax would add 20 per cent to the cost of brown coal and 10 per cent to the cost of black coal. Mr Costello-VVhat does it mean for consumers?",82
149,Mr MCGAURAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Electricity prices will rise for consumers. The tax on the petroleum industry would push up petrol prices. It is quite fascinating that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe )-quite separate from the energy tax floating throughout the government ranks-is arguing for a five per cent increase on fuel excise, which translates to 1.5c per litre. The Deputy Prime Minister is arguing for an increase in the fuel excise in addition to the carbon tax. The combined effect of the two will mean an increase of several cents to all motorists.",83
150,Mr REID,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,And he's the minister.,83
151,Mr MCGAURAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"As the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) says, he is the Deputy Prime Minister. His portfolio includes regional development. People living in rural areas, with a very heavy reliance on transport-farmers included-would find that their input costs and the costs at the grocery store would increase significantly. As the honourable member for Bendigo knows, those regional areas that have a heavy dependence on energy intensive industry-and I refer to the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, Gladstone in Queensland, VVollongong and Port Kembla in New South VVales, and the Iron Triangle in South Australia-would be very hard hit. VVhat effect would the government's carbon tax-energy tax have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions? VV e already know from the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research that it would have a minimal effect. Even people within the government's own ranks are prepared to speak out. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), who is well known to members of the government as a particularly competent and popular minister, said on 13 December last year at a doorstop interview: ... don't say a carbon tax would reduce greenhouse because it would have to be at such a level that Australian industry would not be competitive. Even Phillip Toyne, who is now a deputy secretary in the department of the environment, has poured cold water on expectations that the tax would have any effect on greenhouse. Mr Toyne is reported as saying that the carbon tax at present under consideration by the government 'would, in isolation, produce only a modest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions'. That is from the de facto minister for the environment, fresh from his triumph in the woodchipping issue. If the Phillip Toynes of the world are telling us that the government's new tax will not reduce greenhouse emissions by any measurable or significant amount, there is no point in having it. Why introduce a tax which has such disastrous consequences for industry and for ordinary Australians for no real effect?",83
152,Mr COBB,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"--Because they are broke, that's why.",84
153,Mr MCGAURAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"As the honourable member for Parkes interjects, it is a revenue raising measure alone. It serves no environmental purpose, and nobody who comes to this debate with any balance or objectivity would pretend otherwise. There is a great deal that the government could have been doing over the last few years to minimise Australia's greenhouse gas emissions without reverting to new taxes. Industry at large has been organised for some time now and has been pushing the government to adopt no-regrets measures. Industry, of course, wants to purchase the most energy efficient plant, motors, drives and equipment because it makes plain business sense. Industry would save money on electricity costs and contribute to reduced emissions. However, the government has never provided a lead. In May 1993 the Auditor-General roundly criticised the government and said that it had not even implemented its own energy saving targets or programs. That was followed up one year later by a House of Representatives committee which found that the government had done nothing in relation to greenhouse. The government is very good at talking about problems, particularly environment problems, but it is hopeless at ever doing anything concrete and lasting about them, whereas industry has. A detailed plan has been issued for some time now by the Australian black coal industry highlighting measures, including improved energy efficiency, research and development, and the reform of government regulation. The industry has identified measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions from New South Wales collieries by over 50 per cent by burning coal seam methane and at the same time generating over 100 megawatts of electricity. The electricity industry has also pledged work with other industries on greenhouse gas emissions and has provided a comprehensive inventory of actions under way, such as demand management, improved energy efficiency, research into renewable energy and more efficient supply, to name some of the key aspects of its efforts. At Mount Isa, the mines have already met the international target of reducing 1988 carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. This has been achieved by electricity use improvements and changes to mine. operation procedures. Other examples include mining companies using natural gas in remote operations and mining projects being planned to optimise layout and operation. So cooperative agreements between industry and government, and which industry wants finalised, areÂ· already being negotiated so that many other similar measures will be carried out in the future. But the government is not doing anything because of short-term pressures. It is prepared to compromise, even sacrifice, long-term growth for short-term pressures-the pressures coming from the extremists within the green movement. There is a great temptation for the government to try to appease some of those green groups, particularly after the woodchipping debacle that the government brought on itself by not following the national forest policy statement and not keeping to the agreed arrangements. We have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accusing the Wilderness Society of Goebbels-like propagandaMr Costello---He can talk.",84
154,Mr MCGAURAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes; of all the people who are used to deceiving and distorting messages to the Australian people, the Prime Minister can talk. But that is what happens, as the shadow minister for the environment, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), has said many times, when you lie to the environment movement groups. You must tell them where you stand, you must always adopt a scientific and factually based position-as we do on the timber industry and other environmental issues. If you lie to the environmental groups, you raise their expectations, which can never be met, even by an opportunist, cynical to government like this, and they will turn on you. Trading invective for inventive by the Prime Minister is not going to solve the greenhouse problem one iota. The next problem for Australia will be at the meeting in Berlin in March for the international convention on climate change because the government is ill prepared for that. Earlier this year, Australia chaired a meeting for the Basel convention on the transboundary movement of hazardous waste, which meeting agreed to ban certain exports of hazardous wastes. The fmal position taken at that conference was opposite to Australia's initial position prior to the conference. This totally unexpected outcome has the potential to affect Australia's trade competitiveness with other countries. There is a real danger that at Berlin in March Australia will agree to schedules for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions which will severely damage our trade competitiveness compared with other countries, the economies of which derive so much less benefit from fossil fuels and mining. The government, domestically and internationally, is hopelessly prepared to tackle this problem of greenhouse gas emissions. It has reverted to kind and simply introduced a new tax. It has not built up any coalition of interests between similar minded countries. Australia's trade competitiveness will suffer and, more directly, people in Australia will pay higher taxes because of the government's wilful neglect of a long standing issue and its incompetent reaction at the very last moment. How very typical of this government's administration. (Time expired)",84
155,Mr SWAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This motion could well have been renamed 'The unbelievable hypocrisy of the opposition on tax questions'. I do have a confession to make: until today, I was under the impression that the Manager of Opposition Business in this House was the member for Flinders (Mr Reith). But what the memo that has been tabled in the House today proves is that the Manager of Opposition Business in this House is Andrew Robb, not the member for Flinders. Robb is dictating the tactics on that side of the House, not anyone on the front bench. The Australian Financial Review told us last week in an article by Pamela Williams entitled 'The secret history of Downer's demise: first blood to last rites' that the Leader of the Opposition in this House is not the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) but the Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party, Mr Walker, who told the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other leaders in the Senate at that dinner at the Chateau hotel that Alexander Downer had to go because the $40 million that he had previously raised from shareholders of companies right through this country was not going to be forthcoming while Alexander Downer, the member for Mayo-Mr Neville-On a point of order: while I recognise that in these debates there is a fair amount of free-flowing chatter and so on, the member for Lilley has not even remotely approached the subject of the debate.",85
156,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member is correct. A matter of public importance is a wide-ranging debate but I expect that the honourable member for Lilley will be getting to some of the substance of the matter.,85
157,Mr SWAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It is a very wide-ranging debate and the question I was raising is: who is running the opposition? It is clear that Andrew Robb is running its tactics in this House and that people like Ron Walker are running the tax policy of the Liberal Party. When the Liberal Party and the National Party talk about designing a tax policy, they do not design it for ordinary Australians, for wage and salary earners; they design it for people like Ron Walker. They design policies like Fightback. Those people are the ones who thrust their agenda upon the Liberal and National parties in this House. They are the ones who design the unfair tax policies. So for the opposition to come into this House and to move the type of matter of public importance that it has simply proves its unbelievable hypocrisy when it comes to the question of taxes. If taxes were at the same level-if the same rates applied-now as they were when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer, every man, woman and child in this country would be paying an extra $550 a year. An extra $10 billion would be paid in taxes by Australians if the same regime the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for previously was in vogue now. Let us clarify a few points about this motion today and about the carbon tax or the environmental levy. Discussion of an environthe mental levy or a carbon tax is not an item has been put on the agenda by the Treasury or by this government in an attempt to someapproach how soften up the electorate. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has made it very clear already this House that this matter will be considered in the context of the government's responsimassive bilities to reduce greenhouse emissions. Treasurer has already made it very clear in this House that a decision will be taken this question weIl before the next budget. Mr MCGauran-Rule it out.",85
158,Mr SWAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,What is your policy on greenhe house emissions? What are you going to rule in and out? Would you rule out a GST; estimates. another $23 billion slug? Mr MCGauran-Yes.,86
159,Mr SWAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"You will? Will you rule it out like the member for Bennelong did in then he turned around and completely recounted it? lie went to the election in 1977 with a fistful of doIlars, came back as Treasthat urer and took it all back. Are you going have that same approach to the GST next time around? .What is your fiscal policy? Where are you going to cut expenditure and how are you going to fund the proposals that you talk about in this House day in, day out? The Treasurer and other senior ministers have made it abundantly clear: this matter will be cleared up weIl before the budget. It has been considered in the context of our international obligations on greenhouse; it will be done that way. This debate is reaIly about the approach the Labor Party on this side and the Liberal and National parties on the other to taxation. There have been three distinct approaches taxation that have been evident on that side the House. The first approach was one that was presided over by successive Liberal Treasurers, culminating in the stewardship the member for Bennelong, when you could drive a Mercedes and trucks right through loopholes. It got to the stage in the late 1980s that was optional for the rich in this community. That is what you presided over. You presided over a situation in which by the late 1970s to early 1980s tax was optional. The only that people that paid tax in this community were wage and salary earners. That was your first to taxation. The second part of that approach to taxation was the famous fistful of in dollars in 1977, when the member for Bennelong went to the election promising tax cuts, and came back one year The later and took them all back. The second stage of your approach to on taxation occurred when the Leader of the Opposition was last the Leader of the Opposition in the lead up to the 1987 election, when made what was called a counting error-an error of around $2 billion in your revenue We are all absolutely familiar with . the third stage of your tax policy, the GST-a $23 billion slug on the Australian community, which was going to make 60 per cent of selfemployed people worse off and 70 per cent of 1977; wage and salary earners worse off. There is one common theme that links together those three approaches to taxation: is, your belief that the less you earn the to more you should pay, and the more you earn the less you should pay. That is the theme that ran through .your three approaches to taxation, both in government and in opposition. That is fundament-1 to the fact that you will remain hi opposition forever, because you do not have a credible approach to taxation. Why do you not just come clean and admit that, reaIly, what you have got lurking in your tax cupboard is another big GST? If you will not come clean on where you are going to cut public expenditure, we can only be left with of one conclusion: that you are going down that road again. Your finance spokesman recently said that he thought that the BCA list of cuts to was a pretty good idea. So there is one of member of yoUi' ftontbench who is advocating $5 billion worth of cuts. What would $5 billion worth of cuts be? It would be the of equivalent of knocking off family aIlowance in addition to family payment. Or are you the heading back to the GST days when you were talking about cuts of the order of $10 billion? tax Are you talking about knocking off age pensions? What are your parameters for a responsible budget? In which direction are you going? The fact of the matter is that the only party in this country that has brought respectability to the tax system, that has engaged in real tax reform is the Labor Party. In 1983, when we inherited the mess that John Howard, the member for Bennelong, had presided over, we had to set about putting some fairness into the taxation system. We had to set about taxing fringe benefits. We had to set about bringing in a capital gains tax. We had to set about bringing some integrity into the taxation system. That leads me to the next important stage of this debate. When we are talking about tax in this House, it is really a question of fairness and who pays. That is why it is legitimate to ask: who is making and running the policy on the opposite side of the House? It is abundantly clear from this article in the Financial Review of 31 January 1995 that the Liberal Party is not being run by the parliamentary wing, it is being run by the Treasurer of the Liberal Party, Ron Walker. It is clear from this memo that it is also being run by Andrew Robb. You have to ask yourselves: what sort of tax policy do the Ron Walkers of this world want for this country? I think we all know what that tax policy is. It is a big, large It is a $23 billion slug on ordinary Australians. It is a slug which would make most working people worse off. It is a slug which would redistribute income from the poor to the rich, from the middle income to the high income. That is the dynamic that governs taxation policy in your party. When you look at the front-bench, who are now being directed in their daily tactics by Andrew Robb and Ron Walker, you can see why that is the case, because the loss of the leadership by the memb-r for Mayo (Mr Downer) and the loss of the leadership by the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) before him, had one. common aspect-that is, the Melbourne Club had decided that both had to go. Who is the prime representative of the Melbourne Club in this House? Who is the prime player for the Melbourne Club on the front bench of the opposition? Of course, we all know who it is. It is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). Was it not a coincidence that the member for Higgins happened to be present at this dinner on IS December when it was decided that the member for Mayo had to leave the leadership? He took the instructions from Ron Walker, came back and got together with what has got to be the most right wing collection of frontbenchers ever seen in the history of this parliament. He got together with the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the member for Flinders and the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan)-all of whom have been absolute defenders of a flat rate of taxation all their lives. Right through the last election campaign, they enthusiastically tramped up and down this country advocating a GST-prop agandising for a GST. The member for Flinders was the prime exponent of a GST, but he was joined by the member for Higgins and many others. They are dancing to the tune of a small clique of business people based in the Melbourne Club who are now running the Liberal Party . We are not dealing now with the party of Sir Robert Menzies. The Liberal Party was GST. formed to get away from shadowy financial influences in Sydney and Melbourne. It was supposed to be a party that was independent of those influences. But what we find now is that the policy agenda, the leadership agenda, of those opposite is being directed by those people. We on this side of the House are confident that we will bring down a responsible budget which will ensure that growth is even and sustainable. We can do it, despite the fact that you will be instructed day in and day out to come in here and scaremonger. What the Australian people understand and want is some honesty, integrity and openness. What they will get from us is a budget that will provide long-term sustainable economic recovery. That is what we will deliver. Our policies will not be developed in the Melbourne Club. Our policies will not be developed at the Chateau hotel, where the decision to change your leadership was made at the end of last year. The people drawing up the tax policy for those opposite were described by the member for Wentworth as not being representative of the needs of average Australians. That is what the member for Wentworth said about the people who are responsible for drawing up your economic policy-that they are not representative of the needs of average Australians. So we wait with interest to see how you are going to fudge the tax policy for the next election.' .. We know from past practice that you will not come clean and specify where the spending cuts will come from. We certainly know that you will no- come clean about your political belief in a GST. We know that. And what we do know from reading the last page of, your Fightback document, which was brought out for the la'st election, is that in your hearts you really believe in a GST. Page 345 of Fightback states: Failure to adopt the wide ranging economic reforms outlined in this document will mean the 1990s be the decade of lost opportunities. If you are not game to put forward a GST, you are admitting that you are failing the needs of this country as defined by your bible. Until you bring another bible forward, you will have no credibility on tax, no credibility on expenditure and no credibility on economic policy. Therefore, you will have no ability to convince the Australian people that you can deliver job growth such as we have delivered in the last couple of years. We have delivered 300,000 jobs in the last year-475,000 jobs since the election. That is more jobs than the member for Bennelong created in the whole time he was Treasurer. We have created two milli0n jobs in the time that we have been in government-yet the Liberal Party, in all its time in government, created only 250,000 jobs. We have a record which is credible. We have an economic record which the Australian people will support. We will back it with good, sensible economic policy. No amount of tactics in this House directed by Andrew Robb and Ron Walker is going to convince the Australian public of anything different. (Time expired)",86
160,Mr MCARTHUR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The government's disarray on this matter is exemplified by the fact that it has produced a backbencher to defend its new tax grab. What a remarkable speech by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan); he did not address one iota of the issue. The government's intent on this matter was made quite clear on 18 January 1995 in an article in the Financial Review. A confidential cabinet document referred to in the article indicated the long-term intent of the government. The article was headlined 'Revealed: Green tax shock'. It outlined a $13 billion grab, a $20 a tonne carbon tax and a new 10c a litre fuel levy. That is what the government is on about. The cabinet submission clearly detailed what the government had in mind in the longer term. It wanted the money to be dressed up in green environmental clothes. Another article in the same newspaper, on the same day, written by Steve Burrell, was headlined 'Canberra hit by outbreak of economic madness'. On the one hand, yet again, we have the Minister for the Environment, will Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, and, on the other hand, we have the economic ministers-the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), Senator Cook and Senator MCMullan-arguing a more sensible case, which the shadow minister, the member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), put forward, in terms of the impost on business that this new tax would create. The environment minister is now trying to placate the green movement because this is starting to become an issue. We read in this morning's Australian that Senator Faulkner is now working on a new protocol for consultation between the government and green groups which will almost certainly lead to more selective contacts. So this new tax is being promoted by Senator Faulkner because he is trying to placate the green movement. We had a debacle last week, which the member for Gippsland referred to, when we again had Senator Faulkner pitted against the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). Minister Beddall put forward quite reasonable arguments in terms of the woodchip licences which he issued and which were agreed to under the national forest policy statement. In some states 15 years of security of tenure had been given for these logging contracts in certain coupes. Again, we have the government being run by the environmental movement because they want their arguments put forward. I refer to another newspaper article headlined 'Carbon tax critics ""hysterical"", say greens'. The article reads: The Australian Conservation Foundation spokes groups and several State governments were ""hysterical and misinformed"", and that reaction to the issue was ""grossly out of proportion to the nature and impact of the levies being proposed"". ""Carbon taxes are now firmly on the international agenda,"" Mr Kinrade said. The situation is that the government wishes to billion. impose a new tax, wrapped up in environmental clothes. As the member for Lilley quite clearly said, the government wishes to have its environmental credentials enhanced when it goes to Berlin. All members would remember former minister Ros Kelly, of whiteboard fame; the minister who signed the cover of the docuPrime ment but did not read the contents. Remember her? She is no longer with us but she attended the Rio convention and undertook to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. Those greenhouse gas projections will never be met by Australia. The government admitted only yesterday that this would not occur. Australian emissions will rise 14 per cent more than we had projected. It is worth noting, as the shadow minister indicated in his speech, Australia produces only one to two per of world greenhouse gas emissions. Faulkner is going to Berlin, so he is putting up the argument that the carbon tax will in enhance the government's green credentials. But will the government go to the Berlin conference and say that it is thinking about draining Lake Pedder, which provides sustainthis able, clean energy? I indicate to the member for Lilley, having regard to his tirade about the GST, that have abandoned that policy. Mr Keith Orchison, the executive director of the Electricity Supply Association, in an ABC radio interview, referred to 'the new GST, the greenhouse surcharge tax' . That was his view. So much for the government's GST-that is exactly what the government proposes. It will be small at first, but it will gradually be increased until it is a big tax grab. An impost of $1.25 a tonne raises about $320 million in the first instance-all very nice; not very much tax-putting 10 per cent on the cost of black coal and 20 per cent on the cost of brown coal. Let us remember the fringe benefits tax. In 1986-87 it was a small tax of$535 millionnot too much; nobody worried. Now, in 199495, the fringe benefits tax is $3.2 billion. So a small tax has become a big tax. Let us look at the petroleum excise tax. In the beginning it raised $2 billion. It is now raising $9.7 Mr Reith-Capital gains tax. Mr MCARTHlJR-Likewise, the capital gains tax. Do members remember that? Mr Reith-'There'll be no capital gains tax.'",88
161,Mr MCARTHUR,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, we were told by Minister Hawke, 'There'll be no capital gains tax.' An amount of $25 million was raised in the first year. In . 1992-93, $365 million was raised. It is not evenÂ· put in the budget papers now; they hide it. They do not even tell us the figure. So Â·much for these small taxes. An article in the Age, headlined 'Report points to high costs of carbon tax', contains the caption 'Senator Faulkner: leading campaign'. The article refers to a report that by ACIL which outlines the very good percent formance by the aluminium industry in Senator Australia. It reads: Imposing a carbon tax, or similar greenhouse levy Australia would jeopardise Australia's prospects of being part of this continuing expansion. The aluminium industry has a very good track record in Australia. That report indicates that tax would upset industry, especially industries like the aluminium industry, which depend very much on energy and wouldÂ· be we affected by the high cost which would be imposed by this extra carbon tax. I conclude by referring to the very clear and precise statement made this morning on AM by one of the government's advisers, Dr Joss Haines, a British environmental economist who has worked with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. He dismissed the proposed tax on greenhouse gas emissions as being 'facile and irrelevant'. He stated: If you look at Australia's position in the world, I think the figure is that Australia produces perhaps only 2 per cent of the world's emissions. Now, if you've got to save, if Australia is going to reduce its emissions by a fraction of one per cent, in global terms its a very, very small amount, and in fact it will be overwhelmed by the increases in carbon dioxide emissions which are occurring worldwide, in China, for example. He continued: There is no point in one small player in the game imposing a tax on itself if nobody else does. The effect would be overwhelmed by the lack of reaction everywhere else. This is a global problem; it's a common property problem, and unless you can get global agreement, then then-'s little in my view, in one country embarking on a course of action which merely imposes costs upon itself. So there we have a very clear and precise statement of the argument. On purely environmental grounds, the argument is very thin. On taxation grounds, it will have no effect on gas emissions and on the greenhouse effect. There is no doubt that the government is putting forward this proposal in order to wrap it up, as I said, in the clothes of the environmental movement. It wants to help Senator Faulkner, who no longer has the ear of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on green arguments. This is his one last throw of the dice so that when he goes to Germany and presents the government's case it will be wrapped up with the carbon tax and some other green credentials and the government will look good. We all know that the propositions put forward by former minister Kelly at the Rio convention will not be met by this government. At the time the government, with great fanfare, announced, 'We will meet the greenhouse controls; we are sure to do it.' It will not meet them. This is the government's last attempt to raise revenue in order to overcome its budgetary problems and to get back on side with the green movement, which it has upset over the last three or four weeks.",89
162,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The substance of the matter of public importance today is the alleged imposition of a new tax which will increase costs for all Australian households and businesses. The opposition has the complete gall to come into this House and talk about tax or tax increases. There are two fundamental reasons for that. Firstly, at the last election, it campaigned vigorously on, and was handcuffed intellectually and politically to, a new 15 per cent tax on just about everything. The second fundamental reason is the tax record of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is very instructive to take note of the point that you always need to look at your history to appreciate what might come along in the future. There are three points that you could make about the appalling taxation record of the Leader of the Opposition. The first relates to the size of taxation point, revenue as a proportion of GDP when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. The second relates to the fistful of dollars tax fraud which he perpetrated on the Australian public in 1977-78. The third relates to his absolutely appalling and disastrous record on tax evasion and avoidance. So far as the specific subject matter of the MPI is concerned, those opposite are bereft not only of policy but also of hearing. The complete answer to the MPI is found in answers to questions without notice which were directed to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) earlier this week. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, in response to a question, the Treasurer had the following to say: It was made quite clear at the end of last year that the government should look at maximising its response in relation to greenhouse gases.In achieving its international obligations to get emissions down to 1990 levels, the government should look at all possible means of doing that. After some interjections, the Treasurer went on to say: That proposal was brought forward by the minister for the environment as something that should be looked at. The government decided that it should give the proposal some analysis, and it is being analysed at the present time. There is no decision made by the government about any such tax. Repeat: 'There is no decision made by the government about any such tax.' The Treasurercontinued: Whether the government decides to do that is something which will be decided some time the next few weeks. The minister for the environthis ment will be going to an international conference in Berlin in March. The government will be making a decision about any such tax proposal prior to that time. This matter is not being conducted in the context of budget determinations; rather in the context of maximising our greenhouse response. That is the full response to the MPI submitted this afternoon by the shadow spokesman, honourable member for Gippsland (Mr The MCGauran). I have made the point that the opposition has the absolute gall to come into this House and talk in terms policy. Let us look at some important economic statistics and comparisons and the record the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. You simply cannot take the opposi20 tion seriously when it talks about the level taxation. VVhen the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, was Treasurer, revenue as a percentage of GDP was over 26 per cent. In 1981-82 revenue as a percentage of GDP was 26.2 per cent, and in 1982-83 it cent GST. was 26.1 per cent. So that is his record-26 per cent of GDP. Under this government that ratio had fallen to 23.3 per cent by 1993-94 and it is estimatthe ed to be 24 per cent for 1994-95. So there a two per cent difference. VVhat does that mean in real terms? It means $10 billion worth of extra taxes on Australians by the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition. That is around $550 dollars every man, woman and child in Australia. . That is what those opposite stand for:' $10 billion worth of extra taxes. There are some other relevant economic facts and statistics that honourable members MelJzies' should take note of when they come to anathe lyse what the Leader of the Opposition might stand for, both in terms of taxation policy economic policy. The average rate of economfor ic growth when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer was 2.1 per cent. 'Under this government it has been 3.4 per cent. The rate of inflation when the member for Bennelong left office as Treasurer was 11.4 per cent. It is currently 2.5"" per cent. The average rate of or not inflation under the member for Bennelong in was 9.7 per cent. In the course of the 1990s, year the average rate has been 2.1 per cent. VVhen John Howard moved out of his office as Treasurer, the 90-day bank bill rate was nearly 16 per cent-15.9 per cent. Last week it was 8.2 per cent-almost half. The total number of jobs created under this government is about 1.8 million. The total number of jobs that John Howard created the when he was Treasurer was about 300,000. average number of jobs created per year under John Howard as Treasurer was 52,000 and under this government it is 154,000. The of tax or tax statistics go on. The top marginal tax rate under John Howard as Treasurer was 60 per cent; it is of now 47 per cent. The bottom marginal rate under John Howard was 30 per cent; it is now per cent. The company tax rate under John of Howard was 46 per cent; it is now 33 per cent. Honourable members . will probably recall that, at the last election, he committed himself to increasing the corporate t-x rate from 39 per cent to 43 per cent, with a 15 per History is always very illuminating. In this year, the year of the Liberal Party's 50th anniversary, we have seen the publication of book entitled Menzies' Child: the Liberal is Party of Australia: 1944 (0.1994 by Gerard Henderson. It is well worth a read. It is also well worth ""ensuring that it is a book that we can rely on. VVe find in the WeekendAustralian of 12Â· and 13 November a review of this for particular book. The reviewer states: .. the book is a thoughtful contribution to non-Labor politics in general and the history of the Liberal Party in particular. The reviewer goes on to state: Child is easy to read. The insertion into historical narrative of contemporary reflections from personal interviews is enlivening. . . and That review was by John Howard, member Bennelol)g, Leader of the Opposition. So this is very thoughtful piece with enlivening extracts from modem-day personalities. Let us look at one of those enlivening extracts which might give us a few clues to what sort of economic conditions we might expect to blunt, poor. experience under John Howard if he were elected. I do not need to do anything other than quote from Malcolm Fraser in an extract from the book, which is repeated in an article by Mike Steketee in the Weekend Australian of 1 and 2 October 1994, which states: At the same time, Fraser now professes regret about his patronage of John Howard, who succeedfrom ed Phillip Lynch as treasurer and deputy leader. an apparent reference to Howard's championing of the Dry cause, Fraser says: ""I did not realise perhaps that there were some other implications a change and if I had, for the good of the party, think it would have been better if Phillip Lynch stayed. Not even Malcolm Fraser believes that John this respect. Howard was a reasonable Treasurer or, following that, a reasonable Leader of the Opposition. On the same point, you need go no furtherMr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, I to raise a point of order. The government has not put up a minister to answer this MPI fear that it could inadvertently commit itself to a carbon tax or rule it out, so we have to tolerate the government's defence by backbenchers. But neither one of them has addressed the terms of the matter of public importance before us. On the grounds of relevance, neither will speak to the issue of a Panizza. carbon or energy tax.",90

That is his summation of the Fraser years and John Howard. When looking this morning through the West Australian, the newspaper my town, I was interested to see on In page 4 an article headlined 'Willis hints at carbon tax' by Tom Salom. We cannot hold of Mr Salom responsible for that headline; that I is the subeditor's job. In his article, he refers had to the fact, as I have, that the Treasurer has made clear that no decision has been made in An interesting article appears above that article, which is entitled 'MPs say dump powerbroker'.

167,Mr LINDSAY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (4.55 p.m.)-I move: Excise Tariff Proposal No.1 (1995). Mr Speaker, Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 (1995), which I have just tabled, contains an 1994 alteration to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 which removes an anomaly from the mechanism of indexation of excise duty rates. Sub item 1(bb) of the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act covers beer produced for non-commercial purposes using commercial facilities or equipment. The goods covered by this subsection are dutiable at a percentage of the rate applicable for beer produced for commercial purposes. As sub item l(bb) was not excluded from the legislation relating to the indexation of excise duty rates, double indexation arises as both the rate and the percentage are indexed. This alteration removes sub-item l(bb) from the indexation provisions. It operates from 1 April 1994, the date on which goods classified to sub item 1(bb) became subject to excise. A summary of the alteration contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Tuckey) adjourned. NA NA Second Reading Debate resumed.",93
168,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SIMPLIFICATION BILL," Mr SPEAKER -(Quorum formed) Before being rudely interrupted twice, I made the point that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) had reluctantly agreed to refer the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill to the committee I have the privilege of chairingthe Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I share the Attorney-General's reluctance at that referral. I do not believe that any bill related to the Corporations Law has had more exhaustive consultation prior to its entry the parliament than this particular bill. Its consultation processes were far above and beyond those required by the agreement for three-month exposure between the states and the Commonwealth. I am pleased for two important reasons that the bill hasÂ· been referred to the corporations and securities committee. Firstly, tee has a history and background in relation to this bill, with its report on close corporations to the parliament in 1992. Secondly, if a bill of this nature has to be referred to committee of the parliament, in the order of priority the parliament would be far wiser to refer it to either the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs or the Joint Committee on Corporations and Security. Either of those committees would do a far better job than any Senate committee. You cannot hope to receive the necessary deliberations from any Senate committee that you would receive from either the House of Representatives legal committee or the joint corporations and securities committee. I know this view is strongly shared by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who is the chair of the legal committee. The Attorney-General referring this bill results in part from some pushing and prodding by the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). Unfortunately, I did not hear any of his speech today but I did speak to him privately. He stated that, if we are going to refer bills to committees, we need to get the details right and for that we need bipartisanship. I am always happy to proceed on that basis when dealing with him in his capacity as a QC. I regard him asÂ· very learned and knowledgeable in these matters. I have a high regard for him as a lawyer in the corporate area. However, that is not necessarily my view of him when it comes to policy or politics. That is why I am often heard shouting at question time when the member for Tangney is two-thirds through his question that perhaps he is still being paid by the hour for his political contributions in this place. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill reminds me of a few anti-lawyer jokes. Like the member for Tangney, I am admitted into to the Supreme Court of Western Australia and therefore have standing to make these asides by way of self-deprecation. I suppose the most appropriate anti-lawyer joke in regard to this bill is that which asks, 'What is the definition of 500 lawyers and a white pointer shark at the bottom of the ocean?' The answer is 'A good start.' This bill is a good start to the simplification process in a very the commit- important area. I will deal with process rather than substance because the substance of the bill has any been referred to the committee I chair. It is important that the Corporations Law is simple and easily understood not just for judges and lawyers but also for its users. More often than not corporate law aficionados are the only ones who take an interest in these matters. I think that is, first, a mistake and, second, unfortunate. The basis of our corporate law takes with it investor confidence and confidence in the structure of our economy. It is one of the very important factors in determining whether we are internationally competitive. So it is very important to get these matters right. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, was somewhat amused with my good start joke. A couple of others come to mind along the lines of plain English, which is at the heart of these reform measures. It often alleged that all lawyers come from the same class. That is true: they come from Mr Templeton's 1914 Latin class, Melbourne Grammar. One is also reminded of the notion that lawyers are not particularly good at law reform. Lawyers have been involved in this process of law reform. I think it is a very good process of law reform. I am sure the minister at the table will know the answer to the question 'How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?' The answer is 'None, because lawyers have not changed anything for many years.' On a more serious note, when the honourable member for Tangney spoke on this bill I was chairing a meeting of the corporations and securities committee. We were fortunate today, quite by coincidence, to be briefed by the task force involved in the simplification process. The committee exhaustively went through the processes undertaken by that task force. While I will not bore the House with the detail of those consultative processes, go far and above the usual three-month exposure requirement which follows from the Commonwealth-state arrangement. Some members might be aware of the task force proposals put out firstly by a Plan of Action and secondly by exposure drafts. The members of the task force told the committee today that they found that process most illuminating. The important general point to be made about the simplification process is: simple law is important because it is in many ways the first step in ensuring effective access to justice. If people can understand the law, they can act on their rights and obligations without the need for professional advice. Where they need professional advice, such advice ought to be cheaper and less likely to be beyond the means of the client. Extensive disputes about the content of the law should also be less likely. The key thrust of this bill is to simplify the provisions of the Corporations Law. It is the first step in a comprehensive program to reduce complexity in the law and an endeavour to ensure that the law is understood not just by business, lawyers and judges but also by users, so that they can have a clear underis standing of the legislation. It also attempts to promote economic efficiency because of the importance of this area of law to a competitive economy. The simplification task force, as part of its consultative process, held a series of simplification seminars throughout the Commonwealth in the last quarter of last year. One member of the task force, Mr Robert Eagleson, who is an expert in plain English and in the drafting of legislation, delivered a paper at such a seminar in Perth. Before entering parliament, I had the opportunity as principal private secretary to the Attorney-General of Western Australia to work closely with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in Western Australia. For a time the Chief Parliamentary Counsel for Western Australia was Mr Garth Thornton, who is by birth a New Zealander. We will not hold that against him. He is the author of the very well regarded book Legis/ative drafting. I was they pleased to discover in discussions with Mr Eagleson this morning that he has the same high regard for Mr Thornton as I do. In Mr Thornton's third edition, he makes some points about the need to ensure our legislation is drafted clearly. He refers to the updating of his book from the late 1970s to the time of its publication in 1987. Where referring to his collection of notes since 1979 he states: I find phrases such as 'tortuous and incomprehensible' and 'appalling nonsense' to be not uncommon. The demand for legislation to be better drafted in a more intelligible fashion, of which I wrote in the preface to the second edition, has gained in strength. It is, I believe, a healthy and very proper demand, butit is not one that is likely to or should lead to dramatic change. Time will tell whether it leads to dramatic change. There is an important point to make about Mr Thornton's perception and knowledge in this area. In 1987, he was far-sighted among his peers as to the importance of drafting in plain English and getting it right. I am pleased that nearly a decade later Mr Eagleson is taking up the cudgels so effectively. (Quorum formed)",94
169,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,I have been defeated by my third interruption. (Time expired),96
170,Mr TUCKEY,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,"O'Connor) (5.12 p.m)Members opposite should listen to me because they might learn something-and that would be a big improvement on the day. We are looking at legislation that has a number of purposes. I specifically want to talk to that section which attempts to reform some areas of small business corporations. Historically, this is something that this government has been attempting, going right back to the time when Lionel Bowen was Attorney-General and he produced the close corporations act that was so complex and such a disaster that it was referred-as we propose with this legislation-to a Senate committee and never saw the light of day again. It was a great bipartisan effort--eyerybody thought it was a heap of garbage and, consequently, it was never proceeded with. All those years have gone by and we have the government coming up again, after a task force and green and red coloured publications, giving us some sort of proposal of how it might address. what is a genuine problem. The problem is the cost and current complexity of attempting to register a small business as a proprietary limited company. It has certainly got it wrong again. Firstly, the government does not really seem to recognise the substantial\need of a proprietary company for a small business. The substantial need, outside of avoiding some of the complexity and cost, is to ensure that some of your shareholders at least get the benefit of the corporate structure-in other words, they are not liable for any more than their actual investment. This is very important in many small businesses that are family structures where, frequently, - younger members of the family set out on some business venture like plumbing or something of that nature and seek support from their parents or other more financially substantial relatives. There is nothing here that goes far enough in trying to identify where those secondary shareholders will not be pressed, as they are today, for personal guarantees. It is extremely risky for such people to be asked to mortgage their homes because they are part of this business. There is a solution to that. This legislation goes in the opposite direction. As has been suggested on a number of occasions, instead of having a corporate structure specific to small business where the directors have an automatic liability but shareholders have limited liability, this proposal further worsens the situation for bad debts by reducing the number of shareholders to one and the number of directors to one-in other words, encouraging people who really do not qualify for a corporate structure. (Quorum formed) We might invite all these people to stay because the advice I would give them might even win them a few small business supporters-they have. not got many as things are these days. Not only are these changes too little too late, the message.is the wrong one. Fundamentally, it reduces the number of directors but gives them no additional responsibility. It reduces shareholders to one, which seems to demonstrate noÂ· real or appropriate need to have a company. But, once people have discovered whether they are a small or a large business, it will reduce or remove the requirement for people to lodge financial returns. That in itself is a matter of grave concern to me. I am entirely supportive of a concept to simplify those returns and have held the view that very small companies may, for instance, have been able to lodge a little bit of additional information with their tax returns as their only requirement. That could have been forwarded on to the ASC or been available for public scrutiny within the tax office or whatever. That could have been a simplified approach to keeping the information relative to a proprietary company on the public record. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, like others, have been in business and experienced the _tragedy for your business of another proprietary company going broke. In fact, the inability to establish the true financial circumstances of another company can be a contributing factor to that. This legislation is making that situation more difficult for honest companies seeking to give credit, which is part of their business, to achieve that. (Quorum formed) I have made the principal point I wanted to, so I am not greatly concerned about the loss of time. I would like to repeat the situation, because it was interesting to see how far the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was willing to go into matters of various reports in newspapers and things regarding the Liberal Party---one of these Labor history lessons. Everybody builds everything on history in the Labor Party and not on the future which our children would appreciate. I want you to visualise this limited reporting as it would have applied to the member for Perth when he was secretary to the Labor Party and he had all those senior members of his political party stealing Labor Party funds. He had no way of checking on that if the party is incorporated. We are not making allegations. One senior minister happens to have been gaoled for stealing money; another has been charged; and your premier member has been charged with stealing Labor Party funds-just $125,000. These are the issues you cannot handle.",96
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member would be very careful about referring to anyone who is confronted with a charge.,97
172,Mr TUCKEY,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,The stated fact within the newspapers is that they have been charged.,97
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,All right. Leave it there.,97
174,Mr TUCKEY,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,"That is where I will leave it. The point I make is that, when these blokes want to stand up and read this sort of rubbish, they suddenly start shaking their heads when they get a little bit of it back. The fundamental facts are that, if the ALP is incorporated, which it may be in Western Australia, the member for Perth as party secretary did not have much chance of checking up what was going on. He should never criticise anyone in this place, considering the record of how Labor Party members have dealt with their party's money. We might add to that the wonderful commission of $600,000 that Terry Burke got. I bet he was supposed to get $600,000. That was more likely the gap between what they got and what he collected, which the WA Inc. inquiry so clearly uncovered. Coming back to the legislation, these are the issues. The simple and untouched fact is that, with these changes, we will not have the improvement small business needs. These changes do nothing for middle sized companies, because their concern is to raise capital on a market with a degree of simplicity. More recent changes to security law have made it almost impossible for anyone other than very large business enterprises to get listed on the Stock Exchange-and that is a pity. The real issues are: capital for very small business and a simple structure that still contains a process of public reporting. The only thing this legislation is doing is knocking out the public reporting as a means of simplifying the responsibilities of small businesses. That is not what we want. There are a lot of small businesses which need that reporting to be able to assess the creditworthiness of their clients from time to time so they do not become the victims, as so many have, of the sorts of crashes that occur when relatively good businesses go broke simply because of the credit they have given to others. I think this legislation does well to go to a committee where these sorts of things can be considered. I am all for the concept of making this more simple. I am opposed, however, to a situation where we see people not being able to get access to the normal records that would be available with a proprietary limited company. I am sure there are simple ways-I can propose one-whereby both of the objectives could be achieved: for example, simplification and public reporting. If that were to come out of this inquiry which the coalition proposes in its second reading amendment, it would be to the benefit of all. (Quorum formed)",97
175,Mrs BISHOP,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,"I rise to support the amendments moved by my colleague the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I preface my remarks by saying that I am in favour of the simplification process, of language becoming such that ordinary Australians can understand it. I am interested in what may be termed not the unintended consequences of the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill but the intended consequences of it. I refer specifically to schedule 4 of the which deletes the need for small corporations, as defined by the bill, to file returns. I am particularly concerned about the definition and the requirement not to have to file returns, because it will exempt the Labor Party from putting on the public record the details about its operating companies and will allow it, quite frankly, to circumvent the disclosure provisions which pertain to political parties. I say that for a specific reason. I turn first to a corporation known as John Curtin House Ltd. John Curtin House, under the definition set out in the bill, would qualify as a small proprietary company and be exempt from filing returns because it meets two out of the three criteria. (Quorum formed) As I was saying, one of the things that concerns me about this legislation is that it provides Labor Party to circumvent the provisions and the need, as imposed by legislation, for financial disclosure. Much has been made by one or two of the folk on the other side of the House who able to read about a report in the Financial Review the other day about the Liberal Party's disclosure, made quite properly. It talked about the amount of money that had been are donated to our campaign, all set out perfectly correctly. What it did not say in that article, and what we obtained from the accounts of John Curtin House Ltd-which is the of Centenary House in Barton and which, upon the signing of the agreement for a 15year, nine per cent annual increment lease, netting the Labor Party $34 million above market value over 15 years-is that, the moment it was signed, the Macquarie Bank lent to, or made available for drawing down for, the Australian Labor Party the sum of $50 million. The accounts that were disclosed at the end of its financial accounting year to 30 September 1992 showed that it had drawn down just over $14 million. It then changed its accounting period and the next set of accounts was for 18 months. The accounts show it has now drawn down $22 million. That means that at any given moment the Labor Party has access to $28 million. (Quorum formed) As I said, my concern is that, if this legislation is bill, passed, the Labor Party-as perhaps an intended consequence-would be able to circumvent the disclosure laws as to the method of fmancing political parties. I pointed out that, at the time of the signing of the agreement to lease John Curtin House Ltdthe owner of Centenary House-the Macquarie Bank made $50 million available to the Labor Party. The Labor Party has drawn down $22 million of that amount, about $16 million being used for the development of the building, which is now valued at $32.5 million.

It is signed by Mr Della Bosca as secretary and it says: key financial data has been excluded from this due to the circumstances beyond the control of the company secretary. The financial data has been prepared, but as the ultimate control of this company rests with voluntary officials, a committhe directors to sign the accollnts has not been given. The company secretary endeavours to the key financial data on form 902 supplementary documents before 30 June 1994. That date has already passed by and still the information has not been supplied. It is incumbent upon the Australian Securities Commission to require that that data be supplied. I remind the House that this is the company that owns the notorious Sussex Street building in Sydney on which the Labor on Party has a debt of $10 million.

189,Mrs BISHOP,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,"As I was saying, Mr Della Bosca, the secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales and the company secretary of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd, has given an undertaking to supply the required financial data by 30 June 1994. He has not done so. He says that he cannot supply it because it is in the hands of volunteers. Quite clearly the Australian Securities Commission is required to take action. Of course, if this legislation passes through in its current form the company will not be obliged to file such a return again. That is why I am concerned about the intended consequences of this legislation. It attempts to hide the Labor Party's financial dealings from scrutiny. I remind the House of the figure that the Labor Party has available to it at any given time: the ability to draw down $28 million courtesy of the Macquarie Bank. I also remind the House that the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales owes the Commonwealth Bank-the same one that Mr Keating owed through his piggery-$5.5 million. Indeed, the company has reneged on the payment and the bank has not foreclosed. Why not? The federal Labor Party has $28.5 million in its coffers. That money is available to pay the debts of the New South Wales division. Why is the money not being claimed? Why is the money not being paid? The Commonwealth Bank has a charge on John Curtin House Pty Ltd and that takes precedence over the charge of the Macquarie Bank. There are many questions that need to be answered before this committee to which the legislation may be referred. One question is whether or not the consequences that flow from this bill are intended or unintended. Perhaps we need to look at a very close requirement that the Labor Party and its corporations will still be required to file these returns so that the community can be acquainted with how the Labor Party is spending its money. The main source of revenue for John Curtin House is the rent from Centenary House in Barton. It is a lease for 15 years with annual increments of nine per cent, totalling rent payable over 15 years of $86 million. That is $34 million above market rental. That pays for a lot of elections. It bypasses the spirit of disclosure. The other side has agreed that the Liberal Party has properly disclosed all its accounts and its source of money. I want to be able to hear the Labor Party say that it will file the return so that we know where the money comes from. (Time expired)",100
190,Mr ABBOTT,SIMPLIFICATION BILL,"Warringah) (5.50 p.m.)Let me say that we can simplify all the corporate law we like, but if the law is not well administered it is not going to do us a huge amount of good. I want to comment very briefly on a problem with the corporate law administration alluded by earlier speakers. In the interests of good governmenteveryone in this House is interested in good government-maladministration should be investigated and exposed. On a number of occasions I have raised the corporate law issue of Reg and Sylvia Faulkner. Their case has attracted bipartisan interest in this House. Indeed, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Sen-tor Gareth Evans,. has been a great champIon of the Faulkners m years past. I would like to point out that the latest development in this case is a submission, prepared under the supervision of a Macquarie University professor, analysing the conduct of the bureaucracy between the early 1970s and the mid-1980s when this matter finally went to court. I seek leave to table that submission. Leave granted. ' Amendment negatived.

HEALTH LEGISLATION (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Cognate bill: NA COMPLAINTS LEVY BILL 1994 Second .Reading Debate resumed.",100
191,Mr NEVILLE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I welcome the opportunity today to this debate on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the associated bill. Health care more specifically, the state of the private health care system is a matter that should concern all Australians because, ultimately, will affect them all. This debate is a very important one as it will shape the future our private health care providers, which turn will impact on the wider health care massive 208,000. system. Australia's annual health care bill amounts to $34 billion, based on 1992-93 figures, or approximately 8.5 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product. Of that amount, the Commonwealth meets around 44 per cent of our total health budget; the states a further per cent; and the private sector 32 per cent. This 32 per cent is made up of: private health insurance, 13 per cent; and out-of-pocket payments by individuals, 19 per cent. So, demonstrated, private health insurance still provides a significant component of the overto all health care funding in this country; hence done so. the need to ensure its survival in the health sector. The whole package of reform now before the House was ostensibly born of a genuine concern about the viability of the overall health care system, both public and private. The former health minister, the former Senator Richardson, on 10 September 1993 admitted that you cannot have a healthy public sector unless there is a vibrant public sector. He recognised the looming crisis in our public health system and, with the increasing fallout from the private health insurance system, he went on to say: One reason why those waiting lists are long, why it is such a difficulty, is that we've let private health insurance numbers get too low ... the drift into the public system has, I think, gotten to the stage now where we can't take it any more. Note the 'we can'ttake it any more'; that was from the previous health minister. Certainly, the statistics show an alarming fall in the number of privately insured. The participation rate has fallen from around 59 per cent in February 1984, prior to the introduction of Medicare, to currently around 37 per cent and it is still falling-a 22 percentage point speak in decline in just 10 years. Of more concern should be the change in or, profile of our insured population. Older Australians are comprising an increasing proportion of the privately insured population. it During 1992-93, the number of people aged 65 and over with private health insurance of increased by 12,000 to 844,000, while the in number aged 64 years and under fell by a These changes should ring alarm bells, not only for the private health sector but also for the public health system. The effect of a big drop in overall insurance numbers, particularly among young people, will result in private health insurance premiums rising, forcing 23 even more patients into the already overcrowded public health queue-a queue that we were told has some 112,000 Australians waiting in line. They cannot get into the as public hospitals because people, like our Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who can afford take out private health insurance have not My colleague the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) demonstrated the wider impact of the haemorrhaging health care system when she said, in her speech on the second reading: The estimate is that for every one per cent of people who leave private health insura-ce-andwe are now down to 36.6 per cent-It costs the government, or rather the taxpayer, an?ther.$100 million in services that have to be provIded public sector. I repeat: it costs taxpayers $100 million more to prop up the public system for everyone per cent of people who leave private health insurance. To me, this underlines the seriousness of the problem facing our health system and highlights the importance of reform to stem the haemorrhaging of our private health sector and, ultimately, of our total health care system. These reforms debated today and yesterday should ideally be about restoring a healthy balance between our private and public health care systems. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) says that the reforms will place the health insurance industry in a position to achieve efficiency gains and enable it to pass on the benefits of those gains to members in the form of lower premiums and better controlled costs. Unfortunately, the industry, the private hospitals and also the coalition do not see the reforms in such a glossy light, a fact that has been highlighted in this debate. There is still great uncertainty and concern about this legislation and whether or not it will exacerbate the current health care crisis. Let us look closely at some of the proposed reforms. The first of the reforms outlined is that of 1 Apri11995: private health insurance funds can enter into contracts with individual hospitals and medical practitioners, the so called purchaser-provider agreements. Technically, that is nothing new as private insurers are already able, with almost complete freedom, to negotiate with private hospitals on the payment of benefits to cover hospital charges. Where such health funds and hospitals have been unable to strike an agreement, there has always been a safety net or a minimum level of payment to be paid by a health fund for accommodation in a private hospital, that being the basic table. However, this legislation does not provide for a minimum benefit where the hospital does not have an agreement with the health fund. That has been brought to my attention by Mr Kim Knoblauch, the Chief Executive Officer of the Bundaberg Friendly Society III the Private Hospital. Mr Knoblauch points out that with the removal of the basic table-the old intermediate fee-there will be no discipline whatsoever on health funds to meet some private level unless this is nominated by the government. It must also be understood that small private hospitals, in particular, will not have the resources to be able to take such matters to the Trade Practices Commission. Understandably, private hospital operators who rely on health funds for 85 per cent of their revenue are concerned at these arrangements which more or less force them into an agreement with a health fund. If they are not happy to do that they receive no payment. The minister says there will be a transition period up to 1 July 1997, during which the fund will be required to provide a benefit payment at a level determined by the fund. The minister described this as an incentive for hospitals to enter into contracts, but the hospitals are certainly viewing it somewhat differently. According to the Australian Private Hospitals Association: The potential effects of giving private health insurers this power would give unprecedented and unwarranted power to private health insurers and would be devastating to the future of Australian health care. There is the question of competition amongst health funds or, should I say, the lack of it. In some states such as Western Australia, one private health insurance company totally dominates, holding 80 per cent of the market. In Queensland, MBF controls 63 per cent of the private health insurance market and Medibank some 30 per cent, a total of 93 per cent. In addition, the private health insurers own and control a significant number of private hospitals in their own right. The possibility of a private health insurer favouring its own hospital to the detriment of any competing hospital would seem rather tempting. There is a prima facie case of conflict of interest. The government is relying on the Trade Practices Act to ensure that fair and reasonable activity between the funds and hospitals will occur. But the coalition and the private hospital industry, particularly the small players in regional areas, are not so sure. As the APHA states: In states like Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia and in certain regional centres, the survival or otherwise of private hospitals would be determined, not necessarily by their ability to provide high quality, cost effective services but by the desires and decisions of one private health insurer. Even smaller private health care providerssuch as the Sisters of Mercy Health Care Services, which operates the Mater Misericordiae Hospitals in Bundaberg, Rockhampton and Mackay-have expressed similar grave concerns. The chief executive officer of  tells me that he has been advised that 'an opinion from the Trade Practices Commission suggests that a fund could ignore one hospital and not contravene the Trade Practices Act' . That, I suggest, is most concerning. There is a genuine concern amongst private health care providers about the power to be given to health funds under this proposed legislation. There is an obvious need for greater consultation and discussion with the industry about these reforms. An equally concerning reform contained in the legislation is the fundamental shift in the type of private health insurance payment system to be based on casemix payments. After 1 July 1997, the basic and supplementary insurance tables will no longer exist. Contracts between health funds and hospitals will have to be structured on the basis of a casemix payment system. The minister says that the implementation of casemix payments will improve the efficiency within hospitals and improve the quality and outcome of health care. Another person in the health care industry said to me, 'Is it not the case that the government has got the health funds to do its dirty business?' Again, there is genuine uncertainty amongst private health care providers about the merits of casemix based payments. Again I quote Peter Crane, who says: I question whether the health funds and priva!e hospitals are adequately prepared for a casemlx based system ... in the private system ... if the rates are wrong, either the funds or the hospitals will be in financial difficulty, there cannot be an end of year adjustment because payment is made for each patients episode of care. In other words, once the payment has been levied and the patient has left the hospital, you cannot go back over the same ground. I am also concerned about another small hospital in my area, the Friendly Society Private Hospital. This is a modern, well-equipped facility which is maintained by the friendly societies, a group of lodges in the Bundaberg area. They have built it up to a superb $5 million facility. This hospital, would you believe, for its 14-day bed rate charges the schedule fee. In other words, the health insurance rebate, as it is currently structured, covers the full cost of hospitalisation in most cases. In other words, you can know that if you are in the top scale of medical benefits you can be treated in that hospital with the best of theatres, ensuited rooms and so on, for the schedule fee. The danger is that the health funds, knowing the efficiency of a hospital such as this one, could demand even more. How much extra can they demand from a hospital which has already screwed down its costs to the basic schedule fee? Kim Knoblauch, the CEO of that hospital, pointed out to me that the funds will have access to all the hospital costings. There will be no such thing as commercial privacy. This makes any hospital vulnerable to a fund and certainly makes smaller hospitals particularly so. I would also like to make the pointperhaps it is not of the same concern, but it is of some concern-that some of the small funds may have the same difficulty in negotiating with big hospital chains. I do not see anywhere in the minister's explanation an addressing of these fundamental problems. If the thing gets out of control in the early days without any regulatory processes, we are going to have not only a difficult health situation on our hands but an absolute national shambles. This debate should be about stemming the tide of people leaving private health insurance, adding to the woes of the overcrowded public hospital system. It should be about restoring a better balance in our health care system overall. The government has focused on contractual arrangements and casemix funding as the answer to reducing the cost of private health care insurance premiums-the primary reason people are leaving health funds in such big numbers. However, the APHA does not believe that these reforms will result in much greater improvements in efficiencies or health care fund premiums. The APHA states: Even if a 10% efficiency could be extracted from private hospitals, the cost of health insurance could potentially reduce less than $1 per week, not sufficient to make any difference to the number insured. There have been concerns expressed from some sectors of the health care industry that there has not been enough consultation on these proposed reforms, in particular from consumer groups and private hospitals. This makes the amendments of the member for Mackellar all the more relevant. Given the conflicting views and opinions expressed about this legislation, I strongly support the thrust of the coalition's second reading amendment calling for greater scrutiny of these proposed reforms through a Senate committee. There is too much at stake here. There is not only the future of our private hospitals but the state of our overall health care system which, like the human body, is made up of many parts but which must all be kept in balance to operate effectively. I conclude with a quote from Greg Herring, the Executive Director of the APHA: Once again, nothing in the package will bring the cost of comprehensive private health insurance down. Eighty percent of people drop insurance because of price, so that there is unlikely to be any deceleration in the fall out. Once again Labor is fiddling at the edges and not addressing the real problem. The last sentence is not my quote; it is the quote of the APHA. (Quorum formed)",101
192,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"It gives me great pleasure to rise for the first time in this place as shadow minister for health and human resources. It is a role that I am very much looking forward to fulfilling. I am the final speaker for the coalition in this debate, a debate that was led by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). I want to record my thanks to her for her work as my predecessor and her work in doing the consultation on these pieces of legislation. As the new shadow minister for health, I want to reaffirm the position stated by the honourable member for Mackellar at the outset of this debate. The coalition has serious difficulties with the government's legislation. We have sufficiently strong reservations about features of these bills, and we will seek to amend those in another place. We intend to go some way to rectifying the lack of government consultation over this legislation, which has to be the most fundamentally important change in private health over the last decade. It is being done without adequate consultation. I do not propose to go into great detail, especially given the contributions of my colleagues throughout the debate. I will, however, give the House some observations on the more significant elements of this legislation. In looking at any legislation or policy proposal, it is wise to try to put oneself in the shoes of the government and get some idea of the outcomes it is seeking. In the present instance, I believe there are four outcomes that the government has in mind: making private health insurance a more attractive product to health consumers and to halt the decline in private health coverage; defining the future role of private hospitals in Australian health care; restraining the growth of hospital costs; and introducing and entrenching case payments in the private hospital system and in private health insurance. I would like to say that the coalition accepts that there is some merit in these goals-in some, there is particular merit. We too want to see a healthy system where there is a mix of public and private provisiori, and we want to see private health funds and private hospitals having an essential role in looking to provide the best possible services to their Â·consumers. Where we differ from the government is that, rather than seeing private health insurance as a supplement to Medicare, we see it as essential and complementary to Medicare. This was put very well by the former Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, who said that if private health insurance falls below 40 per cent Medicare is not going to work. We are now at 36.7 per cent and people are continuing to fall out. In the last week I have examined the legislation and heard a range of views from industry groups, service providers, professional groups and consumers. Having done so, I do not believe the government has achieved its first three objectives, and I think it has only imperfectly dealt with the question of casemix's introduction. Rather than go over ground that has already been very thoroughly trodden, I would like to have a look at the implications of the legislation for the immediate future of both private health insurance and private hospitals. In her second reading speech, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) said: The focus of this legislation is on strengthening consumer rights and making private health insurance better value for money. I think these measures have missed the point. The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals summed up the government's dilemma pretty neatly in its November 1994 discussion paper on the minister's package when it wrote: The reforms appear to concentrate on ... reducing out of pocket expenses ... rather than concentratpetition ing on reducing the actual month by month cost associated with paying premiums that is a major reason for consumers to cancel their membership. This is central. If you look at the two-yearly Australian health survey that is done, in the last survey in 1993, 63 per cent of people who dropped out of private health insurance nominated the cost as the reason. This does absolutely nothing whatsoever in the short term to address that. Only 10 per cent of people nominated outof-pocket expenses as the reason they were dropping out of private health insurance. So this fundamentally fails to deal with the principal reason for the decline in private health insurance coverage. That said, this bill makes possible the covering of those usually unexpected extras that can come with hospital treatment. This is something that my colleague the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) has had recent cause to have an encounter with, and to which he can attest. But, while on the surface this is a positive move, there has been nothing in the evidence presented to me or to my colleagues that suggests the cost of private health insurance will not increase under the government package. It certainly will not fall in real terms. The member for Mackellar has outlined the coalition's arguments on these elements of the legislation. I share her concerns that there is no guarantee in the government package that purchaser-provider agreements will preserve the contributor's freedom of choice of doctor and place of care. This is important for the simple reason that that element of freedom of choice is perhaps the prime attraction for consumers in taking out private health insurance in the first place. We remain to be convinced that this new dimension to private insurance will be welcomed by the community which, if the evidence is correct, is barely aware of these proposals at all. I suspect that the lure of outof-pocket coverage under the purchaserprovider agreements will not be the magic ingredient to attract people back to private insurance. I am also not convinced that the measures will necessarily improve cost combetween funds for the consumer dollar. It is not unreasonable to argue that purchaser-provider agreements and the proposed changes to the management of the reinsurance pool will create irresistible pressures on smaller funds to amalgamate with larger funds. I am also aware of concerns expressed to the coalition that small restricted funds will find the present model heavy going. They will often lack the resources that larger funds have to develop a wide network of purchaserprovider arrangements. These smaller and restricted funds are important in the total private health network. They provide access to private health insurance that many people and many trade unionists of more limited means would not normally have. My prediction, one that I suspect the minister might share, is that the next few years will see a significant shake-out of the number of funds competing for a still declining number of people taking out private health insurance. I do not see this as a good outcome. I see diversity of choice as a positive goal that should be shared by all health policy makers. I would prefer to see a market that can embrace a range of insurers-large and small; open and restricted. I am not convinced about the legislation's provision for contributors who require treatment at a hospital, day procedure facility or by a medical practitioner not covered by a purchaser-provider agreement with his or her fund, whether because ofÂ· emergency or because of the nature of the treatment. In our second reading amendments, the coalition has foreshadowed an amendment to the legislation proposing the introduction of a default rebate-a level of 50 per cent has been suggested-in those instances where a contributor cannot avail himself or herself of an agreed provider. This is a fundamentally important fall back. It is all very well to say that funds will not behave in a certain way. We have no guarantee of that. It is all very well to say that funds will be covered by the Trade Practices Commission. It cannot cover a system where funds do not agree to negotiate in the first place. I do not see any safeguard here for funds choosing not to negotiate with hospitals that might have a profile that does not suit what they want to attract-hospitals that are known to have a large number of older patients needing joint replacements; and other things that are unprofitable to them. The government's legislation offers patients who have to go to a private hospital outside their fund's purchaser-provider agreement only an 'average level of benefit' for emergency episodes and a level of benefit subject to the insurer's discretion for non-emergency admissions. In a perfect world that might be acceptable, but private health insurance is not a perfect world. The obligation to provide even a non-emergency benefit will cease on 1 July 1998. We do not find that acceptable. If the principle of freedom of choice for consumers is going to be maintained, it seems to us that maintenance of a reasonable default benefit for non-agreement care is both common sense and equitable. We on this side accept and realise that a person cannot have control over all the circumstances of the management of his or her illness or condition. We would be loath to see a situation where, for example, a person's wait for elective surgery is delayed or long distances need to be travelled because his or her health fund does not have a purchaser-provider agreement with a convenient hospital or day procedure facility. In my mind nothing is more guaranteed to undermine public confidence in the value of private health insurance than the frustration caused by such delays and inconvenience. This is why the coalition would urge the government not to dismiss the notion of a default benefit and why we will seek to amend the legislation in the other place to achieve this. What is the future of private hospitals under the government's proposal? Since becoming shadow minister for health just over a week ago, I have met with or received submissions from a range of hospital industry groups on this legislation. As the minister would know, this portfolio, perhaps more than any other, has a large number of articulate and keenly interested groups that wish to put a particular point of view. The range of views about what the future holds for private hospitals under the model we are debating vary from the highly optimistic to the overly pessimistic. But the prevailing mood is one of serious uncertainty and concern about the long-term future of private hospitals and other private care facilities. This model changes the relationship between hospitals, health funds and health consumers. By creating a direct reimbursement relationship between the funds and the Health Insurance Commission, and by enabling funds to negotiate purchaser-provider agreements based on casemix, the government is placing the funds in a potentially very powerful position to determine the future shape and direction of private hospital care. There are three groups that are important in private health: the funds, the hospitals and the providers. It is dangerous to give any of those three groups a potential to have a significant advantage over the others. A reasonable balance between those three groups-the providers, the hospitals and the insurers-I believe is in the public interest. My colleagues and I are concerned that the spread of purchaser-provider agreements will make the environment much tougher for many private hospitals, particularly those in non-metropolitan areas for which patient cost of care is often relatively high. I would not like to see a situation where funds negotiate unduly tough agreements, or negotiate not at all, with regional care facilities. I am also concerned that it will be the hospitals that will bear the brunt of cost containment as they; in their turn, contract with practitioners to provide professional services and episodic packages. This model will work only if practitioners are satisfied with the rewards of working in the private sector. If practitioners feel the financial return is not worth their while, they may vote with their feet from a particular private hospital practice, to the detriment of the system and the community as a whole. There are three areas I will talk about briefly that are key objections in my mind. One is the timing for the contracts which is set to be 1 July 1995. We think it would be much more preferable if it were 1 July 1996. Doctors are not the only people who provide services in private hospitals. There are also physiotherapists, occupational therapists and specialist nurses. I have had considerable experience as a provider of some services in orthopaedic surgery. In orthopaedic surgery, the physiotherapists are absolutely crucial. There are people with specialist knowledge of a particular surgeon or a particular type of surgery. Hospitals will have to negotiate with a large range of people. The professional associations covering paramedical and other health professionals are very concerned at the introduction of this legislation. They do not feel that there has been adequate time to consult. They do not feel that three months will be adequate time to have negotiations in place. We are not saying that this will never be finalised, but we are saying that a much more reasonable period of time would be 1 July 1996. Another concern is casemix. I believe casemix, as a general form of hospital care funding, is a very positive development in Australian health care. Spreading casemix to private hospitals and private health insurance is almost inevitable and we do not oppose this per se. As the minister kno-s, there is considerable concern in the provider sector about the speed of implementation of the first phase of this package from 1 April onwards, and about the administrative and planning burdens and costs that this timetable imposes on them. While I am aware that the government is proposing the first phase as a transitional period with the old tables and casemix based agreements coexisting, no one can predict how the market will react when the green light goes up on 1 April. The third area of particular concern that is a key objection of the coalition is the notion of data collection. This is going to provide very substantial information to the government about private health episodes. There is some merit in having that information available. There is merit in some medical practitioners having to face the consequences of their treatment decisions, their prescribing or ordering patterns. I can see merit in people, if they have certain practice patterns that are very high cost, at least being aware of it and having to confront that. I am afraid I cannot see why the government must be the body that collects the information. I cannot see why the government must be the body that has it. The government could still have everything it needs and have an independent authority collecting that information. Anyone who needed it, whether it be government, private insurers or consumer groups, could then have access to it in a sanitised form that protected privacy and the community interest. We will be moving amendments in another place. We will be seeking referral to a committee, not to delay it, because potentially some of these proposals could be worthwhile, but there has not been adequate consultation on what is a very major change to private health insurance. We think that some of these issues need to be fleshed out. We hope the government will look seriously at some of our proposed amendments. We are not able to support this legislation in its present form. If the government is prepared to look at our amendments, we may be able to do so.",104
193,Dr LAWRENCE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"I would like to thank all the contributors to the debate, in particular, the constructive contribution by the current shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I want to outline briefly the context in which we are discussing the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994-that is, a very substantial change over the last decade in the way in which health is financed. I think that is what we really need to talk about-the way in which health is financed in Australia. Australia was a relative latecomer to universal health insurance. Many of our OECD partners have had similar programs for a very long time and have a great deal more experience than we have. Nonetheless, the way that it was introduced in Australia, at least since the mid-1980s, has meant that we have a very substantial and worthy system of health financing in this country. In addition, we have a private health insurance market, we have private health providers, who also have a long history in our country and, again, who are a very worthy and important part of our health system. I will put the private health insurance and private health sector in context. We introduced Medibank in the 1970s. A former Prime Minister, the Hon. Gough Whitlam, introduced for the first time a universal health insurance system. That was subsequently and systematically dismantled under conservative governments, principally by Malcolm Fraser and John Howard, despite very clear promises to the contrary. It was reintroduced as Medicare by Labor in the mid-1980s. Since then it has had very wide public endorsement and acceptance and, indeed, now appears to enjoy the regard of the opposition, at least in its key elementsbasically because it is good policy. When I attended the OECD meeting in Paris last year, it was very clear that Medicare in Australia is held in high regard internationally. Indeed, it is looked to by many developing countries and emerging countries as a model. It is interesting, as the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) indicated yesterday, that our peopleI refer to John Deeble-are now advising the South African government about how they might provide similar support for their community. The central tenet of this government's health policy has always been, now over a 30year period, universal access to high quality public health for all Australians, insured out of the taxation system and with the addition of a Medicare levy. In that context we obviously also value the role of the private health sector and the private health insurance market. But, as I have indicated, the private health sector has essentially an additional supplementary role. That is not to say it is unimportant; nor that it would not be difficult, if the system collapsed tomorrow, to replace it. Of course, it would. Private sector participation rates are therefore, in my view, not the kind of critical issue that has been portrayed by the coalition, because we have a commitment in policy to all Australians to provide universal health access by way of a universal health insurance system. The additions we have to that and the choices they might make through private health insurance essentially supplement that. A large number of Australians elect to have private health coverage. That is their right. The government is intent through this legislation on providing them with value for money. They have a right, as consumers, to get a good product, not to pay too much for it and to know what it covers. They are simply the key elements of these bills. The shadow minister indicated a moment ago in his speech that he thought the private health insurance funds now have too great a role and too much power in determining the outcomes of the private health market. But what we have seen is a shift from the consumers and the private health funds, who, after all, are insuring them against ill health, moving from being price takers-they essentially had no choice about what price they would pay and what the consumers would pay-to price negotiators. They cannot dictate terms because they are required to provide hospital and medical services from the existing arrangement of hospitals and doctors. So, instead of being price takers, forced to negotiate with every hospital on the terms that they insisted upon, now, on behalf of consumers, they can be negotiators and, in my view, as a result of this legislation, get a better result. Let us look at the state of the private health system. We have been told by a number of people that it is in crisis. In the analysis that has been undertaken by the former shadow minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and the current one, I hear resonances-because I meet with these people, too-of some fairly clearly vested private health sector interests. The coalition apparently believes the tales of hardship from the private sector operators and offers what I would say is the time-honoured coalition response-tax breaks and other barely hidden subsidies, rather than putting the wood on the industry to perform better. The fact is that if you dig behind the declining participation rate, and it has been declining since we introduced universal health insurance-indeed, in part it was designed to decline; we did not want to have everybody necessarily in the private health sector, and that is why we introduced universal health insurance-you find that the health insurers at the moment have record levels of reserves. Far from being bankrupt or facing severe problems in meeting emerging demands on their funds, they have reserves well in excess of the statutory requirements-sometimes three and four times what is necessary. That is as likely to be true of the small, closed funds as it is of some of the larger ones. Another fact rather than a myth: private hospitals have record levels of admissions at the moment. I give them credit for the fact that they have moved into the day surgery market. They have got a lot of compensation work. Importantly, as well as the privately insured, they have a range of admissions who have come from those who are self-insured. The profitability in the for-profit sector is at record levels. Look at their end-of-year results. We are not talking here about an industry in decline. If you look at investment levels-you have only to move around, as I do, and visit the private hospitals-you will see that they are at record levels. So investors are continuing to put money into these new capital developments. If they thought there was no future in the private health market, I would say they would not be doing that. I have a great deal of respect for investors. I think they do their homework very carefully. Consumers, however, are pretty disenchanted with what they see as poor value for money products and services. Many of them, as we have seen, have been electing to drop their coverage. The people who have been dropping coverage are those most likely to get poor value for money, that is, the young and the fit. They do not use the services very often, they pay a large amount for it and at the moment they do not regard it as a good investment. And who can blame them? An increasing number of people, too, at the wealthy end of the market are self-insured. That is a market that is waiting to be captured by the insurers if they give them value for money. The opposition's answer to all of this-in so far as I have been able to discern one-is, as we have heard, to oppose this bill, to move some amendments and also to indicate that their proposal would see significant tax subsidisation at the cost of billions of dollars to the public health system. I was very interested to note today that the shadow minister put out a press release suggesting that there were plans afoot to significantly reduce Medicare and other benefits payments, he says to the tune of 10 per cent per annum, amounting over four financial cycles to $5.1 billion. Apart from that being fantasy, I point out to members that, if you actually undertook the sorts of proposals that were endorsed by the party under the former shadow minister, $1.1 billion is considerably less than half that which is actively contemplated by way of tax subsidies. So, unless the opposition has a magic pudding, it has a very shallow understanding of funding in this area. If you take $12 billion, or even if you are operating on the figure of $1.5 billion a year, you have to find it from somewhere. Where do you find it? The public health system. How do you do that? The hospitals then have to foot the bill; they have to find further areas in which to make cuts. The shadow minister disappoints me. He gave a very measured response to the bill, but this particular press release is far from meascoalition ured. It makes some extraordinary claims about things that are not going to occur and, in addition, overlooks the fact that his own party has over time embraced a program that says, 'Let's ensure that there are public subsidies to the tune of $1.5 to $3 billion a year,' depending on who you listen to, which will come from the public purse-from the health budget. Clearly, that is unacceptable. The government's answer to the problems in private health insurance-shock, horror-is competition and an informed market. Those are principles which I would have thought the opposition would readily embrace. I will briefly go through some of the that have been raised in the course of the debate. On my own side, I think it is fair to say that, because of our strong commitment to the Medicare arrangements and the recognition of the complexity inherent in the health sector, we have had recognition of two fundamental points. Firstly, we have had the recognition that the primary role of a strong, vigorous public health system delivered by universal access is the one that we want to reinforce-not so as to diminish the private sector but to recognise that as the means by which Australians' health is protected. Secondly, we have recognised in the legislation benefits to consumers from an increased level of competition and reform in the private sector. It is quite clear that consumers have not known what they were purchasing. They have not been able to compare one product with another. They have not known how much they would be likely to have to meet out of pocket. They have not known what they were buying. This legislation informs them. I am very pleased indeed that the speeches given by those on my side have reflected a deep commitment to Medicare, an understanding of the importance of private health insurance and of the importance of both of these bills to improving the value for money to the consumer. I am pleased to indicate that a number of the contributions made by those opposite conceded support for Medicare. Perhaps it was in the same spirit as the Fraser-Howard dismantled it; nonetheless, it conceded support for it. A continued theme that emerges in contributions by the coalition speakers, however, is what I think is a naive conviction that. private health participation rates is the major health issue in Australia. A number of issues surrounding private health participation are critical-we would not have these bills here otherwise. But what we have heard over the last 10 months--certainly in my time as minister-is an obsession with this issue to the exclusion of many others. For example, how do you continue to fund the emerging demands in the public hospital system? How do you ensure decent relationpoints ships between the Commonwealth and the states to remove cost shifting? They are critical issues which are affecting waiting lists in our public hospitals far more severely than the issues surrounding private health insurance. The other issue that coalition speakers seem to have addressed is their characteristic embrace of regressive subsidies at the expense of universal access. I do not understand, as a minister on this side of the House, how Liberal-National Party politicians will so consistently focus on tax rebates, subsidies, breaks, industry support measures, when in other arenas they argue for the reduction and abolition of restrictive practices. Here we have them advocating precisely that. I will speak briefly to the opposition amendments of the member for MACKellar. They were introduced as her last act in that capacity, and in that last act she accused me of-shock, horror-American proclivities. Mrs Bishop interjecting",108
194,Dr LAWRENCE,PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,"Personal abuse is part of the member for MACKellar's style. It is the opposition that would have Australia blindly stumble into an American style health system. It is precisely opposition policies which do that. The opposition would develop a system without universal access. There would be one system for the rich and one for the poor, one for those who have and one for those who have not. There would be a system where private interests override public good-very clearly the case in the speech by the member for Mackellar-and where quality of care is a function of ability to pay. You get the best if you have got the money. That is precisely what we wish to avoid: an American system where 40 million people have no health cover at all. That is the system we inherited when we came to government in 1983. That is the system which, I am pleased to say, we destroyed. As I indicated earlier, when I met with OECD countries and emerging economies in eastern Europe and the Third World, they very clearly recognised our system as being superior to that of the United States. The officials who were there at that meeting, who had just seen the Clinton amendments fail, were in despair because they did not know how they could possibly provide universal access to health care for their citizens without very significant amendments. I will address the amendments briefly, point by point. They are, in my view, very simplistic and shallow. I am pleased, at least, that new shadow minister is proposing to move some more specific and carefully worded amendments in another place. Firstly, it is claimed that these reforms will not stop the decline in health insurance. Quite clearly, these reforms provide a framework for the industry to improve its efficiency and, in many cases, despite difficulty in doing so, there has already been significant negotiation of reductions. There will also be an ability for the industry, for the first time, to develop products people recognise as value for money. This will actually mean that people will know what they are buying; they can compare costs; and they will make sensible decisions. I cannot think of a better way to place pressure on producers than that. It is up to the industry, not taxpayers, to pull the customers back through the doors. That is the difference in our approach. Secondly, it is said that these reforms restrict freedom of choice-quite to the contrary. The choice of products will be significantly enhanced because the insurers and the hospitals have a capacity to negotiate new agreements. If doctors do have contracts, people will be better off with either known or zero out-of-pocket costs. If that is not an improvement in freedom of choice, I do not know what is. So many people right at this moment do not know what they are likely to get by way of a bill until some weeks after they have been discharged. In relation to default payments, both the current shadow minister and the former one said that we needed default payments, otherwise there would be unfair practices and the funds would refuse to deal with certain hospitals or doctors. That is very unlikely but, in any case, the Trade Practices Commission has powers to prevent that from occurring. There is no evidence and, when you think about it, no rationale to suggest that efficient, quality private hospitals of any size-large or small-will be adversely affected by the proposed contracting arrangements. To set default payments at 50 per cent or some other level hardly meets the hospitals' the costs; it is hardly going to be attractive to them. And, if the consumer has to meet the balance, how will that assist them in any way? It would be no more than a sop and it certainly would not be appealing to the funds, the doctors or, for that matter, to the hospitals. The discussions I have had with those of them who are thinking clearly recognise that the funds will not be able to avoid them. They have consumers who are saying, 'I want to go to my neighbourhood hospital; I want to go to my regional hospital. I want to that negotiate with these doctors. If you do not have a package with them, I will go somewhere else.' That is precisely the way in which this industry should operate. The current shadow minister, also in relation to this particular element, indicated that small insurance funds would have difficulty in negotiating with large hospitals. The fact is that they are already acting in concert. They have set up various arrangements whereby they will not act as a single institution or a single organisation; they will be working very closely with one another to ensure that they get a good deal. In relation to these amendments, I turn to community rating. What is outlined in these amendments is absolutely wrong. By law, the funds have to offer a product which covers all episodes of hospital treatment. That is what the legislation requires. So they cannot get around community rating. If, for some reason, their product deviates from that, we have 60 days in advance of the product being marketed. That is what the bill requires. They have to notify us in advance so we can assess it and see whether it violates the principles of community rating. The department will examine these products and ensure that they do not. At the moment, we do not have the capacity; we have to act after the fact. In addition, the amendments suggest that there is no specific appeal mechanism. At this stage, the complaints go to a commissioner who essentially has a conciliatory and recommendatory role. The commissioner is not arbitrating. We have indicated that in future we may wish to do that, and at that point it will obviously be appropriate to introduce appeal mechanisms. In the meantime, these are essentially contracts between hospitals and insurance funds, hospitals and doctors, and doctors and insurance funds, and they can be dealt with appropriately under the Trade Practices Act. The amendments state that the bill grants the minister excessive power. I have to say that the so-called power is no different from that which exists in the current arrangements, and the applicable benefit arrangements are not ones in which the minister is involved. The amendment is simply wrong on that score. The applicable benefit arrangements are between the parties concerned. The minister has no power to intervene, nor is it sought in the legislation. The health funds will be appropriately oversighted to protect the individual contributors to such funds. That can hardly be seen as excessive ministerial power. In relation to the privacy questions, why would it be better to put it in the hands of an independent body or, as the honourable member for Mackellar said in her speech, a private commercial body? I think that would be the worse possible arrangement. We have had extensive consultations with the Privacy Commissioner regarding these reforms, and all of the comments the Privacy Commissioner has made have been appropriately taken into account in the structure of these reforms. In conclusion, the principles of this legislation are to focus on consumer rights and increase the level of competition-principles that I thought would have been embraced by the opposition. In doing that, we want to provide value for money for private health insurance and a wider choice of products. These objectives can be achieved by enabling health funds to make contracts with hospitals and doctors-realistic ones, not ones based on some phoney constraints. We also want to ensure efficiency measures and equitable access. In my view, the policy of the bill and the opposition's response clearly highlight the differences between Labor government practice and coalition rhetoric. Look at the key words: 'consumer rights', 'competition', 'value for money', 'equity', 'access' and 'choice'. In 12 years of government, we have been taking action, implementing and reforming. For 20 years the coalition has been talking, vacillating and shifting ground-both when in opposition and in those years of lost opportunity when the now recycled Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. I commend the bill to the House. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mrs Bishop's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [6.56 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr N.J.

197,Mr GEAR,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Background For many years the income tax law has been criticised for being too difficult to read and understand. This difficulty has led to: unnecessarily high compliance costs for taxpayers; increased administration costs for government; and inaccurate compliance by taxpayers. In November 1993, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended the setting up of a broadly based Task Force to rewrite the income tax law. The following month, the former Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, announced the tax law improvement project. The project's goals are to reduce compliance costs and to improve compliance by restructuring and rewriting Australia's income tax law so that it is more easily understood. The project is not a policy review, but it will provide opportunities to remove unnecessary complexity and cost from the administrative requirements of the law. The project team includes personnel from the Australian Taxation Office, the Treasury and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. In addition, I have appointed two private sector representatives to the project's leadership, as well as setting up a 14-person consultative committee drawn exclusively from outside the government sector. The project will run for three years from 1 July 1994. Substantiation The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994 is the first new law to be brought forward by the project team. Early in the life of the project, the team identified the need to rewrite part of the existing law as a possible legislative model that could be publicly tested and assessed through processes of consultation. The substantiation provisions were chosen because they affect seven out of 10 taxpayers. These provisions set out the rules to be followed in claiming deductions for work related expenses. I released an exposure draft bill in August of last year, and over 3,500 copies were distributed. As well, the members of the project held well-attended seminars around Australia to discuss the bill. Overall, feedback from the consultation process was very positive. It indicated that redraft was much easier to understand and could be expected to lead to a significantly greater use of the tax law itself as a source of information for tax practitioners and others who need to understand the law. More importantly, most people who took part thought the proposed changes would reduce their compliance costs. What the Bill does This bill makes improvements to the substantiation provisions of the law that may be considered in three parts. They are: a clear, helpful structure and layout; plain language in a personable style; cutting back administrative requirements that are unnecessarily complex or out of touch with current commercial reality or normal behaviour. Changes to structure The bill significantly changes the structure and order in which the substantiation law is presented, so that the important requirements of the law are more easily found. One of the innovations of the bill is the use of highlighted key principles at the start of each major segment of the bill. These give readers a simple entry point. As well the bill makes extensive use of navigational aids to identify, and guide readers to, those provisions relevant to them. Changes to language The existing law has been completely rewritten in clear, everyday language that tries to anticipate the needs of its readers. To make readers more comfortable in following the law, the bill introduces another innovation by addressing the reader personally throughout as 'you', using a tone that is essentially friendly and not bureaucratic. Greater use is made within the text of examples and notes to provisions. The bill is shorter, clearer, simpler and more readable than the present law. Overall, the legislation has been reduced by almost half. Changes to administrative requirements In order to make the procedural rules less the cumbersome, the main changes proposed by this bill are as follows. The existing log book rules for calculating car expenses are so complicated that few taxpayers fully understand them. The greatest complexity is in working out what percentage of your car expenses you can deduct. The bill will greatly simplify this calculation and reduce the occasions when a new log book must be kept. This is one area of the bill where the approach taken in the exposure draft bill has been further improved as a result of the extensive consultation process. Access to the 'cents per kilometre' method of calculating car deductions will be extended so that more taxpayers can use it. The cents per kilometre method is the most often used of the four methods available for calculating car expense deductions. Currently, it cannot be used at all if business is more than the 5,000 kilometres in a year. That restriction will be eased so that claims up to 5,000 kilometres can be based on this method even if business kilometres are more than this. The maximum claim remains unchanged at 5,000 kilometres. Record keeping requirements will be eased in several ways. For example: taxpayers will be able to claim up to $150 worth of deductible home laundry expenses without needing to keep receipts. This common sense change has been particularly well received in the community; taxpayers will no longer be required to go to the trouble of signing every entry in a logbook or travel diary; in recognition of practical realities, taxpayers will be able to annotate receipts from suppliers if they contain insufficient information to identify the goods or services supplied. The exception from substantiation for taxpayers who claim no more than $300 of work and car expenses will be effectively widened by excluding car expenses from the limit. Most taxpayers with car expenses usually have such large claims that they are unable to benefit from the exception, even though their other work expenses may total less than $300. By excluding car expenses, these taxpayers will not have to substantiate their other work expenses within the $300 limit. Date of effect So that the benefit of improvements, including simpler administrative requirements, can be available to taxpayers in the current income year, the changes will apply to expenses incurred from 1 July 1994. A special saving provision will apply for the 1994-95 income year to ensure that nobody can be detrimentally affected by any of the changes. Revenue Impact None of the proposed changes result in a gain to the revenue. Overall, the changes may result in a cost to revenue of about $2 million to $5 million per annum. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory travel memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House.",113
198,Mr ROCHER,TAX LAW IMPROVEMENT,"The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994 was introduced into the House on 8 December last year. As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has pointed out, the bill sets out to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Whilst coalition members support and welcome the work put into this proposed legislation, we have some reservations and criticisms that I will enumerate later. They should not be taken in any way to detract from our support for the legislation. Most of the criticisms, I suggest, will be constructive, although there will be some of a more general nature. The bill completely rewrites the substantiation rules for deductions for work, business, travel and car expenses incurred on or after 1 July 1994. The changes were not formally announced but the bill was preceded by an exposure draft in August 1994 which was subject to extensive consultation, as the minister has pointed out. The draft was titled 'Tax law improvement project paper substantiation-Exposure draft No.1 August 1994'. Over 200 submissions and questionnaires were received by the project team which worked on the draft bill. Many of the issues raised in those submissions have been addressed. The changes to substantiation are largely the same as those in the draft; although actual provisions have been renumbered, and in some cases reformatted and relocated. With the exception of certain items such as laundry expenses, the provisions in the bill actually reflect existing legislation. The bill is approximately half the size of existing substantiation legislation encompassed in present sections 82KT to 82KZBB inclusive. Two schedules, schedule 2A calculating car expenses and schedule 2B substantiation, are to be inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act but do not repeal the existing substantiation provisions. Instead, they will remain as schedules until they can be transferred into a new income tax law framework which, we are advised, is currently being developed. In addition, there are a number of consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, income tax regulations, and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act following the restructuring, rewriting and renumbering of the substantiation provisions. The bill adopts a plain English style, including the use of the personal pronoun 'you' to refer to taxpayers. There is also a new numbering system which has been designed to avoid current numbering problems. The bill also makes it clear that the substantiation provisions apply to individuals-not including trustees-and partnerships, including a natural person. The position with the application of substantiation requirements to partnerships has not been clear under existing legislation. This bill is the first product of the tax law improvement project. The tax law improvement project was announced by the government in December 1993 with the object of rewriting the income tax law in simple language. The project started on 1 July 1994 and is expected to take three years to complete the task. The project has a consultative committee of 14 members made up of representatives of accounting and legal firms, the Australian Society of Chartered Practising Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Corporate Tax Association, the National Farmers Federation and the Taxation Institute of Australia Also, there are two private sector representatives. The announcement followed a recommendation by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts made in November 1993 that the government establish a broadly based task force to redraft the principal act. The project has also released a broad framework. It makes clear that the project is not about reforming the tax system or reviewing tax policy. It will focus on administrative rules that are overly complex, unnecessary or out of date with today's reality. However, the framework made clear that: When redrafting, the project team may come across provisions where the meaning is unclear. Those cases may require the Government to clarifY the policy, so the law can be more clearly written. The new rules are designed to be shorter, clearer, simpler and more readable than is the present law. This is to be achieved by restructuring, renumbering and rewriting the legislation as has already been indicated. The aim is to reduce compliance costs by rewriting the principal act and other tax laws so that it is easier to understand-an aim, I am afraid to say, on this first example which will only be partially successful. At the current pace at which the project team is working, the objectives cannot be met until early next century, although I personally would hope that there is some improvement on that possible timetable. The project team has indicated that it is also looking at depreciation, research and development, and primary production losses. The major shortcoming with this whole exercise has been the narrowness of the review. Complex tax policy issues which need to be addressed to achieve any major simplification of the tax system have been totally ignored in this bill with the emphasis of this project resting 100 per cent on using plain English and adopting a simple legislative structure. This is to be commended but, as I will go on to outline, it goes nowhere near far enough. The bill provides that the new substantiation provisions will apply to expenses incurred on or after I July 1994. This contrasts with the exposure draft which provided for a 1 July 1995 starting date. The existing law will apply only to expenses incurred before 1 July 1994, obviously. However, a special provision is included so that in the 1994-95 income year, if the new law would deny a deduction allowable under the existing law or allow a lesser deduction than under the existing law, a taxpayer can nevertheless claim the amount allowable under the old law. The substantiation provisions affect seven out of 10 taxpayers. The number of people estimated to be affected is 5.4 ers. As the Assistant Treasurer pointed out, the financial impact of this bill will be minimal. Most of the administrative changes will have no impact on the revenue, with the exception of the removal of car expenses from the $300 substantiation threshold exemption, which will cost up to $10 million per annum, I understand. Most measures should reduce compliance costs but there will be some increase in compliance costs for individual business persons who undertake short-term domestic travel over a period of one to five nights inclusive. Presently, they are not required to maintain any records but the bill requires that they obtain written evidence. Also the compliance costs to salary and wage earners will increase for those who must now retain records for five years instead of 3 Y2 years they will be disadvantaged and incur additional costs, presumably. The main substantive changes proposed to make the substantiation rules less cumbersome are as follows: for car expenses, logbook rules are now less complex or will be under this legislation. This development is welcome, although the complex requirement to maintain a logbook remains the same. Taxpayers can base their business use percentage on a reasonable estimate of the number of kilometres the car travels during the year in the course of producing assessable income. But taxpayers must keep a new logbook for a stipulated period every five years to establish the basis of allowable expenditure in subsequent years. This reduces the number of situations in which a new logbook must be kept and that is to taxpayers' advantage. Car expenses will now be calculated by the cents per kilometre method. The application of this method of calculating car expense deductions will be extended so that taxpayers who travel more than 5,000 business kilometres may claim for 5,000 kilometres. However, car expenses will now be exempt from the scope of the $300 substantiation-free concession. This change has occurred because in the past, when car expenses were significant, the $300 limit was easily exceeded, with the result that both work and car expenses had million taxpay- to be substantiated. The substantiation requirements for travel expenses are to be standardised by removing the need for taxpayers to keep a diary for short-term overseas travel and requiring business taxpayers to get written evidence of expenses incurred during short-term domestic travel. In future, taxpayers will be able to claim up to $150 for deductible laundry expenses without providing receipts. Existing law requires taxpayers to substantiate all laundry expenses, and we know what a nonsense that proved to be. The bill requires taxpayers to keep records for five years. This will reduce the period which business taxpayers must keep records by a period of two years, but increase it for salary and wage earners by some 18 months. and This change will, no doubt, require taxpayers to take greater care in keeping records. I hope and trust they become aware of that obligation and the extended period for which they must maintain those records. Taxpayers, generally, are not good at record maintenance procedures and are more likely to either misplace, lose or unintentionally dispose of the required substantiation receipts within a period of five years or even less. Under the new rules, taxpayers are required to obtain written evidence for allowable expenditure in three different categories. The first of these is for work expenses. The second is for domestic and overseas business travel expenses for which a travel diary must be kept if a person is away from his or her ordinary residence for six or more nights in a row. Similarly, the third category is for car expenses other than fuel and oil expenses if the taxpayer uses the one-third of actual expenses method or the logbook method to calculate car expenses. Odometer records must be kept for car expenses if the one-third of actual expenses method is used, the expenses are for fuel and oil, and the taxpayer does not get written evidence of it. Substantiation is not now required for some six or seven categories of allowable expenditure. The first is work expenses of $300 or less, including laundry expenses, but not travel or meal allowance expenses or expenses covered by an award transport payment. The second category that does not require substantiation, as has already been mentioned, is laundry expenses of $150 or less. The third category not requiring substantiation involves expenses, on motor vehicles that are not cars-for example, a motorcycle---or are not owned or leased-for example, a borrowed car-unless it is a taxi fare or similar expense or an expense incurred in travel outside Australia. ' Substantiation in the fourth category covers expenses by an award transport payment-that is, transport payment covering travel paid under an industrial instrument in force at 29 October 1986-if the taxpayer claims less than the amount payable on 29 October 1986. The fifth category includes overtime meal allowance expenses covered by an allowance payable under an Australian law. If the commissioner considers the amount the taxpayer claims to be reasonable, the expense will not have to be substantiated. The sixth category is expenses covered by travel allowance. If the commissioner considers the amount the taxpayer claims is reasonable, having regard to expenses it would be reasonable to incur for travel within A ustralia, the expenses will not have to be substantiated on accommodation, food, drink or incidental travel expenses or, if overseas, on food, drink or incidental travel expenses. In that case, taxpayers must still keep travel records. Travel records, however, are not needed for travel allowance expenses covered by, and not more than, a travel allowance for travel principally overseas if the expenses are incurred by an aircraft crew member. The following written evidence will be required for depreciation expenses. Taxpayers must obtain written evidence in the form of a document from the supplier of the property which sets out the name of the supplier, the cost of the property to the taxpayer, the of the property, the day the taxpayer acquired the property and the date of the document. Written evidence for expenses other than depreciation must be obtained from the supplier of the goods or services setting out the name of the supplier, the amount of the expense in the currency incurred, the nature of the goods or services, the day the expense was incurred and the date of the document. If a document from a supplier does not show the nature of the property, goods or services, then the taxpayers can add that information themselves. If the supplier's document does not show the day the expense was incurred, then a taxpayer can use a bank statement or other reasonable independent evidence to show that it was paid. It is rather onerous on the part of the Australian Taxation Office to expect taxpayers, every time they purchase goods and services, to check that the receipt they have obtained contains all the required information. If the receipt is lacking the required information, the taxpayer will have' - to fill in the missing gaps before lodging a tax return. This occurs in an environment where no supplier of goods and services is legally compelled under any state or federal law to actually provide an original receipt, invoice or statement in such a format. Almost every receipt received by a taxpayer would fail to record the statutory requirements now to be imposed by those provisions. A taxpayer can make his or her own record of expenses instead of getting a document from a supplier if each expense to be deducted is $10 or less, all of them total $200 or less, or the commissioner considers it unreasonable to expect a taxpayer to get a document from the supplier. The taxpayer should, however, record in a diary, or similar document, details of activities undertaken during travel in the course of producing assessable income. If this is not done, the activities cannot be taken into account in apportioning travel expenses. The details in such a case to be recorded are: the nature of the travel activity, the day and approximate time it began, how long it lasted nature and where the taxpayer engaged in it. A complete copy can substitute for original documents which are lost or destroyed. If the commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer took reasonable precautions to prevent the loss or destruction, the deduction is not affected if the document was not written evidence. If the document was written evidence, the taxpayer must try to get a substitute document with the same information. If it is not reasonably possible to do that, then the deduction is not affected. With this bill the government has missed the opportunity to simplify complex tax policy, which is what taxpayers and businesses really need. Those examples of requirements still in force illustrate that point. The tax law improvement project is only about using plain English and a simpler and easier to follow legislative structure-nothing more, nothing less. Most of the changes in the current substantiation requirements are not significant enough. While they are important, such as the removal of requirements, including the signing of every entry in a logbook and keeping records for laundry expenses, the process must go further. Having a look at the clock, it might suit the convenience of the House if I interrupted my remarks again. Debate interrupted. NA",115
199,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Darwen, Mr H., OBE",119
200,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"We in this House pay tribute from time to time to past members and also to the work of outstanding Australians. It gives me great pleasure tonight to pay tribute in that same way to a person whom I can only describe as being one of the finest Australians, but a person most members of this House would not know. As he believed in and respected the institution of parliament-although he did not always agree with it-I believe it is a worthy tribute. Henry Darwen died on 21 October 1994. On that day Australia lost a fine Australian. At the same time, the town of Bowen in North Queensland lost probably one of its most dedicated sons and citizens. There are few people to whom one can attribute as many positive initiatives in their lives as one can to Henry Darwen in his 81 years. He was born in 1913 and in his 81 years not only served his country and community but was a great example for what he contributed to his family and community. Few have been respected in the way he was. He used his 81 years to advance his community, to defend his country in war and also to defend Bowen in peace. He was born in Bowen and his father was the editor and publisher of the local paper and was mayor for a term of three years. I believe this set a pattern for the contribution he was later to make. He went into the publishing business at the Bowen Independent very early in 1929 and served on that paper until it was sold to a conglomerate in 1985. He took great pride in the fact that, at the time of the sale, the Bowen Independent was one of the only two purely family independent papers in Queensland. As a publisher, he used his efforts at all times to promote the community and the development in Bowen, his home town. Bowen people are very restrictive in their views of history. They believe that Bowen instead of Townsville should have been the port for Mount Isa. There is also the age factor. Bowen was one of the first communities settled in North Queensland-if not the firstand is positioned on one of the great natural harbours. Despite that, Townsville won the contract to be the outlet for Mount Isa. Notwithstanding that, Henry Darwen did everything he could to promote Bowen. In the time of Dr Peter Delamothe's membership of the state parliament, Mr Darwen assisted him in all ways that would give further recognition to Bowen. He served on the local council as the deputy mayor and was always prepared to jump in and do the things that were required. In this year where Australia remembers its activities during the Second World War, it is fitting to comment that he served his country. He joined the eMF as a member of the Bowen Detachment in 1936; was active in service between 1941 and 1945; and served in Cape York, Dutch New Guinea and Northern New Guinea and was discharged as a sergeant. In both peace and war, in all of his activities he was able to maintain a sense of direction with his family and within the community. He was a member of the Anglican Church and assisted it in every way he could. He was also the chairman of the Bowen Harbour Board, with the firm belief still that Bowen should have been the port for North Queensland instead of Townsville, and he did everything he could to further that view. He was awarded an OBE in 1975 for his achievements in public life of remarkable standard and diversity. It is sad to know that Henry Darwen in life is no more. But he lives on because so many of us are happy and privileged to have known him and to be able to claim a friendship with him both in business and personally, which is a fine thing to be able to say. To Mary, his wife, I would like to say that Mavis, my wife, and I admire and recognise her role and contribution to the partnership and marriage. (Time expired) Road Transport Authority New South Wales Bike Ride",119
201,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to herald an event which will take place within my electorate at Bundanoon on 4 March. I refer to the RTA New South Wales bike ride. I congratulate all those involved the work that has been done over the last two years to bring this event to my electorate. It is with some degree of pride that I stand here and take some of the credit for this, having been the person who initiated the whole program so those in my electorate could go out as a community and put a bid to the New South Wales Bicycle Institute to hold the bike tide. There was a degree of cynicism and scepticism about my motives. They evaporated once we won the bid and the realisation came that somewhere in the order of $700,000 to stage the event would be focused on my electorate and that it was estimated that towns along the route would earn in the vicinity of $30,000 a night when the participants went through those villages and townships. This has not happened all by itself. I feel privileged to be part of the leadership team which has put this together for the benefit of the people in our area. This event is not a one-off occurrence from their federal member. It has been followed up by a very successful seminar with the small business people and tourism operators in my electorate to discuss green jobs and the delivery of green jobs subsequent to a number of environmental decisions which were favourable to my electorate. That seminarwhich was attended by Trish Caswell, the President of the ACF, and the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee)-gave some heartened direction towards our bid to provide tourism as a vehicle for obtaining jobs and for capturing income which was generated outside our region. Mr Speaker, being a fellow member of IREDO, you would be aware that our approach has been to take a regional focus. I have had discussions today with certain people within the tourist industry in my electorate who are looking to make this New South Wales RTA bike ride a showcase for my electorate-the beginning of a package of approaches to market our area for the year 2000 games. Many people claim that politicians indulge in rhetoric and little else. I ask the House to acknowledge that, if we sustain our effort towards a goal within a public framework and for if we are clear in our direction and then follow through with the goodwill of those who are also involved, we can achieve substantial gains for ourselves and our communities. I hope this House sees the coming event of the RTA New South Wales bike ride, which will have a great effect on the localised and small communities within my electorate, as a substantial boost to the economies and the small businesses in what is an off-peak tourist period. Our coast is inundated during the Christmas period. Again, at Easter we attract a large number of tourists from the Sydney region and elsewhere. But there is a slight lull in March and this event was timed to capture and continue the employment of those people through what would have been a small lull in the tourist operations. I believe the success of that boost has been very much guaranteed by the amount of work involved. I would like to pay credit to the councils involved, to the New South Wales Bicycle Institute and to all those who have participated and given their goodwill towards something which is non-political but constitutes an economic advantage for my electorate. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport",120
202,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (7.40 p.m.)Since the misguided decision by federal cabinet in 1945 to develop Kingsford-Smith as an international airport there has been endless controversy. Even in the 1940s it was obviously an unsuitable site, on any unbiased view. For 50 years almost all decision making has been short term and driven by vested interests. It was not until 1980 that the reality was officially recognised in the Sydney region outline plan review as follows: The present location of the airport (Kingsford Smith) is inappropriate for a city the size of Sydney: the site is too small, expansion would adversely affect the bay, the port and the surrounding community. Three out of four approach paths to the airport are over dense urban development giving rise to real concern over safety, and the road traffic to serve the airport is causing increasing congestion on the local road system. There is no doubt that a major airport located on a green fields site and connected to inner Sydney by high standard road and rail links is the only solution to catering for Sydney's future airport needs. That analysis was first made in the 1940s. In 1995 it is now accepted by every thinking person except the vested interests. Yet over the years captive governments and bureaucracies have poured billions of dollars in public subsidies into Kingsford-Smith. Beginning from an area about the size of two football fields, the airport has steadily gobbled up a large part of Sydney. First Ascot racecourse went, then the New Brighton and Bonnie Doon golf courses. Cooks River was moved, two or three lakes filled, a substantial part of Botany Bay taken and a railway line removed. Huge surrounding areas have been taken by airport related infrastructure. Thousands of homes have been demolished. Now hundreds more will be demolished at Sydenham, and thousands more along the flight paths and land transport routes will slowly decay and cease to be livable. It is the single biggest cause of urban sprawl in the metropolitan area except, of course, for the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority. The airport and its adjoining infrastructure are now occupying land on which some 200,000 people could be living at relatively low densities. The fact that 200,000 are instead living on the urban fringe has imposed massive urban consolidation costs on the community--costs which make those of a new airport almost insignificant. After all this, we have a third rate airport with split passenger terminals, on a minuscule site which cannot even cope with the Olympics and has no long-term future. It suffers enormous air traffic congestion and a permanent curfew. Airline competition is stifled by the outrageous 30-year domestic terminal leases to Ansett and Qantas. It is a massive health hazard to both passengers and residents alike, located as it is adjoining the Sydney CBD, with the runways aligned with Australia's highest density residential area and a major petro-chemical works: the whole miasma stirred along by the self-serving Federal Airports Corporationsoon to be disbanded-and the Civil Aviation Authority, a shattered and discredited organisation. The present major health studies being conducted will underline not only the deleterious effects of aircraft noise but the toxic effects of aircraft emissions. In addition, residential areas in inner and middle Sydney are being forced to increase residential densities in a futile attempt to make up for the residential land inexorably lost to the airport. On any rational basis-economic, social or environmental-it is impossible to keep an expanding international airport in the densest part of Sydney. All that can be done in the short term is: firstly, to implement a range of noise minimisation procedures-not on the inhuman political basis of apportioning as much noise as possible to those in the state and federal seats on the northern flight path, but on the basis of equity; and, secondly, to accelerate the construction of Badgerys Creek as a replacement airport for Kingsford-Smith by, say, 2005. A twin airport solution is hopeless and the proposal of long-term leasing of Kingsford Smith to private enterprise would entrench this and all the other problems with no solution possible. It would be uneconomic and inefficient and preclude the massive economic, social and environmental benefits of redeveloping Kingsford-Smith residentially. It is almost beyond belief that in half a century of airport development no cost benefit study has been prepared for this or for the effect on Sydney of any of the major works carried out at the airport. East Perth Project",121
203,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Earlier this week in question time, I asked a question of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) in respect of the East Perth project which is being carried out in my electorate under the better cities progra-. I refer to the schedule to the agreement between the Commonwealth and the state of Western Australia. In the schedule to the agreement in respect of the East Perth project, one of the objectives of the project is described as being 'to promote and increase housing choice and affordability'. The schedule also states: While market housing will be the main emphasis dwellings for public and special needs housing be purchased and developed. A research and development program will be initiated to establish an appropriate mechanism for the provision of affordable housing. In August of last year the Deputy Prime Minister visited the East Perth project and, as a result of representations made by me and my state parliamentary colleague, the state member for Perth, Diana Warnock, he publicly repeated on that occasion the Commonwealth's commitment to affordable housing and made representations to the East Perth Redevelopment Authority that affordable housing plans be producedFollowing that, on 23 August 1994, in the Guardian Express newspaper, one of my local newspapers, it was stated: East Perth Redevelopment Authority chief executive Michael Ratcliffe reconfirmed the government's commitmentto providing affordable housing but refused to say when or how. ""There are a number of mechanisms currently being examined and specific projects are being formalised. "" As a result of patience but seeing no action, a couple of Sundays ago, on 22 January-and following the release of the first lots of the East Perth project, where vacant lots were sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, far beyond the reach of ordinary Western Australian taxpayers-bearing in mind, of course, that $100 million worth of taxpayers' funds are going to this project-my state colleague, Diana Warnock and I released a statement where we called upon the Deputy Prime Minister not to provide 1995-96 better cities program funds to Western Australia until the state government had produced its affordable housing plan for East Perth. In the release that day, Diana Warnock and I stated: We understand that a report from the East Perth RedevelopmentAuthority is currently languishing before the State Minister for Planning, Richard Lewis. We understand the report recommends a modest 50 residential units be allocated for affordable housing purposes. In response to that, the state government, through the Executive Officer of the Redevelwill opment Authority, publicly said-and I quote from the Channel 10 news on Sunday, 22 January, and repeated on the ABC Radio news on the same day and the ABC Channel 2 TV news: 50's only the first component of a much larger program that we've got planned for providing affordable housing in East Perth. Overall probably by the time the project's fully built out there could be several hundred. Members will not be surprised to realise that the following day, it was reported in the West Australian of January 23: Mr Smith and Ms Warnock said they welcomed the commitment to 50 affordable units but called on Mr Ratcliffe to release details of the broader picture. Following that, on 31 January, page 2 of the Guardian Express, under the heading 'Affordable house plans ""imminent''', it was stated: The release of plans showing how affordable housing in the East Perth redevelopment will be provided is ""imminent"". That's the word from East Perth Redevelopment Authority chiefexecutive officer Michael Ratcliffe ""I can't say exactly when but, yes, it is nent."" Following my question to the Deputy Prime Minister this week, I find in the West Australian of Tuesday 7 February, in a report entitled 'Snag over housing cash' the following comment from the East Perth Redevelopment Authority Chief Executive Michael Ratcliffe: However, itthe authority-,., was stilI negotiating with private companies and could not release the plan until those talks had finished later this year. So what do I have, Mr Speaker? On 23 January this year I have a comprehensive plan that is in existence; on 31 of January the release of that plan is imminent; and on 7 February that plan is not yet complete and will be released later this year. That tells me a couple of things. It tells me, firstly, that East Perth Redevelopment Authority is acting under instructions from the state government to drag its feet on affordable housing and not to fulfil its affordable housing commitments; secondly, it tells me that there is no commitment on the part of the state government for affordable housing in East Perth; and, thirdly, it tells me that, unless the state government is relentlessly pursued on this matter, East Perth will become a enclave for the rich and not provide for any reasonable amount of affordable housing. Some people in this business are publicly spirited. I have now in my possession a copy of 'East Perth Redevelopment AuthorityAffordable Housing in East Perth: A position summary', which was released privately to me because the state government refused to do so. This is an East Perth RedevelopmentAuthority plan which provides for an 'active program of assisted housing which will provide 50 residential units to low and moderate income households in East Perth'. This position paper argues that, because 50 affordable housing units will be erected in the first three years, in accordance with the better cities program, this will result in a rich social mix and 'advanced equity and social justice' . 'Rich' is the right word. With 50 units out of a $100 million project, it is for the rich. As I have previously, I call upon the state government immito release its comprehensive plans now. It cannot get away with this sleight of hand-to use $100 million worth of taxpayers' funds to provide only 50 affordable housing units in East Perth. (Time expired) Cranbourne: Medicare Office",122
204,Mr ATKINSON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, having been identified by Coopers and Lybrand as the third fastest growing area in Australia; the former city of Cranbourne, now part of the city of Casey, has many urgent needs. SomeÂ· of these are being addressed. I am pleased to say, for instance, that some cooperation between the federal and state governments will see the extension of electric train services. to Cranbourne by an expected date of late March this year. However, Cranbourne still lacks a Medicare office. Residents with cash or cheque claims the for Medicare, Medibank Private or the new child-care allowance have to travel to the nearest Medicare office at either Parkmore, Keysborough, Frankston or Dandenong. Cranbourne businesses also lose possible takings since the location of a Medicare office can be an important factor in where residents spend their shopping dollars. I know that the Health Insurance Commission will immediately say, 'We have no spare cash to lease and fit out a new office, or to run it with the minimum six staff that we run metropolitan offices with.' May I suggest that, with the Dandenong and Frankston offices both handling in excess of 1,000 claims on many days-the latter having particular difficulties in coping with workloads-any future growth at either of these offices will almost certainly require new office accommodation. Rentals in Cranbourne will typically be cheaper than in Dandenong or Frankston. I agree with the Health Insurance Commission that any new offices must be affordable. Surely, if it can save thousands of dollars through not having to expand in these district centres, that should be a major stumbling block cleared in obtaining the go-ahead for a Cranbourne office. The proportion of bulk-billing-or, as the commission calls it, direct billing-of patients by medical practitioners is now at a statewide average of almost 60 per cent, but for Cranbourne it is only 45 per cent. It certainly is not correctto assume that all doctors bulk-bill in the outer suburbs. This means that there would most likely be a greater than average number of cash claims at any new Cranbourne office for each 1,000 client visits, at least the Medicare side of the office's operationsand Medicare typically accounts for 50 to 60 per cent of an office's workload. Cranbourne has about 10,000 children under the age of five. With about five families moving into the area on a daily basis, it is easy to see that figure rapidly growing. Since many parents will now be claiming the home child-care allowance through Medicare offices, the high percentage of young people in the Cranbourne community further shows the urgent need for a Medicare office in Cranbourne. People from Phillip Island and Wonthaggi presently have to travel to Dandenong to lodge their claims. Not only would their travelling time be reduced but they could also shop in Cranbourne and bring further shopping dollars to Cranbourne. I also note that the Health Insurance Commission opened a new office at Waurn Ponds last year after many years of pressure from my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) for a facility on the southern side of the Barwon River. I commend my colleague for his efforts. However, while I think we all recognise that area around Geelong to be fast growing, it is outstripped by the rate at which Cranbourne is expanding. If Waurn Ponds can be the recipient of a new office, why not Cranbourne? I intend to continue pressing this Labor government for a new Medicare office in Cranbourne. The local community urgently needs this facility. Its provision would reduce likely future expenditures elsewhere by the Health Insurance Commission. Australian Prospectors and Miners Hall of Fame",123
205,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, tonight I want to commend the Australian Prospectors and Miners Hall of Fame committee in Kalgoorlie. This group--(Quorum formed) I must say that, at this late hour in the adjournment debate when members try to get out information often relevantto their electorates, it is a little galling to have this simpering on saurian from Mackellar interrupt the debate. I was making the point that the Australian Prospectors and Miners Hall of Fame Committee is doing a great job in promoting the establishment of this facility in the Goldfields. Three sites have been proposed-in Ora Banda, in Coolgardie and in Kalgoorlie itself. It is modelled, of course, on the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach, and it is designed to give the public at large an insight into all aspects of the mining industry, from prospecting to mining. A repository will be formed. I might use the words of Kris Laurie, the project consultant. She said: The primary objects are: To establish a Public Museum, Art Gallery and Mining Heritage Precinct to act as a repository for historic records, artefacts and equipment of National significance relating to Prospecting and Mining activities; together with a recognition of the people and stories behind the material. To develop the facility as a centre for learning about prospecting and mining in Australia and the relationship with society, the economy and the environment. To acquire and maintain a collection of fine art that adequately reflects and represents the concepts for which the APMHF was established. It is not, however, just a museum. The plan of the committee is to have an ongoing facility which is being continually added to. As progress develops in the mining industry, new exhibits will be installed. It is planned to have a facility which is very much interactive. In the tourist mine in the Goldfields, we already have excellent examples of how well interactive facilities can relate to the public. I had a lot more to say but, as I said, I was stopped by the petulant actions of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). I do want to commend the work of this committee. I think its members have been far-sighted; certainly, they have been very diligent in their work. I believe that the Goldfields and the whole of Australia should wish them every success. I hope that we will not see, however, a situation arise where competing facilities are set up, for it was their original idea and I think they should be applauded for it. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.59 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Walker to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: RAAF Base Richmond replacement medical centre. Mr Richard Evans to move That this House: (1) acknowledges that skin cancer is a growing health issue in Australia; (2) congratulates awareness programs that warn Australians of the hazards of skin cancer; (3) expresses concern about the limited skin cancer screening infrastructure within the health system; (4) agrees that the success of the breast cancer screening program could motivate the Government to introduce a similar program for skin cancer; and (5) calls upon the Government to consider a targeted skin cancer screening program which would include skin cancer screening centres. Mr Richard Evans to move That this House: (1) acknowledges that attention deficit disorder (ADD) is a medical condition rather than a behavioural disorder; (2) expresses concern at the limited resources with federal and State government funding dealing specifically with ADD; (3) notes that an unreasonably large percentage of the community is affected by the medical condition ADD; (4) expresses concern at the ongoing social ramifications of ADD and the inadequate response of policy makers to cope with the condition; (5) expresses concern at the lack of specific funding within special education expenditure for children suffering ADD; and (6) calls upon the Government to review education expenditure with the intention to improve resources available to adequately address the needs of children suffering ADD.

NA",163
238,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1 ) The Commonwealth and the States and Territories cost share with the Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) the costs of their operations. Under the cost sharing arrangements, the Commonwealth provides approximately 38% of the net operating costs with the States and Territories contributing 60% and the BTSs approximately 2%. The amount of the Commonwealth's contribution to the operating costs is determined initially on estimates provided by the States and then acquitted on an actual cost basis. There is no specific allocation made for blood packs. Costs of capital programs approved by the Commonwealth for funding are shared on a 50:50 basis between the Commonwealth and the respective States and Territories. , Total operating costs funding for the years requested are: 1989-90-$21.4m 1990-91-$26.7m 1991-92-$30.5m 1992-93-$30.1m 1993-94-$39.0m 1994-95-$39.5m (2) No. (3) Allegations of dumping are a matter for consideration by the Anti-Dumping Authority (ADA).

240,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Mr John Menadue in his capacity as Chairman of the St Augustine's Parish has had a number of personal and telephone discussions with the Manager of the New South Wales office and other relevant Officers in relation to this project. (2) No, there were no other applications for funding in the Drummoyne area. (3) Yes, approximately 2kilometres. (4) It is not standard practice to make representations to Local Government authorities to obtain approval for construction of hostels and nursing homes for the frail aged. However in this case it was felt that a statement of the Departments support for the proposal was warranted. The need for hostel accommodation in the region had been identified but there were no applications from the preferred area of Drummoyne. However, the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney applied to construct a 40 place hostel in neighbouring Balmain catering both to Drummoyne and Balmain with 8 places set aside for the Italian community. There was wide community support for this proposal. (5) The State Manager's letter of 3 June 1994 supported the need for the hostel and explained the need for the hostel in terms of the Government's aged care strategy. Of course the church directly sought Council approval. Treasury (Question No. 1518)",164

Qantas Pilots (Question No. 1675) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 19 October 1994: (1) Are pilots employed by Qantas compelled to retire at 60 years of age. (2) Has Qantas sought to dismiss pilots because they had reached 60 years of age; if so, will the Government, as the principal shareholder of Qantas, intervene to prevent further discrimination on the basis of age.",167
265,Mr BRERETON,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Qantas has advised that it is continuing to retire pilots at age 60. (2) In relation to the first part of the question, Qantas has advised that it will continue to retire pilots at age 60. The Company regards its approach as consistent with regulations of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which require an airline to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to the territorial airspace of any member country over which its aircraft operate. Qantas has further advised that its investigations have concluded that the overwhelming majority of countries that Qantas either overfly or land in, including such major destinations as the USA, the UK, and Japan, require that pilots shall not act as pilots in command in international air transport if they have reached their 60th birthday. I understand that it is not feasible, as far as operations are concerned, to schedule pilots over 60 to fly only in the airspace of countries that do not apply the 60 years limit. In addition, with the expected integration of the Company's domestic and international operations, all pilots will be required to fly on all routes operated by Qantas. Location State Darwin Northern Territory Katherine Northern Territory Alice Springs Northern Territory Balmain New South Wales Lane Cove New South Wales Kalgoorlie Western Australia Broome Western Australia Geraldton Western Australia Karatha Western Australia The Industrial Relations Act 1988 allows for the termination of employment on the basis of age, where the reason for termination is based on the inherent requirements of the particular position. It is considered that the inability of an international pilot to fulfil the functions of his or her position falls within this ""inherent requirements"" exception. There is therefore no basis for the Government to intervene. In addition, setting conditions of employment is one of the day-today commercial and administrative operations of Qantas, which are matters for Qantas' managementto decide, under the direction of the Qantas Board. However, as a matter of policy, the Government is undertaking work towards the development of a comprehensive strategy on age discrimination, through the work of the Commonwealth Age Discrimination Taskforce. Department of Human Services and Health: Residential Properties (Question No. 1718) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 10 November 1994: (1) How many residential properties are owned and managed by the Minister's Department or its agencies. (2) Where are the properties referred to in part (1) located in each State. (3) Which agency manages the properties at each location.",169
266,Dr LAWRENCE,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Human Services and Health and its agencies own and manage 27 residential properties.

(3) Will further sums be spent on information technology in 1994-95. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Expenditure on information technology items including photocopies and fax machines, desk top computers and mainframe services is as follows: (1)Department The Department's figures do not include expenditure for the information technology for the Repatriaccordance ation hospitals; two of which have been integrated with State health systems during the subject period, one has been sold, one will be sold in Januaty 1995 and two are to be integrated in early 1995. Such expenditure cannot be identified without significant involvement of external parties or disruption to integratiori processes. Australian War Memorial-1991-92, $O.813m; 1992-93, $0.546m; 1993-94, $O.608m 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 $18.5m $23.1m $20.5m (2) Yes, detailed records are maintained in with the Audit Act and Finance Directions. The provision of fully itemised expenditure would however, involve considerable diversion of the Department's resources. (3) Yes, provision has been made in forward estimates for expenditure of the same order as in recent years.",169
