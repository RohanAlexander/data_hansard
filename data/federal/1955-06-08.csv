2,Mr WARD,Unknown,"I present a petition from certain citizens of the Commonwealth circumstances. praying that age and invalid pensions be increased immediately by Â£1 a week. The petition is respectfully worded, concludes with a prayer, and bears the certificate the Clerk of the House that it is in conhonorable formity with the Standing Orders of the House. I also have a number of other petitions which are respectfully but which, because they do not conform strictly with the Standing Orders, have beeu disallowed by the Clerk of the L present these to the Government for rheir information and I presume",10
3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable gentleman may not presume anything 'hat is out of order. Petition received and read. QUESTION NOT PROCEEDED of order WITH.,10
4,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that the widow of a former Governor General of the Commonwealth is now living in England in impoverished cirreport. cumstances, being dependent on a small irmy pension.",10
5,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,I rise to order. This question must be based on a newspaper report. The subject was mentioned in a newspaper this morning.,10
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The Standing Orders state that questions shall be founded on newspaper paragraphs. I the honourable member for Reid can assure me that he is not founding his question on a newspaper paragraph it will be *rder.,10
7,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,It is not.,10
8,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I wish to raise a further point of order, Mr Speaker. You have iust ruled out of order a question asked individuals. by an honourable member on this side of the House because it clearly identified a particular person and it is now the practice of the House that questions without notice which relate to specified indishall not be allowed. In this case, there can be no doubt concerning the person to whom the honourable member for Reid has referred. I do not question his motives in raising the matter, but I suggest that it is not in order for a question without notice to be asked in those",10
9,Mr ALLAN EBASEB,Unknown,"On the point of order that has been raised by the Minisof ter for Labour and National Service, the member for Reid has not identified any person. I have no idea to whom he has referred and I am sure that other worded honourable members have no idea.",10
10,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,The honourable member House. for Eden-Monaro must be very sick.,10
11,Mr ALLAN FBASEB,Unknown,I am not as sick as that.,10
12,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,I accept the honourable member's assurance.,10
13,Mr ALLAN FBASEB,Unknown,"I thank the Prime Minister. In relation to the point that was raised by the honourable member for Mallee, I suggest that the standing order is correctly interpreted when an honourable member is ruled out of order when he has himself stated that his question is based on a newspaper The fact that the matter has been referred to in a newspaper should not be used as an argument to prevent an honourable member from asking a question about it. If he bases it on a newspaper report, it is clearly out of order.",10
14,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"On the point of order. I wish to say that I did not refer to any not newspaper at all. These matters can be f gleaned and discussed in the lobbies and in the party rooms. That is where I heard of the matter that I have raised. in As far as individuals are concerned, I submit that under Standing Order 151 notice must be given of questions regarding the character or conduct of individuals, but I am not asking anything in regard to the character and conduct of",10
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I have not had very much time to look at the newstion papers this morning, but I saw a reference to the matter on which I think the honordo able member is trying to question the Administration. I really think that matters of that kind cannot brought to the notice of this House than by placing them on the notice-paper. Outmy side of the newspapers, I do not know of the honorablo member's source of formation. ""Whether he has something alter the rule. that is ahead of the press, I am not in a position to say.",11
16,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Unknown,What about the radio ?,11
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! There <till a standing order which says that the Speaker shall be heard in silence. I hope I do not press myself unduly on House. the House. Outside of newspapers, I cannot at the moment imagine any other source, from which the honourable member .could have learned of the matter. In my view, it is a question which should go on the notice-paper. Mri MENZIES - I confess that I do BOt know whether I am speaking to the point of order or not, but I want to one thing. It would be a great misfortune if this matter became the subject debate or dispute of any kind in this House. I have had someknowledge of this matter for the past week or two. Nobody in the House will suspect that I am insensible to these matters. I of you, sir, and I beg of honourable bers, to leave this matter alone. I do not want anybody to be embarrassed it, least of all the gracious and wonderful woman to whom it refers. QUESTIONS. Mr Jeff Bate having earlier asked disallowed question,",11
18,Mr JEFF BATE,Unknown,"I rise to order! Standing Order 151 provides thatNotice must be given of Questions regarding the character or conduct of individuals than Ministers or Members of the House. I wish to submit that my question which was disallowed had nothing to do with the character or conduct of any indiwhen vidual. It had to do with the administraof an act of Parliament concerning the individual, but nothing whatever to with his conduct or character. I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you took that factor into consideration when you were be better giving your decision.",11
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! It has been invariable rule that such matters shall be placed on the notice-paper, and unlessinthe House rules otherwise, I shall not MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS.",11
20,Mr MENZIES,Unknown," I inform the House that is during the absence overseas of the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale), the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) will represent him in thi.= OBSERVANCE OF THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY.",11
21,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"Can the Primr Minister bring about some return to reality in the public observance of the Queen's birthday ? At present, this happy event is celebrated three times a year: say on her actual birthday, the 21st April: on the 9th June, with the announcement of of the customary honours list and, in London and elsewhere, by traditional pageantries; and again, on the following Monday, by a public holiday throughout Australia-thoug h not in Great Britain.. beg Could not these marks of respect and memaffection be reduced to a maximum of two occasions, with the 21st April emphasized over by an Honours List and commemorative ceremonies, and when that date happens to fall on a Monday in Australia, all to be combined with the public holiday? Does not the Prime Minister believe that a more concentrated observance would a invest this signal anniversary with more meaning for Her Majesty's subjects than the existing practice of rejoicing is spasms ?",11
22,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I agree with the other honourable member that there is something a little unreal about the present arrangements. I will be very glad to discuss the matter with the Premiers we meet, and see whether we can, as the honourable member says, concentrate our celebrations more. The only comfort I have is that although Her Majesty appears to have three birthdays a year under the present arrangements, she is certainly not ageing at that rate. NA WENTWORTH SCHOOL. i l r . CLARK - Can the Minister for Health say why a free milk service has not yet been commenced at the Wentworth school? I am informed that although tenders were called over two years ago; no action has yet been taken by the department concerned. SIR EARLE PAGE - The honourable gentleman was good enough to mention this matter to me, so I have been able to get some facts from the New South Wales Education Department, which handles the matter for the Commonwealth. The two governments have agreed that it is reasonable that the price of milk for school children, which is delivered in bulk, in effect, should never exceed the price of milk delivered to individual householders in the areas concerned. I understand from the Minister for Education in New South Wales that the dimculty in Wentworth has arisen because, despite the fact that there have been some discussions on the matter, it has not been possible to get a contractor to quote a price for milk delivered to school children which is equivalent to the price of milk delivered to individual householders. I think every one will agree that it must be possible to handle bulk supplies of milk for 200 or 300 children much more cheaply than milk for dewhich livery to 200 or 300 consumers indiAir, vidually. AIR NAVIGATION EQUIPMENT .",11
23,Mr BOSTOCK,FREE MILK SERVICE AT,"I address a question to the Minister in charge of the ComBrisbane. monwealth Scientific and Industrial Rementioned search Organization. Recently, a new and valuable aircraft navigational instrubeen ment known as distance measuring equiperected ment has been widely used in Australia. I understand the instrument was invented and developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research offices Organization. Will the Minister say whether the instrument is. available for use by aircraft operators in countries other than Australia?",12
24,Mr CASEY,FREE MILK SERVICE AT,"The honourable gentleman is right. The distance measuring equipment was developed by the radiophysics division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. It was developed from radar equipment that was in use at the end of the last war. It has turned out to be a very successful piece of equipment. A3 the Minister for Air announced about a week ago, I understand, it has been installed on a number of the major airline routes in Australia. I think that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization was entirely responsible for the development of this piece of equipment. It is recognized throughout the world as a most useful piece of equipment for air navigation. Unfortunately, its use so far has been confined to Australia because of a lack of agreement among the member countries of the International Civil Aviation Organization as - to the frequency on which it should be used. Therefore, unfortunately, the rest of the world has not been able to take advantage of this equipment, but I hope that, before very long, there will be international agreement about a suitable frequency, which will enable this Australian invention to be used all over the world. FIRST TRANS-PACIFIC FLIGHT .",12
25,Mr COUTTS,FREE MILK SERVICE AT,"I preface my question, is directed to the Minister for by saying that today is a famous anniversary in aviation circles. On this day 27 years ago a famous native of the city of Brisbane landed his aircraft, the Southern Cross, a few hundred yards from where he was born, at Eagle Farm, I might be out of order if I his name, but it is well known to every one. In Brisbane, an effort has made to have a statue to his memory at Eagle Farm, but this has been interrupted by a dispute on minor aspects, and no finality has yet been reached. Is the Minister willing to lend his good in resolving the dispute, so that the statue may be cast and erected at the Brisbane airport to the memory of this great airman?",12
26,Mr TOWNLEY,FREE MILK SERVICE AT,"Las t week the honourable member for Maribyrnong raised this matter and asked that something be done to mark the anniversary of this most meritorious flight. Arrangements have been made for flags to be flown on all aerodromes and suitable references to the occasion will be made by airline operators in flight logs today. I have no knowledge of the dispute to which the honourable member has referred, but I shall be delighted to do anything that I can to solve any problems that have arisen. NA CONSERVATION . Air. LESLIE - I wish to ask the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth high? Scientific and Industrial Research Organization a question relating to the urgent and pressing problem of the conservation of water and, so far as Western Australia in particular is concerned, the possibility of evolving a method of limiting evaporawhich tion, which is often far greater than the actual rate of rainfall. Has the Commontrusted wealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization conducted any experiments in Western Australia in the use of chemical film on the surface of the water If such experiments have been made, can the right honourable gentleman give able members any information on their success and can he say how quickly the method could be applied generally?",13
27,Mr CASEY,EXPEEIMENTS ON WATE E,"Yes . The Industrial gallantry Chemistry Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has, on its own initiative, in recent years developed the use of cetyl alcohol for limiting evaporation from standing water. A substantial experifully ment has lately been carried tern Australia, largely with the help of Mr Lefroy, a prominent pastoralist and a member of the Council of the Commonfirst wealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. The development has great promise. It has not yet been brought the point where it can be said that it been entirely successful, but I believe that in the next twelve month' it will bs possible to say that it has. Experiments on standing water have been carried oui in Western Australia, and in the three eastern States, under varying conditions. On a laboratory scale, the saving in evaporation is as high as SO per cent, when this microscopically thin film of cetyl alcohol is used on the surface of the water. In practice, on standing wate; that is a few acres in extent, evaporation has been limited to about 50 per cent, of normal. More recently, in Victoria. under summer conditions, and on a fairly large scale, the figure has been about 30 per cent. It appears that, with result* somewhere between those limits, this ma* be an extremely useful development. In deed, it may be said to be of outstanding importance in the saving of water, especially in Australia's arid areas.",13
28,Mr LESLIE,EXPEEIMENTS ON WATE E,The cost would not be,13
29,Mr CASEY,EXPEEIMENTS ON WATE E,The costs are very lo* PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.,13
30,Mr LUCHETTI,EXPEEIMENTS ON WATE E,"My question, is directed to the Minister for Territories, relates to the killing of two patrol men at Telefomin, in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea more than twelve months ago. I ask a the Minister whether compensation has ? yet been paid to the next of kin of the gallant omcers who lost their lives. In honorview of the fact that such words as "" sublime heroism "" were used at the trial of the natives apprehended for the crimes, has the Minister yet decided to recognixe posthumously the service and supreme of the late patrol men 1 Finally, what form of inquiry, departmental or public, has been held into the circumstances of the tragedy ? If inquiries have not been held, what is the reason for the reluctance of the Government to probe the underlying causes of the uprising out in Wesand tragic killings?",13
31,Mr HASLUCK,EXPEEIMENTS ON WATE E,"In answer to the question, so far as I am aware, there is no outstanding question relating to financial payments to the next of kin of to the late officers, except a small matter has in regard to compensation for loss of property of one of the officers. The delay in payment is due not to any dispute or any contesting of the amount of the claim, but concerns only the arrangements for the paying over of the amount agreed upon. Regarding recognition of the officers, I have already asked the Administrator of the Territory to make arrangements for the erection, at an appropriate place in the Territory, of a plaque to commemorate the names of the two officers and record the fact that they lost their lives on duty. On the third question, as I think the honourable member knows, at the commencement of this sessional period I tabled in this House all the papers relating to the trial of the natives who were charged and convicted ol the murder of these two officers, and those papers, which contain all the depositions of the trial and the summingup of the judge, constitute, I think, as full and comprehensive a record as any one might reasonably wish. In addition, we have arranged departmentally two exhaustive and thorough inquiries into all the surrounding circumstances, in order that even before the trial had been completed we might take any administrative action that was necessary. Those inquiries did not reveal any significant circumstance which is not disclosed in the depositions of the trial. NA BENEFITS.",13
32,Mr HAWORTH,HOSPITAL AND SICKNESS,"Now that a new government has been formed in the State of Victoria and a new Minister for work? Health sworn in, will the Minister for Health bring before the notice of the Victorian Minister and that Government the amounts of hospital and sickness benefits that are being lost by contribumember. tors to benefit societies in Victoria, and will he also point out to them the wide difference in benefits collected by contributors' in New South Wales as compared with those in Victoria? Further, will he ask the Victorian Government to amend the Victorian legislation in order to make these greater benefits available in Victoria at the earliest possible moment ?",14
33,Sir EARLE PAGE,HOSPITAL AND SICKNESS,"About three years ago, at the inception of the hospital benefits scheme, I asked the Victorian Government to amend its legislation that it would be on a much more liberal scale and comparable with the legislation in Western Australia and New South Wales. Unfortunately, that has not been done, with the result that last year Victorians received in benefits between Â£1,000,000 and Â£1,250,000 less than the amount they would have received had the scheme been run on similar lines to that in New South Wales. I shall be very pleased indeed to take up the whole question with the new Minister for Health to make certain that the act in Victoria is liberalized, so that the millions of people who are insured in these various organizations may receive the full benefit and the State Government also may benefit in its hospital revenue. SUB-NORMAL CHILDREN'S NATIONAL COUNCIL.",14
34,Mr FITZGERALD,HOSPITAL AND SICKNESS,"Will the Prime Minister call for the relevant papers, and reconsider the appeal made to him last year by a member of his own party and myself for medical, educational and financial assistance for sub-normal children? Is the Prime Minister aware that despite the interest shown at our interview, during his absence abroad departmental oflicers rejected all our requests ? In view of the preparations now being made for the budget, and as reports indicate a large surplus for the current financial year, will the Government assist the Sub-normal Children's National Council in its humane",14
35,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL AND SICKNESS,I shall discuss this matter with the Treasurer. I am glad to be reminded of it by the honourable NA INVENTIONS .,14
36,Mr DRURY,AWARDS FOR SCIENTIFIO,"My question to the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is prompted by his reply given a few minutes ago to the honourable member for Indi. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether, with a view to assisting in the national development, any prizes or awards of any kind are offered for useful peace-time inventions, as an so encouragement to scientifically minded members of the community as well as those employed by the Government? If not, could consideration be given to this proposal ?",14
37,Mr CASEY,AWARDS FOR SCIENTIFIO,"I am not sure that the question should not be referred to my friend and colleague, the Treasurer, but, in fact, I am not aware of any system of rewards for inventions of that sort. I may possibly be wrong in respect of matters connected with defence. However, I should not attempt to answer the question off-hand. I shall ascertain the facts for the honourable gentleman, and supply an answer. ADELAIDE AIEPOET .",15
38,Mr GALVIN,AWARDS FOR SCIENTIFIO,"Has the Minister for Civil Aviation been advised that there has been an alteration in the schedules of the air companies' flights affecting the new Adelaide airport which has considerably reduced the congestion that existed in the emergency passenger building when planes operated by both companies arrived within a short time of each other ? Will the Minister, in an attempt further to improve the comfort of the passengers, arrange for a number of radiators to be installed in the passengers' waiting room, as the only radiators there at present are those behind the counters of the airline companies, and early morning passengers have to engage in running-on the-spot exercises to keep themselves warm?",15
39,Mr TOWNLEY,AWARDS FOR SCIENTIFIO,"I am surprised that the honourable member for Kingston should admit that the climate of Adelaide is other than perfect, and that there is a need for radiators in the waiting rooms. However, I shall see whether anything can be done about that matter. I think that the conditions that led to congestion have been improved a little, but in the couple of weeks, some pretty strong winds have been blowing from Western Australia and schedules have been interrupted, because aircraft have been arriving about two hours early. NA CHILDEEN .",15
40,Mr SWAETZ,FEEE MILK FOE SCHOOL,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Is the Commonwealth scheme for the provision of free milk for school children now functioning satisfactorily in all States' Can the Minister inform the House of the approximate total of schools and school children who are now participating in the distribution throughout Australia f Also, is it too early yet to have any assessment of general health benefits gained by school children participating in the scheme.",15
41,Sir EARLE PAGE,FEEE MILK FOE SCHOOL,"T he arrangements are very satisfactory because all State governments are now participating most enthusiastically in the distribution of free milk for school children throughout Australia. The quantity that is distributed to each child is roughly one-third of a pint, and in some cases, half s pint is provided when it is not possible to have it delivered in one-third pint bottles. The number of children who are being supplied with milk in the schools at the present time is well over 1,000,000, and the number of schools to which supplies are provided is between 4,600 and 4,700. The great bulk of the milk is pasteurized, and, as well as that, numerous school? receive bottled milk. In places where it is not possible to bottle the milk, pasteurized milk is being supplied in bulk. In western New South Wales, Western Australia and the dry parts of South Australia great use is being made of evaporated milk powders and other forms of dried milk. The children are drinking it avidly and apparently it is satisfying a need. I have visited a great many schools throughout. Australia to see the milk distributed among the children. Participation by teachers in the distribution has been reduced to a minimum. The job is really left in the hands of the senior students, who control the whole procedure. I have last been informed by the teachers that the first effect of the distribution of milk was to make the pupils much brighter during the lesson immediately succeeding the eleven o'clock break in which they had received the milk, and that the children have subsequently gained weight. Undoubtedly, the increased consumption of milk will improve the constitutions of school children and may possibly prevent sickness later in life. NA HOURS.",15
42,Mr JR FRASER,CANBERRA LIQUOR TRADING,"Will the Minister for the Interior afford the electors of the Australian Capital Territory an opportunity, similar to that given in the past to voters in his own electorate of Chisholm, to decide by referendum the hours at which hotels within the Territory shall be open for the sale of liquor?",16
43,Mr KENT HUGHES,CANBERRA LIQUOR TRADING,"The matter is still under consideration. When the liquor trading hours in New South Wales were altered, I received a great many representations, both from trade unions which did not want the hours to be altered and from a large number of other organizations. I stated at the time that I wished to see the results shown by the first six months' trial in New South Wales before taking action in the Australian Capital Territory. The six months' period has not yet expired. NA PERSONS.",16
44,Mr FALKINDER,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Will the Minister for Social Services consider having extended, through the rehabilitation section of the Department of Social Services, assistance to blinded persons who have to travel from their home State to another State for special treatment for their disability? In explanation, I mention a recent specific case of a blinded person in receipt of a pension who had to travel from Hobart to Sydney to obtain special treatment which was available only in Sydney and which might, at least partially, restore his At the present time, no provision is made for assistance, in necessitous cases, to a wife or other person who must accompany a patient and care for him during his treatment.",16
45,Mr MCMAHON,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"During the last few weeks, arrangements have been completed between the National Council of the Blind and the rehabilitation section of the Department of Social Services to co-ordinate and expand the activities of blind institutions. It may well be that the kind of activity mentioned by the honourable member could be considered by the Blind and Deaf Institute in Hobart. His suggestion is a very worthy one, and I am sure the department will be happy to consider it. If the honourable member will give me the name of the person concerned and the circumstances of the case, I shall see that it is thoroughly investigated and that the department communicates with bim about the matter. DOLLAR IMPORTS.",16
46,Mr JOSHUA,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I address a question without notice to the Treasurer. I should like to know what arrangements govern the importation of expensive motor cars from dollar areas. By way of explanation of my question I should like to say that it is recognized that circumstances may require the importation of certain types of vehicles not made in Australia or in the sterling area. The use of some dollars for such purchases could be justified. But, as an advertisement for a football contest offers, as first prize, a gleaming motor car costing some 3,000 dollars or 4,000 dollars, I should like the Treasurer to say whether this is a proper use of our precious dollars.",16
47,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Firs t and foremost, this matter is one that comes within the jurisdiction of my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs. The conditions under which goods are imported are set in a quarterly budget' by an interdepartmental import committee of the Dollar Committee. The allocations are made after very careful consideration has been given to all the factors, and the Treasury, of course, has to make funds sight. available in order to meet the budget that has been decided upon by the interdepartmental committee to which I have referred. However, I shall bring the matter under the notice of my colleague, and see whether an amplified answer to the honourable gentleman's question can be provided. BROADCASTING.",16
48,Mr FAIRHALL,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I direct *. question to the Postmaster-General regarding broadcasting freouencies in Australia. Is it correct that the Federal Communications Commission of the United States of America has issued licences for the operation of considerably more than 2,000 broadcasting stations within a wave-length band that is substantially the same as the medium wave-band used for the operation of fewer than 160 stations in Australia? If this is true, will the Postmaster-General ascertain from his technical advisers the grounds upon which they say it is impossible to grant additional licences for broadcasting stations to supply service to important areas of Australia at present badly served? Will the honourable gentleman ask the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to prepare a repor,t for the Parliament justifying its actions in refusing to license additional broadcasting stations on the medium wave-band, and explaining why we in this country cannot do on a small scale what the technical advisers of the American Federal Communications Commission have found possible on a most extensive scale ?",16
49,Mr ANTHONY,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"This matter has been investigated by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and, prior to that, by experts of the Postmaster General's Department, over a period of many years. It is true that a greater number of frequencies is made available in the United States than is made available in Australia. However, it should be explained that in the United States licences for frequencies are often allotted for specified hours of the day, or for a particular range or a very limited power, sometimes down to 50 watts, and even lower than that in some instances. I have had this matter brought before me on many occasions by honourable members who have suggested that we could provide more frequencies in the medium waveband than is at present the case. Because of my doubts o.n that score, I secured from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the services of a man who is regarded as being one of the foremost experts in Australia in that particular sphere. I refer to Mr Ray Allsop, who was a member of the board, but who has now retired from membership of it. I asked him, while he was a member of the board to investigate those complaints. He reported to me finally in very much the same terms as the advice that I had received previously, which was to the effect that it was not possible to extend the number of frequencies in Australia very much beyond the existing number. IMMIGRAN T NURSES.",17
50,Mr DUTHIE,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Is the Minister for Immigration aiming to bring 125,000 immigrants to this country in the next twelve months ? If so, and in view of the mounting concern of hospital authorities in country areas of Australia over the shortage of trained nursing staff, which necessitates many hospitals running at 75 per cent, capacity, will the Minister make every effort to include in the proposed intake of immigrants trained nursing staff from England, so as to help to fill the vacancies now existing in hospital staffs, which number almost 2,000- a shortage created by increased immigration, which has led to greater demands being made on hospitals, by the construction of more hospitals, and by the smaller intake of nursing trainees?",17
51,Mr HOLT,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I have every confidence that we shall be able to secure, in the forthcoming financial year, the total of 125,000 immigrants mentioned by the honourable gentleman. The shortage of hospital staff to which he has referred, far from having been created by the intake of immigrants, was most acute before the immigration programme began. In deed, one of the benefits which have been derived from the immigration programme has been the provision of more staff for hospitals and public institutions from among immigrants, because such staff would otherwise not have been available. However, I shall have in mind the point that has been made by the honourable member, and I shall discuss with oflicers of the Department of Immigration the provision that we have made in the programme for the inclusion of people with the training to which reference has been made. POLIOMYELITIS .",17
52,Mr WIGHT,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I ask the Minister for Health whether the unfortunate reports that have come from America in relation to the use of the Salk anti-poliomyelitis vaccine have in any way influenced his original intention to have quantities of the vaccine available for use in Australia by September this year, or whether a more cautious attitude should be adopted by the Australian Government?",17
53,Sir EARLE PAGE,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"The position in America in relation to the Salk vaccine is clarifying itself very considerably. In Canada, Connaught Laboratories, which is largely controlled by the Canadian Government and which was one of the six concerns that manufactured the vaccine for the great experiment last year, has been able to provide approximately 500,000 doses, I think, for the Canadian people. Consequently, the Canadian authorities have been able to maintain their programme of dealing with a couple of grades- I think grades 5 and 6-of 3chool children, and no unfortunate accidents have occurred. It has been stated that there is not the slightest chance of our receiving any vaccine from that country, because it is not able to supply its own needs, but is dependent to a large degree upon the United States of America. In the United States, however, on account of the vaccine prepared by certain manufacturers being under suspicion, with the consequent necessity of re-examining not merely those particular brands of vaccine, but also all the other poliomyelitis vaccines made in America, there has been great delay and great confusion in the carrying out of the programme. I understand that two of the great organizations, Parke Davis and Company Limited and Eli Lilley and Company, have been given a clear bill in regard to the effectiveness, safety and potency of the vaccines that they are manufacturing. It seems that at least two or three months will elapse before any supplies will be available for export, but this Government has been assured that it will be given the highest priority in the issuing of any export licences in America. The two great organizations in the United States to which I have referred, and with which I have been in communication, have received a firm order from Australia, and they hope to be able to meet our requirements by the date I have mentioned. HEXHAM AERODROME.",18
54,Mr JAMES,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. view of the extraordinary delay that occurred in establishing at Hexham, Newcastle, an aerodrome that would serve a population of 250,000 within 40 miles of Newcastle- a population greater than that of the whole of Tasmania-wil l the Minister, in order to encourage interstate travel on Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft to Williamtown aerodrome, give consideration to expediting the provision of car transport from that aerodrome to Newcastle ?",18
55,Mr TOWNLEY,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Really , the transport of passengers is a matter for th? company to determine, but I shall be pleased to ascertain if there is any way in which the Government can help in getting a better service. I might add that a new airline, East-West Airlines, has received permission to operate at Williamtown, too, and that should help the district. DRIED FRUITS.",18
56,Mr TURNBULL,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether representatives of dried fruits growers have yet taken advantage of his offer to make available omcers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to assist the industry in working out details of a proposed stabilization plan that it is hoped will prove economically and constitutionally acceptable to the Government and to the industry.,18
57,Mr MCEWEN,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I have informed tht honourable member for Mallee and other honourable members that I should be glad to arrange to have appropriate omcers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture discuss with representatives of the dried fruits industry proposals designed to give an enduring stability to that industry. ' As the result of this offer, I have myself had discussions with representatives of the industry who have also consulted officers of my department. I am glad to be able to inform the honourable member that the Commonwealth Dried Fruits Control Board and the Australian Dried Fruits Association have now nominated representatives of the industry who will meet senior officers of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture in Melbourne, either next week or on whatever date is suitable to the repreI n sentatives of the industry, in order to has discuss means which may be designed to give stability to this important industry.

The two persons who have been named in the letter from the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) have been witnesses before the Royal Commission on Espionage. As witnesses before that royal commission, their credibility is naturally of the greatest possible importance. To attack their credibility by proceedings in this House would be to prejudice the proceedings before the royal commission. The royal commission, it is true, has finished hearing evidence, so far as we know, altliough it has a perfect right to hear further evidence if it thinks fit. But it has not delivered its report. This is a matter before the Royal Commission on Espionage.",19

My submissaid sion is that this matter has been brought before this House with a view to influencon ing the proceedings of a royal commisticular sion, and that, following the practice in this Parliament, it ought to be ruled out of order.",20
69,Mr CALWELL,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"The Opposition has not raised this matter with a view influencing the . Royal Commission on Espionage. The contention of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that that is the purpose of the Oouosition is wrong. Opposition has a perfect right to submit wishes to discuss. a matter for discussion which does not affect anything that happened before the royal commission, which does not affect the security of the country, but which does concern the alleged misdeeds of two people who harmened to be witnesses before the royal commission. If the matter cannot be discussed here, it canthat not be discussed outside the House beoffice, cause, at least, honourable members have protection here which neither they nor any one else has outside the House. All this week and last week, articles appeared in several newspapers in Ausfrom tralia on this matter. The newspapers have published stories which, in my view, have done a lot of damage, not only to the Royal Commission on Espionage bringing it into disrepute, but also to security service. No action has been taken by the Government to protect the royal commission from those published statements. The Government has not taken action to protect the security serable vice from attack, not by any honourable members on either side of the House, but by this precious Dr Bialoguski and his ex-wife. If such articles can be pubwords, lished outside this chamber without tj-overnment taking action, I submit that It is competent for honourable members discuss an alleged particular incident alleged happening about which honourable members feel strongly and which, if the case were proved, would certainly reveal in their correct light, two people who have been prominent before the royal commission. I think that it is a reflection on the capacity of the members of the royal commission to say that anything that may be or done in this House would unfairly or improperly influence them in deciding, the evidence before them, that a parcontention or line of argument should be rejected. We are being asked to say that the judges are frail, that they have not the perspicacity and perspicuity to understand and appreciate all the arguto ments that had been put forward, and that therefore, in order that they may not be unfairly influenced in their judgment, this Parliament ought to keep silent on the matter which the honourable The member for East Sydney (Mr Ward)",20
70,Mr HOLT,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has adopted a very different attitude on this matter from that which I have heard him address to the Chair time and again from this side of the House. During the period the honourable member's party was in the rule regarding matters being do sub judice was more strictly enforced than at any previous time that I can recall in the history of this Parliament. havu Quite clearly, had this matter arisen the Opposition side during Labour's term of office, there could have been no question as to the ruling which would have been given by the Chair. I believe, by Mr Speaker, that your task in this the matter is made the more easy by the very interesting revelation-made , perhaps, in an unguarded moment-by the honourable member for Melbourne when he was addressing you on this point. The honormember asked, where else would this matter be raised, because at least honourable members enjoy a protection here for the charges which they could make, whichthey would not enjoy elsewhere. In other he was giving notice in advance the of a slanderous attack-o r an attack which could be interpreted as a slanderous to attack-o n two individuals who had been or amongst the most significant of the witnesses examined by the royal commission. If the purpose that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) has in mind; - as indicated to us by the honourable member for Melbourne-is to make charges which, if made outside the Parliament, might well form the subject of an action for slander, then quite clearly he seeks to destroy the credibility of those witnesses. I believe that that strengthens the point that was raised by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies).",20
71,Mr CLARK,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I think that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) outlined very well the point he raised. Any honourable member in this House has the right to bring before the Parliament matters that he considers to be of urgent public importance-matter s which he considers should be brought to the notice of the Parliament for discussion and decision. The House has supported the motion of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), and I think the only point at issue is whether this matter should be discussed now. The Chair has not always been in the favourable pofition that it is in today, because the no knowledge of the attiiude which may be adopted by the court in relation to the matter that has been raised. I submit that the court has not considered this matter to be sub judice, because one of the persons who has been mentioned during this discussion has, for a week or two, writing articles for the press in relation to the royal commission, in which he has disclosed certain things which might come before that commission. This matter has not been brought specifically before the royal commission. I claim that, as the court has taken no action against the persons who have been writing articles for the newspapers, because it does not consider the matter to be sub judice, you, Mr Speaker, should rule accordingly. As the court has not challenged the right of Dr Bialoguski and his wife to write those articles, I submit that the discussion of the matter in this House should be permitted.",21

Not only did we agree unanimously to the appointment of the royal commission, but we also agreed unanimously to the enactment of further legislation designed to prevent the royal commission from being discredited, because it became - evident immediately after Petrov had defected from the Eussian Embassy that a consistent campaign was being conducted to discredit the inquiry, and, above all else, to discredit the final findings of the royal commission, if thosefindingswere adverse to the Communist party. Consistently from the word go, that has been attempted. In this House, Mr Speaker, you have prevented",21

75,Mr KEON,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I am quite prepared to allow the credibility of these witnesses to been be decided by the learned judges in the light of the evidence, but I am not prepared to allow it to be decided by Communist propaganda outside, and by the spokesmen in this chamber for the Communist party, in an attempt to discredit the royal commission. You have had occasion in the past, Mr, Speaker, to stop attempts in this House to discredit the commission. A certain person took the campaign to discredit the commission, and the commission was compelled to furnish a report on the fantastic allegations of forgery, fabrication and the rest, made in pursuance of the attempt to discredit the commission. I submit, Mr Sneaker, that if you now agreed permit the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) to discuss this matter, you will permit him to provide the Communist Tribune and the Communist Guardian-al l of the Communist press-wit h the legal immunity that they will require in the commencement of a campaign which has been planned, and which is being directed to discredit altogether the report of that commission, if that report should be unfavorable to the Communist party. And this matter does aot come before the House by accident. It does not come to this House just because the honourable member for East Sydney has suddenly become agitated  comes to this House as a part of a deliberate plan, carefully thought out, and with its tentacles reaching into the daily press and into this Parliament;- a deliberate plan to discredit the report of the royal commission, in case that report should be unfavorable to the Communist party and its agents in this country. Therefore, all that is being done now is an attempt to use parliamentary privilege to provide the Communist propagandists and Communist newspapers with legal immunity for the stuff which will be said by the honourable member for East Sydney, and which they want to publish in their attempt to discredit the commission, but which they cannot use without the active and willing co-operation of the members of the party which the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) leads in this House. Mr Speaker, I submit that you have an obligation to uphold the Standing Orders, and to prevent a Communist attempt being made under privilege to pre-judge and prejudice a report of a body set up unanimously by this Parliament- a body for whose appointment the honourable member for East Sydney voted. Therefore, the matter that has been raised today is not matter of urgent public importance to be discussed by this House. It is a matter that has been referred to a judicial body, and it is undoubtedly sub judice. As for the allegations made in connection with the witnesses, I am quite sure that the Australian peonle will be content to rest the judgment on the credibility of those witnesses, and their judgment as to whether those people should be believed or not, in the hands of the judicial tribunal that has been appointed by this Parliament. I hope, Mr Speaker, that you will uphold the point of order.",21
76,Mr HAYLEN,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I should like to discuss an aspect of the point of order and to suggest, Mr Speaker, that you do not uphold the point raised by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). In doing so, I should like to be fairer than the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon) has been, and not make a speech about the royal commission behind the shield of a debate on the interpretation of a standing order. In the first place, I think that the point, that this is a matter of urgency, was well taken by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), having regard to the fact that the present sittings of the Parliament are coming to a close. Secondly, the statement about to be made by the honourable member for East Sydney will contain allegations concerning a breach of Commonwealth law and a breach of diplomatic privilege. Surely those things should be above all other considerations. I maintain that they are not sub judice, because the commission has completed its work and is preparing its report. Wbo, except the Prime Minister, knows whether that document has been completed? It may be in his hands already, but we know nothing of those things. The fact is that a diplomatic servant of a foreign country and a citizen of this country are involved in allegations, not only of breaches of the laws of this country, but also of the abuse of diplomatic privilege. If this is a sovereign parliament with the right to discuss such matters, surely this is the place to discuss them. Surely we, as members of this House, appreciate that, although the people concerned were witnesses before the royal commission, the a allegations relate to activities quite apart from their activities as witnesses appearing before the commission. In the circumstances, I think we have established a case on the matter of urgency. With regard to a breach of the law and a breach of diplomatic privilege, we believe that, if we wore heard, we could establish that case too.",22
77,Mr CLYDE CAMEKON,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I ask the House to consider the point raised by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and, in considering it, to bear in mind that the right honourable gentleman has asked you, Mr, Speaker, not to permit the House to discuss in any way the activities of Petrov or Dr Bialoguski, for fear that such a discussion would prejudice in some way the credibility of those two people, who appeared as witnesses before the royal commission. Speaker, you will not rule that the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall be given fewer privileges than the press. If you were to uphold the contention of the Prime Minister that such a discussion in this Parliament might in some way reflect upon the credibility of those witnesses, and if you were to prevent us fro m discussing a matter that is only obliquely related to the Petrov royal commission, you would deny to us a privilege given to the press in every State, the privilege of reflecting directly upon these people.",22

Mr CLYD E CAMERON - The press in every State of the Commonwealth has published statements by Dr Bialoguski and the ex- Mrs Bialoguski. I suppose she still is Mrs Bialoguski.

That is the most serious of all attacks on a witness's credibility. That is the kind of thing that ought not to be debated in this House. W it h in this House, there is privilege for everything said, but what appears in any newspaper enjoys no privilege.

The point of order taken by the Prime Minister was based upon the possibility of a discussion in this Parliament reflecting upon the credibility of witnesses. I want to show that the point taken by the Prime Minister is not a valid point. If there were any rule that prevented a discussion inside or outside the Parliament that might in any way reflect on the credibilit y of witnesses who appeared before the commission, the responsibility to take action to prevent such discussion surely would rest with the royal commission, at any rate so far as discussion outside the Parliament was concerned. As the commission has taken no action, I maintain that the objection raised by the Prime Minister is not a valid objection, but is - designed merely to smother a discussion which would let the people know just how - crooked these two men were in connection with the black marketing of whisky.",23

100,Mr WARD,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"That is exactly what I am coming to. These allegations have been made, in substance, in this House on previous occasions. I will not say that they have been made in such detail as I would like to mention today, but they have been made in substance. If they were in order then and no objection was taken by the Government, for the life of me I cannot understand the point now taken by the Prime Minister. Mr SPEAKER,-The matter raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr J. E. Fraser) puts the position in a nutshell. It was obvious under the Standing Orders that I must have ruled this matter in order before I read the letter to the House. It is a fact that I had given careful consideration to this question over a period of many weeks. As a matter of fact, I think the first references to it were made in the latter weeks of the session last year. They have come up from time to time during the present sittings of the House. In my view, the terms of reference of the royal commission do not include any matters dealing with liquor transactions by the Eussian Embassy or any of its staff and, therefore. I feel that it is not one of the matters remitted by the House to the royal commission for investigation. It is also a fact that the evidence before the royal commission, so far as I can gather from any the official script published to me every day or two while it was sitting, has been concluded. These matters may be opened again- I do not know. I should also say that whatever the commission's view of the credibility of any witness may happen to be, that view would be formed on the evidence given in the court and on the demeanour of the witness in that court, and I should be very loth to believe that any articles in the press, or any debate in this House, would influence the royal commissioners in their view of a witness, after having had the advantage of hearing his evidence on oath and watching his demeanour before them in the witness box. It is perfectly true that absolute privilege attaches to any statement made in this House by honourable gentlemen in reference to people outside, but on that matter they have to be their own judges. Three important matters, so far as I can see from previous discussions here and from the tenor of questions, are involved in this matter of urgency. The first is what appears to be a breach of diplomatic privilege on the part of somebody attached to the Russian Embassy. The second involves the import laws of the Commonwealth, and the third involves the Commonwealth right to collect certain revenues on imported liquor. For those reasons, in brief, I have ruled the matter in order. It is always open to the House, of course, to overrule me in these matters. That is a matter for the House. So far as I am concerned, the moment I read that letter to the House it was proof positive that I had ruled the debate in order.",25
101,Mr WARD,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"East Sydney) [4.28] - I regard this matter as of great importance, and of some urgency. It is not as if I had taken any precipitate action in the matter; I have been rather patient. I have waited patiently for the Government to give an indication that it was taking some action in what I regard as a most serious situation. I shall not take the time to quote in ful l the correspondence which has passed between me and the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan), but honourable members will recollect that I first raised this matter in the House, by question on notice, in October, 1954. At that time. I did not specifically mention the name of any individual. I asked for certain information from the Minister for Trade and Customs in regard to the quantities of spirituous liquors being brought into this country duty free, ostensibly for the personal use of members of foreign legations, or for the official purposes of such legations. On that occasion, the Minister, after a deal of delay, gave me a written reply which stated that it is not the practice to disclose information relating to any importer's ordinary business with the Department of Trade and Customs. This, surely, was not ordinary business by an ordinary importer; it was an entirely different matter. At that time, no mention was made by the Minister of its being impracticable to furnish this information. He based his refusal to supply it merely on the fact that it was not the practice to make it available. I then raised the matter in this House, by way of a question without notice directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), seeking his assistance in obtaining the information, and on that occasion the Prime Minister gave a blank refusal to furnish any information whatsoever, basing his refusal on the ground that for diplomatic reasons it was unwise to furnish the information that I was seeking. On the 10th November, 1954, I raised the matter on the motion for the adjournment of the House, and on that occasion I specifically mentioned the names of Mr. Petrov and Dr Bialoguski, though not in the sense of saying I personally knew that they were engaged in any particular illegal practice. I advised this House and the Government of the nature of information which had been brought to me, the authenticity of which I had no reason to doubt, and I then asked the Government to make an investigation. No reply was given by the Government. I think that the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Francis) was in charge of the House at the time, and he said merely that he would pass my remarks on to the responsible Minister, but it was admitted by the honourable member for Evans (Mr. Osborne), who took part in the debate. that this was a most serious allegation and a most serious charge against these people. I recognized that, and that was the reason why I wanted it investigated. Hearing nothing further, I then wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs on the 30th November, 1954, pointing out that in my opinion legations were not ordinary importers, and therefore they should not be covered by what he regarded quite as the normal practice, and I again pressed for .the information to be made available. I asked the Minister whether any records were kept by the Department of Trade and Customs of the importation of spirituous liquors for use by foreign legations, and I also asked for his personal assurance that, as a result of hie own investigations, he was satisfied thaf there had been no abuse of diplomaticprivilege in these instances. So far,, although I pressed that request to tht Minister on a number of occasions, I havÂ» not recefved that personal assurance. On the 22nd December, during the absence overseas of the Minister for Trade and Customs, I received from the Minister who acted for him a reply, in which he informed me that under customs item 373 spirituous liquor could be purchased for the personal or official use of members of foreign legations without the payment of any duty. He stated that the department had no power to refuse permission to import such liquor, and that no separate records for statistical purposes were kept of imports under customs item 373. But the Acting Minister was only evading the real issue, because in later correspondence he varied his excuse and said that, because of the labour involved and the cost, it was impracticable to make this information available. Since obtaining these replies, I have gone to the trouble of ascertaining the practice in the department, and I am assured that, far from its being difficult to obtain the information, and far from a great deal of labour being involved in obtaining the information, a telephone call to the department would enable the information to be readily obtained within a comparatively short space of time. It may be true that the records 'are not kept for statistical purposes, but if the Prime. Minister does not know and makes an inquiry he will discover that such is the case. Orders for this liquor are made in quadruplicate form, and one copy goes to the Department of Trade and Customs and is recorded. It is merely a matter of looking at those records, which are available in the department, to see whether there was any abuse of diplomatic privilege or not. The Minister said that if there had been any abuse he had no doubt it would be brought to the notice of the Collector of Customs. How could it be brought to his notice if no records are kept? Who is to know that this privilege is being abused if the department has no records to show the quantities being consumed by these legations? I again wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs on the 29th December, and I received a reply on the 21st January, 1.955. The Minister wrote as follows:Having regard to the labour and cost involved . . . The House will see that the Minister is changing his ground. Previously, it was not the practice, and then it is because of the labour and the cost involved. The Minister said that, frankly, it was not practicable to supply the particulars 30Ught by me. He said that a scrutiny of all the records would be required, and lie further pointed out that no breach of Commonwealth law was involved. He said that even if my statements were proved to be right, there was no breach of Commonwealth law; it was merely a breach of diplomatic privilege. What I want to ask the Prime Minister is this: tf those facts can be readily obtained from the department, why has he hesitated to order some investigation of the matter ? I again wrote to the Minister for Trade and Customs and received a reply on the 14th February. He had returned to the old argument that it is not the practice to make such information available. We are now back to exactly where we commenced, and I am still awaiting the personal assurance I had sought from the Minister that there had been no abuse of diplomatic privilege. I have asked the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he would ascertain whether there was any information in the hands of Mr Ward. the security service, the investigation! branch, or the New South Wales policetc show that this trafficking in duty-freeliquor had been engaged in by Dr Bialoguski and by his colleague, Mr. Petrov. As far as I can ascertain, thedepartment has made no such investigation. I remember wben I raised this matter on former occasions. Government members then said, as they aresaying today, that this was an endeavour to smear a witness who appeared before an investigation which has not yet been finalized. The fact is that there is no need today to make that allegation,, because these men are smearing themselves. If we take only Dr Bialoguski's own admissions published in the daily press, they show that at least he was a man of such character as to be capable of engaging in these practices. Let us go a little further. We find that Mr. Petrov himself has made very important admissions. When I mentioned in this House the question of huge quantities of liquor",25
102,Mr SPEAKER,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,-Order ! The honourable gentleman cannot deal with evidence ,27
103,Mr WARD,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,I am not doing so. I never mentioned anything about evidence. I said admissions.,27
104,Mr SPEAKER,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,Order ! No reference may be made to evidence given before the royal commission.,27
105,Mr WARD,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I had not mentioned evidence. I am mentioning admissions  this chamber that vast quantities of this liquor were brought into this country, not for the purposes of either the personal or official use of the Soviet legation, but for purposes of marketing it  has admitted Mr Keon interjecting,",27
106,Mr WARD,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,I point out to the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon) that  purchasing officer for the Soviet legation.,27
107,Mr KEON,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I rise to order. It is quite obvious that the honourable member for East Sydney is about to embark on statements that have been made before the royal commission. There has been  I know of, published anywhere. No  .published anywhere other than those -.statements that have been made before the .royal commission, and therefore, if the honourable member for East Sydney is - discussing the admissions made by Mr. Petrov, it is quite obvious he is discussing matters which were before the royal commission. That is distinctly a breach of the Standing Orders. Therefore, I ask .you, Mr Speaker, to direct the honourable member to confine his remarks to the terms of the letter you have read to the House, which you have ruled to be in - order.",27
108,Mr SPEAKER,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Order ! The honourable member is not entitled to refer to  before the royal commission. What other - statements he has made, I do not know. I myself am not aware of any statements - except those made before the royal commission;- so that if the honourable gentleman has information on which he is basing his statements, other than that - before the royal commission, I think he should disclose it to the House.",28
109,Mr WARD,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Mr Speaker, with all respect to you, I say that I have the information but I am not prepared to - disclose the source of it at this particular - stage any more than the honourable member for Yarra is prepared to disclose the connection between News Weekly and the security service, which obviously - exists. If the honourable member for Yarra refuses to disclose the intimate - connection between himself and the security service and News Weekly, I consider I should not be called upon to - divulge the source of my information. There is an easy way for the Government to establish the facts connected with this matter, and that is to investigate it . I am rather surprised at the great concern that the honourable member for Yarra has evidenced for protecting the - Government. I say again that Mr. Petrov has admitted that he handled",28
110,Mr KEON,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"I rise to order. It is quite obvious that the honourable member for East Sydney is quoting from Petrov's admission or statement before the royal commission. It is quite obvious because honourable members know, and you, Mr. Speaker, know too, that all the statements  statements that have been made in evidence before the commission. The honourable member for East Sydney can produce no statements from any other source to substantiate what he is saying. He is trying to skate around the Stand admitted he said something, and so on. Even though you, Mr Speaker, may not know the sources of the statements Mr. Petrov made or may not have made, it is obvious that the honourable member for East Sydney is quoting from knowledge that was obtained from a knowledge   quoting the evidence submitted by Mr. Petrov to the royal commission. It if one thing or the other. If the honourable gentleman is prepared to admit that the information was obtained when Petrov was an M.V.D. agent, or a Russian spy in this country, then I suggest he would be in order; but he is certainly not in order unless he is prepared to admit he obtained the information in that way. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! I must rule that the honourable gentleman, if he is quoting from material supplied by Mr. Petrov to anybody which he wishes to use at this stage in a debate of this kind, must disclose the source to this House; otherwise he cannot persist on those lines.",28
111,Mr WARD,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Wel l then, Mr Speaker, I shall make reference to information that was furnished to me, and give the source of it. It is not, however, the information to which I have just been referring. One of the solicitors who appeared before the royal commission has personally told me that he has been interrogated by s member of the Commonwealth Crown Law Department in Sydney and asked to divulge the source of the information upon which he had based his cross",28

It is equally idle for him to claim that, on demand, a government ought to publish details of the imports of duty-free goods by foreign missions in this country.

122,Mr MENZIES,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"The honourable member for East Sydney now presents himself as the apostle of virtue in this matter and says, in effect, "" I do .not want to prejudice a witness before the royal commission. I am a great believer in the royal commission, and I hope that its report will be made without delay."" The honourable member takes up that attitude now merely because he wishes to smear two people, each of whom has been a witness before the royal commission, each of whom has been seen by all the royal commissioners, and neither of whom, as I believe, has been seen by any member of this House, unless by the honourable member for East Sydney. And, sir, I believe, and the people of Australia believe, that when judges are appointed to estimate the character and credibility of witnesses, those judges ought to be allowed to perform their task. It would never occur to me, nor to any other honourable member of this Bouse, except perhaps one, to substitute my own, or his own, uninformed judgment about those people for the opinion formed by the judges before whom they have appeared and before whom they have been cross-examined for days, and sometimes for weeks. The honourable member for East Sydney says, "" Oh, yes, but the Commonwealth has made no inquiries "". Well, I spoke to my colleague, the Attorney-General (Senator Spicer) about this matter, and the information I gleaned is of great interest. Extensive inquiries were made when those allegations were first outlined in this House.",29

When those facts were assembled they were laid before the Crown Law authorities, which, as honourable members will agree, is the eminently proper course to follow in such cases. The reports were put before the Crown Law authorities with a request that they advise whether they disclosed anj evidence that would support the institution of proceedings against Petrov, or Bialoguski, or any other person, for aB offence against the Customs Act, or any other Commonwealth law, in relation to these alleged sales of liquor.",30

143,Mr SPEAKER,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Order ! I warn the honourable member for East Sydney, for the last time, that he must cease interjecting.",31
144,Mr MENZIES,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"A little careful investigation of those matters is always distasteful, I know. But there it is! If the charge that is made is a charge of abusing diplomatic privilege, that is to say, a charge of behaving improperly in a diplomatic capacity, then all honourable members, and all the people of Australia, know perfectly well that the whole of Petrov's conduct as a diplomat has occupied weeks, and indeed months, of the time of the royal commission. They also know that, the royal commission was set up to investigate that very problem, and to make its report. There is no more commonplace Communist technique in this country than that which has been used in this caseto set out, first of all, to discredit the royal commission, of which this House had unanimously approved, as the honourable member has rightly reminded us, and in the second place to discredit, if possible in advance, the report of the royal commission which must, in the nature of things, have a great relationship to the evidence given by Petrov and to the conduct of Petrov in his diplomatic capacity in the Russian Embassy. Therefore, the only other matter left in this charge is: Has there been a breach of the law, and has the Government failed to investigate it? I have told the House that it was properly and fully investigated. Did the maker of the charges contribute one shred of information to the investigation? Not at all! If there had been an investigation by a royal commission into that particular matter he would have pleaded privilege and run away, as he did before. Vou get no evidence from a man of this kind. None whatever! He publishes th""> rumours, he makes the charges. Thoy are picturesque; they are worth headlines. As it turns out, after the most careful! investigation, the Crown Law authoritiesof this country who investigate the reportssaid that there is no evidence to support any charge that there has been a breach of the law.",31
145,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"No , because there is not a breach of the law. Thelaw allows it to be done.",31
146,Mr MENZIES,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"That is all that needs to be said on this matter. Insofar as it concerns the diplomatic conduct of Petrov, it is plainly a matter outside the jurisdiction of this House at present. Insofar as it concerns the scrupulous, impartial enforcement of the law, theanswer is that, after a complete investigation, no evidence was obtainable that, im fact, there has been any breach of thelaw of this land. And, let me remind 1 honourable members, the law concerned is not a recent law. It is a law which has existed for 30, 40 or 50 years in Australia. So, in those circumstances I think that enough has been said in this debate. TheHouse has been patient in permitting the honourable member for East Sydney to raise this matter and in so doing to seize,, once more, the opportunity to follow the Communist line and put forward Communist propaganda.

Motion (by Sir ERIC HARRISON) agreed ioThat Standing Order 104-1 1 o'clock rulehe suspended for the remainder of this week. FOREIGN APE AIRS COMMITTEE. Motion (by. Sir ERIO HARRISON) proposed.1. That Mr Andrews and Mr Keon be members nf the Joint Committee appointed to consider foreign affairs generally, and, in ticular, to inquire into matters referred to hy the Minister for External Affairs. 2. That the foregoing resolution be com-municatcd to the Senate by message.",31
147,Mr CALWELL,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Melbourne) [5.10] [f the terms contained in the motion now before the House were the terms of appointment of the joint committee to consider foreign affairs, the Opposition would join the committee. As the motion stands, it states that the committee is appointed to consider foreign affairs generally and, in particular, to inquire into matters referred to it by the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Casey). If honourable members turn to the resolution of the House on the 25th August, 1954, they will note that the motion now before the House is in complete conflict with that resolution. The same words are used in the resolution, but they represent only the first of its five paragraphs. Paragraph 4 of the resolution contains no fewer than eight sub-paragraphs. Every paragraph after the first paragraph, including every sub-paragraph of paragraph 4, is designed to limit the NOES. powers of the committee. For instance, paragraph 4 (d) reads as follows:the committee and its sub-committees wil) sit in camera and their proceedings shall be secret unless the Minister at the request of the committee otherwise directs. There is not h in g to that effect in the m o t i o n now before us. P a r a g r a p h 4 (/ ) of the resolution statesthe committee shall, for considerations of national security, in all esses forward its reports to the Minister for External Affairs, but on every occasion when the conimittee forwards a report to the Minister it shall inform the Parliament that it has so reported; As t h o u g h that were not sufficient safeg u a r d to prevent the committee from d o in g a n y t h in g at all , another reservation is contained in the following words:except that in the case of matters not referred to it by the Minister for External Affairs, the committee shall not submit a report to the Minister nor inform the Parliament accordingly without the Minister's consent. No w we come to the precious p a r t of this sub-paragraph, w h i c h reads as f o l l o w s : Provided the Opposition is represented on the committee, copies of the committee's reports parto the Minister for External Affairs shall be it forwarded to the Leader of the Opposition for his confidential information. If the House agrees to the motion, and if it appoints to the Foreign Affairs Committee two representatives of the Australian Labour party (Anti-Communist), there is no provision in the resolution of the 25th August, 1954, nor in this motion, whereby the leader of that party may be furnished with the reports that the Minister for External Affairs will receive so that he may have them for his confidential information. The leader of this new party is to be treated as though he were not a leader at all. He is to be ignored' completely. That shows just how rapidly the Government arrived at a decision on this matter, and with what haste the negotiations must have proceeded when the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison) could not even draft the motion properly. Because, as I have already remarked, when members of the corner group join this committee, its reports will not be forwarded to the Leader of the Australian Labour party (Anti-Communist), to give it its full title. The hand of the Minister for External Affairs is evident in the resolunot tion of 1954 which stated that, subject to the consent of the Minister for External Affairs, the committee shall have power to send for persons, papers or records and that, subject to paragraph 4 (d) of the resolution, all evidence submitted to the committee shall be regarded as confidential to the committee. As a result of that provision, members of the new party will not receive any advice from their two representatives on the committee concerning its deliberations, just as members of the Liberal party and members of the Australian Country party are not allowed to receive advice from their representatives on the committee. If members of the committee do give information to their parties concerning the proceedings of the committee, they will obviously breach a decision of the House.",32
148,Mr CASEY,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,No .,33
149,Mr CALWELL,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"The Minister shakes his head and says "" No "". I put it to him that if he wants a real foreign affairs committee and not just a study circle, he should have the resolution of August, 1954, amended to conform to the resolution that has been submitted today. An interesting question is whether the resolution that has been moved today will supersede the resolution of August, 1954. If it will, the Opposition might nominate a number of members for appointment to the committee. But we certainly shall not make such nominations if the terms of the resolution of August, 1954, still stand. Eor a number of years, the Opposition has benn trying to make the Minister for External Affairs realise that he cannot tie up a foreign affairs committee. We do not ask him to appoint a committee with roving powers and wide discretion such as the committee on foreign affairs in the TJnited States of America. But we ask him not to call what is only a study circle a foreign affairs committee. If he wants to inform honourable members on foreign affairs, let him agree to the appointment of honourable members to a foreign affairs committee with the right to convey information that they derive from that committee to their party colleagues. Then the House generally, merely the "" blue orchids "" - I understand that is the title that members of the foreism affairs committee proudly bear-woul d receive information from the committee instead of remaining uninformed or misinformed. However, as the Minister for External Affairs has not been willing to give honourable members a clear statement on what is happening in Malaya, we cannot expect that the Minister will permit us to receive much information from this precious committee. The honourable members whom it is now proposed to appoint to the committee previously decided, when they were members of the Australian Labour party, to accept the decision of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) that Opposition members should not accept appointment to the committee. Having made this choice, thej may learn something from their membership of the committee or they may noi learn anything. But if it is the objective of the Minister for External Affairs, to drive members of the Opposition on to the committee by this means, he will fail. His approach to such matters as this is completely amateurish. I should like to believe that when he meets Mr Dullef and Mr Macmillan, face to face, he shows a more practised hand than he does when he tries to convince honourable members of this Parliament to join the body that he has set up. If this resolution is carried, that body will be repre sented to the people as having much wider powers than it really has. The Minister should encourage further discussions on this matter and should make the concessions necessary for the foreign affairs policy to become, like the immigration policy, bi-partisan, so that the country may know that on the first as well as the second of these two subjects there is not such a deep cleavage of opinion as there would appear to be in this House about our foreign relations",33
150,Sir ERIC HARRISON,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"The honourable member should say "" As there is"", not "" As there would appear to be "".",33
151,Mr CALWELL,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"Of course, there are differences of opinion on foreign affairs, but they get ironed out in this chamber as they are ironed out in the House of Commons. There will always be element? in. all parties who will not agree completely with what has been done. That is the way in which democracy works and it is good that there are divisions of opinion and that everybody is not regimented into thinking in the same way. The essentials of democracy are goodwill, the desire to serve our country, and the desire to protect the interests of our community and the interests of our allies. The Opposition is conscious of its duty in that regard and is proud of its record. But the Minister for External Affairs stands in the way of co-operation. He wants to lay down terms like a schoolmaster. On occasions, he thinks that he is still in Bengal as the Governor, although he has been back in Australia for nine years. Let him take ithe Australian attitude and help to iron out our differences on this matter, and offer less objection to the proposals of Opposition members, although we do not agree as an Opposition with the present constitution of the committee. We do not wish to have a couple more members added to the committee because such action will only make the committee more futile than it Has been. Some day, the Minister for External Affairs might present to the House some of the reports that this committee is supposed to have presented to him from time to time. I think that I can recollect only one such report having been presented to the Parliament. Perhaps there were two, but certainly there were no more than three. The committee has been in existence for about three years, and its members are still waiting for the longdelayed trips to Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries to which they were told that they would be able to io and question - diplomats and others about what is happening abroad. I remind the Minister for External Affairs of his failure to consult the Opposition on this matter. The terms to which he has referred are not the terms of reference of the committee. I have read those terms to the House. Perhaps, at this stage, the Minister for External Affairs might move an amendment to the motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to delete a number of clauses of the resolution of August, 1954. If he wants the Opposition to agree to leave being given for that purpose, such leave will be gladly given.",33
152,Mr CASEY,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"La Trobe-Minister for External Affairs) [5.23] - I always want to do justice to the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). I think that I can best do him justice now by assuring the House that he is not nearly as foolish as he appears. I sometimes envy him his ability to say things that he does not mean. As a matter of fact, I am not sure that I do envy him, but I say that in order to be pleasant. The Foreign Affairs Committee has been in existence, I think, for two and a half years. It was reconstituted in October, 1954, by a resolution which covered almost a foolscap sheet of paper. Qn behalf of the Government, I invited the official Opposition to join the Foreign Affairs Committee. Debate after debate has occurred in this House in which the honourable member for Melbourne has made statements similar to those which he made just now-statement s which fly in the face of the experience of honourable members who have served on this committee. With great respect, I say that everything that the honourable member said on this subject is nonsense. I hope that you will not misunderstand me. Mr Speaker. The word "" nonsense "" has a parliamentary meaning and I think that it avoids your stricture. That is why I have chosen the word so carefully. It was necessary, in framing the motion before the House, to refer in short terms to the resolution which covered a foolscap sheet of paper. Consequently, ths Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison), quite rightly, chose to identify the previous resolution of this House by citing the first clause whioh, in fact, is the executive clause and which reads as follows:That a joint committee be appointed to consider foreign affairs generally and, in particular to inquire into matters referred to it by the Minister for External Affairs. The resolution then proceeded to set out the way in which the committee should work, its powers to call for papers and people, and other matters in terms which I am sure remain in the minds of some honourable gentleman. The leader of the Anti-Communist to Labour party (Mr Joshua) approached me recently, and asked that his party be given appropriate representation- I think that was the term he used-o n the Foreign Affairs Committee. I considered his request, and consulted the Governterms, ment on the subject. It was obviously matter to which we would agree. In fact, my colleagues and I did agree accede to the request, and I told him that we would be glad to accept members of his party, pending-as I explained to him-the agreement of the other section of the Opposition to be represented on the Foreign Affairs mittee. I was obliged to say that numerical representation of his party would then have to be reconsidered, cause the inclusion of two members his party would be rather dispropormembers tionate, having regard to the numerical strength of the whole of the Opposition. The honourable gentleman was apparently prepared to accept that reply, and so motion took its present form. Sufficient of the full resolution, which is on record, was repeated in this motion to make quite clear to the Parliament what the Governsee-a ment was doing. That simple expedient has drawn the fire of the honourable ber for Melbourne, who has given himself the luxury of launching against me a speech similar to speeches that he has delivered on at least two other occasions in this Parliament, in which he affected to believe that the Foreign Affairs Comare mittee is merely a creature of my own, that I gave information to it at my whim and that, in fact, the committee of no use whatever. Although he tried to put venom into his remarks, he had difficulty in doing so; I give him credit for that. He referred to the committee as a study circle.",34
153,Mr CALWELL,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,The Minister has no agreed with that description of it.,35
154,Mr CASEY,ASSISTANCE FOR BLINDE D,"It is not a phrase that I myself would have chosen, but it is a derogatory phrase. The Foreign Affairs Committee is not an executive body. Apparently, what the honourable member for Melbourne wants, and what the honour the able gentlemen who sit behind him affect want, is that it should be an executive body on the general lines, I presume, of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Congress. It is the object of this Government not to create a body on those lines, but, if we are to choose to create a body very much more a approaching a study circle than a foreign affairs committee on the American model. to The honourable member for Melbourne is welcome to any comfort that he mighi two derive from that observation. We come to the very simple proposition that these two honourable gentlemen Comwho have been nominated by the leader the of the Anti-Communist Labour partythe honourable member for Yarra (Mr. beKeon) and the honourable member for of Darebin (Mr Andrews)-shoul d become of this committee. The Government welcomes their decision ap further evidence of the light they saw when they left, shall we say, the rump this of the Australian Labour party. The Government believes that they will get great advantage from membership of the Foreign Affairs Committee. They will s the existing members of the committee have seen for some considerable memtime-that nothing will be held backfrom them. Obviously, there are things which should not be quoted in public, leal the Australian national interest should suffer, but the members of the committee are told of those things. So long as they not disclosed in public, there will be no reason whatever why they should not own tell the other members of their party is about them in confidence. The honourable member for Melbourne sought to get this House to believe that anything thai the two members of the anti-Communist Labour party might learn as members of the committee would be secret, that they could not tell their party colleagues about them, and that, therefore, they would be better off by reason of having received the information. With great respectand I hate to say anything against my not friend from Melbourne-that is nonsense, as I hope and believe the honourable member for Yarra and the honourable member for Darebin will discover, possibly before next 24 hours are out. There is nothing more I need say on this matter. Although, in general, I respect my friend the honourable member for Melbourne, I must say that he has forfeited a small portion of my respect, for the reasons that I have tried to state.",35

JUDICIARYBILL 1955. Motion (by Mr MENZIES) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Judiciary Act 1903-1950, as amended by the Judges' Kemuneration Act. 1955. Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING .",38
161,Mr MENZIES,COVERED CABLE AND COVERED,"Kooyong - Prime Minister) [5.47] - by leave- I move That the bill he now read a second time. This bill, which amends the Judiciary Act, will probably, by leave of the House, be debated in conjunction with the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Bill , because the amendments apply partly to that legislation also. The present state of affairs in the High Court of Australia is that there is an appeal, as of right, from certain judgments of the Supreme Court. I ought to point out to honourable members that there are three ways in which a case can reach the High Court of Australia in its appellate jurisdiction. One is an appeal, as of right, where no leave or special leave is required. The second is the case where there is an appeal to the High Court, by leave, and the third is the case in which there may be an appeal to the High Court by special leave-specia l leave being reserved for those cases in which some point of law of novelty, or of extraordinary importance, falls to be determined. The appeal by leave-no t special leave-is frequently asked for in a case where a full court, for example, the. Supreme Court of a State, may have I directed a new t r i al of the matter and that being what the lawyers choose to call an "" interlocutory order"" in its effect, no appeal may be taken to the High Court except by leave. But there is a great difference between leave and special leave because in special leave matters of genuine legal importance must emerge. Now for many years the position in relation to appeals as of right-the first of those three classes-unde r the Judiciary Act, has heen that there may be an appeal as of right from every official judgment of a Supreme Court which is in respect of any sum or matter amounting to Â£300, or involves any claim to any property or civil right amounting to Â£300, or, thirdly, affects the any person under the laws relating to aliens, marriage, divorce, bankruptcy or insolvency. I need hardly tell the House that an appeal, as of right, iii respect an amount of Â£300 in 190.3 is now a little outdated. The trouble about it is that it rather tends in these days to lead to the cluttering up of the High Court lists with a number of cases that, iri reality, ought not to go there. It is the highest court of the realm and ought to direct its attention to matters of the greatest importance. Therefore, the effect of this bill is to propose that, having regard to modern circumstances, the amount shall be increased from Â£300 to Â£1,500. It has oeen suggested in some quarters that it ought to be Â£2,000, but I think that Â£1,500 id a not unreasonable amount. I want honourable members to understand that this does not mean that if the amount involved is less than Â£1,500 there can be no right of appeal to the High Court; All that it means is that there will be no appeal, as of right. It is still open to the High Court tb grant leave, or special leave, in appropriate cases. I should not imagine that there would be much argument about that amendment, which also has a bearing oh the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Aet. I come now t6 an appeal, as of right, from a judgment which affects the status of any person under the laws relating adjourned. to aliens. Interestingly enough, in the whole 50 years there has been no appeal aÂ« of right on a matter affecting aliens. What happens in the case of an alien who claims that his rights have been violated, or that he has a right to enter Australia, or something of the kind, is that habeas corpus proceedings are taken in the High Court in the first instance, and the matter is dealt with there, some constitutional point having been Mr Menzies. raised in the Supreme Court, the matter is automatically referred to the High Court without reference to this section at all. Therefore the reference to aliens is a dead letter. So far as bankruptcy and insolvency are concerned, the present position is that when we passed our bankruptcy law we provided a means of appeal to the High Court that was rather more status of satisfactory than this is. That leaves only the case of marriage and divorce* The position as we find it of is that a divorce suit is brought in the Supreme Court of a State. It is possible, under the celebrated, historical decision in Parkin v. James, to appeal direct to the High Court from the decision of a single justice of a Supreme Court. The result is that a fair number of divorce suits reach the High Court They often present no legal novelty, but considerable time is taken up in reading evidence and hearing arguments on matters in which there is no real problem of law. If there were, the High Court could still grant special leave to appeal. In the result, many hours are occupied in the High Court in arguing matters of that kind. I think it would be generally felt in the House that, in the absence of a genuine point of law of some novelty, an appeal to the Full Court of a State is adequate in the case of divorce; That is what the bill does: It takes up section 35; it recognizes the facts of life about aliens, bankruptcy and insolvency; it eliminates an appeal, as of right, in divorce matters; and it increases the appealable amount as of right from the 50-year-old Â£300 to Â£1,500. That is the substance of this bill, and I commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Calwell) NA NA BILL 1955.

164,Mr HASLUCK,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"Curtin-Minister for made .by this House. Territories) Â£8.3] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this hill is to provide the acceptance of the Cocos or Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean as a terriin tory under the authority of the Commoning wealth, and to provide for the governspecified ment of that territory. The House will recall that the first legislative step connection with the transfer of these islands to Australia was taken in Novemtherefore ber, 1954, when Parliament passed the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (Eequest and Consent) Act 1954. By that act, Parliais ment requested, and consented to, the enactment 'by the United Kingdom Parliament of an act enabling the Queen to place the Cocos or Keeling Islands under the authority of the Commonwealth making provision for matters incidental to the placing of those islands under that authority. When the bill for that earlier act was introduced on the 2nd November, 1954, the Minister for External Affairs informed Parliament of the discussions which had taken place with the United Kingdom Government and the Singapore Government with a view to the transfer of the islands to Australia. At the same time the Minister for External Affairs also gave to the House last November the reasons why the Australian Government thought that Australia, as the Government controlling the airstrip, should also administer the islands. The House was informed that when the bill had been approved by Parliament, the United Kingdom Government would introduce & bill into the United Kingdom Parliament for the purpose of transferring authority over Cocos Islands to the Commonwealth of Australia, and that when that action had been completed another bill would be brought before this Parliament to provide for the acceptance of the transfer and for the future administration of the That bill having been passed by Parliament last November, and the reasons for it having been given at that time, there is no need to go over the same .ground again or to enter on any of the matters on which a decision has already been I wish to inform honourable members that since November the United Kingdom Parliament has passed an act enfor titled the Cocos Island Act 1955, which provides that Her Majesty may, by order council, direct that the Cocos or KeelIslands shall, on such date as may be in the order, cease to form part of the Colony of Singapore and be placed in under the authority of the Commonwealth. The next legislative step is with this Parliament and is being taken in the bill now before the House. The passing of this bill which now presented for .debate will leave the way clear for the United Kingdom Government to seek Her Majesty's approval to an order in council in terms of the Cocos Islands Act 1955 of the United Kingdom. After the making of the order in council, the Australian Government will take over the administration of the islands. Having given that preliminary outline of the various formal and legislative steps to be taken in order that the transfer of the islands to Australia may be completed, I propose now to outline briefly the main provisions of the bill which I have now presented to the House. Part I. provides that the act shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. That date will be the date to be specified in the order in council to be made in terms of the United Kingdom, act as the date on which the Cocos Islands will cease to be a United Kingdom possession and will be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth. II. of the bill provides for the Cocos or Keeling Islands to be accepted by the Commonwealth as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth and to be known as the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I might mention that the use of the term ""Keeling"" is partly to distinguish these Cocos Islands from another group of islands known as Cocos, and also to commemorate and do honour to the discoverer of the islands-Keeling. 'Provision is also made in this part for the transfer to the Commonwealth, subject to certain specified exceptions, of the property, rights and liabilities of the United Kingdom and the Colony of Singapore, in and in respect of the islands, and for the exercise by the Governor General, on behalf of the Queen, of rights and powers vested in the Queen under the Indenture of 1886 granted by Queen Victoria, through the Governor of the Straits Settlement to George Clunies Ross. Subject, to conditions which allow Her Majesty to resume land in the public interest, provide for the establishment of a telegraph station, and prevent the alienation of land to other persons without the assent of the Crown, that indenture granted the land of the islands to George Clunies Ross and his heirs to hold in perpetuity. this regard, the United Kingdom Government, in the course of the negotiations, has been assured that the legitimate interests of the Clunies Ross family 3{r. Hashick. will not be prejudiced in the transfer of sovereignty to Australia. In other words, the rights of the Clunies Ross family will remain unaltered. The solicitors to the family have been kept in touch with the position, and they will continurto be informed of developments. Part III . of this bill deals with legislation for the territory. It is proposed to continue in force, subject to this act. when enacted, and to any other Commonwealth acts which will extend to the territory of their own force or which may be extended, the existing body of Singaporelaws in force in the islands at the time of transfer. In this bill specific provision is made in clause 18 for the continuation of the Malay institutions, custonuand usages which govern the daily life of Part the islanders. These provisions have been inserted su as to avoid any disruption which mighi have arisen if there had been an application, at one stroke, of a completely nen body of laws and customs. Under this? bill, the powers and functions conferred on the Governor of the Colony of Singapore by any of the laws which are being continued in force will in future be exercised by the Governor General of Australia. Those powers and functions which are conferred on any other person or authority by the laws which are being continued in force will be exercised b j such person or authority as the responsible Australian Minister of State may direct, and the Minister may delegate hit powers and functions to a specified person or authority. Provision is made in thit bill also for the Governor General to make ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, and for any law continued in force to be amended or repealed by an ordinance so made. I think experience will show th<extent to which this may be necessary. Ordinances made b.y the Governor General in terms of this bill will be subject to disallowance, in whole or in part, by the Parliament. Provision is mad* in this part of the bill also for tht In application of the Post and Telegraph Acts of Australia to the Territory, and for the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) to be responsible for necessary overseas telecommunication services. Part IV . of the bill provides for the application of Australian citizenship to residents of the islands, just as residents of the Australian possession of Papua are Australian citizens. Under this provision, a person, not being an Australian citizen, who, immediately before the date of commencement of this measure, was a British subject ordinarily resident in the islands may make a declaration, in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time, that he wishes to become an Australian citizen, and upon registration of that declaration, as prescribed, he shall be deemed to have become an Australian citizen upon the date of commencement of the. bill. For the purpose of this provision, the phrase "" Ordinarily resident "" means that the person, at the particular date, must have his home in the islands, or, if he should be temporarily absent, the islands must be the place of his permanent abode. Persons resident in the islands for a special or temporary purpose only are excluded. The provision regarding Australian citizenship has been included to meet a condition proposed by the United Kingdom that the residents of the islands should be given the opportunity to become Australian citizens. There are a little more than 300 residents of the islands to whom this provision might apply if they choose to exercise the option open to them. In Part V . of the bill, provision is made for the Governor General to have power to grant pardon, remission or respite of sentence to offenders convicted by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction in the Territory, and to remit fines,-penalties or forfeitures imposed qr incurred under the laws in force in the Territory. In the same part of the bill, there is provision for the accounts of the islands to be subject to audit in the usual way. Those are the provisions of the bill. Eonorable members will see that it seeks to make the transfer of the Territory from the United Kingdom to Australia with the least possible disturbance of any existing rights and with full respect for the existing customs and institutions of the islands. It might be emphasized also, if such emphasis were needed, that this transfer of territory has been brought about by a process of f r a n k and friendly negotiation between all the interests concerned and as a result of agreement among them, and that the transfer pays careful regard to the future well-being of the small population resident on the islands. As I indicated earlier, this bill is a necessary preliminary to the order in council by which the actual transfer of the islands to Australia will be made. I am sure that all honourable members are aware of the strategic importance of the islands to Australia, in view of the action that they took last November when they expressed their approval of the proposed transfer. They will be aware, also, of the heavy commitment which Australia has assumed in the reconstruction and operation of the airfield on the islands, and of the great importance that that airfield might have for us in certain contingencies. Therefore, in commending the bill to honourable members, I am confident that it both deserves and will receive their full support.",40
165,Mr DRAKEFORD,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"Maribyrnong ) [ 8 . 1 6 ] - I do not wish to criticize the bill in any way, but I should like an assurance from the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck) on the question whether the Cocos Islands will become completely an Australian possession. 1 recall that when the proposal for the transfer of sovereignty was first made, the British Colonial Office objected to the transfer. ""We in Australia considered that the Cocos Islands were a necessary link in an all-red air route from Australia to the United Kingdom. We saw only too clearly, during World War II . , - that, in time of war, the air route through India can be broken. Therefore, it has become necessary to have a route through South Africa , and, consequently, a stop at the Cocos Islands, where an airstrip was built for use by the Royal A i r Force during World War II . Later, that strip was used by the Royal Australian A i r Force. As the Minister has already stated, the present runway was laid down by the Airfield Construction Squadron of the Royal Australian A i r Force, which made a very good job of it . Earlier, we found a great reluctance on the part of the British Colonial Office to transfer the Cocos Islands to Australian sovereignty. I realise that it was not easy to overcome the objections of the Colonial Office. After the late Mr. Chifley visited England as Prime Minister of Australia and took the matter up with the Colonial Office, negotiations became a little easier. Any .one who has looked at the maps and studied air travel can see that it is essential to have a stopping place somewhere other than in South-East Asia on an air route from Australia to Great Britain in order to prevent an interruption of communications in time of war. From the Cocos Islands to South Africa is a very long flight. The nearest point to Africa at which a stop can be made after leaving the Cocos Islands is Madagascar and the next stop on the route is Johannesburg. The air route then proceeds northwards to north Africa and across to the TJnited Kingdom. As I stated at the outset, I do not wish to criticize the bill. I am not clear whether the Cocos Islands will become an Australian possession. Australia's responsibility in these matters is great. At various conferences I, when I was Minister for Civil Aviation, and other Ministers who have since held that portfolio, were told that the British Government complained that it had to meet the cost of the upkeep of far distant airfields such as those in the Cocos Islands and at Fiji, and that it was more inclined to allow Australia to have the responsibility of administering the territories in which those airfields were situated. Let me say now that I think a very good job has been done, not only in the preliminary negotiations that took place when Mr Chifley was Prime Minister in the Labour Government, but also since. This matter clearly illustrates the time that it takes to achieve something which it seems obvious to the ordinary person should be done. My own feeling is that it could have been done earlier than this, but now it has been accomplished I tliink Australia has every reason to congratulate itself on having overcome what appeared to be very difficult problems. I commend the bill, and I am quite sure that there will be no opposition to it from this side of the House. I feel, having had an assurance from the MinisMr Drakeford. ter for Territories-at least, he nodded his assent when I raised the matter-that it is the property of Australia, that something has been achieved, because there is a very big responsibility connected with the upkeep of civil airfields that are built on coral. I happened to know a man who was engaged in building a lot of airfields in the Coral Sea and other areas. When heavy planes land on such airfields, it is difficult to keep them in very good order. Apparently that difficulty has been overcome. I support the measure wholeheartedly. Debate (on motion by Mr CHAMBERS) adjourned. NA TARIFFS AND TRADE. Debate resumed from the 7th June (vide page 1495), on motion by Mr. MCEWE NTliat this House approves the Government's decision to accept the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the proposed agreement on the Organization for Trade Cooperation, subject in either case to prior acceptance by the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States of America.",42
166,Mr CREAN,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"Melbourne Ports) [8.21]. - I should like to support the opinion expressed by the honourable member for  is unfair of the Government to bring in a proposal of such importance as is this proposal to the future of Australia's trade and our balance of payments position generally, in the dying hours - of the sessional period. It is more unfair when one considers that the review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which we are considering consists of about 100 pages of printed matter which contain elaborate and intricate amendments to the agreement. By introducing, at this late stage, for our consideration, such a bulky document, the Government is showing scant courtesy to honourable members and giving very little justice to the public outside.",43
167,Mr ADERMANN,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"Some of the provisions have not been dealt with here, but have been dealt with outside.",43
168,Mr CREAN,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"That is so. We expect to be informed in this Parliament of the country's business, and not to hear about it as a result of statements that have been made to members of primary producers' organizations. I wish to join issue with the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr. Swartz) with respect to his statement in the House last night that this was the earliest opportunity that the Government had had to present this matter to the House. As evidence of the lack of basis for that statement by the honourable member for Darling Downs I now produce Command Paper 9414, entitled Review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which contains exactly the same text as the document we are now considering, and which was presented in the House of Commons last March. If the TJnited Kingdom Government found it possible to present this document in the House of Commons Ln March, I fail to see how any government apologist can justly claim that the 3rd June was the earliest date on which this review of the agreement could be presented to this House. Having read the second-reading speech of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture MCEwen), who, unfortunately, is not in the chamber at the moment, one would imagine that the amendments to the agreement that have been, secured constitute a great triumph for Australian diplomacy in general, and for the Minister himself in particular. That is - a matter of opinion. However, just to show that apparently any success in having these amendments made is not regarded as being exclusively an Australian success, I should like to quote a small extract from the London Economist of the 2nd April, 1955. In a section headed ""American Survey"", the American correspondent of that journal refers to the situation in America, and indicates the dimculty that is experienced in getting this kind of document through the TJnited States Congress, which seems to be in inverse ratio to the ease with which the Minister apparently imagines this document will go through this Parliament. The article readsDemocrats in the Senate may hold together enough to defeat this dangerous amendment but' not unless the Administration speedily clears up the anxieties over Gatt. Fortunately the State Departmentseems confident that it can demonstrate that the recent conferences at Geneva so far from placing a time bomb under the Constitution amounted to a major victory for American diplomacy. Starting with a very bad hand dealt by the need to stand by every embarrassing section of the laws on agricultural subsidies, the Americans eventually trumped almost all opposition by the familiar tactic of appearing as arbitrators between other countries and Congress. In other words, this informed critic imagines that what took place in the negotiations over the agreement was a triumph for America. The Minister imagines it was a triumph for Australia. I suggest that there are one or two matters on which the Minister might have given this House a little more illumination. The bill, and the Minister's second-reading speech, were accompanied by this document of about 100 pages, which sets out in detail the amendments to the agreement. I should like to ask the Minister a question in respect of the statement which appears nnder the heading "" Tariff Bindings "" on page 6 of the document. That statement reads(Mr During the three months immediately before 1st July, 1955, Australia is free to modify or withdraw-in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 of the Article-individua l concessions in the Australian tariff accorded to other countries. It is now the 8th June, 1955, so there is not much time left. I ask the Minister to indicate in more detail what some of the concessions that are to be withdrawn amount to. Perhaps he would enlighten the House as to what modifications are, in fact, proposed and of what advantage they will be to Australian trade generally. Last night the honourable member for Darling Downs gave us some of the history of this agreement. I do not intend to traverse that history in detail other than to indicate that when the agreement was drawn up there were fundamental differences of approach on the part of America and on the part of Australia as to how far this agreement might go. The Americans, I think, were more interested in lowering tariffs generally, whilst Australia, on the other hand, and I think rightly, saw this problem not merely as one of trade but also as one touching the whole economic pattern itself, and particularly related to the maintenance, not only in Australia, but also in other parts of the world, of full employment. That particular aspect seems tb have been lost sight of in this more narrow question of bargaining for concessions between countries. I think  a delegate from Canada, sum up the real weaknesses in this general approach to these important matters. He said, speaking of the 100 pages or so of details of this new agreement The rules say very little indeed about exports. We think tliey should say more. In other words, the whole emphasis on this question is. not on exports, but on iniports. I submit initially that that is a rather back-handed way of approaching this problem. After all, the imports of any country-and I deal with Australia in particular-ar e determined by its earnings from its exports. One thing about which we have to make up our minds in this country, and I am glad to see that apparently even an Australian Country party Minister is at last converted to the idea, is that, whilst it is easy to talk glibly about Australia living off the sheep's back, in order for Australia to have a properly integrated economy, we must have secondary production as well as primary production. If we are to continue to develop our economy we must have more and more secondary industry, because we cannot absorb our increasing population-no t only our own natural increase, but also the increase by immigration-if we do not develop secondary industry. There seems to have heen evolved at this recent meeting on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade a new kind of economic unit that was not envisaged previously. In the past, we have talked about under-developed countries on the one hand, and developed countries on the other hand. The great contribution that has been made by the Minister in relation to this matter seems to have been that he has suddenly discovered that Australia is neither under-developed nor developed, but that it is a developing country. I suggest that that is the only brain-storm that has emerged from the recent conference, although it is a little belated. Honourable members on this side Jfr. Crean. of the House have always urged that Australia is a developing country, and that the problems of properly using our natural resources in the national interesl is probably the prime problem with which this Government is faced. However, it seems to have been lost sight of in these intricate negotiations about minor details. I suggest that there are many things in these amendments about which the Minister might have given a little more information. The report contains amendments of the general agreement itself, and at the end there are a number of resolutions that were agreed to separately. One matter in particular on which the Minister ought to throw more light, is the decision of the 5th March, 1955, which appears on page 99 and the following pages of the report, and which deals with the important question of import restrictions or, as the Americans seem to call them, quantitative restrictions. It . too, is a problem that must be faced up to seriously in Australia. It seems inevitable that for a. long period ahead it wili be necessary to have import restrictions for the purpose of regulating Australia's trade. Yet to some degree- I do not know how far, because I have not had sufficient time to go into the details of the resolution-Australi a has handed over to the new body called the O.T.C., the full designation of which is the Organization for Trade Co-operation, consultation on the imposing of import restrictions in this country in the future. I should say that that is a considerable limitation of Australia's economic freedom, particularly when it is realized, as it must be realized, that our economy is, as the Minister has stated, a dependent economy. We are dependent for what we can import on what we earn by exports. The thing that has not been faced up to in these negotiations is the fixation of reasonable prices for Australian exports. There are always minute limitations at the other end on what we shall import, but, to me, the primary question seems to be that of our export earnings. We in Australia have very little control over our export earnings, as they are dependent upon the two important commodities, wool aud wlieat. Australia does not determine in any degree the price of its wool and wheat. We have very little control over the volume of those exports. These things show the hazardous position of our export earnings, yet no attempt seems to have been made-and [ think the greatest obligation is on America-to arrive at some method of determining with justice what the prices of wool and wheat ought to be. I admit chat it is not an easy problem to solve, but, unless some attempt is made to grapple with that side of it , it seems to me that a document like this report on the review of the general agreement can rely, as it has relied, only upon those clauses that are described as escape clauses. What happens is that we enter into the agreement and then we put so many limitations upon it that virtually it contains more exceptions than observances. It is difficult to know whether, it is worthwhile to pursue that kind of agreement. The general agreement was entered into in the period of post-war reconstruction when everybody had high ideals about how people ought to live amongst themselves in the future. But, to some degree, trade, private enterprise and conflicting economic systems have overridden those humanitarian ideals in the ensuing period. Of course, we must be realists about these things. The Minister has been a realist in relation to some of these matters, at any rate, but there are one or two questions that I should like to ask him . I hope that when he is summing up he will be able to furnish some explanations. The first of those questions which, as I have already stated, is referred to in the report is this: What are the concessions that it is proposed shall be made before the 1st July, 1955? One further point about which we are entitled to further explanation is this: Just how far does the report go in relation to the regulating of prices of American products on the home market which, as we know, is of importance to the rest of the world. I propose to quote for the information of the House an article that was published by the Princeton University in Essays In International Finanre. and which was entitled "" America's Foreign Trade Policy and the General Agrr>empnt on Tariffs and Trade. The article was written by Raymond Vernon, who forinany years was one of America's representatives at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade secretariat in Geneva. I wish to know from the Minister what is the position now with regard to what are called price support programmes in America, because they are very relevant to this matter. The article readsOno of the principal exceptions, made largely at American urging And the writer is referring to the situation that had existed before the ninth session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradehas to do with domestic agricultural incomesupport programs. The general rule here is that if nations decide to curtail their domestic production or marketing of an agricultural product to any degree in order to support farm income, they may curtail imports in equal degree. The GATT does not, however, give license to any nation to curtail such imports simply because that nation is pegging the price of an agricultural commodity above the world prices for the commodity; the right to restrict imports exists only where domestic production or marketing also is being restricted. Accordingly, many of our American price-support programs would not qualify as the type which justifies import restrictions under the Agreement, I ask the Minister what modifications have been made to bring within the scope of the general agreement those matters that were previously outside its scope and which, it seems to me, give very important concessions to America at the expense of other countries. Mr Vernon also' cites Australia's experience a year or two ago when Chile objected to a subsidy that apparently was being paid on superphosphates in this country and in relation to which, as a result of talks that were held by agreement countries, some modification was made. He refers to a further incident that occurred recently when the United States protested to the United Kingdom because the United Kingdom was putting in pure Virginia tobacco a certain percentage of tobaccoes which, I presume, came from other than dollar areas. A system already operates in Australia whereby a certain proportion of Australian grown leaf is added to imported tobacco. As a result of these negotiations, has Australia's right to continue to operate that kind of system been in any way limited? These are the kinds of matters on which the House is entitled to a more adequate explanation than has been given because this document will of some significance to Australian trade to this country. during the next few years. In a bulletin of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia called Canberra Letter and dated the 6th April, 1955, Mr Latham Withall, diswool, cussing the modifications to the agreement which had been announced in the newsby papers but not divulged to this House, made the following statement:The oflicial explanations will be, of course, couched in the language of diplomacy and be somewhat difficult to follow, or be readily understood and evaluated by the business community. I think that the official explanation been couched, not in the language of diplomacy, but in the language of extreme obscurity.",43
169,Mr JEFF BATE,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"Macarthur) [8.42]. - I think that it would be proper for the House to express its appreciation the efforts of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) and the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) who went overseas to "" negotiate with the Government of the TJnited Kingdom concerning trade idea arrangements between the TJnited Kingthat dom and Australia and who achieved their final triumph at Geneva in conexport nexion with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If there were any suggf.sr.ion of unemployment in this country, the House would be packed honourable members would be very anxious. I suggest that this agreement will prevent the recurrence of the serious events which took place in this country after the of 1914-18. From 1929 to 1932, the world prices of our exports crashed and we received a very small amount of export income although we still had great comcately mitments overseas in the form of repayties ments of loans and interest payments. The sufferings of those years left a mark on the community which will not be easily erased. A recurrence of those happenings has been avoided by the abortive journey abroad of the Minister for merce and Agriculture and the Minister for Trade and Customs. In approving the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in placing Australia in a very special position in relation to that agreebe ment, they have rendered a great service Many honourable members know that the United States of America holds surpluses of certain primary products which are important to Australia. I refer, not to but to butter, dried fruits, the production of which has been subsidized the United States of America, and other commodities a surplus of which could seriously affect the marketing of the products of some of our smaller inmay dustries. Although small, those industries contribute to the great total of our export income which enables the continued development of this country by has providing funds for the purchase of the raw materials which go into the manufactures of which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) has spoken. The honourable member took credit to his party for the fact that it of had always regarded Australia as a developing country. In effect, he said, "" We backed this horse "". If the honourable member favours what has been called import replacement "", let him remember that the people who have advanced this to the Tariff Board have forgotten if costs of production in Australia are raised and if , in consequence, our income is injured, the supply of the materials needed for our manufacturing industries will be restricted. In a developing country such as Australia, and manufactures are important. Recently, the chief executive officer of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, Dr Vernon, made an applicawar tion to the Tariff Board in which he said that Australia could not expand its export income any further. He said that the wheat and wool markets were delibalanced, and that other commodiwere selling for less than their cost of production. He then stated that, in order to protect our balance of payments, we must try to reduce our imports of manufactured goods instead of taking action in relation to exports. He Comsaid that we should try to manufacture in Australia those goods which we now export. He used that contention, as an argument in favour of raising the tariff on those, manufactures in which he was interested. But he forgot that it is necessary to expand the exports of a developing country in order to secure raw materials. I think it was the cellulose acetate industry that he sought to have protected. But .that industry, too, needs to obtain its raw materials from overseas. Our overseas credits may be supported for a time by means of dollar loans, but in the final analysis rural exports are necessary in order to pay for the raw materials required for the manufacturing industries. I am glad that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports agrees that, in the long run, our export industries must continue to function. Half of our exports is wool, about one* sixth is wheat, about another sixth is meait, and other industries such as the dried fruits industry provide the balance ef our very necessary export income. Recently, some financial stringency has been observed in this country. That is - directly traceable to the fact that our overseas credits are Â£200,000,000 less than they were last year. Immediately our overseas balances commenced to fall, we started to get into trouble. Some representatives of the Building Workers In dustrial Union of New South Wales are now in the King's Hall in order to make representations for the provision of capital for building purposes. Those men are there because our export earnings have been falling, not due to any lack of effort by the people engaged in our export industries, but purely because there was a fall of Â£40,000,000 in the amount that was - paid for our wool this year, and because our food industries have met strong competition overseas. This very full document, together with the speech of the Minister for Commerce .and Agriculture, has provided honourable members with a record of what happened at the conference on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at Geneva and what happened .between the representatives of the Australian .Government and the United Kingdom .Government in London. I think that some honourable members have showntoytheir attitude to this master that they - are not awa-re of rthe very .great 'importance of the paper that is being considered. It is now ten years since the end of World War II . and, due to the efforts of the Minister, we may avert what happened in 1929-30, which was about ten years after World War I . I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Americans for the consideration they gave to the arguments that were advanced by Australia, particularly in view of the fact that some blunt references were made at the conferences to America's huge stocks of food. I point out that if they threw low-quality goods on the various markets, and thereby established a new low .threshold for those goods, they .could destroy the trade of the rest .of .the western world. At any rate, that action would go a long way towards destroying - our economy. It is only recently that the Americans have realized the value of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a means of preventing a recurrence of happenings in the period between 1929 and 1932. The .two Australian Ministers concerned in - this matter exerted tremendous efforts to bring about the revision of the agreement that we are- .now considering. I want to congratulate the Minister for Commerce .and Agriculture (Mr. MCEwen)-â¢ Mr Ward. - What has he done?",47
170,Mr JEFF BATE,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"The honourable member - for East Sydney (Mr Ward) wants to .know what the Minister has done. I was about to thank the Minister on behalf of the people of Australia. Apparently the honourable member for East Sydney has not been present in the chamber during the greater part of my speech, during which I have pointed out to the House that the Minister has probably saved us from a disaster-probably , because we do not know whether a disaster would have occurred. At least, the Minister has taken great precautions to insure aga.inst a disaster occurring, and we have high hopes now that a disaster will not occur.",48

175,Mr WARD,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"Obviously , the honourable member is not one of the Liberal rebel group.",49
176,Mr JOSHUA,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"Ballarat-Leade r of the Anti-Communist Labour party) [8.52] This is a most important measure, and I am sorry that an honourable member is allowed only twenty minutes in which to speak to it. As the measure has been introduced rather late in this sessional period, I do not propose to spend a great deal of time bewailing that fact, but shall endeavour to make the best use of the time allotted to me. The proposition before the Government was whether it should continue a very strong measure of control over Australian industries-bot h primary and secondaryor whether, colloquially speaking, it should go alone. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) was confronted with considerable difficulty when seeking a solution to this problem. There is no doubt that when the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was negotiated, the Labour Government that was then in office was confronted with even greater difficulties. It entered into the arrangement with hesitancy, a feeling of misgiving, and some wonderment as to the outcome of the agreement. The Minister has had considerable experience of the difficulties that confront our primary and secondary industries. He has endeavoured to overcome the complaints of the manufacturers, and we know that he has been mindful of the necessity to protect our rural interests. I shfll review briefly the manner in which the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade worked. As far as secondare manufacture is concerned, the aTvpfvment resulted in irksome procedures, which caused additional expense to manufacturers and necessitated thei' laying o^t extra, coital, a COITPP which they did not consider to be justified. Let us take, for example, the importation from Germany of plant for the Lurgi-gasification works at Yallourn, in Victoria. Considerable expense is involved in the payment of duty. Consequently, the capital cost, of the plant, when installed, will be very much greater than it should be. This is an example of the effect on large businesses of the exercise of control in relation to our primary and secondary industries. I have also observed instances of additional expense being caused to the textile industry. I understand that textile manufacturers favour intricate machinery of Swiss manufacture. When they wish to expand their plant, they naturally favour installing additional machinery of similar manufacture. They then find that such machinery attracts a very high rate of duty. Their only alternative is to buy English machinery, but the parts of such machinery are notinterchangeable with the parts of the existing machinery. In a number of instances textile manufacturers decided that it was best for them to incur the extra expense of installing foreign-made machinery, but they have complained to me that that additional expense had increased their capital outlay, and consequently their working costs. Of course, this state of affairs has been brought about by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I have no doubt that the Minister took that fact into account when he was considering whether we should subscribe to the agreement for a further term. The Minister must also have been aware of the very slow procedure of tariff adjustment. It is a very slow business for any manufacturer to obtain relief from the Tariff Board. In the first place, three months' notice must be given of the application. Considerable time is then occupied in discussing the matter, considering the application, preparing the report, and passing the necessary regulation to grant him relief. It will be appreciated that a manufacturer cannot apply for relief until such a course is justified, because it is necessary for him to prove his case before the Tariff Board. There is no doubt that many manufacturers have been involved in considerable loss 1 throuqrh the lengthy procedures of the Tariff Board. During such hearings, in many instances both their plant and their man-power remain idle. This results in a loss of efficiency. I am sure that many persons who are engaged in secondary industry have experienced considerable difficulty through the system of Tariff Board control and preferential 'duties. There is generally present at hearings of the Tariff Board an anonymous person representing the Joint Committee on Tariff Revision, who is really the watchdog of overseas interests. I fear that the Australian manufacturers are very largely in the hands of overseas interests. Of course, the manufacturers do not resent the Tariff Board; on the contrary, they appreciate the board's efforts. To the degree that the Tariff Board is the watchdog of Australian interests, it should be commended. However, in view of the fact that manufacturers' costs are continuing to increase, the lengthy procedures of the Tariff Board do not give the manufacturers much comfort. If the board does not ensure the provision of adequate protection, some Australian industries might have to close down, with resultant losses of money and trade. The alternative, of course, is a good market, in which the demand of industry for labour and materials has a continuously inflationary effect, which results in increased costs of labour and materials. Their only source of relief is the Tariff Board; but, as I have pointed out, that is a slow method of getting relief. Turning to primary industries, we find a somewhat similar position. Increasing costs in this country have made it necessary for one measure of protection after another to be afforded to primary producers. We find evidence of that in the ever-increasing array of new boards. We have butter stabilization bodies, we have people regulating the sale of sugar and wheat by sugar agreements and wheat asreements, we have fla.x bounties and assistance to dried-fruit producers. There is a board or authority controlling almost every primary product. These bodies have to be kept alive and kept on the job the whole time in order that the farmers mav get a fair return for their output. We know that butter is sold overseas for less than the Australian consumer has to pay for it. We all pay an extra ls. or so for our pound of butter in order to offset the low returns from sales of butter overseas, so that the dairy farmers will get a fair return for their labour. Increasing costs have made that necessary. I am only looking at things as we find them at the present time. That is what the Minister has to do. He has all these boards to look at. We have only to study the publications issued by a department such as the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to find out what a tremendous job has to be done. It all goes on under the surface. No one seems to take any notice of it in these days, but it entails the expenditure of a tremendous amount of money and shows that the primary producers are very highly controlled and very highly organized. I feel that, as costs increaseand they seem to be increasing all the time-ther e will be further agreements, boards and controlling bodies. The farmers are becoming as tied up with controls as are the manufacturers. If we want to be objective, we have to consider whether the Minister could avoid this rigid framework of controls. This Government at times gave the impression that it was endeavouring to avoid controls, but it appears that the Minister, at any rate for a time, has foresaken that policy, and feels that he must accept controls and also that he must accept this agreement for a further period. I observe, however, that he has endeavoured to secure some flexibility by certain measures that he has adopted. I refer, for instance, to the machinery for studying market conditions in certain countries and for consultation with Australian producers. That will afford some protection, but not a great deal. However, for what it is worth, the Minister should be given credit for it. We all were very interested to see whether he could secure some alteration of the arrangements for imposing import controls. These controls are most important. If a large volume of manufactured goods flows into this country, the expenditure on those goods may eventually exhaust our overseas funds. It may be necessary to do something to reduce the inflow of goods before our overseas funds run out. The fact that p,ur oy.er.seas curiiency reserves w.er,e runt ning ^own had the .beneficial effect of prpjtec,ting .Australian secondary indust tr.ias frpm $ e inj;qa(js which large quantities of imported manufactured goods were making into their markets. Everybody wanted to know whether, when the Minister went .overseas, he would 'be able to get a clause inserted in the agreement under which we could clap on import controls at any time when our secondary industries were experiencing difficulties. Other countries pre.tty soon woke up to that one. They would not allow t'he Minister ,to do that, but he was able to retain the right to impose import controls if our overseas currency reserves were imperilled. I must agree that the Minister had no alternative, and for that reason I do not oppose the resolution. In phe last few minutes pf my .speech, I want Jo try to show the way things are going. The Minister has got a three year agreement. We pan look forward to another review of the position in ahout three years' time. What shall we find then? Shall we still find this irksome superstructure of contrpls on top of our secondary industries and primary industries? I think it is very likely that we shall find it. It is likely that we shall find that there is. an increased number of boards. There are at present about 3,000 tariff items wbjch regulate the inflow of secpndary manufactures to this country and have a tremendous bearing on our secpndary industries. I think we shall find in three years' time that there are many more' tariff items regulating every sphere of pur secpndary industry. I feel also that the number of farmers' boards will have increased. Must we negfird f.hat state pi affairs as, sgrqething that will always be with us,? If we give attention tq the proper methpd of overcoming the difficulties and if we know what will have to be done, it wi\l not be such a shock to us when it is done. I think that the whole of the problem is bound up with the fact that our currency is over-valued. No amqunt of pretending that it is not overvalued, will make any difference, because the signs will appear. They are, the difficulties of our secondary industries in meeting competition and the difficulty of selling our Mr Joshua. u primary pr.pd.ucts .pyerseas. When our currency is oy.er-y-alued, .thpse difficulties always' .appear.. W-e haye ,at .present a fixed .exchange r,ate, .which bas marry .advantages for Australia. But there was a .time when the variatio.ii of fte exchange (rate fr.om day ,to ,day had ,a regulating influence and prevented pur currency fr.pm becoming .oy.er - yalued. That - was s,et aside in fay.pur ,of a fixed .exchange rate, although ,the idea was not .to abandon, alterations .of .tie exchange rate for all ,time, When the fixed exchange rate was introduced, it was recognized that there might be times when it - would be necessary to alter i^t. The idea w,ae to .avpid small .and frequent fluctuations aad to make alterations only when it appeared that a .definite change could be expected in the economy of the country oyer a .cpnsiderable period. That is what faces us at present. We can expect a definite change in the economy of the country over a considerable period. At present, our currency is over-valued. That is shown by the difficulty .of selling our primary products overseas and the difficulty that our manufacturers are experiencing in competing with imports from other countries. When we recognize the real value of pur currency, we shall probably be able to d.o a great deal tp reduce the great superstructure of controls which we are building on top of our primary and secpndary industries. There is a lot to be said ih favpur of an alteration of the exchange rate. I bring the matter up now because I think that newspapers have a duty to prepare the people'for such an alteration. Any suggestion ""that the currency should be depreciated by, say, 5 per cent., IQ per cent., or 15 per cent brings howls of rage froni all the importing interests. They misrepresent the position, because it is' to their advantage to do so.

The. newspapers have a job to dp there. I mention i \ also for"" the benefit of businessmen, jfthere is to be. a cjiange in the exchange rate, businessmen might be caught with a large quantity of goods for which they must pay in sterling. They can avoid paying for those goods many more Australian pounds than they had expected to pay, if they have sufficient warning. Of course, they may, for a few pounds, insure their contracts with the Commonwealth Bank against the consequences of an alteration in the exchange rate. Better still, they can arrange for their contracts to be settled in Australian currency. If they do this they will not suffer as a result of a change in the exchange rate. An altered exchange rate would confer great benefits upon Australia. It would have to be accompanied by substantial alterations in protective tariffs. These would have to be down-graded because a further depreciation of the Â£1 would give added protection to both primary and secondary industry. Many of the Tariff Board's decisions could be completely set aside because no protection would be ueeded. On the other hand, many agreements for the sale of primary products wonld also have to be reviewed. Exports would yield a greater return in Australian currency, and this might lead to a reduction in Australian prices.",49

178,Mr MCEWEN,GENERAL AGREEMENT ON,"Murray-.Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [9.12] - in reply-^-I do not propose to occupy the time of the House unduly by replying at great length to the speeches of honora. able members. Generally speaking, they have been temperate and constructive. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard), who led honourable members opposite in this debate, said that the members of this Government, who had criticized the agreement when a Labour Government had brought it down, now proposed to renew it. That is true, hut the honourable member studiously avoided reminding the House that our criticism was on specific grounds. That is on record. We criticized the manner in which the agreement closed the door negotiation, and stressed the value of Ottawa preferences. That was the prima purpose of our criticism. Our experience in the last few years has shown it to be completely justified. As we predicted, having become a party to the agreement, Australia has been unable to persuade other interested parties to give it the licenee that Labour failed to reserve for it-to re-negotiate with the United Kingdom and re-establish the value of the Ottawa preferences. That is a completely candid explanation of the serious position which was created by the ineptitude of a previous Labour government and which we have been unable to correct. Moreover, Labour helped to establish a position which could not be overcome by Australia's withdrawing from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. So far as the re-negotiation of Ottawa preferences is concerned, withdrawal from the general agreement would not enhance our position at all as long as the United Kingdom remained bound by its inhibitions concerning new preferences. The United Kingdom has made it quite clear that it intends to remain a party to the agreement. Insofar as this Government is recommending the ratification of an agreement which, in this particular, is highly unsatisfactory to Australia, it feels bound to point out that the responsibility is clearly that of the Labour party, which was in office when the agreeExperience has also shown that our criticism of the agreement on other grounds was justified. We pointed out the inflexibility of the agreement, which bound the Australian tariff schedule over wide areafor long periods. Hansard of 1947 and 1948 will confirm that. We prophesied that this would have serious consequences for Australia's growing manufacturing industries. It is a matter of history that in recent years the Associated Chamber of Manufactures, and individual manufacturers, have bitterly criticized the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for that very reason. It remained for this Government to marshal the arguments and make the other parties to the agreement realise what Labour had itself failed to realizeto rethat the character of our economy,, the especially in the field of secondary industry, demands a certain flexibility in our tariff rate. I explained the need for chat in my first speech on this proposal. This Government has, in the terms which [ outlined earlier, and with the aid of representatives of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures who acted as consultants on the spot negotiated that degree of flexibility which every one knew to be essential. I am able to say that the Associated Chambers of Manufactures regards the new and modified General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as an acceptable and valuable document. The third point upon which we criticized the agreement when Labour presented it seven or eight years ago, provides me with an opportunity to reply to a statement by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). We pointed out that the agreement was really unbalanced in that it dealt comprehensively, though somewhat unsatisfactorily, with tariffs as they affected secondary industry. \Quorum formed.] It was obviously designed to give a certain degree of stability to co mtries largely interested in exporting the products of secondary indu?cry. Of course, Australia was not then, nnd is really not now, in that category. It provided no comparable protection for the exports of Australia's primary So part of the mission of Senator O'Sullivan and myself in these negotiations was to try to achieve a balance lacking in the original document. Without traversing some of the matters which [ explained in some detail when I spoke earlier, I remind the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that we have achieved, partly in the articles as redesigned in the agreement, and partly by resolutions carried during the negotiations, a protection hitherto non-existent for our exports against unjustifiably subsidized exports of competitor countries. We achieved results of a character which, to a very important extent, are binding on nations which entered into this agreement in good faith-and would question that the United States qualifies on those terms. Those resolutions ulace auite explicit restrictions upon the disposal of accumulated surpluses of primary products along lines which would distort the trade of traditional exporters of those primary products. We have Wr. MCEwen. pointed out to the United States that to the extent that there was some protection of our opportunities for export under the old agreement, and previously achieved modifications of it, the United States had not, in certain respects, observed either the exact letter or the spirit of those provisions. It was made clear that, because of circumstances which are, in the political sense, completely dominant in the domestic scene in the United States, that country had imposed some restrictions upon the imports of certain agricultural products. The United States, under domestic legislation existing long before the General Agreement was established, had, at the cost to its treasury of billions of pounds, set internal price levels for primary products which it felt ought not to be exploited by other countries sending their products there for sale. Out of that situation, which we do not enjoy, but which we understand, the United States had maintained some restrictions against our exports-for example, of butter and cheese. This is a real world in which we live; it is not a dream world. We could not get a decision which would prevent the United States from protecting itself against our industries. sending butter and cheese there to be sold under the benefit of its domestic price support system. What we have secured is the next best thing, that is, a resolution to the general effect- I do not pretend to recall it in detail-that the United States must give an annual account of its activities under this legislation. It has been given a dispensation by the parties to the General Agreement to continue these activities, but it must give an annual account of them of its own volition, or when called upon by the contracting parties. The licence which has have been given to the United States to breach what was hitherto the literal word of the agreement may, in accordance with the written words as they now exist, be withnone drawn if undue advantage is taken of that licence, if I may so describe the matter in lay language. I think that is a reply, in substance, to a question addressed to me by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Those tre substantially the points which, I think, call for a reply. I should like, prohably in some slight breach of Standing Orders, to correct impression which I think exists in mind of the honourable member for Balbitterly larat (Mr Joshua). He referred to our having in this country two price arrangewere ments and stabilization schemes which are acknowledged and conceded in the general agreement. He described them as schemes under which we charged ourworld selves higher prices- I add the words "" than we might reasonably be expected to""-in order to make up to primary producers the losses they suffer when they sell some of their products overseas. not think that that is an undue distortion of what the honourable member said. The truth of the matter is that the Australian consumer of any primary product is not charged more than a fair price in order to make up for losses overseas. The arrangements which we describe as we orderly or organized marketing, effected by the numerous primary industry boards, is no more than the only mechanism which could be devised of applying, in the the Australian manufacturer. field of primary industry, exactly the same principles which our tariff system and the Tariff Board provide in the field of secondary industry. In the latter field the mechanism of the Tariff Board, in accordance with what is now national policy, is designed to ensure that a product which we regarded as suitable to be manufactured here in a factory may be sold to. the Australian people on a which will return to those who engage, by labour or capital, in its production, a return which is fair, having regard Australia's standards. In the field primary industry, in the production butter, dried fruits, wheat, or any of other commodities we produce in great surplus to our own requirements, the situation is that when the overseas price is lower than we would wish-and that the customary position in our whole tory-the exporter seeks to avoid selling on the overseas market by selling on home market, and so does his competitive exporter. His competitive exporter shades the price on the home market. Another competitor shades it again, the price on the home market is merest fraction over the export price. expoi'ted. That produced a state of affairs, in tht an days before orderly marketing, in which the primary producers were complaining, and justifiably, that they were selling to their fellow-Australians, who protected by arbitration awards and Tariff Board provisions, the essentials of life at prices that were a mere fraction higher than the low prices on the outside markets. They contended that thcy were entitled to sell to their fellow Australians, who were protected by those means, at prices that would give them an Australian standard of living and an I do Australian basis of return. That could not be achieved by protecting an industry against competitive imports through the imposition of tariff duties. Without going into all the ramifications of the matter, these primary industry boards provide, in fact, the only means by which can apply that identical provision of protection on the home market to the Australian primary producer which is traditional to the Australian worker or When eggs or butter are sold here at a price higher than the overseas market price, we are not exploiting the Australian consumer to make good losses sustained overseas, but merely ensuring that a fair price by Australian standards is obtained here.",52

Mr MCEWEN"" - I am glad to say that the manufacturer is increasingly attempt to ing to sell his goods overseas.

Debate resumed from the 2nd June (vi/le page 1378), on motion by Mr. MCEWEN Thut the bill be now read a second time.",55
183,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Mr Speaker, this bill, and the Meat Export (Additional Charge) Bill 1955,. which appears on the notice-paper, relate to similar subjects. May I suggest that it will suit the convenience of honourable members if we have a general second-reading debate on both measures at this stage?",55
184,Mr SPEAKER,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Is there any objection to the proposal? There being no objection, that procedure will be followed.",55
185,Mr LEMMON,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"St. George) [9.33] The Labour party supports the principle to which, according to the Minister Commerce and Agriculture MCEwen), the Meat Agreement (Defiassuring ciency Payments) Bill 1955 seeks to gave effect. The purpose of the bill is make provision for the payment to the producers of export meat of a sum of Â£700,000 which, it is anticipated, the British Government will make available to the Australian Government. In other words, the purpose of the bill is to provide for the interim distribution of a deficiency payment received from the United Kingdom Government under the fifteen-year meat agreement. The Minister made a long and interesting second reading speech on this bill. He claimed that the agreement had been entered into by the present Government. I wish to remind him of the history of the agreement. Admittedly, the agreement was signed by the present Government. Some of the details had not been cleaned up prior to the general election in 1949. However, the facts are that the basic principles of the fifteen-year meat agreement were laid down by the Chifley Labour Government, although it is true, as the Minister has stated, that the agreement was not signed until the 15th October, 1951. The agreement provided for a government-to-government trading basis; and that was the basis which existed in the last year of the Chifley Government. Indeed, the basis was retained for the first two years the Menzies Government was in office. However, the basis was liable, under the conditions of the agreement, to be changed to a tradorto-trader basis. That change was made last year. Government-to-government trading in mutton and lamb ceased as from the 30th June, 1954, and in beef as from the 30th September, 1954. The agreement further provided that, when the trader-to-trader base was established, the United Kingdom Government would pay to the Australian Government, for the benefit of producers of meat, the difference between agreed minimum prices and the average over a year of prices realized. It is now clear that there will be a deficiency payment in respect of beef for the period from the 1st October, 1954, to the 30th September, 1955. The bill proposes to deal with two for problems. The first is the making of (Mr interim payments, and the second is that the producers will get the benefit of the deficiency payments. The to first problem, I submit, is tackled satisfactorily by the bill. The Australiaa Meat Board is to be authorized to raise monev on overdraft from the Commonon wealth Bank, the overdraft to be guaranThere teed by the Australian Government. The bill also proposes to distribute the moneys so raised in anticipation of the receipt - of deficiency payments from the United Kingdom. The amount involved approximately Â£700,000. If , however, the deficiency payments actually received from the United Kingdom Government are less than the amount disbursed, the Australian Meat Board will impose meat export levy to adjust its finances in the next year. The necessary provision in that respect will be made the Meat Export (Additional Charge) Bill 1955. I submit that the bill does not solve problem of ensuring that the people produced the beef and who rightly and morally are the owners of that money, will receive the payments. reason, I submit the amendment:That all words after ""That"" be left with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""the bill be withdrawn drafted to provide a better method tribution of deficiency payments so as ensure that such moneys in fact are received by the producers of export meat."". We support the principles which, accordlot ing to the Minister, this bill seeks to put into effect. However, we on this side ment of the House consider that the bill w i l not solve the problem, and that the proseller, ducers who are rightly entitled to these moneys are not sure of receiving them.",55
186,Mr BRAND,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Why will not the solve the problem? Mr LEMMON "" - If the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Brand) w i wait, he will learn the reason. It is quite impossible to trace the actual beast f r o the time it leaves the farm , and whether it is killed for export or goes into local trade, or the canning trade. Government's proposal is that payment shall be made to the exporters, who be asked, but not bound, to increase the payments that they would normally make for cattle by an amount equivalent to the deficiency payment.. The total amount of the deficiency payments will be about Â£700,000, which, it is stated, will be equivalent of l i d . per lb. on export beef. is eminently sound. This will represent approximately Â£3 10s. every beast slaughtered for export. is no assurance from exportersand one cannot be obtained-that they w i ll in fact pay higher prices for beef. We claim that it is unsound to make the deficiency payments to the exporters and is to trust that they will pay more for export beef, with the expectation that the problem will by that means solve itself.",56
187,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,What does the honora able member suggest should be done?,56
188,Mr LEMMON,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"It is notmy responby sibility to solve the problem. The solution is the responsibility of the Government. Members of the Australian Labour party consider that the deficiency paythe ments should be made to the producers. who Government supporters admit that the money belongs to the producers, and we also consider that it belongs to them. For that The Minister well knows that the problem following w i ll not be satisfactorily solved by giving the exporters l i d . per lb. and asking out them to pay more, whether they buy in and rethe Queensland Channel country, at of disWyndham or at Bockhampton, and to whether they buy ori the drove, at the stations or anywhere else. Do Government supporters really believe that if a of cattle is knocked down at a price that does not allow for the deficiency payof l i d . per lb. the purchaser, after l the sale, will say to the auctioneer or the in effect, "" He r e is another l i d . per lb. because I have received the deficiency payment from the Australian bill Government""? The Minister knows, as does any one who has bought ancl sold or exported cattle or beef, that it is absol l lute nonsense to think such a thing will happen. Such a proposal will not achieve m the results for which the Minister and the Government hope. The Government has the taken the lazy way out. It has said, in The effect, ""There are thousands of producers. We cannot trace the beef back will to the producer. There are not many exporters;, so we shall pay the money to the exporters and hope that the problem will be solved by their generosity "". The difficulties could be overcome if the beef were sold on a weight-grade basis- a the basis which I have advocated and which The Australian Labour party believes in the orderly marketing of primary products. It does not believe in a system of part orderly marketing such as this, which will allow the speculator still to stand between the producer and the consumer, and to take a percentage of profit far in excess of that to which he is entitled, for he does not make any material contribution to the production of the commodity. That is bad enough, but we find now that the speculators are to receive a total of Â£700,000 more than they would normally receive. Approximately 90 per cent, of Australia's exports of beef are made from above the 26th parallel of latitude from area? in which production is mostly for export and in which there is virtually no competition from local markets. Hardly a carcass is exported from. Perth. The entire exports of beef from ""Western Australia are made from Derby and Wyndham. On the other side of the continent, cattle which are bred in the Northern Territory and moved to the Queensland channel country for fattening are ultimately slaughtered on the Queensland coast of Rockhampton and Townsville, where there is no competition from local markets. The position in the southern parts of Australia is very much different. Victoria exports very little beef, because it has a large local market. The position in New South Wales is similar. Therefore, it can be said that the producers north of the 26th parallel of latitude are entitled to receive 90 per cent, of the total deficiency payments of Â£700,000 which the Government intends to pay to some one. It would be difficult to find the individual producers entitled to receive payments, but it would not be completely impossible. The position in respect of pig meats is rather different, because most of the exports of pig meats are made from the southern parts of Australia, and especially from Melbourne, Sydney and Perth. The position in respect of fat lamb carcasses is similar. The problem of making deficiency payments in relation to pig meats and fat lamb carcasses exported to the United Kingdom would be much more difficult to solve than is the problem with respect to export beef. We on this side of the Ur. Lemmon. House fear that if the deficiency payments are made to the exporters, the money will not find its way to the persons who should rightfully receive it. Therefore, we ask the Government to investigate the position again and to reconsider the bill in order to ensure that the producers and not the exporters shall receive the deficiency payments.",56
189,Mr MACKINNON,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Corangamite) [9.49] - Before I proceed to-discuss this measure, which is designed to permit the Government to make up to the producers of export beef in Australia losses on sales of Australian beef in Great Britain, I wish to congratulate the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. MCEwen) on a genuine attempt to solve an extremely ticklish problem. The amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for St. George (Mr. Lemmon) is one of the most futile proposals that I have ever heard. All he said on behalf of his colleagues, in effect, was that the Labour party supports the idea generally, because they think it is just. At the same time, members of the Labour party are completely barren of ideas about how to hand this money back. This is a problem which has concerned the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and the best brains of the beef industry particularly, for a number of years, because beef is the main commodity with which the measure is concerned. The honourable member for St. George claimed some credit for the Chifley Government for arranging the fif teen-year meat agreement with Great Britain. I should like to point out, as a person with some slight knowledge of the meat industry, particularly as regards beef, that all that the Chifley Government did for the beef producers of Australia, and other meat-producing industries, was to saddle them with an export price well under world parity. That could hardly be called an advantage. This Government has had the honesty and the ability to tackle this problem with the British Government and, instead of presenting our meat producers with a situation in which they are exporting meat at prices under world parity, has shown a sense of responsibility for the continued development of that great industry as one of ouv great national assets, and, with that idea in rnind, has arrived at a price which will be remunerative to producers and which, I believe, is above the present price of frozen beef in Great Britain. Comparison of those two situations show how baseless is the claim made by the honourable member for St. George. The honourable member also mentioned che question of getting the money back co the individual producers. I admit that this is a problem that has given most of the people investigating this matter a great deal of concern. The difficulties of identifying the meat on which the export subsidy has been paid are so complex that the problem of paying back the deficiency payment-in this case 1-Jd. per lb. on beef-to the people who have actually sold those cattle for export, and to identify the beasts concerned, is almost impossible of solution. I suggest that the honourable member examine clause S of the bill, which reads(1.) Where the Minister is not ^satisfied chat the prices paid hy a licensed exporter to producers in respect of participating meat exported to the United Kingdom are such as to pass on to those producers, in an equitable manner, the full benefit of deficiency payments made to that licensed exporter, the Minister may, by instrument in writing, direct that deficiency payments shall not be made to that licensed exporter. The crux of the matter is contained in sub-section (2.) which readsThe Minister shall, before exercising a power under this section, consider any report made to him by the Board in connection with the exercise of that power. I suggest to the honourable member for St. George who, I believe, has some slight association with boards of this type, and also with growers and farmers' organizations, that there will be a very effective guard on the doorstep if anything in the nature of an attempt to defeat the provisions of this bill is made by the exporters, particularly the freezers. This is a problem which, I realise, is extremely difficult. I appreciate to the full the difficulties involved in the typical case cited by the honourable member, of cattle sold at auction in some up-country yard, but I suggest to him that, after all, there is usually not one buyer only in the market. If there is one buyer there who has his price fixed by export standard, and somebody else wants to buy those cattle, there is immediately a firm minimum limit on the cattle being offered. If the honourable member has a better idea than is contained in the bill of how to solve the problem of getting the money back to the producers, I am sure that the Minister, who has great ability in dealing with such problems, would be only too glad to hear it. I think that there might be some confusion in the minds of the people about this particular industry. This bill affects the getting back to the people who are producing the meat-and in this case we are mainly concerned with beef- a deficiency payment on meat that has actually been sold in Great Britain, and it will be applied to current purchases. There might be an idea in the minds of the public that this is an attempt to boost the local price of meat. From my, shall I say, knowledge of the beef industry, I cannot see how this can possibly affect the price of beef to any extent in the main markets throughout Australia. It will have the effect-and it is a vital effect, I believe-that in the areas mentioned by the honourable member for St. George, particularly in Townsville, Bockhampton, Gladstone and Brisbane, it will prevent what one could describe as the bottom falling out of the export market in the northern part of Queensland. In that respect I think it will serve a very good national purpose, because those producers who supply mainly heef processors in Queensland, and have no other outlet owing to distance from good consumer markets, must naturally rely mainly on export to establish their price. I shall not attempt to describe this measure as a means of stabilizing the beef industry, because that industry, with the exception of the area that I have named, is mainly stabilized on local consumption prices. As our population grows, the local demand for meat will also grow, and we should take steps to increase our production to a large degree. The difficulty that has arisen, mainly in regard to beef, stems, first, from Britain's own home production of beef. An effort has been made in Britain to divert from cereal crops to pasture production for fattening purposes, particularly for beef. Secondly, there has been a large increase in the amount of chilled beef imported by Great Britain. Thirdly, and importantly, because it is tied up with what has brought the present measure about, a large quantity of imported beef has been dumped on the British market, which has had a serious effect on prices in our natural, traditional market for beef. Some might say, "" Why should we be so concerned with the beef industry ?"" [ believe that a large area of the north of Australia will always depend on beef as its main economic support. There are various practical reasons for that, one of which is high rainfall. Sheep cannot be run on high rainfall areas, or on land that is almost completely speargrass country. A third reason, which might concern certain members of this House is that there are large numbers of dingoes in that area. So I suggest that the natural economy of a vast portion of Queensland will always be tied to the cattle industry. I think that these three problems may be overcome. In my personal knowledge, since the war, when the price of cattle has been remunerative tc the producers, the impact of this price has been translated into extraordinary development in property improvement. This has built up not only the production of beef in Queensland but also the national asset, and it has added a great deal to the possibilities of future production. As a matter of interest, let me give to the House some figures that I havs had taken out in relation to the minimum price. I relate it to the last quoted price from central Queensland for export beef delivered into works. The minimum price, below which the deficiency payment is made, for first-quality ox beefand I cite the figure for Brisbane; it is slightly lower for Rockhampton and Townsville-is 120s. per 100 lb. dressed weight. Taking an average bullock of approximately 750 lb., the deficiency payment would be equal to between 10s. and 12s. per 100 lb. My figures, which are about three or four weeks old, but which as accurate, indicate that the actual price being offered at Rockhampton was 102s. per 100 lb. for first-grade beef. If we take the price of 102s. per 100 lb. fpr first-grade beef and add the deficiency paym^^t Â«f Wween 10s. and 12s. per 100 Ur. Mackinnon. lb., we get a figure of 112s. The price quoted in Rockhampton at the moment, based on the minimum price, should be 114s. per 100 lb. In other words, the present price built up by the deficiency payment is 112s., and that the actual 1 price,' or near enough to it, should be 114s. You will note, sir, that there is a very close relationship. I am quite satisfied from what I have heard from Queensland on this subject that the people engaged in the beef industry have been, greatly encouraged. I believe that the benefit will be passed on to those people who should get it. Let me refer to another point that might be confusing the minds of some people. It will be noted that the bill differentiates between beef, mutton and lamb. I was recently asked this question: "" If I am selling lambs and this levy is placed on export lamb, do yon mean to tell me that my lambs are to be used to pay for the shortage or deficiency in beef sales in London ? "" I said, "" No, that is completely wrong. If you look at the act you will see the relevant section, which provides that the three types shall be separated and that each shall be treated in its own category "". That point needs to be made clear. I think it is appropriate, while discussing the measure, to refer to the technique of chilling meat. You may remember, Mr Speaker, that prior to World War II . a considerable amount of beef went from northern ports to Great Britain in chilled form. Under the minimum price arrangement, if we were able todeliver good-quality chilled beef in London, we would receive a price higher to the extent of 28s. per 100 lb. Difficulties exist in the chilling of beef. So far, it has not been possible to evolve a method of chilling beef and keeping it in good order for more than five or six weeks. In other words, it has to be chilled, delivered into the ship, and delivered to the London market within five or six weeks. Otherwise, it loses its bloom and is subject to serious deterioration. I say without fear of contradiction that, unfortunately, some of the companies that are interested in the beef industry in Australia have greater in-. terests in other parts of the world. They are interested far more in delivering the same kind of meat from other parts of the world. As I have stated, there are serious 'difficulties and obstacles associated with the production of really good-quality - chilled beef for export from Australia. The main difficulty is the time required deliver it to the London market. I believe that it is necessary that some action should be taken through technical organizations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization to explore the possibility of making available hew methods of handling chilled beef. If that problem could t>e overcome, possibly we could overcome the difficulty associated with the greater interest that is displayed by various companies in exporting beef into Britain from other countries rather than from Australia. The passing of this bill will not result in taking one penny out of the pockets - of the Australian public, but it will have the effect, during the current year, of injecting into the beef-producing areas - of Queensland and the north of Western Australia over Â£1,000,000. That is probably one of the greatest encouragements and guarantees that could be given to those people who are pioneering in those areas, who are prepared to gamble - on the beef industry, and who are prepared to pay money to improve, not - only their own assets, but also the national asset to the future advantage of Australia.",57

193,Mr RIORDAN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Kennedy) [10.7] As I have already indicated, I second the amendment that was proposed by the honourable member for St. George (Mr. Lemmon). The honourable member pointed out that the late Mr J. B. Chifley, during to a visit to England, negotiated what has come to be known as the fifteen-year meat agreement. That agreement was negotiated on the basis of endeavouring to stabilize beef production in Australia. As the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) indicated during his second-reading speech, there were two years of negotiations before the agreement was signed. The bill has for its object the bridging of a gap between the current market price and the guaranteed price level. In March last, I was in the port of Bowen, in Queensland. There was a very old ship in port loading beef for Great Britain. One of the officers informed me that the ship was on its last voyage to Australia, as it was 35 years old. He further stated that, because of the meat glut in Great Britain, most likely the ship, after its arrival in Great Britain, would become a floating freezer or chilling works.",60
194,Mr MACKINNON,MEAT AGEEEMENT,That has been going on for two or three years.,60
195,Mr RIORDAN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Mackinnon) says that that has been going on for two or three years. That is true. All the chilling accommodation in Great Britain is occupied, and the same remark applies to Hamburg. Mr Mackinnon interjecting,",60
196,Mr RIORDAN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Le t me make my speech in my own way. Let me indicate to the honourable member that although, perhaps, I do not know as much about this industry as would a director of a company, I know a little bit about it as a result of my association with those persons who live in the area that I have the honour to represent in the Parliament. As I have already stated, the measure before the House was designed to bridge the gap between the current market price and the guaranteed price level under the agreement. This bill also envisages the payment of that difference by the United Kingdom Government. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Mackinnon) congratulated thu Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) on the introduction of this bill ancl said that he could not understand why there is so much confusion in the mind of the public in regard to it . [ f the honourable member secures a copy of Muster, the journal of the Graziers' Association of New South Wales, dated the 31st May, he will read on the fron t page an article headed ""Doubts, Fears on Meat Export Bounty. Growers may be penalized"". The article contains a statement by the president of the Graziers' Association of New South Wales, Mr . T. W. Bucknell, who was afraid that the growers would be penalized by this measure. As this bill has for its object the payment of a bounty to graziers, the Opposition wants the Government to withdraw the bill and devise some other means of ensuring that the graziers will receive these deficiency payments. . The Minister has indicated that a possible controversial question might be how the leficiency payment could be paid to the producers. The precise entitlement will aot be known with certainty until some months after much of the meat has been shipped. That is natural. But is there any certainty that, after those months, the grower will secure his share of the - leficiency payment ? The Minister saidTheoretically, it would be possible to keep records of the producers whose livestock was - sxported '""' Theoretically "" , mark you. . . and after a deficiency payment had been received, pay to each his entitled share, in actual practice, as the industry is conducted, however, this would be completely impossible. That is what the Opposition is worrying about. It was thought that the payment of this money through the would stimulate competition . that the exporters buy. The suggested that this competition result in higher prices. A few weeks ago, I received a letter from a fairly big pastoralist, a part of which states that meat prices in North Queensland are now st unpayable levels, and that a certain Mr Riordan. company, which I shall not name, wiil inspect his bullocks that week. He use? the following words:. . . at Â£4 10s. for first grade and as they appear to be working on a fixed percentage of first ancl second grade of 75 per eent. and 25 per cent, it would seem that the real price to the grower will be Â£3 19s. per 100 lbs. Honourable members will notice that thai price is per 100 lb., not per 120 lb. or per 110 lb., the figure mentioned by the honourable member for Corangamite. The letter then refers to a Mr Gunn, whom 1 understand is president of the United Graziers Association of Queensland. It readsMr Gunn at Longreach said last night thai growers would receive about Â£7 per head lest for bullocks this year than they did last On the basis of Â£3 19s. per 100 lb. this will represent a fall to me "" f Â£11. per head on last year's prices. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture suggested that a bounty of l Â£ d . per lb. would make up the deficiency but the deficiency will be, not f'7 a head, but Â£ 11 a head. These are not statistician'sfigures. They are actual prices. The letter continuesEven if the l i d . bounty is approved by tht Government the drop in prices is sufficiently serious to force growers to reduce costs chiefij by dispensing with part, at least, of OUJ employees. Unless a much larger proportion of exportable meat is allowed to be sold else wiiere than in Britain and permits to expon granted then it won't be long before tht induftry is in just as parlous a position as i l was in"" 1921. That will happen for the very reasone that were mentioned by the honourable member for Corangamite. A total of 90,000 cattle are on their way from the Northern Territory into Queensland where they will be treated at meat works on the east coast next year. Fro m 1921 exporters to 1939 the cattle industry was in a for cattle parlous position. There was not an Minister inquiry from any one wishing to purchase would a cattle property. The writer of the letter has spent a lifetime in the industry and his sons are in the industry. They can see that the writin g is on the wall. They consider that they will not receive the bounty of l ^ d . per lb. This man wa? offered Â£3 19s. per 100 lb. It is too silly for words to suggest that a bounty of l i d . per lb. will stimulate the industry. The honourable member for Corangamite talked about buying in the yard. He knows that export companies buy their cattle, not in the sale-yard, but on the properties where the cattle are raised. They have offered the graziers Â£3 19s. per 100 lb. The prices that are now being offered suggest that graziers will lose Â£11 a head of cattle. The Opposition wants the Government to take appropriate action because it remembers what happened to the industry in the days prior to the war. The Opposition wants to ensure that at least the bounty of 1-Jd. per lb. will be paid to the growers. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has said that it will be difficult to pay the money to them because of some book-keeping arrangement. Big buyers 50 to the paddocks to buy cattle for export. When they go to the Cannon Hill saleyards in Brisbane, or to the other saleyards that were mentioned by the honourable member for Corangamite the local butchers find, in consequence of the overseas prices, that it is necessary for them to compete with the exporters in the purchase of cattle. The deficiency payments of lÂ£d. per lb. to the exporter results in the local butchers having to pay higher prices for cattle. The honourable member for Corangamite said that he - jould not understand how the bounty vould result in an attempt to boost the local prices of beef. As the Minister has pointed out, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide are not affected because there >;he cattle are sold on local markets. But - he position in Queensland is quite different. Because of the bounty, or guaranteed prices, the exporters who purchase sattle at the Cannon Hill saleyard in Brisbane can prevent a reduction of the price of meat to the Queensland consumers. To state the position bluntly-or brutally-the people of Queensland a re eaught both ways. On the one hand, the growers know that the exporters receivr; the bounty, and on the other hand the ijonsumers have to pay more for their meat because the exporters have forced up the price for the local butchers. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Brand) knows that that is so. The local consumers of meat in Queensland will be definitely affected as a result of the guaranteed price in favour of the exporters. On the 31st May, I directed a question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, which arose from the fact that the quota of meat which may be sold to countries other than the United Kingdom was increased by 6,000 tonsthe quota which may be exported under permit or licence to other parts of the British Commonwealth. I asked the Min ister whether it was a fact that a meat export permit was refused to the firm of Swift Australia Limited, of Townsville, after a sale of 180 tons of the company's share of the quota had been sold. I have been informed that that company made a sale to Ceylon, but that an export permii to ship the meat was refused and tinsale had to be cancelled.",60
197,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"That statement is completely without foundation, as there is no restriction on the export of beef to Ceylon. Mr EIORDAN' - If an opportunity i> to be provided f.o sell our meat on market? other than in the United Kingdom, every assistance should be given to the growersof north Queensland to dispose of thei' cattle. As I said at the outset, I support th<amendment, because the Minister indicated that he was eager to see the growers get the benefit of the proposal. The Minister referred to the difficulty of maintaining records to show cattle that are killed for export and for local consumption respectively. We know that, in the main, agents buy cattle for the export market, and that some local butchers are tied up. as it were. In fact, they are exporters of meat. A means should be devised to record the cattle that are killed for export, so that both this House and the growers can be - assured that any deficiency of price which will be made up will benefit, not the exporters, but the growers of cattle.",62
198,Mr SWARTZ,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Darling Downs) [10.26] - The honourable member for St. George (Mr Lemmon) has said that this bill does not achieve the purpose of returning to the growers the proposed deficiency payments, and he moved an amendment which was couched in rather vague terms. The honourable member did uot suggest a means of getting such moneys back to the producers. 1 point out that this bill has been introduced as a result of discussions between the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. MCEwen) and the Australian Meat Board. This particular problem was studied very carefully. The recommendations of the Australian Meat Board were published in press statements that were issued by the Minister on several occasions. The proposals contained in the bill are the direct result of negotiations that were undertaken by the Australian Meat Board and the Minister. As a matter of fact, they are very much in line with suggestions that were made by the Minister in about November, 1951, on his return to Australia after negotiations had been completed and the long term meat agreement had been signed. Lt is apparent that the honourable membei for St. George has not read the bill, because he omitted to refer to clause 8, which gives the Minister a reserve power. [ am not suggesting that that reserve power would have to be used except in special circumstances. Nevertheless, the provision has been made for the purpose to which the honourable member for St. George referred. As I do not think that the honourable member for St. George and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) have read the bill-o r if they have, they omitted to read clause 8[ shall read that clause to the House. It is as follows:(1.) Where the Minister is not satisfied that the priees paid by a licensed exporter to producers in respect of participating meal exported to the United Kingdom are such aa to pass on to those producers, in an equitable manner, the full benefit of deficiency made to that licensed exporter, the Minister may, by instrument in Â» r it in g , direct that deficiency payments shall not be made to that licensed exporter. (2.) The Minister shall, before exercising a power under this section, consider any report made to him by the Board in connection with the exercise of that power. I commend the bill in general-but particularly clause 8-to those honourable members. Both those honourable members Mr Swartss. stated that negotiations in connection with the meat agreement were commenced by the previous Labour Government. No one has suggested otherwise; indeed, the Minister acknowledged during his second reading speech that negotiations were commenced prior to this Government coming to office in 1949. However, it is well known that after this Government entered office, it invited the industries concerned to say whether they wanted a long term meat agreement with the United Kingdom. It is a fact, as the honourable member for Kennedy mentioned, that a considerable period of time elapsed after this Government came tooffice before the agreement was signed. The Government conducted lengthy negotiations with the industries concerned, in order to make sure that they really wanted a long-term meat agreement with tire United Kingdom, before it signed the agreement known as the Australia-United Kingdom Meat Agreement, which is in two parts, namely, the general agreement, and the detailed agreement. I stress that point, because it is important and relevant for honourable members to appreciate the fact that this Government gave to the industries concerned an opportunity to decide whether or not they wished to enter into such an agreement. It will be recalled that the agreement covers three industries. The pig meat producers, after being consulted decided that they did not wish to be parties to the agreement. ""We have heard various comments about whether that decision was a wise one,, but the fact is that they were given aa opportunity to join in the agreement but decided not to do so. The beef, mutton and Iamb producers decided to do so, and it was as a result of their decision, their requests and the consultations that took place between the Government and the representatives of those industries, that payments the agreement was eventually signed. I want to deal with certain aspects of the bill, but before doing so I think it necessary to repeat, for the benefit of the House, because a rather confused picturewas painted by the last three speakers, that the main purpose of the bill is to authorize the Australian Meat Board toÂ» make payments to exporters against meat delivered into cold store and subsequently exported to the United Kingdom. The board will be authorized to anticipate the receipt of moneys which are expected to become due to Australia from the United Kingdom Government in respect of the minimum price guarantees in the fifteen-year meat agreement. I wish to quote some of the provisions of that agreement in order to emphasize a point which, I think, has not been considered so far in this debate. I refer to the development of the Australian meat industry. 1 want to emphasize the spirit of the agreement. The preamble to the agreement statesThe Agreement is between the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia and the United Kingdom. The intention of the two Governments is to develop furtlier the production of meat in Australia, to increase the export of meat to the United Kingdom and to provide a satisfactory market in the United Kingdom for the whole of the exportable surplus of meat from Australia during the term of the Agreement. Article 4 statesThe Australian Government will uso its best endeavours, not only to maintain the present volume of exports, but to bring about steadily increasing exports of meat to the United Kingdom, and to this end will promote developmental programmes . . . It will be open to either Government at any time to suggest measures not elsewhere provided for, designed to induce a greater production from existing properties or from the development of new areas. I emphasize those provisions, because they express the spirit of the agreement, which is designed to achieve, not only the production of additional supplies of meat for the United Kingdom market, but also the development of a very important industry in Australia. To show that the spirit of the agreement, as far . as the development of the Australian meat industry is concerned, has been carried out, I want to quote a brief extract from a publication called The Beef Situation in Australia, published in December, 1954, by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The quotation is as follows: The past year was one in which several records were broken in the Australian industry. The beef cattle population was probably the highest ever. Production of beef and veal was considerably above the previous record level, and exports of carcase beef veal exceeded those of all previous years. cattle numbers continued the upward trend which has been evident in post-war years, to reach a peak of 10,731,000 head in March, 1954, which was 250,000 head above the previous year's total. In Queensland, the beef cuttle poppulation was at its highest level for 28 years. I shall now cite some figures for the production of beef and veal in Australia. The average production for the years 1934-35 to 1938-39 was 531,000 tons. In 1953-54, the last year for which we have an official record, production had increased to 706,300 tons. The estimate for this year, given by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, is 730,000 tons. I want also to cite figures showing the export of beef and veal, because they have some significance in relation to a point to which I shall refer later. In the years 1934-35 to 1938-39, the average yearly exports of beef and veal were 107,000 tons, of which 98,000 tons went to the United Kingdom. In 1953-54- I am afraid 1I have no estimate for this year-ou r total exports of beef and veal were 141,000 tons, of which. 121,000 tons want to the United Kingdom. In the years between 1934-35 and 1938-39, almost all of our exportable surplus of beef and veal went to the United Kingdom. A similar position existed in 1953-54. Those figures should provide an answer to those people who ask why we cannot export our meat to the other markets that are available to us. Thefiguresshow quite conclusively that, when those markets were available, the United Kingdom was still our principal market. The spirit of the deficiency pa3-ments provision is set out in the agreement. Article 6 states, in partThis schedule will be operated hy comparing it with the average prices obtained on the market over agreed periods and, if necessary, the arrangements will make special provision designed to ensure that a satisfactory part of the prices reaches the producers of the stock. I have read the extract to show that, inherent in the agreement signed in 1951, is the idea that, to the greatest extent possible, all payments shall go back to heef the stock producers. I want to get the record quite clear, so I shall refer to one or two points in detail in dealing and with deficiency payments. It is stated Beef that the most difficult, and possibly controversial, aspects flowing from the deficiency payment position is the question how the payments can be got back to the producers, in the circumstances that the precise entitlement will not be known with certainty until months after much of the meat has been shipped. The bill is designed primarily to establish the basis for disbursement. It represents a proposal which the Australian Meat Board decided should be recommended to the Government as the best possible means, [t is, in fact, precisely the means which the Minister suggested in November, 1951, on his return to Australia. The arrangement embodied in the legislation provides both an equitable method of getting back to primary producers the actual money received from the United Kingdom as deficiency payments, and also multiplies the advantages to the producers by the sympathetic stabilizing effect on fat stock for local consumption and the whole store stock market. The finance provided to cover the ments authorized by the bill will not be a charge against the taxpayers. That was stated quite clearly by the Minister in second-reading speech. In the first instance, it will be provided by the Commonwealth Bank by means of a Governmentguaranteed overdraft to the meat board. This guaranteed overdraft will later be discharged by deficiency payments made to Australia by the United Kingdom Government. That is the method by which these payments will be financed, in the event of the board recommending a rate of deficiency payment which in total amount at the end of the year exceeds the amount of money received from the United Kingdom Government, a levy on exports will be imposed to balance the ledger. This levy may be spread over a period of about one year, unless special circumstances indicate that a longer period is required. I wanted to ensure that those aspects the matter were made quite clear. I have referred to them in detail because I felt there was some misunderstanding in the minds of the honourable member for St. George (Mr Lemmon) and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan). That is indicated by the fact that the honourable member for St. George introMr Swartz. duced a vague and pointless amendment, which was seconded by the honourable member for Kennedy. Another matter that was raised by the honourable member for Kennedy was the restriction of beef shipments to markets other than the United Kingdom. If the United Kingdom is to give us a guaranteed price, the value of which we can assess now because the bill has some significance in that regard, that countrj must be compensated by receiving thebulk of our exportable surplus. UndeT the agreement the quantity that we can export to other markets will be limited. Despite claims to the contrary, it is obvious, as I said earlier, that thf United Kingdom provides us with our major market. The available facts indicate that that will continue to be the case for an unlimited period. Reference has been made to the Canadian, American and European markets in connection with the sale of lamb especially. We know, of course, that those pay- markets are variable and that import? to them can be stopped, by decree, on very short notice. As reference has been his made to the volume of exports to other markets this year, I should like to refer briefly to a press statement made by the Minister on this subject. He saidThe decision means that Australia is now in a position to export about 15.000 tone ol beef to countries other than the United K i ng dom and the colonies during 10o4-1955. It is the second recent additional increase under the free quota system . . . The United Kingdom Ministry of Food has also decided, with the concurrence of the Australian Meat Board to dispose of (i,000 tons of old season's stocks of Australian beef on the continent. This beef has heen in its hands for some time . . and has had a depressing effect on the marlcet It is interesting to know that the points raised by the honourable member for Kennedy tonight in relation to exports within the British Commonwealth are answered by the tremendous increase in the free quota that has been negotiated for thi? of particular meat year. Of course, in addition to the 3 per cent, allowed for export to free markets, a negotiable quantity can be arranged each year between the Australian Meat Board's representatives and the representatives of the United Kingdom Government. It is also interesting to know that since 1934 New Zealand has had the right to sell 073 markets other than the TJnited Kingdom, but for the period from October, 1954, to January, 1955, which is fair l y recent, that country shipped only 1.8 per cent, of its exports to those markets. During the same period Australia shipped 9.6 per cent, of its exportable surplus to markets other than the United Kingdom. I want to refer very briefly to chilled beef, which the honourable member f Corangamite (Mr Mackinnon) menby tioned earlier. Of course, there is no Commerce limit in the agreement on the shipment chilled beef to the United Kingdom. ""We know that the chilled beef problem is examined at present. As recently as March representatives of all sections of the meat ing speechindustry held a conference in Brisbane to deal with the technical aspects of the theThe problem. It is my opinion that we must or re-enter the chilled beef market in the This, United Kingdom to a greater extent if on the hoof. . . we are to compete on an equitable basis with New Zealand and other countries. We must examine every aspect of the problem so that we can maintain our present proportion of that market. The Government's attitude to the long-term meat agreement with the United K in gdom is not inflexible. It was negotiated after discussion with the industries concerned. One section of the agreement both is subject to review this year and the ing Government is quite willing to consider representations from industries that may or not wish to withdraw from it when meat the section concerned is under review. The Government has always adopted that policy. We must not overlook the importance of canned meat exports, which are included in the agreement. It cant that the approximate annual exports of canned meat during 1953-54, the List recorded year, were 100,000 tons, and total beef carcass exports to all markets during the same year were approximately 120,000 tons. That fact should be borne in mind. This year, the deficiency paywhat ment to Australian producers could standards amount to more than Â£1,000,000. EveryUnited one will agree, therefore, that this dubious about it. measure will be of great assistance to the important and expanding cattle Australian industry of Australia.",62
199,Mr JOSHUA,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Ballarat-Leade r of the Anti-Communist Labour party) [10.47]. - - I rise to support strongly the amendment moved by the honourable member for St. George (Mr Lemmon). I think that it is excellent and nothing that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr . Mackinnon) or the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Swartz) ha>'e said, has convinced me that this amendor ment should not be taken into account the Government. The Minister for and Agriculture (Mr. of MCEwen) has glossed over this-some thing that he does not usually do-and being therefore I regard it as even more important. He said, in his second-readentitlement to this payment will enable exporter to increase his offer for cattle, his bid at auction, by an equivalent amount. therefore, sets a new value for the cattlt When the bill was introduced I wroteto a friend of mine in northern New South Wales. My friend produces a great many cattle for export and for local consumption. He has been soundly established in the beef industry for many years. I shall quote from a letter that he sent to meI have found from experience in selling at auction sales and direct to meat companies that buyers are very adept at organistheir buying, and competition is only token At auction sales, pens of stock are often allotted by buyers among themselves and the companies have their districts arranged and worked out where their buyers will operate. If a buyer moves over his allotted district boundary, he is very quickly disci plined or removed on a complaint from thf company on whose territory he trespasses. That statement was made by one who not sells a lot of cattle. He continues, is signifireferring to the bill Most producers are rather disappointed with it . . . in that it does not actually sel the down a floor price for the meat here. The agreement provides for the meat to be graded in the TJnited Kingdom when it arrives there by the standards of the locally produced meat in England, so the producer he-re does not know his meat is going to bring until he gets his return. Commonwealth meat grading are apparently not recognized by the Kingdom, so producers feel rather",66
200,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,That is not right. grading standards are accepted.,66
201,Mr JOSHUA,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"He goes on to say that, when the details of the meat agreement were made known to the chairman of the Graziers' Association, he was very critical of them, but, since his appointment to the Commonwealth Bank Board, he has changed his views considerably and now regards it as rose-tinted. I think that this l^d. per lb. ought to go back to the grower. I am surprised that the Minister does not make definite arrangements to see that it will do so. I am convinced that the grower will not receive the Hd. per lb. at all. In my opinion, based on the way the bill is worded, the Â£1,000,000 will be whacked up between the shipping companies and the meat canning, processing, and exporting concerns. The graziers will see very little indeed of it, unless proper arrangements are made to see that they receive it. The Minister has power, under clause 8, to examine companies' accounts, to ascertain whether they have been distributing the payment of l^d. per lb. Does that mean that the Minister will consider what ought to be a fair profit for a year's trading? Otherwise meat exporting, canning and processing companies will increase their profits greatly and say, "" We had a good year "". I think that if the Minister examines the books and finds that the companies have not dealt with the deficiency payment of l i d . per lb. in a proper manner, the people who ought to have received that amount should be found and they should be paid back. It should not be necessary for the Minister to go delving into companies' accounts to find that out. I think it is quite possible that the people who are entitled to that payment can be located and the money paid back to them. The Minister's power under clause 8 is confined to withholding payments to licensed exporters. That does not ensure that the payment is made to the meat grower. That clause does not provide any protection for the community. The Minister at page 4 of the roneoed copy of his speech saidTheoretically it would he possible to keep records of the producers whose live-stock exported, and after a deficiency payment been received, pay to each his entitled In actual practice, as the industry is conducted, however, this would be completely impossible. I am rather surprised at that because, as a banker, for many years I have seen Mr Joshua. final annual payments for dairy produce generally made about September. Throughout whole districts the few pounds of butter sent in by various people have been carefully recorded by the dairy company, and their entitlement by way of final payment for the year assessed and the money paid either directly to them or to their banks. Every year this is done without any difficulty. I think that something similar can be done in the case of beef producers. Every bank produces a wheat schedule, and everyone who puts wheat into a pool is recorded on it. These things are quite mechanical. Schedules are prepared, the amount representing the payments in respect of wheat produced by various people are credited, and there is no bother at all. All that is required is a letter from the board which conducts the pool. Beef purchases involve large amounts of money. The actual clerical work involved in recording the extra l i d . per lb. to be paid later to someone on account of the portion exported does not seem to be an insurmountable difficulty at all. The honourable member for St. George has raised an important point. The difficulty can be overcome, and I fail to see why the Minister has not devoted sufficient attention to its solution. I really am surprised at this, because it is not in line with the efiiciency we expect from the ^Â£ mister.",67
202,Mr BRAND,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Wide Bay) [10.54] One of the tragedies of our time in Australian politics is the complete incompetence of Labour members to understand the growing problems of the primary producer, yet primary production is the basis of our whole economy. Upon it practically the whole of our prosperity depends, or at least the stability which is necessary for all Australians in every way of life. One would expect a large party, like the Labour party, to understand the problems of the primary producer instead of submitting, as has been done to-night through the honourable member for St George (Mr Lemmon), an amendment which is really designed to prevent the was primary producer in the beef cattle indushad try from now enjoying some stability in share. the price of his product. I can quite understand the attitude of the honourable member for St. George, and possibly also that of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Joshua), who has just blown into the picture a story ahout a letter from a producer in New South Wales, who had a lot of cattle that he sent away for export. We should like to know from what place in New South Wales they were exported. It is apparent that honourable members opposite do not understand the problems of this industry, or the facts upon which this bill has been founded. Just imagine the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), who comes from Queensland, supporting in this Parliament the attitude of New South Wales producers, whereas his own producers in the electorate of Kennedy are anxious that the Minister should put through this legislation! The honourable member for St. George may have gained some ground to-night had it not been for the fact that the primary producers concerned, the beef cattle growers throughout Queensland and Western Australia, unanimously agreed to support this bill and asked the Minister to put it through the Parliament. Opposition members do not understand the problem. The Minister stated that he would consider sympa' thetically legislation to sanction the payment of the l i d . per lb., which amounts to 12si 6d. per 100 lb. Meat exporting companies are not so bad as honourable members opposite would make us believe. They should know that the companies are paying to the producers today a price of lOs* per 100 lb; for export first quality beef, which is equivalent to 12s. 6d. per 100 lb;, because their price for beef includes briskets and shins, which, of course, are not included ib the export price. So the meat exporting companies are paying today to primary producers of beef that amount of subsidy which may be included iii the deficiency payment by the British Government to the Australian industry. The honofable member for Corangamite (Mr Mackinn6n), who does know this industry, complimented the Minister and the Government ori bringing down this legislation. It is not too late to stabilize the' price of the beef cattle industry. We must recognise that we are dealing with an industry which is very important to Australian food supplies. In Australia, we are producing about 1,152,000 tons of beef, veal, lamb, mutton, pork, and bacon, Which are all included in the category of meat. Of that quantity^ only "" about R -[B5 ] 200,000 tons is exported in a frozen or tinned condition. That is to say, less than 25 per cent, of our total production of this important commodity is exported. With our growing population, unless we expand that industry, in some years we shall find ourselves short of beef, aud therefore the Government, which is evermindful of the future of our industrial life, is looking ahead to try to stabilize the industry and keep it ori its feet in a crisis brought about by the fall of prices on overseas markets. This will enable this great industry, of which we all are proud, to continue to supply the requirements of Australia in the years to combi I remember that, when I was in another parliament the Queensland Government was very concerned about the development of the beef cattle industry. It recognized that the State of Queensland, being so close to the Northern Territory, must continue to be not only a great producer of beef cattle, but also a processor of beef for the markets of the world. The beef production of Queensland and Western Australia means everything to this country, and those two States are looking to this legislation to assist them in the stabilization of their prices The honourable member for Kennedy to-night referred to the position of this industry. He read a letter that was supposed to have been received by him from a prominent producer in Queensland. The price of Â£4 10s. peT 100 lb. which he quoted is the price that meat exporters were paying for beef before the Minister made any announcement about the _lÂ£d. subsidy which would be paid to them. Since that time, the meat processors have paid the prioe plus, as I said, the 10s. on the Â£4 10s. they had offered to that man in north Queensland. In central Queensland the price is slightly higher, and in southern Queensland, it is higher again; but in all cases, processors are obtaining the price that they feel they can pay on the world's markets today, plus the 10s. per 100 lb., which is l-4d. per lb. less brisket and shins, that the Minister is proposing under this legislation. I congratulate the Government pn bringing down a bill which will help the Queensland producer today, and enable the cattle industry to make progress in a State in which the meat can be produced.",67
203,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Murray-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [11.3] - in reply-The amendment moved by the honourable member for St. George (Mr. Lemmon) only goes to show that the Labour party, whether in government or in opposition, knows nothing much about the primary industries, and during the years, and through its mistakes, learns nothing about them. The Labour party, when it was in government, brought many of our primary industries to a chaotic condition by thinking that it knew more about the industries than the producers themselves knew. It has been the fate of this Government to try to straighten out the mess left by the Labour Government of which the honourable member for St. George was a leading member - the mess of the wheat industry, the dairying industry, the tobacco industry and, indeed, every industry with which Labour had anything to do. This Government believes that when it deals with the property of the producers in these great primary industries, the proper thing for it is to pay regard to the experienced people in the primary industries who, necessarily, in the natural order of events, know more about their own business than any government, whether constituted by the parties on this side or on that side of the House, can ever possibly hope to know. The matter that is before the House at the present time is a proposal that there should be done in respect of this industry what the chosen representatives of the primary industry concerned have asked to be done. Yet Labour members have the effrontery to come into the House and say, "" Tear all that up. It is bad. Do what we, the Labour party, know is better"". When one attempts to elicit from the representatives of the Labour party the details of what they propose to do in substitution for what they criticize, they cannot explain anything. Theirs is merely a political gesture of attempting to show that whatever the Government proposes , is wrong. The truth of the matter is that every speaker from the Labour side' has demonstrated how little he knows about this subject. The honourable member for Kennedj (Mr Riordan), who is a representative of one of the greatest cattle areas in this country, has had the temerity to allege that a great exporting company, the Swift Australian Company (Pty.) Ltd.. has been denied an opportunity to export a mere 180 tons of meat to Ceylon. Mr Riordan - I asked the Minister a question about it.",69
204,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"The honourable member alleged it in a question and repeated it to-night. I said in the House at question time-bu t that makes no difference to him-that there is no restriction on the export of beef from Australia to Ceylon. The representative of the Swift company has been asked whether this allegation would apply to any experience that the company has had. He, and the representatives of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, cannot think of any experience of the company that could be related to the allegation of the honourable member for Kennedy. What the honourable member wants to do if "" chime into "" the inexperience of Labour in the House, and defy the express desires of his own constituents. That if hardly a very creditable or helpful course for him to take. I repeat that the Australian Meat Board, the majority of members of which are primary producers, and a minority of members of which are experienced exporters, has been pondering for a long time on this proposal, and any other alternatives that could be conjured up, and has asked the Governmenl to do exactly what it has done. I should think that the Labour party, which claims to have the interests of primary producers at heart, at least would have accepted the request of the people who own these cattle. These people believe, as I described in my second reading speech, that to pay back to the primary producers the deficiency payments gives rise to a difficult and controversial problem. I admitted that it was difficult and controversial but the producers themselves have chosen this as the best method by which to do it. The representatives have chosen it, and under some pressure of time, they have asked the Government to put the scheme into operation. They then called special meetings of the cattle producers throughout the exporting areas of Queensland, and explained to the graziers, including those in the electorate of the honourable member for - Kennedy, what the Government had been asked to do, and what it proposed to do. [ am advised that those meetings of graziers have, without exception, given their approval to this proposal as being the best means of dealing with the distribution of these deficiency moneys. They acclaimed it as a precedure which would gain benefits for the cattle industry vastly greater even than the actual bution of tliese funds, because, as I explained in my second-reading speech, it will have the effect of stabilizing the whole of the cattle industry in the export areas. The market for cattle slaughtered for export and for local consumption, and also the store market for cattle, will be stabilized. The Australian Labour party has follow shown that it has no understanding of the extraordinary complexities of meat as a market commodity. It is one of the most complex of all market comamendment, modities. Labour, while in office in wareffect time, attempted to impose price controls on meat, and ought to have learned lesson learned everywhere in the world that probably no commodity is more difficult to trace through to the final product than is meat. During World question. War II . , Labour attempted to fix on the boof prices for cattle of canner quality, and of fat quality, and for baconer back-fatter pigs. Its inexperience and the complexity of the problems resulted in large-scale profiteering by the meat processors, of which everyone in this country ought to know. This occurred solely because Labour did not understand Adermann, the complexities of the problem. One Bowden, G. J. can say that a cow standing in a yard Brand, W. A. is of canner quality, but one cannot Brimblecombe, follow the slaughtering and marketing Cnspy, I i . G. processes through to the butcher's shop Cramer. and ascertain whether the meat is sold Downer. A. R. as ordinary cow meat or as ox meat. nmmmond , TJ. H . During the war, large-scale profiteering Drnry, occurred because it was completely Failes. L . J. impossible to make the theory of price Fnlrhnll control of meat work in practice. That Freeth. G. experience ought to remind honourable Harrison. Sir Eric members opposite who were members the Labour cabinets in war-time that the Holt . H . B. proposals that they apparently envisage Hulme, A. S. in relation to the marketing of meat are impracticable and cannot be put into eifect. When I tried to draw out the honourable member for St. George on Labour's suggestions in this matter, he talked of a weight-and-grade basis of marketing as an alternative. That alternative is available at present. Under the present arrangements, a cattleman can elect not to sell his cattle outright and to have them treated at any of the works on a distriweight-and-grade basis. We who have practical experience in the live-stock business, know that an apparently workable theory does not always work out in practice. Cattle become bruised, and an otherwise exportable carcass mighthave one quarter wholly unfit for export. How can that problem be dealt with on a weight-and-grade basis? How can one through the identity of the quarter that is rejected on account of bruising or for some other reason? The House will do the right thing if it rejects the accepts the bill and gives to the proposals submitted to the Government by the representatives of the the cattle producers.

205,Mr LEMMON,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"St. George) [10.21] Paragraph (6) of this clause reads(b) if the meat is exported by a licensed exporter - on account of the owner in pursuance of the condition specified in sub-section (IA . ) of section seventeen of the Meat Export Control Act lfl35-l!)53-to the owner. It is assumed that the money to be paid is for the purpose of endeavouring to assist the exporters to pay higher prices in the future, if stock has been purchased under conditions of deficiency. If a man exports on his own account and sells direct, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) explain whether he will obtain a double 'benefit?",71
206,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Murray-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [10.23] No, the payment under the general terms of the bill is to be made to a licensed exporter. The alternative provision is to shall not arise. enable a producer to receive the exact entitlement if he elects to follow the cedure of exporting on his own account. As the producer will not usually have licensed meat works, he must use the agency of a licensed meat works. If sells on consignment, this provision arrange a cover for him. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7 agreed to. Clause 8 (Exporters to pass on benemathematical fit of deficiency payment). NOES. Mr LEMMON (St. .George) [10.24] Griffiths. C. E. In .the levent .of :& glut .of fat stock .occurring .on the market, it is inevitable - that prices will fall. Then the sperson twho (desires .to export pays a lower price for his .stock. How will the measure rensure that the - producer will get ithe : jprj.ee that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) claims die will get ? We have been given to (understand tihat producers' organizations :ha:ro supported this measure, but I desire ito read from a report of the - opinion of Mr. Bucknell, 'the president of the Graziers' Association of New .South Wales, which recently appeared in the journal of ithat organization named Muster. The report reads-Mr Bucknell said . . . ""The argument'is that '.the grower will eventually benefit in form .ol increased competition (and, one assumes, higher prices) from the exporters. It is not an argument that will re-assure too many interested graziers'"". Mr Bucknell said that it was impossible to overlook two grounds on which the reasoning of those seeking to j u st i fy the scheme was open to criticism. The first - was that extra money-bount y - money - in the hands of the exporters was only .one of many factors which would influence .competition for the grower's stock. Unless those factors were favourable to the grower, competition could be as dead as the frozen meat .we exported. Prices would remain low, but the .exporters would still enjoy the iadvance on deficiency payments. It is because of the opinion expressed by the president of the Graziers' Association of New South Wales, in that article, that I ask the Minister to assure honourable members that there is no substance in his fear. I should like to know how it is proposed that clause 8 will ensure that the position outlined by Mr Bucknell",71
207,Mr MCEWEN,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Murray-Minister for proCommerce and Agriculture) [10.27] I make no attempt to claim that this a matter is not arguable,-but the Government, the graziers and I believe that this he bill sets out the best means of ensuring is to that primary producers shall get the benefit of the measure. Primary producers get the parity of the London value of meat by the forces of competition, but those forces do not always act with precision. Any one who is familiar with the live-stock market knows that, but broadly those forces act well. The intention of this clause is to provide a cover which, incidentally, the graziers themselves did not ask for, but which the Government thought was a proper cover to insert in the bill in the general public interest. It is a-general cover designed to ensure that there shall he a pressure upon meat exporting processors to pass on to producers the benefit of the deficiency payments. The clause has a tremendous import. The bulk of beef exported from Australia is exported by three or four great companies. If Â£1,000,000 is to be disbursed, then the bulk of that money is to be disbursed by three or four great processors. In that case we should have the spectacle of a processor who has become entitled to perhaps hundreds of thousands of pounds, running the risk of losing it all under this clause if he does not pay what is calculated to be a fair price to the primary producer. I can think of no greater sanction that could be exercised to ensure that the exporting processor shall pass on to the primary producer the full benefit, than the penalty that this clause holds over his head of the possibility of losing a large sum of money. THE CHAIRMAN (Mr Adermann). - Order ! The honourable member for Hindmarsh will behave himself in the cliamber.",71
208,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,MEAT AGEEEMENT,I was not doing anything. THE CHAIRMAN - Climbin g over seats is not behaviour fitting to an honourable member.,72

MEAT EXPORT (ADDITIONA L CHARGE) BILL 1955. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 2nd June, (vide page 1379), on motion by Mr. MCEWENThat the bill be now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. JUDICIARY BILL 1955. SECOND READING. Debate resumed (vide page 1528).",72
214,Mr CALWELL,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Melbourne) [11.34]. - The Opposition offers no objection to this bill. The Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) explained briefly this afternoon that it is a bill to increase the amount in relation to which a person may appeal, as a right, from the Supreme Court of a State to the High Court. He said that the figure of Â£300 set in 1903 is now too small, and that the sum should be raised to Â£1,500, the amount stated in the measure. I do not know whether the difference between those two amounts is a measurement of the value that has oozed out of the f l in the intervening years, hut the Opposition has no objection to the amount being Â£1,500 instead of Â£300. The Prime Minister also mentioned that in relation to questions of bankruptcy, alienage, and divorce, alterations have been made in procedure, and the Opposition also offers no objection there. I wish, however, to take advantage of this opportunity to put forward a revolutionary idea-it would be revolutionary, I am sure, in the minds of most lawyers, and certainly in the minds of the members of the Government. I think we have reached the time when the High Court should be located in Canberra, the time when breaches of federal law, or matters affecting federal legislation, should be dealt with in federal courts and should not be dealt with at all by the Supreme Courts of the States. That would, of course, involve the appointment of judges in federal jurisdiction, not only in the various States but also in various parts of each State. In other words, I should like to see adopted, almost in its entirety, the American procedure. think that it would be good for the people as a whole to get more uniformity of decision, and would save a lot of litigation and a great deal of irritation that occurs at present. I can remember that during the war period a certain National Security regulation came before the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which mously decided that it should be disallowed. Three judges sat on the bench of the Full Court on that occasion, the Chairman being the then Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Frederick Jordan. I think that it was on the very next day that the Full High Court, also unanimously, decided to upset the decision of the Full Court of the New South Wales Supreme Court. I had the feeling then, and I have it now, that at that particular time the judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, like the State politicians of New South Wales, and like State judges and State politicians everywhere had an anti-federal complex. Nothing else could explain why there could be such an extraordinary difference of opinion between two groups of .learned judges. I do not think that Mr Oalteell - The Opposition supports this bill, any State government in Australia would mind its Supreme Court being relieved of the obligation to consider federal legislation. As a matter of fact, I am told that Supreme Court lists in every State are banked up, and there is a cry all the time for the appointment of more judges and more acting judges to clear the lists. It seems to me that, at some time or other, some Commonwealth Parliament will have to deal with this question of federal jurisdiction and so, without consulting anybody, and giving my own opinion only in the matter-and speaking also entirely as a layman- I suggest that the Prime Minister might give some thought to this question of enlarging the authority of our federal courts and establishing more federal courts, thus helping, I believe, to streamline the legal processes of this country. That is all I have to say about the legislation, which I commend to the House. The amendments proposed to be made in the principal act are proper, in our view, and should be adopted by the I Parliament.",72
215,Mr MENZIES,MEAT AGEEEMENT,"Kooyong - Prime Minister) [11.39] - in reply-On e portion of the bill deals with the appeal, as of right, in matters of divorce, and on that, certain questions have been raised by honourable members who are members of the legal profession, which I should unani- like to consider. I want merely to indicate that we shall consider them before the bill goes to the Senate, and if anything arises as a result of that consideration I shall, of course, put the House in possession of it.

Debate resumed (vide page 1532).",73
217,Mr CALWELL,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"Melbourne) [11.43]. - The honourable member for Marito byrnong (Mr Drakeford) has placed before the House the views of occasion, the Opposition on this bill. He a has discussed the civil aviation aspect of the matter, which is important to the future safety of Australia. We aot offer any opposition to the bill. We are pleased that action has been taken to incorporate this territory Commonwealth, although we understand that some objection to the decision of the British and Australian Governments transfer the area to Australia has been raised by some of the people on the Malayan Peninsula. I understand that the territory was previously under the ijontrol of the colony of Singapore, and ao doubt some feeling has been whipped tip in Singapore about the transfer. Cocos Islands have a very good airseparating field, which was provided with Australian capital. It will be of great value to persons travelling between Australia and South Africa, and it may even be useful to those travelling by air between Ausgenerally, tralia and England. The incorporation of these islands in Australian territory will be of some value to the future - lefence of Australia.",74
218,Mr ROBERTON,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"Riverina) [11.45] This bill is of great historical importance to the people of the Cocos Islands and to. the people of Australia. I want to make an impassioned plea to the Minister that the significance of the bill should uot be lost because of the lateness of hour of its introduction in this House, f t is a measure which must inevitably affect the lives of all those resident in Cocos Islands group, and it must affect the lives of the Australian people, because it is an additional responsibility of the Australian Government, and every intelligent man and woman in this country should appreciate these increasing responsibilities. I ask the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck) not to let this great occasion pass without some kind of historical pageant, no matter how simple, which will give it significance in the memory of those who are present on that important occasion, and in the minds of those who come after them. I remember vividly the occasion when the Minister for External Affairs introduced the bill take the first step in this direction. That was some time last year. On that too, the bill was introduced at very late hour towards the end of the session, and I was persuaded then to limit what I had to say to the bare facts of the do case. Since then a great deal has happened, and it is necessary to remind ourselves of the significance of this important within the and historic occasion. The Cocos group consists of no fewer to than 25 islands in the Indian Ocean. Admittedly, they are a long way from the coastline of Australia. Indeed, they are 1,800 miles from the City of Perth. They are 1,778 miles from the City of Colombo in Ceylon, and 1,050 miles from the City of Singapore. These distances The at one time constituted great barriers the mainland of Australia from this group of coral atolls in the Indian Ocean. Because of the great advances that have been made in transport these distances have diminished until it can be said now that the Cocos Islands group is only a few hours away from the Australian mainland. But 1 remind the House that the islands are only 803 miles from Djakarta, the capital of the Indonesian Republic. It is, therefore, necessary to view this question in its proper geographical perspective. If the transfer of the administration of these islands is not handled competently by the Government, they could become the another problem for Australia, such as West New Guinea is at present. The islands were discovered by William the Keeling in the year 1690, which is nearly 300 years ago. I remind those who always speak in defamatory terms of what is now called colonialism that islands at that time were uninhabitated. There are certain critics of colonialism who always say, when speaking of places like these islands, that the thing to is to hand the territory back to the natives to whom it originally belonged. But the Cocos Islands, in common with a great many other parts of the British Dominions, were uninhabitated when they were discovered 300 years ago. Eor 150 years very little happened. Subsequently, that intrepid Scot, John Clunies Ross, arrived at the place. My quite recently. mathematics may be slightly astray here, but he arrived 150 years ago and brought these coral atolls, this barren, inhospitGovernment, able group of islands to fertility for the first time. When he had accomplished that great task, he found it necessary get people from the United Kingdom, Malaya and Java to do the normal jobs production. So they built up this island community in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Strangely enough, that settleHouse ment, if one might so describe it, has singularly successful inasmuch as during those 150 years of settlement there been no crime of any importance, no vice of any importance, and none of hates and enmities that divide communivernment ties such as our own, throughout the modern world. We have cause to be proud of what John Clunies Ross did for Cocos Islands group, and for the. people who ultimately populated them. The islands became part of the British dominions in 1857, nearly 100 years ago. In that way, all the allegiances to the British throne that we share with so many other people throughout the world were shared by the people of the Cocos Islands group, and have been so shared for nearly 100 years. The islands, I suppose because of their geographical position, came under the administration of the Government of Ceylon in 1878. That arrangement continued, no matter how satisfactory, and I suppose no Australia. matter how unsatisfactory, it might have been, until the administration passed from the Government of Ceylon to the Government of the Straits Settlements 1903. It is at this point that I direr-t attention of the House to the fact that Mr Roberton. would be unreasonable to suppose that the overtures might have been made to the Commonwealth of Australia at that time, when the administration had to pass from the Government of Ceylon to some other do government. The Commonwealth of Australia was too young at that time,, and so we missed that opportunity. Since then, of course, the Cocos Islands have been administered by the Government of the Straits Settlements. That administration might have been satisfactory, or it might have been unsatisfactory, but it continued in an uninterrupted way until During World War II . the Australian in concert with the governments of other allied countries, found i l necessary to construct an airstrip in the to Cocos Islands group. That airstrip served a very useful war purpose, but, as of soon as hostilities ceased in 1945, the work of construction ceased and the airstrip was abandoned. I suggest to the that, but for the change of governbeen ment in 1949, the story of the Cocos Islands might have been a repetition of has that dreadful story of Manus Island. the Fortunately, there was a change of goin 1949, and by 1950 the airstrip, such as it was, was rehabilitated to some degree. In 1951 it was completed, the and immediately an air route was pioneered between this country and the Union of South Africa and the countries north of the Union of South Africa. So the Cocos Islands became a place of great significance in our general transport system. But, in addition to that, there was the historical importance of this handf u l of people populating a group of islands in the Indian Ocean and owing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen, and of the administration of those islands by the Government of the Straits Settlements without any responsibility being taken by the Government or people of This Government, having explored the possibilities, introduced a bill last Novemin ber in which it sought the sanction of Her the Majesty the Queen to the transfer of the it administration of the islands from the Government of the Straits Settlements the Commonwealth of Australia. I am very proud of the fact that the Government of Her Majesty the Queen in the United Kingdom saw fit to bring down the appropriate legislation in the Mother of Parliaments. Now it is our duty and our great pleasure to complete the legislative action that is necessary to bring the administration of these islands to this country, where it rightly belongs. I have nothing more to say. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",74
219,Mr ROBERTON,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"The applause comes from those honourable members who are not the slightest bit interested in this very important subject, and for that very reason it is necessary for me to repeat what I said at the beginning of my speech. Whether the Opposition likes it or not, this a moment of great historical significance to the people of the Cocos Islands group. Because of that, I appeal to the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck) to devise ways and means of making the passing of this final piece of legislation important to those people and, so far as he is able, important to the people of our own country so that it will be imprinted upon their minds, just as our forefathers saw fit to seize every opportunity to mark such occasions with pageants that would be of some historical interest to the succeeding generation.

222,Mr CALWELL,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"Melbourne) [12.34 a.m.],-This paper is as stale as the one with which the House has just dealt. I wish that the Government had given us an opportunity to discuss these matters earlier. However, we do not propose to discuss this matter any further at this stage.

226,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT, That the following paper be printed:Defence Policy and Programme-Minis terial Statement.,77
227,Mr CHAMBERS,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"Adelaide) [12.38 a.m.] - As this is a very old matter which was introduced into the House last year, and as many statements on the subject have been made since then,-1 think that it would be quite useless to attempt to speak on the matter now.",77
228,Mr LUCHETTI,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"Macquarie) [12.38 a.m.] - I shall delay the House for only a few moments, but I contend that the expenditure of vast sums of public money should receive consideration, even at this COPPER. early hour of the morning. I appreciate llth that this paper deals with only a certain aspect of defence. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that the Parliament and the people should be given more information concerning the expenditure of these large sums. Each year, the Parliament votes Â£200,000,000 for defence, but very little information is made available to the Parliament, and practically none to the people, about the manner in which thai money is expended. 'Some time ago in this chamber, I suggested that it was desirable to appoint a defence expenditure committee to probe fully waste and extravagance in connection with the defence programme. I am of the opinion that that suggestion should be more carefully considered. A number of important defence projects are in hand. The Minister for the Army (Mr Francis) is putting in hand the building of new defence establishments at various places. At Orange, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Calare (Mr. Howse), additional army buildings are to be erected, although satisfactory buildings at Bathurst have been sold at almost give-away prices. Consequently, our defence programme has been impaired. Valuable work has been thrown aside. A military camp which served this country extremely well during World War II . has been almost given away to people interested in second-hand materials. DEFENCE. Instances such as that, in which the mere expenditure of money seems to be an end in itself, are many. The Government seems to be concerned not so much with what is being achieved by way of defence preparations as with the problem of how to spend Â£200,000,000 each year as expeditiously as possible. Then, at the end of the financial year, we find the Government lamenting the fact that it has been unable to expend all the money voted by the Parliament. That is not only unfortunate; it is also deplorable that public money .mould be expended in that fashion. Even uow, during the closing stages of this sessional period, I think that a protest .mould be voiced against that sort of thing. W it h regard to our other defence com-' mitments, I consider that a committee should be appointed to visit these establishments, call for witnesses, and ascertain how the people's money is being spent. The Government has a Eoreign Affairs Committee which airily studies, in the fashion of a study circle, vast matters of Australian foreign policy. It could do a much more practical job for the people as a committee on defence expenditure, similar to the committee on war expenditure which rendered such a very fine service to the people of this country during World War II . The industrial development associated with defence needs probing. Army, air force and naval expenditure all require investigation and consideration. I make this plea in the hope that, one day, the Parliament will be given further information on these matters and that honourable members will be given an opportunity to probe this expenditure and endeavour to ensure that public money is being spent wisely and bringing the best results.

The following answers to questions were circulated:[12.41 INCREASE OF RETIRINGAGE .",78
230,Mr FITZGERALD,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"the Prime putMinister, upon notice I. Will he have an investigation made to determine the increase in the life span of people today compared with 40 years agoi - 2. Is it a fact that in England the RegistrarDoes General's investigation has shown that now people can expect to live on an average twenty years longer than 40 years ago? 3. If inquiries show a similar figure here, will he give consideration, as a lead to others, to increasing the retiring age in the Commonwealth Public Service, which today, despite its shortages and need for trained men, still obliges employees to retire at the ages of 00 and (id?",78
231,Mr MENZIES,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Investigations in the form of life-tables and calculations as to the expectations of life of people at various ages have been made regularly after each census in Australia (as in England) for many years past. I would refer the honourable member to page 38 of the Statistician's report on the census of 1947. A similar investigation w i ll he made on the results of the census of 1954. 2. The facts in England appear to be approximately as indicated in the honourable member's question in respect of expectations of life of children at birth. However the Registrar-General's reports show that the average expectation of remaining life of men in England who have attained age 60 has increased from only 13$ years 40 years ago to a little over 15 years at the present time. In Australia, over a slightly shorter period, the corresponding increase has been from 14.3 years to 15.4 years. 3. The Government has already agreed to the establishment of an inter-departmental committee to examine the employment of aged people. In the. course of its examination, the committee will study amongst other things the effects of compulsory age retirement in public and private employment upon manpower utilization and the financing of social security benefits. Following an earlier examination of the subject of retiring age, the Government decided that it should be studied from its overall national importance and not sectionally only in the Commonwealth Public Service. FLOOD DAMAGE AND RELIEF.",79
232,Mr MENZIES,TERRITORY SUPREME OOURT,"On the 12th May, honourable member for Shortland (Mr. Griffith) asked the following question:Is the Prime Minister aware that as a result of the appalling devastation caused by the recent disastrous floods in areas such as Hexham, Singleton and Maitland, an enormous amount of work still remains to be done to clear debris and silt from streets and homes? he also know that miles of fencing will have to be erected and farmlands will need to be cleared and levelled? All this work will have to be done, but because of the shortage of labour and finance in many cases, homeowners, businessmen and farmers are unable to make much headway in the work required. As a result the national economy must suffer. Will the right honourable gentleman confer with the Minister for the Army and ask him to visit the areas affected to ascertain whether military personnel and equipment, including national service trainees, could he made available and used in the work of restoring the Hunter Valley centres to their once prosperous state ? The matter raised by the honourable member has been discussed with my colleagues, the Mmister for the Navy and Army and the Minister for Air. At the outset, I would point out that the work of clearing and rehabilitation after a flood disaster is a matter in which it is appropriate for the State Government rather than the Commonwealth to assist. The provision of military aid for such a task may, therefore, only be considered in response to a specific request from the State authorities. As the honourable member is aware, personnel from all three services were extensively used in aid and rescue work when the floods were at their height. The Commonwealth Government does not, and, I hope, never will, begrudge this form of assistance. However it must be remembered that the great majority of the servicemen then concerned were national service trainees and this must also be the case in the event of any similar future assistance. Their participation in relief work was so extensive as to have serious repercussions on the fulfilment of essential training exercises. In addition, and in common with industry, the manning position in the services is such the that it is extremely difficult to meet services by the Government. While, therefore, it is appreciated that the workinvolved in clearing up the aftermath of the floods constitutes a serious drain on the national economy, I am unable to accede to the honourable member's request that servicemen be used in this work. nsiYKBSItTSCHOasARSRIPS, . MsMENZIBS - On . the 31st H a y , honourable member for Ballarat (Mr.. Joshua} asked tha fojlo.ising question, t1 address a question without notice to the Psime Minister, concerning university students. In view of the fact that a mature-age scholar drip, of Â£4 1 Ds. a week is awarded to universityatudents. who have reached the age of ?5 years, and are still studying will the Prime Minister make inquiries into the deplorable living conditions of married students of this class, whose wives go out to work? Because of this the students are deprived even of the Â£4 10s. a meek. It is necessary to add that the matureage scholarship relieves a parent of financial responsibility on this scale even when in receipt of considerable income, but if the wife of a student earns mqre than Â£250 a year the meagre allowance is withdrawn. Will the Prime Minister examine the position with a view to relieving distress amongst advanoed umversity studcata? The maximum allowance payable to a mature-age scholar is Â£4 ISs. 6d. a week. In addition a married mature-age scholar may receive dependants' allowances of Â£1 l is . a woek for his wifo and 9s. a week for the first dependent child nnder sixteen years of age. The maximum allowance is payable in the case, of a married scholar when the income of the scholar and his wife does not exceed Â£4 10s. a week. Whoro the weekly in come exceeds this amount the maximum living allowance is reduced hy 2s. for every 3s. of the excess. It will he seen that if the wife of a mature-age scholar earned Â£250 per annum the scholar would receive an allowanco of Â£5 ISs. 6d. a week and their total weekly income from all sources would be Â£10 14s. 8d. The living allowanco would be progressively reduced as the wife's earnings increased beyond Â£250 per annum, but some allowance would he payable until her earnings amounted to Â£13 14s. 7d. a week. I assure the honourable member that in fixing the rates of living allowances under the - Commonwealth scholarship scheme, attention is paid to existing economic conditions aad the allowances are determined only After very careful consideration.
