2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned concerned citizens respectfully showeth: 1. Australia's extensive road system is a nauonal asset wasting because of inadequate Federal and State funding. 2. Commonwealth Government funding of roads has fallen over the last six years from 2.9 per cent of all Commonwealth outlays to 2.3 per cent. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, should ensure: That the Commonwealth Government's long-term policy should be to provide SO per cent of all funding for Australia's roads. That at a minimum the Commonwealth Government adopts the recommendations by the Australian Council of Local Government Associations for the allocation of $5,903m of Commonwealth, State and Local Government funds to roads over the five years ending 1980-81, of which the Commonwealth share would be 41 per cent as recommended by the Bureau of Roads. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Clyde Cameron, Mr Drummond, Mr MCVeigh and Mr Millar. Petitions received. Symphony Orchestras To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that we are deeply concerned at the threat of the continuation of symphony orchestras throughout Australia posed by the I.A.C. and Green reports. We believe that the Government should not allow the symphony orchestras of Australia to be reduced in any way at all. Your petitioners humbly pray that your honourable House will take steps to ensure the continuation and growth of our symphony orchestras, thereby ensuring that the quality of life of the people of this country shall be maintained. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Connolly, Mr Dobie, Mr Jarman and Mr Martin. Petitions received. Rural and Urban Roads To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned concerned citizens respectfully showeth: 1. Australia's extensive road system is a nauonal asset wasting because of inadequate Federal and State funding. 2. Commonwealth Government funding of roads has fallen over the last six years from 2.9 per cent of all Commonwealth outlays to 2.3 per cent. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of PETITIONS Representatives in Parliament assembled, should ensure: That the Commonwealth Government adopts the recommendations of the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads for the funding of rural local roads and urban local roads in New South Wales for the triennium 1977-1980.

Minto Housing Commission Estate: Public Telephones To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That 1. There is no Public Telephone in the Minto Housing Commission Estate. This Estate is a residential area at present housing some 60 (sixty) families or 400 (four hundred people) of whom 130 are children of four years of age. The Minto Estate is 41.6 km (26 miles) from Sydney and 6.4 km (4 miles) from Campbelltown. The nearest Public Telephones are respectively located 1.5 km away on the corner of Pembroke Road and Warwick Street; and 2.S km away at the Minto Post Office in Redfern Street, Minto. The poor surface condition of the roads leading to these Public Telephones causes considerable delay and inconvenience in reaching them. That 2. There is no Doctor in Minto, such that any emergency requires telephone contact with the necessary medical authority located in towns other than Minto. Delays in contacting medical assistance could endanger a life or lives. That 3. On medical grounds it is an absolute necessity that some families have immediate access to a public telephone within the Minto Estate. Seven families have young Asthmatic children and a further two families have Epileptic children who frequently suffer severe convulsions. There are case examples to illustrate the dire need for a Public Telephone and to remedy the situation where an unconscious child may be able to secure immediate attention. That 4. A large number of the population are left during the day without transpon and thus without quick access to a telephone for contacting emergency services such as Firebrigade, Ambulance, Hospital, Doctors and the like. That S. Constant traffic of large trucks to building sites and the presence of incomplete houses is potentially dangerous and thus demands installation of a Public Telephone, in order that such potential crises can be met. Your petitioners kindly pray that your House will: 1. Request the Minister for Post and Telecommunications the Hon. Eric Robinson, to make a Public Telephone available within the Minto Housing Commission Estate. This could be located in the area bounded by Benham Road, Mortimer Street and Guernsey Avenue-a n area which would not be hampered by construcuon work and thus damage to cables. 2. Request the Minister for Post and Telecommunications the Hon. Eric Robinson, to ensure that an adequate number of Public Telephones be available to meet the need of the 1483 accommodation units that will be contained within the Minto Housing Commission Estate on its completion. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Baume. Petition received. Czechoslavakia: Basic Human Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Your petitioners believe that every citizen should have fundamental human right to express his beliefs without threat of arrest and punishment expresses their grave concern Jin Hajek and other Czech citizens merely for soliciting suppon for basic human rights as expressed in their 'Charter 77 \ Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge the Government to voice its disapproval of the and detention which are contrary to the United Declaration of Human Rights. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Groom. Petition received. Taxation: Superannuation Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the said Parliament nuate Pensioner by seeing the nuated and future Superannuated Pensioners having made sacrifices of income (along with taxes) to provide for retirement be allowed to receive their said Superannuation Pensions free of all Taxes. Increasing Taxes are becoming an increasing burden on those with a Axed income. Housing is needed by the Superannuants like any other section of the community but the Superannuants unlike any other section of the community are tied to a fixed income. The said Superannuants would appreciate this greatly as this would assist these people in obtaining (purchasing) housing of a reasonable standard. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wilson. Petition received. NA Notice of Motion",11

6,Mr ELLICOTT,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS,"The Government has not writer given consideration to that Bill. Although the Government supports the view that the High Court should become the ultimate court of appeal in the country, it regards the quesuon whether appeals to the Privy Council should be abolished or terminated as a matter for each State. I can only say that I have raised the question at meetings of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General for consideration by Attorneys-General of the States. At my request the question of a Statute of Westminster for the States was referred to a sub-committee of that Standing Committee. It seemed to me that it might consider the abohtion of those appeals in the course of considering that matter. That subcommittee has not yet reported.

7,Mr BROWN,MISS SUSAN DAY,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that an Australian zen, Miss Susan Day, presently employed by the Government of the People's Republic of China as a teacher, has applied to the Chinese authorities for permission to marry a Chinese citizen? So far as the Prime Minister knows, has that permission not yet been given? Will the Prime Minister be prepared to use his good offices to encourage the Chinese authorities to give permission for that marriage to take place?",13
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MISS SUSAN DAY,"This is the kind the of individual case in relation to trahan Government would want to act sympathetically. If the circumstances were reversed I think an Australian government would want to respond to a request made by somebody to marry an Austrahan citizen. When I was in China I expressed to the Chinese Government the view that, as we saw the situation, permission ought to be given for Miss Susan Day to marry the Chinese to whom she wished to be engaged. understand that subsequently she made an applipart cation to take out Chinese citizenship. The interest of the Australian Government was expressed quite correctly. In more recent times the Australian Embassy in Peking has been asked to remind the authorities of the views that were expressed several months ago. I am not aware of any response having been received from the Chinese authorities. NA",13

11,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMY,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it possible to ask the Treasurer to citianswer the question rather than make blustering personal attacks? If he is again reading from the letter from which he has read previously, may I ask once again that the full text of the letter be incorporated in Hansardl",13
12,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"There are 2 parts to the point of order that has been raised. The first part concerns the nature of the answer by the Treasurer. He is entitled to answer in a manner that is relevant to the question. As to the second part, at conclusion the answer I shall pursue the matwhich an Auster of tabling the letter.",13
13,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMY,"I was not sure whether the honourable gentleman said 'blustering attack' or 'blistering attack'. We have been waiting all week for that incisive, sharp economic attack from the Opposition. I confess to becoming a little tired of waiting for it. But perhaps it will arise during question time. I invite such an attack I because the answers can be provided. The first of the question asked by the honourable gentleman related to unemployment, for which the Opposition Party stands indicted because it caused that particular problem when in government. Unemployment is too high. We are on the record as stating that and I reaffirm that we yield to none in our concern for the unemployed throughout this country. But I remind the honourable gentleman, who eschews a sense of concern for statistics, that it was the Opposition that pushed unemployment from 1.8 per cent to 5.6 per cent over the period of 3 years in which members were in government. It has since risen by a mere 0.2 of a per cent. Of course, I indicate no complacency in relation to that, but I shall take up that point in a moment. As the Budget Papers indicated, no improvement",13
14,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMY,"I raise a point of order, Speaker. My question was about the growth in employment during the current financial year. should be very interested to learn about the rent rate of unemployment at anothertime,but is this answer relevant to my question?",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"I think the answer is relevant. I must draw the attention of the House to the that when a question is asked the questioner may not be satisfied with the answer, but it is not purpose of the Standing Orders to prevent this manner. occurring. The purpose of the Standing Orders is for the questioner to put the question and for the Minister to answer it as he sees fit provided it relevant.",14
16,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMY,"As I was saying before the interruption by the honourable gentleman, the Budget Papers indicated that no improvement in the unemployment situation was expected ing calendar year 1976. As we move further into 1977 and the recovery strengthens improvement can be expected. I take the opportunity to say on the general question of employment figures that I believe that a closer look needs to be given true picture. I refer to the last special survey was conducted by the Department of Employnot ment and Industrial Relations. Of the responwhich dents to the survey only 63.8 per cent were employed on the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition which, of course, is an internationally Hansard. agreed definition, 26.8 per cent were employed full time or part time or had lost or found the week of the survey, 9.4 per cent were classified as not in the labour force under the internationally agreed definition and finally 17 per cent of the sample survey rather than the respondents to the survey were found to be not residing at the address stated when for unemployment benefits. As to the reference of the honourable gentleman to the consumer price index, I remind the honourable gentleman of what I said in my speech to the House on this matter on Tuesday of this week. Of course the CPI which comes out at 12 noon next Tuesday will show a higher increase than any since the 5.6 per cent recorded for the December quarter of 1975, but that once and for all statistical effect should not be allowed to obscure the steady and considerable underlying improvement in the rate of inflation. I went its on to say that the point could be more easily seen if one looked at the broadly based deflators. I recall a question from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on broadly based deflators quite sometimeago. I welcome the Dorothy Dix question from the shadow Treasurer and take the opportunity to say in the strongest terms that this Mr Government deplores the attacks which he and his colleagues have disgracefully made upon the I integrity of the Acting Commonwealth Statiscurtician. I understand that the CPIfigurewill be released at 12 noon next Tuesday. That is a matter for the judgment of the Acting Commonwealth Statistician; it is not a matter which comes fact within the competence of this administration.

20,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"Is it confidential? to the Mr Lynch-No , the document is not. I should that however, so that the honourable gentleman is misled, say that I have a document here is headed: 'What is Wrong with the Oppounsition's Economic Policy'. The document runs to 8 pages. I am very happy to incorporate it in a job in Mr SPEAKER-Does the honourable member for Adelaide wish it to be incorporated?",14
21,Mr HURFORD,ECONOMY,"Yes , those documents from which he quoted. Mr Lynch-I seek leave to incorporate the registering document in Hansard.",14
22,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"Leave has been granted. The document read asfollowsWHAPS WRONG WITH THE OPPOSITION'S 'The danger in Labor's approach is the possibility of intensified pressure of demand leading to further prolonging of inflation.' 1. An increase in the money supply to the rate of inflation plus growth. 2. Selective stimulatory government spending: (a) Grants to the States for works programs. (b) Grants to local authorities. (c) Manpower programs such as youth employment subsidies. 3. Indirect tax cuts and/or grants to the states to reduce public sector charges. On 7 February the Shadow Treasurer issued a two-page press statement that purports to be the Opposition's economic policy. The statement contains no economic analysis and provides no details of the way in which the policy would be implemented or, indeed, of its objectives for growth, inflation and unemployment. It is useful to recall that the Liberal and National Country Parties' economic policy in Opposition, released on 10 February 1975, covered some 57 pages of detailed exposition. The Opposition's policy is designed primarily to stimulate a higher level of economic activity and begins from the lowing premise: 'The present low level of economic activity and level of unemployment are more that a cyclical recession.' Apart from the fact that all recissions are cyclical, finition, economic activity is, of course, at a low level relative to what was the norm during the post-war period only cause of the damage done by the Labor Government. What we promised at electiontimewas a three year program. recognised that the enormity of the economic problem required policies to curb the deteriorating position under predecessors, and to lay the groundwork for sustained recovery. Inflation was clearly the number one objective; its prominence is supported by virtually everyone but the Labor Party. Facts the Opposition Ignores If we look at the first year's economic performance, dence is increasingly showing the correctness of our proach; the fact is that economic activity has recently strengthened: 1976 has by almost all accounts been a much stronger than 1975. We expect the budgeted growth rate exceeded. Real gross non-farm product has increased in each of the first three quarters of 1976. It is now 7.6 per cent the December 1975 level. TREASURER Industrial production has been firming after a growth Parliament House pause around mid-year; year on year gains are Canberra 2600 spreading. 15 February 1977 Registration of new motor vehicles, seasonally adjusted, rose to 63,200 in December, a record monthly level; 1976 registrations were higher than 1975-the year ECONOMIC POLICY when sales tax was substantially reduced to boost the SUMMARY OF POLICY industry. Retail sales, seasonally adjusted, grew by 2.6 per cent in November and 1.2 per cent in December, reflecting increasing buoyancy as compared with earlier months in the year. Again, 1976 appears to be a year of real Mr Hurford growth. 15 February 1977 Real private investment in dwellings in the six months to September was 26 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Real private investment in plant and equipment, (seasonally adjusted) responding to the Government's investment allowance, increased by 4.3 per cent in the six months to September following a 3.6 per cent decline in the six months to March. Company profits increased by 26.2 per cent during the six months to September last, as compared with almost no change in the six months to March 1976. Background Facts the Opposition Likes to Forget As to the question of unemployment, the following should be taken into account: The Labor Government, not the present Government, stands indicted for the destruction of full employment in Australia. The average rate of unemployment in Australia between 1963 and 1972 was 1.3 per cent of the workforce. In December 1972, when the Whitlam Government came to office, the level of unemployment was 1.8 per cent In January 1976, reflecting three years of the Whitlam A Faulty Analysis policies, the level of unemployment had reached 5.6 per cent-it is now 5.8 per cent. In other words, the Labor Party which pushed unemployment from 1.8 per cent to 5.6 per folcent over a period of three years is now condemning the present Government because the level has moved upward by high one fraction of a per cent over the past twelve months. This year's Budget papers made it clear that a decline in by dethe level of unemployment could only be expected towards the end of the financial year, with further improvement in belabour market conditions later in 1977 in response to strengthening economic activity. This trend should be It further aided by the positive effects of devaluation. Unemployment in January this year was in no way inconour sistent with what was put before the Parliament last August. 'Present expectations are thus for only a gradual reduction in the rate of unemployment with little if any of this appearing during calendar 1976.' (P. 53 Hansard 17August 1976) eviThe Labor Party, both in and outside the Parliament, has apattempted to create apprehension in the community about the unemployment situation. Both the Leader of the Opposition and his Deputy last year predicted that unemployment would reach half a million in January. The President of the year ACTU made the same prediction. Labor's new statement of economic policy is a further attempt to exploit the 'politics' for the economy to beof unemployment. What the foregoing demonstrates is that the whole basis on which the Opposition has framed its policy is wrong. The above level of unemployment is not a lead indicator and cannot, therefore, be used to assess activity at the present stage of the economic cycle. Economic activity is trending upwards and the economy cannot be said to be moving deeper into recession. Against this general background a number of fundamental criticisms can be levelled at the Opposition's policy: The policy makes no reference at all to wages and it must therefore be assumed that full wage indexation for the majority of the workforce, as set down in the so-called Whitlam five point plan of 14 October this area. This factor alone during 1977 would inevitably lead to increased inflation, especially insofar as it would greatly exaggerate the price effects of the devaluation. The supine posture assumed by the Opposition to the critical question of wages stands in sharp contrast to its position when in Government. For example, the previous Treasurer explicitly recognised the real wage problem in his 197S Budget Speech when he said: 'It does employees generally no good to get higher and higher money incomes if the results are just higher prices, a severe squeeze on profits, a slump in new investment and a contraction ofjob opportunities. Consider, also, Mr Whitlam's words to the 197S Young Labor Conference: 'Inflation today is undoubtedly and almost solely due to wage claims and increases.' The Labor plan argues for manpower programs such as 'youth employment subsidies and apprenticeship, vocational and techmcal education schemes'. This, of course, completely ignores the very significant employment innovations of the present Government: A special youth employment training program; Relocation Assistance Scheme; Community Youth Support Scheme; Improvements to NEAT; Review of CES Services; Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Full-Time Training; Inquiry into education and the labour force. Labor's new policy abandons monetary control as an instrument in the fight against inflation. The Labor Party now proposes that the rate of monetary growth should be increased to the rate of inflation plus the rate of economic growth-or , according to Mr Hurford, by around 5 per cent. This is put forward because, according to the Opposition, the present rate of money supply growth 'is causing a credit squeeze'. The first point to be noted is that any suggestions a credit squeeze are baseless in fact. In the wake of devaluation, certain adjustments to the monetary instruments have been necessary to keep the thrust of monetary policy firmly on the anti-inflation track: Yields on Government paper have been increased in order to attract more funds Measures have been taken to restrict shorter term, low priority overseas borrowings from adding to monetary easiness; Further moves have been made to contain the Budget deficit; The SRD ratio has been increased by 3 percentage points, with another call of 1 per cent effective on 21 February so as to prevent an inflationary upsurge in bank lending. But calls to SRDs have not been excessive-tradin g bank free liquidity averaged 6 per cent of deposits at the end of Wages January, an increase ot 4 percentage points over the level at the end of November. The very substantial non-official holdings of Treasury notes-ove r $2.5 billion-will serve to smooth out the liquidity rundown during the final quarter of the financial year. last, remains as ALP policy in Furthermore, the minimum LGS ratio of the trading banks will revert from the present 23 per cent to 18 per cent at the end of March, or when the liquidity down-swing gets underway. Against this background there is no basis for claiming that there is a credit squeeze and that monetary policy should be eased. Indeed, what the Opposition now advocates is that inflation should be underwritten by monetary policy. It is worth recalling that Mr Hurford claimed on 22 January last year that the Government had put in hand a 'vicious credit squeeze', in spite of the statement by Mr Hayden at the time that the Government's economic package was 'an appropriate measure'. It should also be recalled that, in a speech on 3 August last, Mr Hurford endorsed the Government's monetary policies in the following terms: 'The rate of inflation would be reduced by a combination of policies including . . . allowing the money Manpower Policy supply to grow at a rate sufficient to accommodate a recovery of growth and a declining rate of price increases.' Last August Mr Hurford presented a mirror image of the Government's monetary policy-no w he claims for political reasons that measures taken, in line with that policy, will lead to a credit squeeze. It is not irrelevant, when considering the Labor Party s record in this area, that the 1974 credit squeeze was far more severe than any credit restrictions in the post-war era and was instrumental in pushing the economy to the depths of its recession. The Private Sector Labor's new policy now finds it appropriate to 'scrap or reduce some of the more extravagant, and only marginally useful, investment and depreciation allowances. In other words, Labor would abolish the 40 per cent investment allowance that has been one of the primary factors leading to a revival in business investment spending. It Monetary Policy would also reduce the extent of depreciation allowable to businesses and, presumably, abandon the move towards company tax indexation of which adjustments to depreciation are a fundamental part. This aspect of Labor's new policy alone would seriously jeopardise the recovery. Again, it is not inelevant to note Labor's previous actions and it will be recalled that the Labor Government abolished the 20 per cent investment alof lowance that was in force under the preceding Government. Business has condemned this aspect of Labor's policy in trenchant terms. Some of the business groups having done so include the Associated Chamber of Manufactures, Victorian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Farmers' Federation. Government Spending from the non-bank private sector; Labor's plan calls for 'a selective, stimulatory, Government spending program'. Consistent with the rest of the policy statement no figure for spending is included. It has to be assumed that thefiguregiven by Mr Whitlam in bringing forward hisfivepoint plan last October-$500 million-is a minimum. Labor's spending proposals are simply the same old discredited big spending, big deficit approach that has been repudiated not only by the Australian electorate, but by every international meeting of finance ministers over the past twelve months. The new plan is, in this regard, little more than a hangover from the halcyon days of Dr Cairns who, it will be recalled, lifted Federal spending by some 46 per cent in one year. Far from bringing about any stimulus, the Cairns policies simply added to the economy's difficulties at the time. Labor's plan suggests that indirect tax cuts should be used to increase real incomes and to boost consumer spending. There is no real basis for Labor's assertion that reductions in indirect taxation could effectively reduce the rate of inflation, thereby leading to an increase in consumption. In fact, when Labor reduced sales tax on motor vehicles early in 1975, the stimulus was short-lived-sale s slumped badly in the second half of the year. As a rule of thumb about $400 million of indirect tax revenue has to be foregone to reduce the Consumer Price Index by a mere 1 per cent. If inflation really could be dealt with by cutting indirect taxes, it is astonishing that such pleasantly soft options have not been universally adopted. Quite apart from the hard economic realities, precedence clearly needs to be given to personal income tax reform because of Australia's already heavy reliance on direct, rather than indirect, taxes. What Labor Doesn't Mention Labor's new plan makes no mention of three important proposals that were previously Whidam plan: A reduction in the rate of company tax; More generous income tax rebates; A reduced health levy. The plan gives no commitment to either personal tax indexation or company tax indexation. The plan makes no mention whatever of external policy. It has to be remembered that the Labor Party has been critical of the Government's external policy. In the light of such criticism, it is strange indeed that no alternative has been brought forward. Finally, the plan says nothing of substance about financing the increased deficit-althoug h some mention is made of 'aggressive' selling of bonds (whatever that means)-it is abundantly clear that the Hurford plan is simply to print more money. The absolute folly of Labor's proposal is, perhaps, best summed up in the words of the British Prime Minister, Mr James Callaghan, in his address to the Labor Party Conference on September 18 last: 'We used to think that you could just spend your way out of a recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists and that insofar as it ever did exist, it worked economy.' NA",14
23,Mr BIRNEY,SEAT MANUFACTURE,"Is the Minister for Transport aware that the extent of a recent fire on a Sydney train was mainly attributable to the presence of a highlyflammablematerial-polyurethane-in the train seats? Does the composition of aeroplane seats used on Australian airliners include this substance? If so, does he regard its presence as a safety hazard? Is remedial action contemplated? Is there any need for public concern relative to any of the materials used in the manufacture of such seats?",17
24,Mr NIXON,SEAT MANUFACTURE,"I am aware that it is asserted Indirect Tax Cuts that thefirein the train in Sydney recently was caused by polyurethane seats. I understand that tests have been undertaken by the New South Wales Transport Commission to prove or disprove that assertion. It is a fact that polyurethane is used in the manufacture of aircraft seats, but I am able to inform the honourable member that, happily, the polyurethane in aircraft seats is given some fire resistant treatment that satisfies the Department of Transport in respect of the prospect offire.The polyurethane seats in aircraft throughout Australia are quite safe. I think that during the period of office of my predecessor steps were taken to set up procedures to test flammable materials in aircraft, and polyurethane seats were subject to those overall tests. Therefore, the safety standards of Austrahan aircraft are very high. put forward as essential in the CONSUMER PRICE INDEX: EFFECT OF NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Treasurer a question. He will recall that after the meetings between the Government and union leaders last June a joint Press statement was issued that the Government would not oppose adjustments to award wages thatflowedfrom increases in the Consumer Price Index due to the introduction of the Medibank levy. Does the Treasurer's statement on Tuesday that the Government intends to press very strongly indeed for a maximum measure of wage restraint indicate that the Government will now ignore this agreement with the unions and will oppose any increase in award Conclusion wages to compensate wage earners for the imposition of the Medibank levy? Will the Government also oppose future increases in wages insomuch as they are caused by the effects of devaluation?",17
25,Mr LYNCH,MEDIBANK LEVY,"A very quick response to the honourable gentleman would be that in matters of this type, as he should be very much aware, it by injecting inflation into the ought not to be within the province of this Parliament to seek to canvass matters of detail which the Government will be putting in the national wage case. I made that perfectly clear in the statement which I brought down in the House on Tuesday of this week and I do not seek to go beyond it. I might say to the honourable gentleman generally on wages that this Government is confident that the overwhelming majority of Australians now understand the need for wage and salary restraint because of the incidence of inflauon and because of the problems of job opportunities, that is to say, the absence of job opportunities created by the honourable gentleman. On this subject, I can do no better than quote what the honourable gentleman said to the Young Labor Association conference in January 1975. He said then that inflation was 'undoubtedly and almost solely due to wage claims and increases'. He will recall this as well as I do from the piece of paper which I have here. I quote the honourable gentleman back to him: You cannot blame Vietnam for the inflation in the world. You cannot blame the oil crisis for the inflation in Australia. You cannot blame the takeovers inflation in Australia now. You have to place the blame on wage claims. The Leader of the Opposition went even further and oudined why excessive wage increases lead not only to inflation but also to unemployment. Again I quote from what he said: Every excessive increase in income for one man takes the job of another. I can well understand, therefore, why, curiously and somewhat incomprehensibly, the honourable member for Adelaide, who is the Opposition's spokesman on economic matters, made no reference whatever to wages in that somewhat incomplete- I underline 'incomplete'economic statement published in a 2-page document some few days ago.

26,Mr CHAPMAN,AIRLINE FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED,"Is the Minister for - Transport aware of recent newspaper advertisements by Qantas Airways Limited and British Airways Corporation which gave readers the immediate impression that they would be able to save $450 on returnflightsto Britain from 1 April, when in fact these cheaper fares do not apply until flights in October? Will the Minister ensure that in future Qantas and British Airways abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the trade practices legislation in relation to their advertising?",18
27,Mr NIXON,AIRLINE FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED,"Qantas Airways Ltd and British Airways have announced a new cheap fare from Australia to the United Kingdom and from the United Kingdom to Australia. The fare is $850 in the off-peak season compared with the present fare for the same period of $1,104. There is no doubt that in general terms the new fare structure has been widely welcomed. Indeed, Qantas received some 6000 inquiries in the first week after the announcement about bookings at the new cheap rate. In respect of the specific matter raised by the honourable member, I have sought information on it and I understand that the advertisement is in no way in breach of the trade practices legislation, the reason being that Qantas and British Airways have widely advertised the full fare structure, including peak and off-peak travel. Therefore no prospective traveller ought to be under any illusions as to the price he would be paying. I will, however, draw to the attention of Qantas the concern expressed in the honourable member's question. CONSUMER PRICE INDEX: EFFECT OF NA and the currency rates for Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Treasurer a question in precise and simple terms. Does the Government adhere to its undertaking of last June that it would not argue against wage award increases by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission insofar as changes in the Medibank levy resulted in increases in the consumer price index?",18
28,Mr LYNCH,MEDIBANK LEVY,"I was quite precise and made it quite clear that I would not answer that question in this House. My colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations might see fit to answer it. I will leave the question in his jurisdiction. He may or may not wish to answer it. I do not predict or foreshadow that he will. I was saying that I, as Treasurer, would say in this House no more than I said when I made the economic statement on Tuesday. I repeat that to KINGDOM the honourable gentleman. We shall be stating our position in this matter fully in the national wage case which is expected to commence within a few weeks. I do not propose today to foreshadow our submission in detail. I, as Treasurer, refuse to do so. I leave it to my colleague who may have a different judgment in which case he will exercise it. But, as Treasurer, I refuse to give any indication of detail as to that wage case regardless of what the honourable gentleman seeks to pose to me. NA",18
29,Mr KING,POSTAL RATES,"I direct my question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Has the Minister read a statement attributed to Mr Kennedy, Chairman of the Australian Postal Commission, regarding a possible rise in postal rates in the near future? Can the Minister inform the House whether this is a factual statement?",18
30,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,POSTAL RATES,"I was rather surprised to read the Press statement attributed to Mr Kennedy. I have discovered that his statement was misinterpreted by some media. I am told that the Chairman of the Australian Postal Commission in a Press announcement said that there would be no postal thisfinancialyear. Some sections cided to interpret that as meaning that there would be increases next financial year. It also ought to be stated that the Chairman of the tralian Postal Commission and the Chairman of resulted the Australian Telecommunications Commission the can make recommendations as to basic charges the but the decision on basic charges is for myself after, of course, consultation with the Cabinet.",18
31,Dr KLUGMAN,POSTAL RATES,And the blame.,19
32,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,POSTAL RATES,I would suggest that time. members of the Opposition do not interject because their record in this area is not very good. the 3-year period in which they were in they permitted the postage charge to rise from 7c to 10c to 18c. In that same period they permitted basic telephone call charges to rise from 4c to 6c quoted: to 9c. That is the sort of problem we inherited from the Opposition. Under this Government basic charges have been held for 18 months. proposal about increasing these charges will considered very carefully by this Government because we realise the inflationary effect have upon the community. CONSUMER PRICE INDEX: EFFECT OF and for NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask a question of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relament tions. Does the Government adhere to its public undertaking last June that it will not argue against increases in awards by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission insofar as changes in the method of financing Medibank result in increases in the consumer price index?,19
33,Mr STREET,MEDIBANK LEVY,"There are a couple of points on that I would like to make. Firstly, I reiterate the Treasurer said: The Government makes traffic known its case to be presented at the national wage hearing at the proper time-whe n it been appears before the Full Bench of the Comthe mission. The Leader of the Opposition did not quote in precise terms, so far as I remember, communique which was issued. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I do not mind if the precise words are incorporated in Hansard. I have them here.",19
34,Mr STREET,MEDIBANK LEVY,I think it might be useful to have the precise words incorporated. Mr E. G. Whitlam-May I read them?,19
35,Mr STREET,MEDIBANK LEVY,"Read them if you like and get it sections of the over in that way. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Do I read them or do you? increases Mr STREET- I will read them. The comof the Press demunique states: The Government indicated that insofar as these changesAusThat is changes in the consumer price indexin increases in the consumer price index, then, for purpose of adjustment to award wages for movements in consumer price index under the wage indexation principles, the Commonwealth would not be arguing that the index should be 'discounted' for these particular increases. That is the quote from the communique of the Mr E. G. Whitlam-You interpolated after In 'changes' the words 'in the consumer price office, index'. They are changes in Medibank.",19
36,Mr STREET,MEDIBANK LEVY,"To remove any doubt, I The Government indicated that insofar as these changesAny I interpolated there: 'These changes being be changes in the CPI due to the introduction of new Medibank arrangements'. That should they remove any misunderstanding. The Government is concerned that the question of the new Medibank arrangements be dealt with on a once all basis, not in a piecemeal way as has happened in several industrial cases recently. Therefore we believe the proper place to resolve it is at national wage case hearings. The Governcase, when it is presented at the proper time, will take into account what was said earlier. NA",19
37,Mr JULL,BRISBANE AIRPORT,"Is the Minister for Transport aware of a Brisbane Sunday Sun Press report on 6 February that both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines plan to spend $ 10m new terminal facilities on their present locawhat tions at Brisbane Airport to handle passenger until 1990? Does this indicate that all plans for a new airport complex in Brisbane have scrapped, or is there still a possibility that relocation of the runway system will go ahead to alleviate the noise problems in the the Wynnum area in my electorate and in areas of the electorates of Griffith and Lilley?",19
38,Mr NIXON,BRISBANE AIRPORT,I am able to reassure the honourable member that any redevelopment programs proposed by either Ansett or TAA do not in any way inhibit any future decisions that may be taken in respect of relocation of the runways at Brisbane Airport. NA,19
39,Mr KEATING,NATURAL CAS PIPELINE,"Has the Prime Minister read the trans-continental natural gas pipeline feasibility study prepared by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation? Does the Government concede that at least on the advice of this study the economics of a trans-continental line may be established? Has the Prime Minister approved of the Government's negotiating with the Australian Gas Light Corporation for the sale of the Gidgealpa-Sydney natural gas line presently owned and operated by the Pipeline Authority? In view of the growing importance of natural gas to the Australian economy, how does the Prime Minister justify the Government's jettisoning this natural asset in the interests of the commercial enterprise?",20
40,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NATURAL CAS PIPELINE,"I will refer the matter to my colleague, the Minister responsible for these matters, and see what information he would feel incUned to make available.",20

43,Mr BAILLIEU,INDIRECT TAXES,My question is directed the Treasurer. Has the Government made a detailed examination of recent proposals calling for a reduction in the level of indirect taxes? If will the Treasurer tell the House which proposals have already been studied and the likely quences if such cuts were to be made at present?,20
44,Mr LYNCH,INDIRECT TAXES,"The Government certainly has looked at all the proposals which have been put forward, and in particular the proposal emanathonourable ing from the Opposition that indirect taxes ought to be cut to reduce inflation at a cost of $400m for each percentage point. No doubt the Leader of the Opposition believes that inflation can be reduced by 10 per cent and paid for by a $4 billion overseas loan, but calls for tax cuts strange coming from an Opposition Leader who is on the record not so very long ago as describcision ing such calls as amounting to no more or no than economic vandalism. They are even stranger when it is remembered that it was Government that increased indirect taxes in of its 3 Budgets. All Australians will recall massive increases in the rates of indirect taxes Labor's last Budget when the man in the street was hit to leg by steep rises in taxes on cigarettes, beer, spirits and petrol. Against the background of the record of the Leader of the Opposition say that his proposals for cuts in indirect taxes amount to no more than humbug and hypocrisy.",20

49,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TARIFF ON TRAVEL GOODS,"I direct my question to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer to his statement in the House on 7 December last, advising that the Government had accepted the Industries Assistance Commission tariff recommendations in respect of multilateral trade. Can the Minister explain why in respect of travel goods, which were the subject of the recommendation of the IAC, the Government has taken no action to reduce the tariff as indicated to this House? Has the Minister made any public explanation for this apparent mistake or what is the reason for the Government not taking such action? Is he aware that many people in business, particularly in importing travel goods, relied on the ministerial statement made, acted accordingly, reduced their prices for forward selling and have suffered substantial damto age because of the Government's action? Accordingly, is the Minister prepared to allow these goods in at the lower rate of duty forecast so, in the IAC report or alternatively will he offer compensation to the companies affected? conse Mr HOWARD-The Industries Assistance Commission report referred to contained recommendations dealing with some 900 items in the tariff, and it will not therefore surprise the gentleman if i say in reply that I cannot recall the details of each of those 900 items without referring to the IAC report. I will investigate the query that the honourable gentleman has raised. If there has been any error I will give consideration to any consequential action that are ought to be taken. I should point out to the honourable gentleman that subsequent to the deof the Government as announced on 7 less December regarding the adoption of the IAC recommendations on the Multilateral Trade his Negotiations, it was ascertained that to each implement all the recommendations might have the breached certain bilateral trading arrangements in enjoyed by this country with other countries. In consequence a further statement was issued indicating that some of the 900 items on which action had been foreshadowed on 7 December I had been excluded from that action because of our trading obligations. It may be that the items to which the honourable gentleman refers fall within the category of those items subsequently excluded. If that is the case, that is the explanation, but I will check the specific items mentioned and I will be more than happy to advise the House. NA",20
50,Mr OKEEFE,BEEF EXPORTS,I direct my question to the did Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Overpearance seas Trade. In view of reports of prospects for the beef industry can the Minister indicate what level of exports the industry is likely to achieve this year and to what extent the benefits of higher sales are likely to flow through to the cattle producers?,21
51,Mr ANTHONY,BEEF EXPORTS,"I am very pleased to be able to say that the prospects this year are for record meat sales. This is a result of the representations that have been made by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Primary Industry and me to governway ments for greater access to their markets. access to the United States this year will be record level under the voluntary restraint arrangements. Our Japanese quotas are being continually pushed up since the ban on imports in 1974 was lifted. The European Economic Community has eased some of its restrictions and offering a market of about 125 000 tonnes imports of which we will have a part. One aspect that is very pleasing is the sales that have been made to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and to the eastern Soviet bloc countries. pleased to say that it is after Union and the invitation of the head of the Soviet State Trading Agency that we look like making sales to the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries of about 100 000 tonnes which is ditional to last year's sales. The higher prices and the greater sales mean that the industry should be doing better. I believe it is true that the non-growing sector of the indusState try has had a prosperous year-that is the extive porters, the processors and the people who in the meat works. But the prices have not been reflected back to the cattle producers. I think a bad situation for the whole of the industry everybody does not share in the benefits. The cattle producing side of the industry has gone through 3 agonising years. Unless there is a sharmania, ing of the returns then I think great harm will done to the industry. There should be an tunity for higher returns going to cattle owners this year but that will depend on whether the buyers are prepared to pass the returns back and on whether the meat unions are prepared to keep the abattoirs working at full capacity which they will have to do to meet our prospective sales. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I address my question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. Since, as the Treasurer stated earlier, the consumer price indexfigureswill be issued next Tuesday, why he state on television last Tuesday in his apwith the shadow Treasurer that they brighter would be published this week?",21
52,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,I did not state on television that the figures would be announced this week. I said that my understanding was that they would be out before the end of this week and I think I may have said 'on Thursday'. I only repeat what the Treasurer has said-that the announcement of these figures is a matter for the Statistician who holds a statutory authority. In no was I indicating that I knew or had any idea Our when they were coming out. It was my underat a standing that they were expected this week. NA,21

Have representations of been made by Tasmanian members to the Minister for the upgrading and improvement of air freight services between Tasmania and the mainland States? Will the Minister inform the House I am whether any developments have been made in my visit to the Soviet this regard?,21
54,Mr NIXON,TASMANIAN AIR FREIGHT SERVICES,"In the last 12 months I suppose that if the door has not been battered down it has adcertainly been well pummelled by Tasmanian members seeking improvements to Tasmania's transport system, especially the connections to the mainland States. As Tasmania is an island the great difficulty I have is finding alternamethods of transport that might be of assistwork ance to Tasmania. Of course the best way of improving transport is by sea. We introduced the it is freight equalisation scheme to assist Tasmanian if industry in that way. I have no doubt that that has been of great benefit to Tasmanian industries. I have looked at the air services to Tasparticularly the freight services, and have be concluded that some innovation is desirable. opporThat is why this week I have approved the import of 2 Carvair aircraft for Air Express and 2 Argosy aircraft for IPEC to commence carriage of freight between the mainland and Tasmania. I believe that this innovation and the improved aircraft will assist markedly the capacity of manian industries to sell their goods on the mainland and, likewise, the mainland industries to deliver their goods to Tasmania.

55,Mr UREN,FARM INCOMES,"Has the Minister for Primary pacity Industry noted in the publication of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Trends in Australian Agricultural Commodities; Farm Costs and Farm Incomes, issued in December 1976, that real income per farm will have fallen 1973 to $5,700 in 1976-77. That is, this financial year real income per farm is anticipated by Bureau of Agricultural Economics to be only 36 per cent of what it was in 1973 and, by a long way, the lowest since that year. As the Minister clearly implied when in opposition that suitable policies would overcome the fall in farm income, will he outline what policies he has in hand the seriously depressed level of farm incomes?",22
56,Mr SINCLAIR,FARM INCOMES,"I should like to thank the Deputy Deader of the Opposition for that quesknow tion. It is one of the most intelligent observations I have heard him make in reflection on deteriorating economic circumstances of people throughout rural areas as a result of the 3 years of Labor rule. The 36 per cent decline in farm incomes occurred as a result more than anything else of Labor's implementation of the Coombs report and its failure to recognise that the tem15 porary upturn for rural producers in general economic circumstances in the early days of its regime was not a product of a government address change but a direct result of a lift in export prices. Tragically for Australian agriculture, dependent as it is on export markets, there has always been a cyclic pattern with times of order. very high prices and shortages of the commodities we sell, followed unfortunately by periods when there is an abundance of the products sell. This has been reflected in the mountains butter in the European Economic Community, nise the lakes of wine and surpluses of other modities and, the consequential collapse world prices. Those realities of the market bit lost on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition but they are the realities upon which the first premise of agricultural survival in Australia depends. The second premise is that there has equally been a cyclic pattern in seasons. We have floods, droughts and bushfires. This cyclic tern does not aid predictability of general patDecember. terns of production. Pohcies on our side of the House have led towards a maintenance of the circustances of the economy of the Tas- industry to offset these things. Let me give an illustration. The income equalisation deposits within the farmer's individual capability provide an opportunity for insurance against seasonal or market change. This is a very worthwhile development. The individual farmer has the cato set aside money in a good year so that when markets collapse or seasons deteriorate he can reduce his dependence on government assistance because he has not paid tax during the year on the income equalisation deposits from his from $ 15,900 in own resources. We have introduced schemes of assistance in the respect of individual commodities. I have said before that I regard the action by the Australian Labor Party when in government of reducing the wool price reserve as one of the most diabolic that any government has taken against the rural sector at any time in Australia's history. When to lift we came into government we gave the Australian wool growers a 2-year guarantee- a guarantee which has been reflected in the continuing improving returns for them. I do not whether the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, for example, realises that almost as a dithe rect result of the Government's policy",22
57,Mr HAYDEN,FARM INCOMES,I rise on a point of order Mr Speaker. The official report shows income increasing by 4 per cent and costs increasing by per cent this year. That is the substance of the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to which the Minister is refusing to himself.

70,Mr ANTHONY,PIPELINE AUTHORITY,"Pursuant to section 45 of the Pipeline Authority Act 1973, I present the annual report of the Pipeline Authority for the of yearended 30 June 1976. NA Commonwealth-State Housing News Session-Botan y Bay Port Development-Statistics-Price s of Petroleum Products-Pathology Services-Brisbane Airport an overseas loan of Quesuon proposed: need for a That grievances be noted. on Mr UREN (Reid) (11.25)-My grievance is the Fraser Government unilaterally is trying to force the State governments of Australia to continue agree to the changing of the existing Commonanother wealth-State Housing Agreement in a way that will create hardship for many existing tenants of welfare housing and will create inequity between the needy poor and other less affluent people in our country. The Fraser Government is mtent upon forcing the States to pay the long term possible bond interest rate of 10.5 per cent per annum on loans for welfare housing. As a consequence, the of welfare housing will pay rents at the current market level. The present interest rate, was set by the Whitlam Labor Government, for those who receive a rental house under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is 4 per cent per annum. Of the loan under the Agreement 70 per cent is used for dwelling conto struction by Housing Commissions while the 30 per cent of the loan is used by terminating building societies to assist eUgible families to buy their own homes. This is made available by the Government to the States at 4¥i per cent. While there may be some long term reason in no the Fraser Government's proposals from a rational economic point of view, in immediate the decision is both callous and cruel and from a human point of view it is full of weakIt brands the Fraser Government as an centralist. The Fraser Government did not the States how they considered the Agreement could be improved; it just set down the edict from Canberra. Is this a part of Fraser's There can be no doubt that if this proposal is bludgeoned through by the Minister by sayfor Environment, Housing and Community the Development (Mr Newman) the immediate poleffect on many tenants of Housing Commission will be a large increase in rental rates. In Sydney some rents wouldrisefrom $25 a week to $80 a week. No fanuiy, no matter how well off it might be, should be faced with such a immediate increase-suc h an instantaneous shock to the family budget. The situation will be similar in all States, including Western Australia, where an election will be held on Saturday. by Prime Minister Fraser's standards, life not meant to be that hard. Mr Newman-That is why you are telling Ues now.",23
71,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The Minister will withdraw that remark. Mr Newman-I withdraw it.,24
72,Mr UREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The electors should be aware of what Sir Charles Court's Federal Liberal colleagues have in store for his State Liberal coUeagues. They set down their edicts in berra. Is this the Liberal Government's new eralism? To approach such a human problem this way only highlights the Government's lack of humanity and concern. It does not highlight compassion. This approach demonstrates once again the Government's lack of understanding of the nature of the housing problem in Australia. Increases in other areas of Sydney of New South Wales generally, let alone in other States, may not be as high as those mentioned but they would be just as hurtful. These differences result from differing market values and from differing costs to produce the total dwelling and land package. Even allowing for the subsidies the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development talked about, many families in Sydney will be faced with higher rents thanfinanciallyequivalent famUies in other capital cities. Non-subsidised tenants in Melbourne also will pay much higher proportions of their incomes in rent thanfinanciallyequivalent tenants in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and the Terriinstitutions tories. They will pay much higher rents because of the higher cost to produce the house and land package. They will pay higher rents because land in Sydney in particular and in Melbourne is much more expensive than residential land other capital cities. In fact, because of the which operates in Adelaide with a Land Comearn mission that a Federal Labor Government sisted to set up, the non-subsidised Housing Commission tenant in Adelaide will be much better off than his income equivalent elsewhere in Australia. It is even possible that subsidised tenants in Adelaide and in other areas outside Sydney and Melbourne will be better off than their counterparts in Sydney and Melbourne if this proposal is accepted. But we know it will be accepted. Having said that, housing comof mission tenants in every State will suffer enorsociety mously because of greatly increased rents. I see this happening. Even Rather than attacking the Labor Premiers was who have these and other doubts over the end result of the Fraser Government's proposal, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development would be more productive if he ensured that studies were undertaken correlating the cost benefit and social welfare implications of alternatives to the existing scheme. Before demanding changes in the existing agreement, the Government should have a definite workable proposal that will protect those people who earn up to 85 per cent of average weekly wages. These are the people who can apply for housing commission homes under the CanCommonwealth-State Housing Agreement. We fedneed proposals that will not only guarantee inhousing at rents these people can afford but which will also guarantee access to housing by a easing the supply problem and reducing the number of famUies on the waiting Ust which currently numbers 100 000 throughout Australia. and One other aspect of the Minister's proposal concerns me greatly. It is a matter on which he has been totaUy silent up to date. I refer to the question of moneyflowingthrough to terminating buUding societies. At present families are eligible for low interest loans-loan s where the rate does not exceed 5A per cent-to achieve home 3 ownership, which are avaUable to famUies where the breadwinners income does not exceed 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. As I said earlier, this totals 30 per cent of the money allocated. The money is made avaUable at An per cent and let out at 5% per cent, the difference being taken up by administrative and other costs. The terminating building societies are the which give the opportunity of private sector home ownership to the poorer sectors of our community. The societies enable low income earners to put their feet on the rung of home ownership and the economic benefits that follow in Will these famUies be denied benefits of home system ownership-like those in our community who between 95 per cent and 135 per cent of avaserage weekly wages-by a mechanism of high interest rates and the creation of the arbitrary repayment gap? At present people earning between 95 per cent and 135 per cent of average weekly earnings find it impossible to meet monthly repayments. This Government has no solution to the problem. These famUies whose wage earners earn less than 95 per cent of aver notage weekly earnings will be denied the benefits home ownership if the terminating building interest rates approach the levels charge can by other lending institutions. Let me give an example. If interest rates are increased to \0n per cent on a loan of some $25,000-the average cost of land and dwellings in the western suburbs of Sydney at present is nearing $35,000-peopl e will have to pay $249 a month which amounts to $58 a week. If they raise the other $10,000 deposit these people would have to earn $232 a week at a time when average weekly earnings are $184 a week. Therefore we have to make sure that we protect the position of these people by ensuring that terminating building societies do not increase interest rates. This is the great human and social problem of housing in Australia. The Government, by this new arrant centralism, is trying to force on to the States this new formula. Basically it is wrong. I hope that people in Western Australia, who at least can voice their censure on this centralism and high handedness of the Fraser Government which is cutting back once more on the needy people will show their displeasure next Saturday.",24

Firstly I refer to the disgraceful speech we have just heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren). He took a letter, which was written by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Newman) to State Premiers, as the basis of discussion for a new agreement, out of context and has attempted, for blatant political purposes connected with the Western Australian election, to totally misrepresent the Commonwealth Government's position.

They also ought to realise that the Government and the Opposition really have the same basic objective in determining a new housing agreement. A constructive approach ought to be adopted, not this political approach of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who is seeking to make some capital before the next election. He has forgotten that under the former Labor Government much of the tremendous abuse that occurred in this field was allowed to develop through his Party's attitudes and the proliferation of the schemes which his Party failed to properly administer. The second matter is this: I understand that last night on the 7 p.m. news on Canbena television a news reader named Ken Begg said that at the joint meeting yesterday of the Liberal and National Country Parties there was a barrage of foot stomping while matters relating to electoral redistribution were considered and that the state of party room emotions was such as to warrant the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Cabinet looking at the matter again. It is well known that other than the official briefing which is given after party meetings a member of the parties does not make comment on what was said in the party room. He neither confirms nor denies matter that may appear in the Press purporting to relate what was said in the party room. That is a proper rule. It allows full debate in the party room. When claims of these types of activities are made it is quite proper for a member to say that the conduct in the room in no way was anything other than calm, reasoned and sensible. There were no emotional overtones and matters were discussed in a sensible and proper fashion. The person who has given the so-called information to Mr Begg earns nothing more than my contempt. Labor Opposition members throughout last year sought to use statements in the Press about what Liberal or National Country Party members of the House were alleged to have said in party meetings to gain political capital in circumstances in which members could neither confirm nor deny the accuracy of the reports. Those Labor members then and now earn my utmost contempt. The grievance I refer to is the problems of the Botany Bay pon development as it affects truck transportation in the St George electorate. The St George area is a very historic area not only of Sydney but also of Australia. Regrettably it is dis- one of the most environmentally devastated areas. The present State Labor Government has spent a year postponing a previous decision. With some minor variations and the removal at this stage of the coal loader proposal the Government intends going ahead with the development. There are insufficient roads to take the trucks that will add to the already heavy congestion. No proper plan has been provided by the State Government to deal with this problem. It has in fact scrapped the former State Liberal Government's first priority for a main road which might have alleviated the problem. Let me mention the words of 3 State Labor members while they were campaigning in the last State election in New South Wales. The words are contained in an article in the St George and Sutherland Shire Leader which deals with statements made by the members in the House. Mr Crabtree, now a member of the State Labor Ministry, described the Government's Botany Bay project as monstrous. He said that the tion would be decided not on the poltiical colour of candidates but on pledges to protect the The member for Rockdale, Mr Bannon, said residents of Rockdale municipaUty could look forward to non-stop bedlam 24 hours a day if planned development of the Bay goes ahead challenged. Mr Walker, the present Attorneyfor General and a member of Cabinet in New South Wales, said that the Bay project would bring its wake environmental degradation and human misery which could be vaUdly paralleled with senseless destruction of war. Alderman Ryan, the present State member for HurstvUle, is relem ported to have stated at a pubUc meeting in April 1976 that the Botany Bay proposals would have disastrous effects on St George residents. The former State Liberal Government provided in its roads program for the first priority road in that State to be a road called the Kyeemagh to Chullora urban road, designed to take truck transportation away from the area. The Federal Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) recently visited the area and saw the tremendous problems which occur when huge trucks are roads using small residential roads. It is at least as as the Balmain problem and probably worse. It constitutes a very serious environmental and safety hazard. The Minister gave an assurance that funds from the federal coffers would be vided for projects in the area. It is for the State Government to decide where to buUd roads. I not saying that it ought necessarily to Kyeemagh to Chullora road. If it does not buUd that road with moneys that have already been provided, it ought to buUd some other road area to alleviate the problem. There is talk of expired. what is called an industrial road. That road or some other road ought to be built if the Kyeemagh to Chullora road is not buUt. There are 2 ways in which this can be The State Minister for Transport does not appear to be taking any action either way. There be an application for an export road declaration. That apphcation has not been made by the State Government. I am given to understand that former Liberal Government did not make the application because it intended to provide fully from its own funds for that road. The New Southhomes Wales Government should make an apphcation immediately to the Federal Minister for declarbeing ation of a road as an export road. That could provided under the Act. After an apphcation made and approval given for the road to be constructed, it would still take considerable time for the road to be constructed. It would still take 6 elecmonths or more for all the various environmental investigations and approvals and for prearea. liminary plans and engineering plans to be that drawn up. The Agreement expires on 30 June this year, although funds are still avaUable under this year's Agreement. I understand it is quite unpossible for the Labor Government to apply now an export road declaration on the basis that it would be considered once the new legislation in was brought in. The way things are going, the road will not be bunt by the time the port is the operating. The residents are marching backwards in time as far as the environmental probis concerned because, even with the best will in the world, the roads cannot be buUt before the port is open. At the very least, the State Government should make this application. My reading of the Act indicates that it ought to be successful. The Federal Minister does not make the nomination. There must be an application, both on a fair reading of the Act and m accordance with practice. If the New South Wales Government does not intend to apply it must include this road or another read in its ordinary urban arterial program request for the year, which can be bad approved by the Federal Minister. In answer to the question in the House, the Federal Minister undertook to provide funds. If the State Government makes this road its first priority-it is the pro-State Government's province to declare the priority-it would become the first priority once am again. Either the Kyeemagh to Chullora road or buUd the another road is absolutely vital.",25
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Lucock)in the Order! The honourable member's time has,26
77,Mr LES JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"(Hughes) (10.44)The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has drawn the attention of the House to the very serious done. imputations contained in the Government's intention to renegotiate the Commonwealthcould State Housing Agreement. This proposal to increase interest rates on welfare housing loans has caused intense anxiety and alarm throughout the Australia. Low income earners' hopes for adequate housing have been dashed, and those renting or purchasing State housing authority are fearful of a massive upward spiral in rent or repayments in cases where houses are purchased. Let me remind the House of be the history of Commonwealth-State Housing was Agreements. With the limited time at my disposal, I am obviously unable to give the history in detail. It is sufficient to say that successive Liberal-Country Party governments have shown enthusiasm for the States' housing grams for low income earners. They have always kept interest rates for the welfare housing gram at a high level, generally providing only one per cent advantage against the bond rate. the Agreement were changed in terms of tralevel. ditional Liberal-National Country Party policy, the interest rate, which at present stands at cent under the Agreement negotiated by the contractors, Labor Government, would increase to a figure slightly over 9 per cent-to one per cent less the Commonwealth bond rate. That would have disastrous effects on the provision of housing low income earners. Honourable gentlemen will recall that the . pose of the Housing Agreement was to provide adequate accommodation, reflecting economic rentals, to which has been added a rental rebate system for those whose income is exceptionally low. The rebate system varies from State to There is scope to moderate and improve that tem. The primary requirement is that the economic rental system, which I as former Minister theWhat for Housing and Construction encouraged the States to uphold, operates effectively. If it is applied in the proper manner it will ensure that nosaid body whose income rises will be getting a home mission in at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. There double is no need to jettison that scheme. It has provisions which, with some adjustment and ation, can prevent the exploitation of the Australia, said Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and disastrous the housing commission program as we know it. this The Agreement provided that up to 30 per cent of funds went to terminating building societies, at interest rates not exceeding 5A per cent. This is (Mr a very important consideration for that medium will mention income range of people whose income does not of Tasmania accused exceed 95 per cent of average weekly earnings. Another intention of that Agreement was to build up a stock of rental housing so that no more income than 30 per cent of completed homes could be special sold. We wanted young people to have the opposal portunity to pass through the housing comdepartment mission system, to gain the benefit of a low for a considerabletime,enabling them to have every opportunity to save which would enable them, in turn, to raise a deposit for a loan through a bank or a building society. Previously houses were being sold and resold, and something? times bulldozed down to make way forflatsin the inner city suburbs which workers could afford. We had this Agreement with all its virtues. If the Government abandons it, as the Minister for never Environment, Housing and Community proDevelopment (Mr Newman) is apparently contemplating, the effect could be disastrous in promany ways. The housing commissions of the a various States have contrived a tender system If which screws down the cost to a very competitive Probably no private contractor is able to turn out houses more competitively than the 4 per housing commissions are, even using private because that tender system is so tight and competitive, Moreover, if one abandons the than housing commission system and the Housing Agreement one jettisons the benefit of the econfor omic assembly of land processes. Land is bought in parcels. That does not mean that people in housing commission homes have to be congregated together. In Western Australia, a purState which runs its Housing Commission quite effectively-this applies to other States as wellthere is a deliberate policy of mixing the income strata of people by selling some of the land acquired by the Housing Commission so that State. home ownership can take place and the sociosyseconomic groups can be dispersed on that basis. is the reaction of the State Premiers to proposal to raise interest rates in the Housing Agreement? Mr Wran condemned the idea. He it would mean that a typical Housing Comrent of $32 a week would more than 18 months. He said rent for a new Commission house could rise to $80 per week or modermore. Mr Dunstan, the Premier of South that the proposal would have a effect on rents and loans. He said that would put home ownership beyond the reach of a very wide section of the Australian community. The honourable member for Mallee l Fisher) interjects and says that they are all Labor premiers. I have mentioned two of them. I a third Labor premier. Mr Neilson the Federal Government of turning its back on welfare housing for low earners generally. He has called for a Premiers Conference to discuss the prowhich he said would force State housing rents up by as much as $ 12 a week. rental What of the other Premiers? How about their obligation to low income people and to the provision of low income housing? The best that Mr Bjelke-Petersen could say was: 'But let us just wait and see if it happensfirst'.Is that a good That is his extent of concern for low income people. Mr Hayes, the Victorian Governnot ment's spokesman on housing, said that the adoption of the proposal would mean State governments paying 10.5 per cent on money borrowed for welfare housing. At least he is showing concern. Of course, there did not seem to be any response at all in Western Australia. I wonder whether the people of Western Australia, who are to go to the polling booths on Saturday, will have regard for the fact that the Premier of their State has raised no objection at all to this iniquitous proposition which will jack up the cost of Housing Commission homes to such a level that they will be beyond the reach of people seeking them. I wonder whether the people realise that if they want to protect the Housing Commission system and if low income earners are to be given the opportunity of obtaining housing-this group includes many young couples who have not had the opportunity to assemble the deposit-the y will have to vote for a Labor Government in Western Australia. Enormous consequences are involved. A 1 per cent movement in interest rates has an enormous effect. For example, the monthly repayment on $25,000 loan over 20 years at 7 per cent is $ If the interest rate is taken to 8 per cent monthly repayment on this loan is $209. If the interest rate is taken to 9 per cent the monthly repayment is $224. At 10 per cent the monthly repayment is $241. Under the proposal put forward by the Minister, Housing Agreement minuet? interest rates could spiral from 4 per cent to 9 per cent plus. Of course, there is a proposal to introduce a new scheme-the housing assistance voucher experiment scheme, known as the was HAVE scheme. If one had time it would be possKen Begg said: ible to indicate that that scheme is no substitute for the Commonwealth-State Housing AgreeCountry ment. I warn the Parliament that the Governroom today, ment's proposal puts at risk the terminating building society movement in Austraha. I hold in my hand an appeal from the president of that organisation to fight to sustain income housing.",26
78,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, I wonder whether the Western Australian election has anything to do with the Australian Labor Party's interest in housing.,28
79,Mr LES JOHNSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Why shouldn't it?,28
80,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I will tell the honourable member why it should not. Housing is an issue that affects the poor at alltimes-when there are elections and when there are not elections. The Labor Party's sudden interest in the subject leads me be a Uttle cynical. I remind the House of a couple of things. Firstly, the changes in the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement result from recommendations of the Henderson poverty inquiry. I remind the House of the case of a man earning $600 a week, no less, who occupied a $25 a week house to the exclusion of people who were really needy. I remind the House of a Minister of this Parliament in a former government who occupied a State owned house also to the exclusion of the needy. I remind the House that the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) some time ago suggested that it was demeaning for an educated person to do manual work. The honourable member just spoke at some length about people on a medium income. I remind the honourable member that welfare housing is for those who need it-the low income group. My purpose in rising today is to raise another matter that is troubling me. When I spoke to my wife and daughter last night I was greeted with some hilarity concerning the subject of the party room discussions of the Liberal and National a Country Parties yesterday. Apparently one Ken 193. Begg reporting for the Australian Broadcasting the Commission suggested that there was an angry barrage of foot stomping at the meeting. I will quote what he said and then demonstrate to the House how far from the truth he was.",28

82,Mr HYDE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It was neither a square dance nor a minuet, but certainly the tenor of the debate in keeping with square dances and minuets. But the Cabinet was not entirely unsympathetic to the Party's problems and it was proposed in the party that the 20 percent tolerance level should apply to Australia's 7 biggest electorates. This proposal was acceptable to the Cabinet but was not to the Liberal dominated party room which, I am toldassistance for low He was toldgreeted this proposal with an angry barrage of foot stomping.

84,Mr BEAZLEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The stricfrom tures of the honourable member for Moore Hyde) on the Australian Broadcasting Comare mission reporter to whom he referred remind me of a former distinguished person in the AusGeorge tralian Labor Party, the late Frank Anstey. He once ran a newspaper. He gave it a motto which he printed over the leading article which he said was the true motto of every Australian the newspaper. It said: 'The truth will be told to the exclusion of more interesting matter'. Perhaps the ABC has become converted to the look general standards of the Australian Press. I should like to deal with the honourable member's own sUght editing of facts. He spoke about the sudden interest of the Labor Party housing presumably because of this debate. I wish to quote from a statement by the Honourhabit able PhilUp Lynch on advances to the States for housing. I am sure the honourable member for This Moore would not regard the Honourable Phillip Lynch as one who teUs untruths. Here is the 'sudwhat den interest' in the Labor Party in housing. In or 1971-72 the Liberal and Country Parties' adto vances to the States totalled about $4m. In with their agreement still operating, the disfigure became $13m. The Labor Party's first agreement-thei r interest in housing-cam e in House 1972-73 and that $13m became $225m, according to Mr Lynch. In 1974-75 it became $392m. In 1975-76 it was cut by the Hayden Budget to $37lm. The present Government has increased This it by $10m to $38lm. But the Labor Party's housing agreement was of course what the a present Government was implementing. I am quite sure that the honourable gentleman knows that that $ 10m increase, or $1 on $37, being less than a 3 per cent increase, would not keep up and with inflation and would certainly not keep up with inflation of buUding costs. It was no greater Coalition or get housing effort. We have heard therighthonourable member for Lowe (Mr WUliam MCMahon) talking about overseas reserves being at the comfortable level $3,000m and not mentioning that the effect of devaluation is that they have been cut by l2Vi of per cent in purchasing power. Yesterday I on exacted from the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) the first admission that the defence budget has in fact been cut in purchasing power for equipment produced overseas by devaluation because the sum of money appropriated has not been changed. I think it would be a very good thing if in all these matters we stuck to factual Certain State Premiers are under attack because they are alarmed at the terms of a letter the Minister for Environment, Housing and (Mr Community Development (Mr Newman). They entitled to be alarmed at the terms of the Minister's letter. The honourable member for St (Mr NeU) has told us that the terms of the letter are merely proposals. The Premiers are reacting to proposals which seem to them to be damaging-interes t increasing from 4 per cent to bond rate. If they wish tofindout what is the but not philosophy of the present Commonwealth Government on this matter they only have to at what it has done in the Australian Capital Territory. I invite honourable gentlemen to consult Commonwealth car drivers as to what has happened to the level of their rents. I invite them in tofindout what has happened to building society interest rates in this area. There is a growing of untruthfulness in official government statements that is very alarming-untruthfulnes s or suppression. Honourable gendemen opposite, in opposition, were constantly quoting seasonally adjustedfigureson unemployment. It was quite scandalous, when seasonally adjustedfigureson unemployment have been pan of the statistics of the Commonwealth for a long period, for present Government to abolish statistics in that form because they are embarrassing. There is, in the case of overseas reserves, this contant comthe parison of different units. Comparing overseas reserves after devaluation with reserves before devaluation and saying that they have improved when in fact their purchasing power has been is disturbing. But a really scandalous action that of the Minister for Education (Senator Carrick) in the statement that looks like a report on the Independent Schools (Loans Guarantee) Act. Listen to the peculiarity of the wording. number Talking about loans to private schools he states: cost will involved Until 1974 repayments of loans were being made schools by equal annual instalments over a period years. Due to the difficulties that have arisen, ment has now changed the Scheme to reduce the repayment period from 20 years to 10 years, thereby doubling annual rate at which the Government reimburses the f >al payable to the lending institutions and consequently owering the long-term interest burden on schools. That of course was a decision of mine in 1974. far as I know, it immediately cut the interest den on Catholic schools by about $1.5m over period of years. The Minister began by referring to 1974 and then said: The Government has nowThisfitsin nicely to afictionabout ment being particularly concerned to assist the non-government schools and about the Government's predecessors not being concerned. I wrote to all the authorities of the schools. I might plain that the situation was that the Commonmade wealth paid back the capital and paid the interest up to the long term bond rate. If the long term bond rate was 9A per cent and the Catholic edumiracle, cation authorities were paying 1 \Vi per cent had to pay 2 per cent. Obviously cutting the period of the Commonwealth's repayment of the capital from 20 years to 10 years interest burden. That is precisely what I did. Now we have this wording: 'The Government has now decided'. It is rather serious when it a document looking like a report but actually ministerial statement tabled in the Parliament. is this sort of thing which is lowering confidence and the knowledge of State Premiers of what happened in the Australian Capital Territory probably alarmed them. The honest truth about the levels of housing advances made by Liberal-Country Party for governments before Labor came into struck office-$7 m and $ 13m-is that they were mere tokenisms. The MCMahon Government had a marvellous art of getting away with token gestures. Now, when a very seriously increased burden is to fail on a lot of people if the Minister for the Housing's proposed new agreement becomes a fact, we have a token gesture to about 4500 poor as people. At a cost of $ 15m these people will nave capacity to pay the full interest rates and the full rental burdens made possible by grant, which means there will be no Commonwealth action acting as a depressant in the market on the cut rentals coming from low interest advances made is palatable by assistance to these few people's poverty, though the proposition is a good one in itself, if additional to the present scheme. According to the Minister's own statement the is 4500 out of 125 000. The be $15m. It is an experiment, we are to told. Of course the experiment will succeed. Of of 20 course lifting the burden from a poor famUy is the Govern the right thing to do. What about the other the 121 500 people? When is the experiment to be princideclared to have succeeded? WUl it be extended? At a cost of $ 15m for only 4500 famines, what sort of assistance to a widespread social burden As are we talking about? If you extended it to the burwhole 125 000 you would have to multiply the a $ 15m by 28, which would be $420m. So there is a $15m burden being lifted from 4500 people as part of a camouflage for what is being done to raise interest in another field, and on the other 121 500 a burden which would cost $405m to Uft the Governpresumably being left. When an action like this is kept small because it is only an' experiment' it is pathetic. You might exjust as well talk about the 'experiment' that was in properly feeding pregnant Aboriginal women with protein and vitamin supplements by the Presbyterian authorities in Queensland and miracle, miracle. It meant that no clull they dren were born brain-damaged. But according to the Medical Journal of Australia that was done on missions but it was not done on Queensland reduces the Government settlements. This housing 'experiment' will succeed but it could be a camouflage for decisions at the exis in pense of what has been an extremely good Housa ing Agreement in which the Australian Labor It Party vastly increased the Commonwealth's stake in housing the nation-fro m an insighas nificant $13m to somewhere in the vicinity of has $380m for housing. If this agreement is to be tampered with and if interest rates and consequential rentals are to rise, a powerful weapon keeping down general housing costs will be from the hands of the Australian community, and that will be a great tragedy. We in Western Australia are expected to gawp with miration at yachts of millionaire land dealers, reflecting land prices and competingtimeafter another for the America's Cup. I think that demonstrates and reveals a tragedy.",29
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has on expired.,31
86,Mr FISHER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Before bringindustries. ing forward a grievance on behalf of rural people I would like to support my colleagues the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) ment and the honourable member for Moore (Mr we Hyde), in their criticism of the lack of credible reporting by an Australian Broadcasting Comnot mission political commentator. I feel that his comments were fantasy and were totally lacking in informative and accurate reporting. I point out also to the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), who has just spoken, that in my understanding the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) alone did not bring about the change in compiling unemployment's ment figures. The change was made after consuland tation with State Ministers for Labour and themselves, Industry. I believe that no greater imbalance could exist than that which is seen in the prices of petroleum products between rural of the nation and metropolitan areas. Without expounding any economic reasons a substantial case can be advanced on social equality grounds for reintroducing a price equalisation scheme. Acting on the Coombs task force report, the Ausof tralian Labor Party Government destroyed the products petroleum products subsidy scheme that had equivalentatprice been introduced in 1965-66 by a Liberalnational comparison National Country Party government. That action would suggest that petrol has resulted in increasing the cost of fuel by up to This is misleading, as the Australian 35c a gallon above the price paid in metropolitan of motor spirit is considerably less than regions of Australia. It has resulted in sigother countries. For example, in France nificantly increasing the input costs of our rural price, less tax and duties, per gallon is 23.93c, sector and the transport industry on which productive industries so heavily depend. The rural sector uses 19.5 per cent of the total refined petroleum produced, with 21.3 per cent of the product being used in the transport sector which serves it. The purpose of the former petroleum subsidy was simply to reduce fuel prices in nonZealand metropolitan areas to levels closer to city prices. The scheme incorporated an arrangement motorist whereby the Government agreed to pay inland was transportation costs in excess of 3.3c a gallon. Part of the administrative costs of the scheme were borne by the petroleum companies, adwere required to furnish records of rural sales. The administrative expense on the part of the Government was very small. The total cost to the this nation during the term of operation of the scheme was small, averaging $ 18.5m a year. The Industries Assistance Commission report crude oil pricing states that price rises will 'add significantly to the many difficulties currently being experienced by many Australian Some rural industries as major users of fuel and whose ability to pass on cost increases is limited, would be most affected. Our Governhad to give incentives to oil exploration. If do not attract exploration and drilling companies back to Australia we will shortly be faced with price rises in the order of cents but with rises that will double our fuel costs in a few years. Australia has been supplying up to 70 per cent of its annual oil usage. As this percentage has been decreasing, expensive imports have been proportionally forcing our fuel costs higher. The advantages of being able to supply a major proportion of our oil needs was a direct result of our GovernpoUcies. The loss of valuable technology expertise, as with the exploration companies is directly attributable to a total lack of understanding by the previous Labor Government in removing concessions and incentives to huge disparity in the industry. areas It is imperative that the Government takes positive action in line with the report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum. It is imperative also that this action allows the exploitation our potential oU reserves. However, it is essential that Australians receive their petroleum the cheapest possible price and at an throughout the nation. An interof prices at the retail level is cheap in Australia. tax content that in the in the the United Kingdom it is 23.58c while in New Zealand it is 25.9c. In Melbourne the price ex-tax is 32.4c and in Sydney it is 32. lc. A major explanation for the differences in ex-tax prices probably lies in the cost of retaUing. As is pointed out in the royal commission report, in the first part of 1975, at a time when Australian and New currency tax and motor spirit prices were all near parity, the cost of retailing to the from service stations in New Zealand 11.38 per cent of the ex-tax price of 56.2c. In Victoria it was 44 per cent of the ex-tax price of 65.4c and in New South Wales 42.8 per cent of which the ex-tax price. Australian distribution costs are even more starkly highlighted by the followingfigures.In 1974 the approved retail margin in New South Wales was 10.9c per gallon, to which must be added rental charge. This additional rental has been estimated at 7c a gallon, with the result that the true retail margin in New South Wales is nearly 18c a gallon. In New Zealand the retail margin is only 6.3c a gallon-approximately 35 per cent of the New South Wales margin. Despite the high retail margins for the distribution of petrol in Australia, there is no evidence that excessive profits are being earned in retailing by the companies concerned, the lessees or independent retailers. This is because high retail margins are accompanied by high distribution costs. Some years ago a form of trading developed Australia through contracts where dealers agreed to sell one brand of motor spirit only. direct consequence of this the number of retail outlets increased from approximately 11 000 1951 to 21 000 in 1966. This proliferation retail outlets is largely responsible for the cost of retail distribution in Australia. An sis of marketing costs reveals that the cost marketing through a 50 000 gallons a month their station is only 62 per cent of the cost per gallon selling through a 25 000 gallons a month stauon. It should therefore be possible to reduce prices down. by up to 10c a gallon if we ignore the effects of inflationary costs during a rationalisation cess. Such a rationalisation process would also expired. assist service station proprietors in improving their profitability which in general terms has become unrealistically low and has created severe hardships for many retailers. The previous equalisation scheme can be criticised particularly on the ground that it dealt only with transportation costs. The overall price structure could be analysed to determine whether the pre-subsidy prices were justified. Lower retailing costs could reduce the existence of price differentials. It could be that many rural and urban consumers were being charged expossible cessive prices. There is a real need to examine the total rural distribution system. I am quite that the Government will be doing this in context of the IAC examination. However, know that inland transportation costs for mary producers amounted to $ 12.42 a ton or 4. a gallon, which is 3 times the average cost of plying the overall retail network. Analysis also reveals that the combined cost of commission, installation and depots associated with supplying E$4.3rimary producers was $ 17.76 a ton or 5.8c a gal>n compared with Australian-widefigureof a ton. The rural sector is virtually dependent on petroleum fuels. Primary industry is export oriented to approximately 60 per cent and does not have the ability to pass on input costs. The whole trend of agriculture since the war has been towards capital intensification. The general lower standard of farm prices has been countered by increased productivity over the years to the extent that today the industry is basically dependent on petroleum fuels. The House will be aware that in the United States of America and in Canada, our 2 major competitors in agricultural trade, the on-farm price of automotive distillate and gasoline is below the Australian onfarm price even though the price for crude oil in in both countries is approximately twice the crude oil price in Australia. Radical changes must be As a made to rationalise distribution and major inefficiencies in petroleum retailing which would in reduce both rural and urban costs. Incentives of must be allowed to compames in the search to high find and develop local potential. Rural people analycannot be expected to produce the bulk of the of nation's export earning while being penalised by geographical position. A noticeable trend is of developing towards decentralisation. The growth of Sydney and Melbourne is slowing",31
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Lucock)proOrder! The honourable member's time has,32
88,Dr KLUGMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I should like to discuss some of the aspects of what has become known as the 'pathology rip-off or racket' as it has hit the Press during the last couple of weeks or so. I should like to emphasise that this is a longtimeproblem. It is not a recent problem even though it has suddenly hit the news. I became a member of this House at the end of 1969. I had been in medical practice before then. I think it was round about thattimethat pathology laboratories started to develop with automation and with the machines becoming available it was for technicians and pathologists to make large amounts of money. This is, of course, 5 or 6 sure years before Medibank. They were able to get the money from the funds-the Medical Benefit we Fund of Australia Ltd and the Hospital Conpritribution Fund of Australia-and those funds lc were aware of it. There was an organisation in supSydney called Preventicare which offered large benefits to doctors. I do not think that it did any 'kicking back' as it is called these days by actually giving money to the general practitioners who sent them unnecessary pathology work but what this organisation did do was supply comthey puter terminals in doctors' surgeries. It supplied sisters to collect the specimens and the sisters were paid by Preventicare. The sisters were able to do other work for the doctors also. Therefore in effect what the doctor received was, of course, a free member of his staff. Preventicare went broke. I think itfinallyowed about $750,000, mainly to Customs Credit as I recall. The reason Preventicare went broke was that the funds cided not to pay on the money owed for the ology carried out and I suppose that type of thing will tend to happen again. I am not sure what the legal position is. But just delaying payments break those sorts of pathology laboratories. One of the interesting aspects then was that this organisation put computer terminals into doctors' offices thinking that doctors would be very interested not only in the pathology results that would come through the computer terminals but also in the fact that they could get some medical education. They could press a button which would help them in diagnosing conditions and so on. But as I understand it the most popuAustralia lar button to press was one-remembe r that this was in 1970-71- which gave the stock exchange fluctuations on the mining share market at any particular time and that was the button most often pressed in doctors' surgeries as far as computer terminals were concerned. I do not think some of the comparisons are being made at the present time are comhave pletely fair. It is not up to me to defend present Government, but at the same time statements that there has been a doubling in expendiOne ture on pathology from one 6-month period to another a year later are not completely fair cause one is not comparing equals. One is comfront paring a 6-month period at the beginning of Medibank when lots of claims of course were not lodged, with a 6-month period a year or 18 months later which would include a whole 6 months work. I think the important thing to monly'. remember there is that there are all kinds of interest groups feeding information to the newspapers and to the media and they all have an axe to grind. I think that as parliamentarians we are aware that whenever we get information fed to us we have to realise what is in it for person who is reporting that particular item. It is important to remember just what is hapof pening at the present time. There are pathology laboratories run by pathologists-peopl e who that call themselves non-commercial private patholcome ogists; there are pathology laboratories-'com mercial pathology laboratories' as they call themselves-run by non-medical pathologists. If charge the patient the patient cannot receive a reimbursement of that charge from any of the funds. Therefore that charge is made by the general practitioner who has referred the patient to the pathologist unless there is a trained specialist pathologist on the staff. As I understand it, the laboratories pay the general practitioner 20 per cent or 25 per cent off the top. If the general practitioner charges the patient, the depatient of course gets a refund from the fund. pathAlternatively the laboratories have what I referred to earlier- a trained specialist pathologist on the staff who has the accounts sent out in can his name and that particular specialist pathologist is paid 25 per cent or 33 per cent off the top, or at least on the letterhead. But even the so-called non-commercial specialist pathologists who claim to be doing all the work themselves are not doing the work themselves. They employ non-medical technologists, biochemists and so on who do the work. Most of the pathology that is being done in or anywhere for that matter is done by non-medical pathologists but they are specialists. They are specialist non-medical pathologists and they are undoubtedly better able to my mind to do the biochemical tests and most of the tests the that are involved, than most medical pathologists would be. Most medical pathologists in fact would not be able to carry out the tests for which which they charge and which they claim they done. The tests have been done by people the who have had a different training. of the important things that arise from our point of view is the unnecessary expenditure. I benoticed in today's Australian an article on the page by Janet Hawley which gets closer to the facts of the matter than most of the articles that have been written on this topic. She refers in the article to one example of tests which were commonly asked for. I emphasise the word 'comThe article says that one test on a patient included sliver function tests, 5 biochemical, 4 electrolytes, a lipid and cholesterol estimation and 4 enzyme estimations. For that work the refund is $115 under some circumstances. I would argue that that sort of test would be the necessary only very rarely. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) may have had that sort test on a number of occasions recently but very few other people in the community would need battery of tests and for that sort of test to becommon shows that lots of unnecessary tests are being carried out. At the same time, it is important to emphasise that these tests do not hurt the patient. They hurt the patient as payer. They hurt the community as taxpayers cause unnecessary money is going to people but they do not hurt the patient. Once a person has had a sample of blood taken from him he does capital not care what they do with that sample and only one sample of blood is collected. I will compare that with unnecessary surgery which is performed on pauents where there is a throughout definite risk involved as far as the patient is conthe cerned. One of the interesting things that arise osition from this is that the Australian Medical Association, which is now being active about this caUed racket is far as pathology is concerned, Games. accuses doctors of doing things for money and awarded states that they are acting in a completely comtrans-shipment mercial way. It has always previously argued that it could not possibly imagine doctors performing unnecessary surgery or performing any incapable unnecessary medical work just for the money. Commonwealth According to the AMA that just was not possible Even with the high ethical standards of the Australian medical profession. It is interesting now, suddenly, when it affects other doctors' incomes the so-caUed private non-commercial Australia pathologists through then* association with the The forecasts doctors agree that this is going on and that docbeen made. Brisbane tors are prepared to order unnecessary pathology capita usage of any airport just for the sake of getting an extra income. I than Canberra but the evidence think it is important for this House to be aware the real facts behind this issue. It is a difficult to deal with and I wish the Minister success trying to cut down expenditure on pathology tests. At the same time, he should not forget that as long as we have fee for service payment for medical services this sort of practice will continue and the only way to deal with it is to abolish fee for service payments.",32
89,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My order remarks this morning wiU be in relation to Brispassengers. bane Airport. It is a subject which has attracted the notice of many people throughout my State for some years. A number of facts in relation to that airport have come to light which disturb greatly. More tests have been done, more prom-equivalent ises have been made concerning the proper development of the airport than in relation to its any other major city capital airport in Australia. Those tests and promises have continued from the middle 1960s to the present day. Precise promises were made in 1971-72. Promises were made by the previous Government in 1973. The Coombs report and other determinations were utilised to try to wish the promises out of existthrough ence. Circumstances have now come to my notice which make it quite clear that that airport is a taxincapable of functioning properly and combepletely even as a domestic airport. Those facts are serious. Brisbane has the third city airport in Australia. It is the quickest growing airport in terms of traffic. The movements of domestic and international passengers have consistently exceeded the target levels. That happened even last year when passenger traffic Australia fell significantly shon of projected levels. Therefore, the first propI make is this: Unless there is a new runway development that airport will be incapable soof handUng the traffic for the Commonwealth The Commonwealth Games have been to Brisbane. If that city is not merely to become a secondary and subsidiary airport for of passengers to and from international nights to other airpons in Australia it is of handUng the traffic. I refer to the Games held in Perth in 1962. if there were the same type of increase in traffic as occurred then at Perth, Brisbane could to note that not cope. It is unsatisfactory that the third airport in would be incapable of doing the job. of the rate of growth of traffic have Airport has the highest per in Australia other in respect of ofdomestic usage of the airport is overwhelming. oneis clear that even domestic Boeing 727 aircraftIt in are not able to utilise that airport with their all-up weight. I should Uke to read some data into Hansard which I believe is extremely important. In light to variable wind conditions at Brisbane Airport at 28 degrees centigrade which applies in the area for most of the year-it is a modest temperature- a domestic Boeing aircraft has to fall 2600 lb short of its take-off weight into function. That is equivalent to 12 to 13 At 30 degrees centigrade with similar wind conditions or no wind conditions a domestic aircraft using the present runway with its incorrect configuration has to be 4600 lb short of me its all-up weight for take-off purposes. That is to 21 to 22 passengers. At 32 degrees centigrade it would be 8000 to 9000 lb short of full take-off weight. At only 2 capital city airports are such restrictions required. Darwin, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney do not have them. Only Brisbane and Adelaide have them and Brisbane is the third busiest capital city airport. Last year nearly 2 500 000 passengers went that port. I suggest to the Government that the situation at Brisbane Airport with that number of passengers and with the responsibUity of being the number one airport and the only significant international airport in Queensland is totally unsatisfactory. It has always been known to me and to others that it is incapable of functioning adequately as an international port. Boeing 747 aircraft on international nights which are fully loaded with passengers have to shed fuel, drop down at Sydney and then proceed overseas. There is no way in the world that that situation is justifiable for what should be an international airport, certainly for the holding of the Commonwealth Games. I will give some data in respect of Boeing 747 jets. With nil or normal wind conditions across the runway, at 28 degrees centigrade those planes have to drop 116 000 lb in their take-off weight. At 30 degrees centigrade they have to drop just on 122 000 lb in their take-off weight. At 34 degrees centigrade, a temperature which is experienced in Brisbane quite often, they have to drop 133 000 lb. No one should pretend that in those circumstances the airport comes even close to functioning as a justifiable international terminal.",34
90,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,How many extra on the runway are needed?,35
91,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"An extra on the runway would not solve the problem because it would not take account of the correct wind conditions. They are such that the runway has to be new and tilted as an old runway wastiltedmany years ago. Even a Boeing 707 has to be over 40 000 lb short of its take-off weight at 28 degrees centigrade. At 30 degrees centigrade it has to be 45 000 lb short and at 34 degrees centigrade it has to be 51 600 lb short. The gravamen of my remarks is that judgment on the use of that airport depends upon a judgment as to its runway. I beheve that all other airport conditions are secondary to satisfactory runways. For domestic functioning Brisbane runway cannot do the job. A most common domestic plane in Austraha, the Boeing 727, always has to function with less take-off weight than the maximum which it can have at all other capital city airports other than Adelaide. We know the difficulties Adelaide sometimes has with passengers travelling between that port and Perth. I suggest that the Government make it a top priority in airport construction to upgrade and recast the runway in the direction that has been promised.",35

Customs TariffProposals No. S (1977). The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos. 1 to 3 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by Gazette notices during the last recess. These proposals implement the Government's decision, which I foreshadowed to honourable members in this House on 7 December last year, to take action in selected areas either to remove temporary assistance or to reduce tariff levels where such reductions would not have adverse effects on local industry. In addition, the tariff changes arising from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on agricultural tractors are included in Proposals No. 2. Proposals No. 4 amend the Customs Tariff Act 1966 to meet the duty commitments undertaken by Australia in the recently signed Agreement on Trade and Commercial Relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Proposals No. 5 give effect to the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on: Calcium carbide; and copper foil; primary shapes produced by rolling, drawing, extruding of non-ferrous metals.

102,Mr MCLEAY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Boothby-Minister for Construction and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (12.45)-I move : That the Bill be now read a second time. I point out by way of explanation that the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) is in Western Australia on Government business and I am introducing this Bill in his absence. The purpose of the Bill is to increase pension benefits payable under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948 and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973. Honourable members will recall that my colleague, the Minister for Defence, made brief reference in this House on 9 December last to the proposed introduction of the necessary legislation in the autumn session of the Parliament to give effect to the Government's pension increases undertakings. The Bill provides for pension increases payable in respect of the year 1976-77 to apply retrospectively to the first pension pay day in July 1976. Additionally, provision is made for the automatic annual adjustment of pensions in future years to operate also from thefirstpension pay day in July of each year. The need for separate Acts of Parliament which has charactensed the annual pension increases granted since 1973, will, I am pleased to announce, no longer be necessary. The increases in defence forces retirement benefits and defence force retirement and death benefits pensions for the year 1976-77 and in the future will be related to the percentage increase in the consumer price index during the period of 12 months ending 31 March immediately preceding the date of effect of each annual adjustment. The pension adjustment factor for 1976-77 which derives from the movements in the consumer price index during the yearended 31 March 1976 is 13.4 per cent. The adjustment provisions incorporated in the Bill are detaUed and complex. I propose therefore to explain in broad terms only how they are to operate. A more detaUed explanation of their practical effects will be made avaUable to beneficiaries by the Defence Force Retirement and BusiDeath Benefits Authority when the increased rates of pension become payable. For DFRB pensioners, that is those who retired prior to 1 October 1972, the amount of the increase will be determined by applying the relevant pension adjustment factor to the total pension payable as BILL 1977 at 30 June of each year. Pensions payable to widows and the additional pension payable in respect of eligible children wdl be adjusted on the same basis. DFRDB pensioners-thos e Second Reading retired since 30 September 1972-wh o are in receipt of retirement pay, are to receive increases by applying the same pension adjustment factor to an amount that represents the amount of retirement pay remaining as if the member had commuted to the fullest possible extent following his retirement. Pensions payable to the widows of DFRDB retirement pensioners will be adjusted by applying the pension adjustment factor to that proportion of the widow's pension that bears the same ratio as the member's residual pension, or notional residual pension as the case may be, to his total retirement pay at retirement. DFRDB invaUdity pensions, and the pensions payable to the widows of deceased contributors and of invalidity pensioners are to be adjusted in full. Appropriate adjustments will also be made to the additional component of pensions payable to children. In essence, therefore, the pension updating arrangements encompassed by this Bill achieve the earlier stated aim of consistency with those currently applying to comparable classes of pensioners under the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation schemes. It was intended also to provide in this Bill beneficial amendments to section 25 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act designed to remove an anomaly affecting certain officers who were detrimentally affected by their transfer to the DFRDB scheme in Ocotber 1972. Drafting of the necessary amendments has raised a number of complex technical drafting difficulties. The pension updating provisions are therefore being introduced now and drafting of the amendments to section 25 of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act is proceeding for introduction as quickly as possible into the House. I take the opportunity of mentioning that the Government is currently considering a number of beneficial variations to the existing legislation arising from a general review of the reversionary benefits structures of the DFRB and DFRDB schemes. I can assure the House that when the Government has made its decisions, proposed amendments will be introduced as soon as possible. I commend the Bill to the House.

104,Mr NEWMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development) (2.15)-May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I suggest it might suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Bill and the Constitution Alteration (Referendums) Bill as they are associated BUls. Of course, separate questions will be put on each of the BUls at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 4 BUls to be discussed in this debate.",37
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 4 BUls? There being no objection, I shaU allow that course to be followed. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (2.16)-The Opposition supports all 4 BUls. I found the arguments of the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) compelUng, not least because I have advanced them myself in this place over 2 decades, in opposition and in government. The 4 proposals have become steadUy more relevant and in 1975 they became urgent and crucial. Ten years ago when my Party was in opposition and I had just become its leader we supported the referendums put by the Holt Government. My Party wiU take the same attitude towards these referendums. We have not been soured by the attitude which our opponents took to the proposals which we put to the people when we were in government and which they are now putting to the people whUe they are in government. My Party sees no nuleage in wrecking referendums. Our opponents now realise that too. The first Bill proposes an amendment to the Constitution to provide for simultaneous elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives. This recommendation was made to the Parliament by the Constitutional Review Committee in 1958 and again in 1959. The Committee was drawn from both Houses- 8 members of this House and 4 senators. It was drawn from all parties- 6 members from the Labor Party, 4 members from the Liberal Party and 2 members 1977 from the Country Party. On many occasions in the 1960s in each House the matter was brought Second Reading on for debate. An almost identical Bill was passed twice by the House of Representatives in the Parliament elected in 1972 and thus the proposal was able to be submitted and was submitted to the electors in May 1974. It was approved by a majority of the electors in New South Wales and was rejected, but only narrowly, by the electors in the other 5 States-and by the electors of the 6 States as a whole. It again was passed twice by the House of Representatives elected in 1974. It could have been submitted to the people in December 1975 but inexplicably was not. Whatever doubts there may be about the Governor General's powers in other respects, there can be doubt about his powers to submit a referendum to the electors in the circumstances which obtained at that time. The proposal was relevant when made by the Constitutional Review Committee in 1958 in the aftermath of the double dissolution in 1951, which produced separate elections for the Senate in 1953 and for the House of Representatives in 1954. After the Committee made its report the matter was given renewed relevance by the to premature House of Representatives elecuon in 1963. The proposal clearly has increased November relevance in the aftermath of the double dissolsible-i utions in 1974 and 1975. I notice that the objection has been raised outGovernors side this House that this referendum will cost some money. In fact, if this referendum is carpective ried, it will every 3 years save at least as much it costs to hold the referendum. If this referenate dum is carried, instead of having 2 elections for this Parliament every 3 years there will be, as was originally intended, only one election for this Parliament every 3 years. That means that every 3 years we will save at least as much as it will to hold this referendum. If the best can be made to this referendum is that it will money, there is no substance in any objections that can be made to this or any other of the referendums. Whatever might have been said previous occasions, I suggest that there could no valid objection to putting this referendum to passing it. One relevant issue will be solved by this ment referendum. It would not have been thought to which fare have been a problem until the end of 1975. The request.the Constitution provides that the writs for a Senate election in each State shall be issued by the Governor of that State. Until 1974 Governors of fore there the States had always issued writs for Senate ment elections in their States on a date requested of the them by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. There was every justification and every precedent for an election for half the Senate at the end of 1975. The of the Liberal Party, however, passed a resolution on 13 October 1975 calling on the Federal and State parUamentary parties and Liberals everywhere to do all in their power to prevent Whitlam Government gaining control of Senate. This was an instruction to non-Labor Premiers to advise their State Governors not issue writs for an election of half the Senate they were requested by the Governor General to do so. From the time of thefirstSenate election State the governments of every political complexion had would automatically issued Senate writs as and when requested by the Federal government. Prime would Minister Menzies called separate elections for would now half the Senate in 1953 and 1964. Prime Minister have an orderly Holt did so in 1967 and Prime Minister Gorton Houses of this Parliament in 1970. Those elections were held chosen by the Federal government of the day. Moreover, on each occasion the Prime Minister announced his intention to Parliament-to this House-befor e advising the Governor General request the State Governors to issue the writs. Courteously, but imprudently, I did not do so in 1975. It is quite clear that it is post has always been clear that it has been possible-for State governments to advise their to issue writs for a Senate election at a time when the State governments seefit,irresof the views of the Federal government. asThe Constitution says that elections for the Sencan be held at any time within 12 months before the elected senators take office. To take the current situation, under the Constitution Senate elections could be held on any Saturday this July or at any time up to the end of June next year. cost The elections could be held on different objection that Saturdays in every State. cost A State government may feel that the candidates of its party may not fare as well on the date proposed for a Senate election by the Federal on Government via the Governor General and the be State Governor as they would fare on a later date and and may therefore advise the State Governor to issue the writs for a later date. A State governmay feel that the candidates of its party might better at an earUer date than that Federal Government is expected to The State government might therefore advise the State Governor to issue the writs beis a Federal request. A State governmay even feel that its party's candidates may not secure a majority at any election before time when the terms of retiring senators expire and may therefore not issue the writs at all and thus, as the Constitution permits, leave the Federal Council positions vacant. These 3 situations which I have stated are all possible as the Constitution stands at present. They would be a travesty. They would have been the unthinkable before the last quarter of 1975, but the the proposition was made by the supreme organisation of one of the two great political to parties in this country in October 1975. It is if clearly an unsatisfactory situation which should not be allowed to continue. This referendum will permit this Parliament to pass laws concerning dates upon which Senate elections can be held. One would assume that the Parliament only pass an act which said that the dates passed, all be the same. If this referendum is as in this House I conceive everybody proclaim and advocate, we shall succession of elections for both at the sametime.It at a time will be a more rational, a less more contemporary procedure. expensive and a The second Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill, is designed to write into the Constitution the principle casual Senate vacancy should be filled by a member of the same poltiical party as the one to which the former senator belonged at the time his election and for the balance of the term of former senator. Here again this proposition was accepted by aU seven governments in Australia as far back as 1951 on thefirstoccasion a casual vacancy occurred after proportional introduced in the election of the Senate. After that time every casual vacancy until 1974 filled by a State government and then by a State parliament by a man or a woman belonging to the same party as the former senator, however the former senator ceased to be a senator. The Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1958 and 1959 unanimously that principle. It has been endorsed ever since by everybody who has considered it. It was in fact tor endorsed by our own Senate early in 1975. The Council, question was regarded as academic until The events of that year are in the minds of all members of this Parliament and on science I would trust of aU members of the Government parties. It can no longer be said that the question is an academic one because in 1975 ber the convention was twice dishonoured. I believe cil on this issue, as on so many issues which arose in became 1975 in this Parliament or on the part of persons worthy appointed by the Government responsible to this House, the words of the honourable and learned Wales member for Moreton, the present Minister for so MrLegislative Defence (Mr Killen) are succinct and apposite. Assembly. He said: If in their anxiety for power men lose sight of great ciples they put at risk the safety of their institutions. Accordingly it is gratifying that this Bill is being put forward. I beheve that every member in each become House of any principle, every member who has ing regard for the safety of our institutions, for the Bill and outside will give it his support. The Bill in fact is in the form moved by my coUeagues at the Hobart meeting of the Constitutional Convention last October. The majority of the delegates to the Convention supported an amendment moved by Sir Charles Court which would have excluded the operation of the convention and of the proposed Bill whenever a senator ceased to be a senator other than by death or incapacity. A few at the Convention even opposed Sir Charles Court's amendment as well as the original motion which now forms the basis of this Bill. At the Convention Sir Charles Court accused me of denigrating the Senate. I was at some pains to dispel any such notion. Since at the Convention my remarks on this issue seemed to receive that a more support than my remarks on any other issue perhaps I may recall them to the House. I suggested then that Sir Charles Court, not I, was of denigrating the Senate and senators by his the amendment because he was saying in effect that senators even if well-suited and qualified should not become judges, ambassadors, high commissioners or administrators. I did not and I do voting was not accept that proposition. Mr Donald Cameron-Vinc e Gair is a good was example. He was an excellent ambassador. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I knew that somebody would make that interjection because it was made at the Convention by a fellow Queenslander and dear friend of the honourable gentleman who interjects, a Mr Frawley, MLA. I endorsed believe myripostewas apposite: The interjection came from a Queenslander. The interjecwould be worthy of being a member of the Legislative the upper House of Queensland, which, of course, 1975. expired more than SO years ago. I asked the Convention to draw a parallel with the conState governments. I said: It is not so long ago that Sir Charles Court's own party in the Victorian Parliament found there was no worthy memamong them in the Legislative Assembly to succeed Sir Henry Bolte as Premier. They went to the Legislative Counand demoted the honourable R. J. Hamer, MLC, and he Premier. Not only that, there was no adequate or Liberal in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria to become Deputy Premier so they demoted the honourable Lindsay Thompson, MLC. In my party in the New South Assembly there is a host of talent, but even Wran, MLC, was demoted to the Legislative I come back to Federal Parliament. Not long ago there prinwas no adequate or worthy Liberal MHR to be Prime Minister. Senator Gorton was demoted to the lower House. Under Sir Charles Court's amendment, the best man in the Liberal Party, as Senator Gorton undoubtedly was, could not have Prime Minister. Are we to denigrate senators by saythat even if among them is the worthiest man to become Prime Minister of our country he cannot be appointed to that will vote post? Of course he should. I continue with my quotations from the Convention: Regarding Judges, are we to say it is acceptable for Mr Higgins, MHR, or Mr Isaacs, MHR, or Sir Garfield Barwick, MHR, to be appointed to the High Court, or Mr Latham, MHR, to resign with the prospect of being appointed on the High Coun, or Mr Joske, MHR, or Mr Nigel Bowen, MHR, to resign to be appointed to other courts, but wonhy lawyers in the Senate are never to be appointed to the High Coun? At the Constitutional Convention I said: I thought that Senator Spicer was an admirable appointment as the founding Chief Judge of the Australian Industrial Coun and that Senator Murphy would prove to be the Oliver Wendell Holmes Junior of the Australian High Coun. I am pleased I have such universal approbation for my assessment of these matters. I referred to the appointment of Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin as High Commissioner to New Zealand, which was an admirable appointMCTiernan ment. Her term was extended by my Governculated ment. She had the complete trust of Mr Kirk myself. During the penod that she was a senator one member of this House had been appointed High Commissioner to New Zealand, Dr Donald Cameron; three had been appointed High Comthe missioners to Britain, Sir Thomas White, Sir Harrison and Sir Alexander Downer; and regarded another had been appointed High Commissioner to Malta, Sir Hubert Opperman. From this House 7 members have been appointed ambas-justices sador- Mr Spender and Mr Beale to the United States, Mr Gullett to Greece, Mr MACKinnon to Argentina, Uraguay and Peru, Mr Roberton Ireland, Mr Freeth to Japan and Mr Fairbairn The Netherlands. If they had been senators, cording to the majority view at the Convention, they could not have been properly appointed. Joshua Francis and Mr Roger Dean were appointed Consul and Consul-General. Mr Dean, Mr Chaney and Mr England have been appointed Administrator of the Northern Territhrough tory. The best a senator could ever be was ministrator of Norfolk Island-Senator this Wordsworth. Above all, Mr Hasluck became Governor General. If he had been a senator, under Sir Charles Court's amendment, it would not have been a proper appointment. At the for Convention I said: If the best man or woman for any of these jobs found in the Senate or the Legislative Council, he should be eligible for that appointment. I am glad that my remarks which did not perwhich suade the Convention have now persuaded the Government. This Bill is worthy of our support. The third referendum Bill proposes to amend the Constitution to provide a maximum years ago. retirement age for justices of the High Court and of other Federal courts. This might not have been regarded as a matter of great moment the judges affected consisted only of those High Court, of whom there have never been more than seven, or even when thefirstFederal one court, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy, was appointed. No Chief Justice has died in office they have all retired in the fullness of age. Griffith retired at 74; Knox at 67; Isaacs retired at 76 and Uved to 93; Gavan Duffy retired at and lived to 88; Latham retired at 75 and 87; Dixon retired at 78 and Uved to 86. The present Chief Justice is already 73. Of the or associate justices, only three have fore they reached 70-Evatt at 46, WUliams and Kitto at 67. Powers retired at 76, Starke 79, Rich at 87, Webb at 71, Windeyer at 72 and at 84. Few occupations appear so calto preserve one's mental powers and E and hysical stamina. The first Federal Judge in ankruptcy Mr Justice Lukin, died in office in 1944 at the mature age of 76. He had been appointed a Federal Judge after retiring from Supreme Court of Queensland. These statEric istics might be notable but would not be as necessarily justifying amendment of the Constitution. Nevertheless, now there is a large number of Federal judges. There are 27 of the FamUy Court of Australia, all appointed in the last year and a few months. to Mr Ellicott-As at today that is the number. to Mr E. G. Whitlam-As at today, yes. I achave no doubt that we will have to amend the regulations to permit an extension beyond 30. Sir Mr Ellicott-We do not know what the position will be by the end of next week. Mr E. G. Whitlam-We will get the Bill before the appointments are made. The AdFederal Court now has 19 judges. Accordingly, is now a matter of real moment. It is one of those matters in which the position could be altered by a change in opinion on the High Court. High Court and Federal judges hold office life because of a decision given in 1918 that because at the time our Constitution was drawn up judges in England held office for Ufe, there is to before, judges mentioned in our Constitution, or she which is a British Act of Parliament, held office for Ufe. The High Court could alter its interpretation. It has altered its interpretation of matters have been undisturbed for longer than the period between 1918 and now-for instance the corporations power, the most ferule of aU the powers, in the light of Attorney-General Hughes's admirable and successful advocacy 5 Mr Ellicott-You do not mention his junior. when Mr E. G. Whitlam-I believe that at that on the time the honourable and learned gentleman gave immense service to his country and I was of the first to applaud it. Clearly it is wise to put this amendment to the people at the same but time as the others. It deserves support. I would imagine that there can be no rational opposition to High Court justices and other Federal justices 83 having a retiring age, as aU other judges in Uved to Australia have long had, appUed to them. puisne Mr Donald Cameron-You made an excellent retired bespeech on this subject in 1955. at 69 Mr E. G. Whitlam-That is quite true. I am at indebted to the honourable gentleman for his second interjection. As a matter of fact, I was paid the immense compliment on that occasion by the then Prime Minister, my most disthat tinguished living predecessor, coming into House to hear me and asking me out for approtraUan priate hospitality afterwards. The fourth Bill proposes to give electors in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern he Territory a vote in future referendums. This is opinion surely an irrefutable proposition. support also. There are three points I might House ofarguments make on it. It is clear, from we are debating, that it is Ukely that the Northern Territory, when it becomes a State, will have a functionary named a Governor, either appointed or elected. At least he will not be British official, as aU present State Governors are, bearing a commission signed by the Queen of Britain and countersigned by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. Perhaps the second point is that this may not be the last amendment of the Constitution which will bear upon the Territories. On 1975, in the case of WA v. the Commonwealth, the High Court by a majority rejected suits against the Commonwealth brought by Western and Australia and New South Wales challenging the desirabUity validity of the Federal electoral legislation, and mit this Parliament by Queensland seeking a declaration Senate (Representation of Territories) Act was the High Court, and toother beyond power. Victoria intervened in support of vision for retirement at make the objectors. We therefore had at that time conservative governments in Australia-mind , as recently as 1975-objectin g to the Territories ations where the Constitution is explicit or situhaving senators. More recently on thefirstof this month in the case of the Attorney-General for New South Wales at the Relation of MCKellar v. the Compermit monwealth, and Others the States of Western Australia and Queensland again raised, but did not argue, their earUer chaUenge to therightof the Territories to have' senators. The Chief Juswith tice, stiU sulking from his rebuff by his brethren in the earUer case, invited a further challenge. It is important that we should have this referendum put to the people-at this stage it only be put to the electors of the States-and let the electors of the States say that when there referendum the electors in the Territories also should be able to vote on those referendums. This will discourage these challenges to the people of the Territories having representation the Senate or even in this House. The third point, which I raised at the Constitutional Convention, concerns Australian citizens in the overseas Territories of Norfolk Island, Cocos Island and Christmas Island. (Extension of time granted) I thank the House. I speculated Sir John Nimmo as Royal Commissioner on the Norfolk Island might recommend that the Auscitizens of Norfolk Island should be given a vote for this House. In fact, since then Sir John 's report has been tabled and pubUshed and did so recommend. I also vouchsafed the that in respect of Cocos Island and Christmas Island there are powerful interIt deserves our national for giving votes for the Representatives to the citizens who the batch of BUls thatreside there. This Bill, if carried by electors of the States, a will permit the Australian citizens in those overseas Territories-I imagine honourable members and honourable senators and the great majority of Australian citizens everywhere, including in those Territories, would wish them to remain Territories of this country-to vote in any future referendums. So I suggest that this fourth Bill 17 October also deserves our support. All 4 BUls deal with issues of real importance growing urgency. I have mentioned the of amending the Constitution to perto set a retirement age for that the future federal judges, than the justices of 70 constitutional proyears of age for justhe 4tices of that court. There is a necessity the Constitution to deal with the otherto3 amend convention has been dishonoured. In these cases change is required. There is no way that the High Court can interpret the present Constitution to the changes sought by these other 3 BUls. It will be noted that none of the BUls deals the legislative powers of this Parliament. I must confess that I have become reluctant to ask the electors to expand the legislative powers of this Parliament. I reaUse that the High Court has usuaUy been more readUy persuaded to aUocate can legislative powers between the Federal and State legislatures. None of the BUls, for instance, even is a deals with the interchange of powers between the Federal and State Parliaments although that was suggested in 1973 by the conservative governments in New South Wales and Victoria in and applauded at the'Sydney meeting of the Constitutional Convention by those States and by the representatives of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, and was not even opposed there by the representatives of the Queensland Government. None of the Bills deals with the structure State legislatures, although in respect to cratic safeguards their constitutions except possshould ibly South Austraha and in one respect-term s office-N.S.W . such safeguards are becoming more necessary. The Bills deal with the structureshould of the Federal legislature and the Federal diciary. They in no way affect the States except where the States have intruded into matters which concern this Parliament, to wit, casual vacancies in the Senate and the issue of writs the Senate. The Bills conspicuously avoid giving an ounce of provocation to any State party. present Government has abandoned earlier proposals to ratify actions of the Senate and the Governor General in October and November happy 1975. The present Opposition has refrained fromno dilating on some remarkable conversions on the issues and from speculating on the Government's motives in deferring the Senate elections. The whole tenor in which the matter has so farObviously been dealt with in this House, would, I believe be calculated to secure a rational and relevant aplarge proach to matters of real relevance and increasAustraUa ing urgency. My Party hopes support these 4 referendums. Whatever governtralian peoplethat ment the people hereafter elect Representatives, whatever members the people have already beenidentical hereafter elect to this Federal Parliament, Federal Parliament and Government will be and circumstances are different. able to operate in a more rational, contemporaryimportant. and constructive way than the Parliament and governments have been able to operate hitherto. The BUls should be supported in the Parliament; they should be supported outside the Parliament. I do not believe that any Party in Australia canthe gain anything from the rejection of any of these BUls.",37
106,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There are few accept occasions when I rise in this House following Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) that I find myself in substantial agreement with most of what he has said. This is one of those occasions. There are, of course, in the electorate at large a good many divided views about the also character and the manner of the Australian Conof stitution, in terms both of its relationship individuals and of the necessity for change. Emodate. tions are very easUy generated when we speak ofwhich altering the Australian Constitution. Those of on this side of the House certainly believe that the Constitution was the basis behind which survival of democracy was achieved after 1975. There are still many people who look appreproposals. hensively at the Constitution, beUeving that the inherent rights that our forebears, who in some cratic way. of way they believe were more wise than those of us demowho succeeded, wrote down so many years ago inevitably survive without modification. I ofam quite sure it was never in the minds of those who wrote the original Constitution that that be so. The very inclusion of section 128 of juthe Constitution indicates that there was an intention to provide for change and for circumstances of change which it was expected would follow perhaps much the same consultative forcourse as the original Constitution conventions or, if not in that way, then in the submission of Thequestions specifically to the people. Referenda in Australia have not had a very history. So few have been passed. There is need for me to repeat this afternoon the abysmal record of success of referenda. When I say 'abysmal', it does not necessarily mean, because a question goes to the people, that it needs to be supported by the whole Australian electorate. there are differing views between the States and the smaU States and there are different ideological views among the people of as to the substance of the questions. In that the people will the questions are to be submitted to the Ausunder this legislation there are 2 in this House ofquestions almost with questions that the and rejected, but they are not in submitted earUer referenda entirely identical That is quite Thefirstand most important thing I want to say about the submission of these questions to people is that there seems to be almost an apprehension in the minds of some people and a belief that there should be no reference of questions to the people. I believe that to be quite It is essential that the Australian people that there are legitimate occasions when thethey should be entitled to cast their views on suggested change, particularly change to the Constitution, which written as it is prescribes so raremuch of the terms and conditions within which our Federal Government can operate. There is to be a poll on a national song. It is not part this measure, but the necessary legislation is to intended to come before the House at a later Again this will be a very worthwhUe way by the people of Australia can cast their views us on a matter of significant pubuc concern. I mention it because there should be no concern in the theminds of those around Australia who are apprehensive about the character of these referendum There is nothing wrong in their being asked to vote. It is a necessary part of our demoThe second thing I want to do is look at the way by which these 4 questions come before us this afternoon. They have not been submitted just as a matter of a government decision. When two of these matters were submitted last to the Australian people in 1974 they had not emerged as a result of the Constitutional Convention, although the Convention had its first meeting in Sydney on 3 September 1973. A good deal of discussion was still underway. There were two subsequent sessions of the Convention. The one in Melbourne was not very well attended but the other two in Sydney and Hobart, the Hobart meeting being late last year, were attended by representatives of all parliaments, by representatives of both federal and State levels of government, by representatives of local government and by representatives of both sides of both chambers in those States where there are 2 chambers. On those 2 occasions there were two very widely represented groups of people. There were not just lawyers, people who represented only a particular profession within the community, but people from all stratas of society representing local government, State government and Federal government, Federal Parliament and State parliaments. They came together and they met. Something like 20 resolutions were affirmed by the last session of the Australian Constitutional Convention staged at Wrest Point in Hobart from 27 to 29 October. The 4 questions which are the subject matter of these 4 Bills emerged as a result of the very substantial, near unanimous, agreement on these 4 proposals. Some slight modifications have been made to the form of words. Perhaps I might refer to those directly, although the Leader of the Opposition has already referred to them. For example, in the casual Senate vacancy instance, as a result of an amendment moved by the Premier of Western proposal. Australia there was a modification of the original question. This modification, referred to by my isHigh colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), suggestion flowed from what was seen to be an almost perhaps if there impossible task of writing into some of words a condition known as bonafideillness, the appointments to be itdelayed as it was described in the amendment. In any passage of this Bill accelerated.somewhat event, in my opinion it is far more desirable that if the convention is to exist it should exist across ceptance the breadth of casual appointments rather than any way affect in a narrow sphere only. These 4 questions emerged not just as a uct of a decision by this Government, not cause two of them have been before the people before, but because the Australian Constitutional Convention on three successive occasions led towards an acceptance of these 4 resolutions, which was achieved finally at the Wrest Point convention. In that sense there needs to be a recognition by those who might question these referenda that throughout the country there seems to be a universal accord that this type of deliberation on the Constitution is worthwhile; that if there is to be constitutional change it should not be just for the fulfilment of the political aspirations, desires or objectives of the Government for the time being in Canberra but it should be something that has evolved from the consultation at the Constitutional Conventions. I think the authenticity of the origin of these questions must be accepted. The fact that they were so significantly supported at the Convention adds further weight to the case for referring them to the people and I hope they will receive the support of the people. I would like briefly to turn to each of the 4 questions. There are two which I believe must be accepted by the Australian people without controversy. The first is the question of alteration of the Constitution so as to provide for a retiring age forjudges of Federal courts. It really brings the circumstances of the judiciary into parallel with those of other members of the community. While there might be some question as to the age that is to be provided for, the age decided on is again a direct product of the Constitutional Convention. It was felt that the age of 70 years was appropriate. Of course many people over that age can still have full possession of their mental faculties, but the incredible record of longevity of members of the Federal judiciary read out by the Leader of the Opposition indicates that normally on retirement members of the High Court and other Federal courts have been considerably older than people in other professions. It is significant that we look at the form of this We should realisefirstthat no change to be effected on any present incumbent of the Court or other Federal courts. Hence the by the Leader of the Opposition that are Family Court judges or other legal form judges to be appointed might be desirable for It is or the necessary that we recognise that neither this Bill nor the acof this question at a referendum will in the incumbency or term of office of those who are currently Federal court judges prodor High Court judges. Nor will it affect the beappointment and continuation in office of any present incumbent of Federal courts or the High Court subsequently appointed to a more senior position either by transfer from a Federal court to the High Court or elevation from the Federal courts or the High Court to the position of Justice. There is no suggestion that in any way the independence of the judiciary is being threatened by this question but a more rational and generally acceptable age of retirement is being set. There could and should be no oppowas sition to that question. The second question which I think is equally likely to be accepted without criticism, although know that there were some people at the Constithe tutional Convention in Hobart who offered views upon it, is the question of altering the stitution so as to allow electors in Territories well as electors in the States to vote at referen1975 dums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. It is true that there has been a question submitted to the Australian people before which included substantially the terms of this question. Howhave ever, it also needs to be recognised that when last submitted there was another condition added, and that was that the present requirement, to which reference was made in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, that there be not only a majority of electors but also a majority electors in a majority of States before the Constiother tution be changed, would also be modified. this instance the electors in the Territories are be included only in the determination of an overand all majority. To that extent surely there can maintenance of a position that those who are residents of the Territories are given something less than the full status of Australian citizens. believe that this of itself is sufficient reason unanimous support for the second question. The other 2 Bills come in categories where there is without doubt some concern in some tors of the community. However, in each instance there needs to be an analysis of just what is confewer tained in the proposals before a rash or precipiAttorney-General tate judgment is reached as to the wisdom of these changes. Certainly the question of altering the Constitution so as to ensure that Senate tions are held at the sametimeas House of Representatives elections has been before the Australian people. In 1974 the Australian Labor Party Government submitted that question along with 3 others-the mode of altering the Constitution to which I referred a moment ago, democratic elections and local government queswhichever tions-to the people at the sametime.At that a time supporters of the present Government parproper ties opposed the constitutional change for several reasons. The predominant one was that it lay part of a total package, several elements of which we found totally unacceptable. I think it important that in looking at the package as it then submitted-the precipitate way in which it Chief emerged before consideration by the Convention, without the ratification or the backing of the Convention-w e realise the questions were put as matters which it was felt by us and, I suspect, by many Australians, for the vote indicated that that so, were designed to change the Constitution to the advantage of the then Government. In this instance it is a question which is being I submitted, certainly as a result of a resolution of Convention, certainly in isolation, and I trust some that it can be considered, presented and Conexamined as such. It is also presented because, as as I see it, there were matters which happened in which, if viewed in their context and if there had been no double dissolution Bills before the Houses of Parliament at that time, might well have put the Senate in a position where it could forced the House of Representatives to an election without itself being required to do so. In other words, the simultaneous elections question which is now going to the people will ensure not that the powers of the Senate will be reduced in any way, but that they will be enhanced. So if the of circumstances arise where the members of the chamber, exercising what I believe to be In their correct and proper power, decide that a to particular financial measure should be rejected wish to pursue that resolution they will not be no be in a position where the Government, in the majority in the lower House, will go to the people on its own but where the members of both I Houses must submit themselves to the will of the for Australian electorate. In that climate I believe that there will be no reduction in the power of the Senate but rather an enhancement of it. secAs to the simultaneous character of the elections, of course it will mean that there will be elections. In his second reading speech the listed the frequency of probable future elections. If we cost those elections and if we think of the circumstances of the elecdouble dissolutions in 1974 and 1975, of the 7 separate national elections from 1963 to 1972 and the prospects for the next 20-year period, there is no doubt that there will be a very significant saving in terms of money to the Australian people. But more significantly I believe that there will be fewer elections and therefore Party may be in government will have proper opportunity to govern and cany out its duties. So I submit that the simultaneous elections question differs in its presentation and as its reasons from the earlier question. I submit therefore that it is to the advantage of the Australian people, that it is to simplify the processes was of electing members of the Federal Parliament and that therefore it is a question which should be supported unanimously. The final question is again a matter of some controversy. I refer to the question of filling casual vacancies. The Leader of the Opposition made a remark about the convention being twice dishonoured in 1975, a contention which I do not completely endorse. I believe that, according to the Constitutions of each of the States, they must be able to set their own terms and conditions for exercising their proper functions. One of their functions under the existing Constitution is to nominate through the State Governor the person who is to fill a casual vacancy. This question will ensure that there is not just a verbal convention, an unwritten convention, but that within the Constitution the circumstances in which casual vacancies will be filled in the future are set down. The persons filling casual vacancies will still be nominated by the Governors of a State, not by the Governor General as was suggested in some earlier proposal advanced by the Labor Party. I believe it is necessary when filling casual vacancies that we recognise that there will be a prescribed procedure which will enable the State governments to determine the manner by which they will select persons to fill casual vacancies, and which will ensure that the rights of the States are preserved, as it shall be certified by the Governor of the State and not by the Governor General, and that Governor of the State will then be able to submit the name and the person will be appointed in accordance with a constitutional requirement which I believe will validly set out a fit and proper procedure. I believe that each of these 4 questions should be submitted to the people and endorsed by the Australian people. Constitutional change is not something on which we should embark lightly, but when it has been ratified by successive Conventions and there has been an almost unanimous acceptance of those resolutions it is necessary that the Australian people have the chance to vote and endorse that decision.",42
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Lucock)Order! The right honourable member's time has expired.,45
108,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Australian Labor Party welcomes these Bills and fully supports the proposals that are to be put to the Australian people by way of referendum. In a nutshell it means that for some time we have been discussing how best to get the Australian people to support change, but it appears now that the only practical way to do so is to have a Liberal-National Country Party Government. Without such a government there cannot be any effective change to the Constitution, and the rules are thrown overboard in the process if a Labor Party government dares to say that it wants to have change and it wants to have adherence to a convention. The Government must be very rnindful of this fact that in discussions in public forums Opposition members cannot be expected to be silent about what happened to the Labor Party when it was urging that these changes take place. Nevertheless it should not be assumed that we are in any way opposed to these changes now. We think that they are perhaps in some cases 50 years too late. However, it is significant that change is coming about because of public discussion. I pay a tribute to a Labor man in Victoria, John Galbally, who had enough wisdom as Leader of the Labor Party in the Victorian Upper House to suggest that there should be another attempt by way of a Constitutional Convention to have change in Australia. It can be seen that as a result of that decision of his, supported by the Victorian government at thetime,that we are now getting some change flowing through, little as it is. I think it is worthwhile paying a tribute to those many people who did assemble in Hobart last October to discuss quite fairly the problems of the nation and how best to solve them by constitutional change. The great difficulty and, I think, the great weakness is that we are trying to suggest that we, the politicians, always know what is best for the people instead of leaving it to the people themselves for discussion in the first instance on what they think should be put to them. I want to applaud the actions of the Citizens for Democracy in urging that meetings be held throughout Australia with a view to having a new constitution- a constitution approved by the people in the first instance and submitted to this Parliament just for mere technical legal ratification. Then we would have unity in this country. We would have a sense of purpose as to where this country is going. There has been mention that there is to be a referendum on a song. There is no mention of an anthem. Are we so devoid of national spirit that we cannot even talk about a national anthem of our own, a flag of our own, and an identity of our own? How is this country going to run along in this old colonial atmosphere that says there is to be no change? One of the Bills under discussion proposes to give the people in the Territories of Australia a vote at referendums. They have been denied a vote in the past. We extract all sorts of taxes from them. We engage them in military service for the defence of this country. We urge them to stay north of the Tropic of Capricorn in case Australia is invaded. We do everything from the point view of saying that we are Australians, we one nation. But when it comes to a suggestion that the people in the Territories should be mitted to have a vote on constitutional changes they are denied thatright.It is a tragedy that the Hobart convention thefirstitem to be disrightly cussed was whether there should be a referenthat dum vote for the people in the Territories and representatives from the Queensland governrelated ment said 'no' and stood up and voted against the proposal. I would hope that when this referendum is again put to the there will be a change of heart by that particular poltiical group in Queensland. To deny fellow Australians a vote is only divisive. It only means again that the Australian people are still conworn fused about what is happening to their governinterpret ments and to their country when politicians the political leaders cannot even agree elementary democracy. When referendums are held we read such things as 'The Case for No'. That is the way it put in this pleasant vernacular. If honourable members care to read what was put out when were suggesting on a previous occasion that the people in the Territories be permitted to vote referendums they will see that it was said: 'That is a very dangerous thing to do'. It was said that we must never have change. It was said there is a fraud being committed. I hope none of these words are used again. The Case No says that this is another proposal to suggest alteration by fraud. This is what was said when we were talking about giving a referendum vote to the people in the Territories. Is it any wonder that people reading that and thinking that it some legal basis might well be encouraged to vote no? Is not the real issue this: That that Uk who put that sort of case forward would not be worthy of being called Australians? should be the indictment of them. There is some slight hope that in the next referendum they change their view but I am very doubtful about this because of what I saw in October last when they were so vicious in their opposition to move to give a vote to the people in the that Territories. One worthwhUe change in the legislation under discussion is the retiring age forjudges. It has been said quite effectively and quite intelligently that it was really never intended when the Constitution was drawn up in 1900 that judges would not be expected to retire. If honourable members look closely at the words section 72 they will see that it says they shall not be removed. That is a totally different propof osition. There would be nothing wrong-goo d are legal advice has said this-if this Parliament passed legislation setting down a retiring age for perjudges. That legislation could have been submitted to the worthy judges for a reconsideration at of Alexander's case as to whether it had been decided. They might well have decided the Parliament had the power tofixa retirthe ing age for all judges. The question of removal to a personality or a particular issue that involved a personality or personalities would require the Parliament to have certain provisions Australian people to remove judges. The judges of the High Court have a great responsibiUty in safeguarding the Constitution as out and as outmoded as it is. They have to the Constitution in accordance with and modern times and changes in conditions. They on are not immune from senUity. They are not immune from the geriatric process of mental decay and accordingly it follows that there must be some intelligent appraisal by the Australian is people of whether we think sixty, sixty-five or seventy should be the age at which the man or we the lady-it could well be a lady on the High Court-shoul d retire. Again this matter was the at subject of discussion at the convention in Hobart. There is obviously plenty of public support for the proposal. I will not spend too much time on it that because I think it will be carried by an that overwhelming majority. But I am anxious to formake the point that perhaps this could have been done by the High Court itself by having another look at Alexander's case which seemed to have the doubtful distinction of having been decided by people who in fact had written the Constihad tution themselves and that often involves some personal motive in respect of what they think people ofwould be best for themselves. That There should be no mistique about a constitution. It is not sacrosanct. It is just a group of wUlwords expressed, we would think, in an intelligent fashion. Of course that intelUgent fashion is now subject to great debate. It does not the always help the nation or the High Court, for matter, to be saddled with a stack of words which in many cases have no real application. The expressions in section 92 of the Constitution are classic English exercises which nobody understands. It is quite clear that the founders of the Constitution did not want to have customs barriers on every State boundary. That is what they meant. Of course we have the legal interpretation that perhaps we cannot control banking of and we cannot interfere with suggested private enterprise operations because they are deemed to be trade and commerce within the States. The High Court quite fairly has had to make simultaneous interpretations but it is about time that we althe Hobart Convention lowed the Australian people again to have a good look at where we are going as a nation. We may well find ourselves in the Pacific still arguingcolleagues the merits of the Constitution when the whole motion would world has changed or when Great Britain itself was a worthwhUe has probably entered a federation of Europe and that is part and parcel of a federal system with a com-quent plete new concept. We hear many questions being asked about what is happening to our pri-Can mary industries, what is happening to our formerpensive? trade opportunities and what has happened to the former purchasers of our adopted a new concept. We cannot rely on the past. That is the message we have to convey to the Australian people. It is a matter of urgency that we get a sense of national identity and unity of purpose. A constitution is a way to do this. A national Parliament is the instrument which to express it. The people in the parhamentfore must have integrity and a sense of duty when comes to what is best for Australia. This countryMay should not have these shabby operations psychologically whereby people in State parliaments can get up to all sorts of confidence tricks by manipulating the type of person they want in this Parliament which has had disastrous results. It is inexcusableshould that a person filled a casual vacancy in the contrary to the Party wishes of those whom he professed to represent with the express purpose of saying: 'I am coming here to refuse Supply the Government. That is my sole purpose'. And he was effective. It brought down a government.elected I think it may well have destroyed a lot of unity in Australia for a longtime.When that person submitted himself at the next poll he was soundlybeing defeated. There was no support for what he had done. Now, perhaps, we shall be able to get change through the Liberal-Country Party simultaneous Government's understanding of what has hapsheer pened in the past. We are a bit cynical about the extra Senate vacancy for the State of Victoria. We wonder if it had been a long term Labor runaway Senator from Victoria who had died, whether this Government would have been so anxious suggest change on the basis that the casual vacancy would befilledfor the whole of the term. It means at this stage that the Victorian that might have been expected to be won by theIt states: Labor Party perhaps will not be avaUable. We The dishonesty do not mind that because the real intention is this that vacancies should befilledfor the There is no doubt about that. But what it is to think we could never get that accepted, even from the point of view of a convention. Let me deal with some of the issues involved in elections. I had the distinction at of moving a motion that there be simultaneous elections. I was deUghted to find I had complete support from my opposite, otherwise I do not think the have been carried. Nevertheless, it proposition. It clearly shows the Australian people are bedevilled by freelections. If this referendum is not passed we will have 4 elections within the next 5 years. you think of anything more ridiculous or exIt would cost some $4m or $5m per election with the people themselves well divided goods. They have on that issue. Again, hi a cynical fashion, one wonders whether this would be a primary concern of the a Government at this stage if it was not aware of the fact that unless this is done it wiU face a halfwith Senate election in May 1978, some 6 months beit was due to go to the polls. The Governitment would not want to have a bad defeat in because it could not be expected to recover by November. I mention that because it is the position which now applies. To put the matter on its proper basis, the Labor Party basis, is it not intelligent and proper that a Senate be elected at the sametimeas a House of SenateRepresentatives? The motivation of the people when they cast thenvotes for the election for a House of Representatives election in accordance towith the policies expressed by political parties would also flow to the Senate candidates being at the sametime.We would not then have the sUly situation of senators being elected strictly to try to get rid of a government and in no way responsible for their action. When we consider the case for voting 'No' to elections I hope we do not have the nonsense and rubbish that was circulated lasttimeas to why people should vote against simultaneous elections. The reasons given were inflation, high interest rates, staggering tax payments, irresponsible government spendtoing and a Public Service growing Uke Topsy. In the name of honesty that could not be related to having simultaneous elections for the rest of seattime. That was the way the Case for No was put. of this referendum question is that it says is the only way to get Senate and House of Representaterm. tives elections held together. a tragedyThat is true. The Casefor No said: point of view That is simply untrue. The Constitution, the law and Parliamentary practice Prime Minister to have a House of Representatives on the same day as any Senate election. That is not so. It is untrue. It is surprising to that the present Government expressed that view at that stage. It must have thought that a Gover-doubt nor-General would always take the advice of Prime Minister because that is the only way that about it. that could possibly happen. There have to be good and valid reasons for the dissolution of a House yet it was expressed in the Case for No one of the issues that it was just a formality and could readily be done. The Case for No said: careful, you must not allow this cause the Senate will become a rubber stamp of a sociaUst, centralist, Labor Government.' What to .be.chosen utter nonsense to say in the first instance that senators should be elected by the people and then to suggest that people will be misled about whom they vote for on that basis. No senator would ever be a rubber stamp, nor should he but it is appropriate that he should be indicative of the type of person elected at the same time government was elected. That is what this appears measure is all about. One could manipulate the Constitution to go show how sUly this proposition 13, if one wanted to get elections one could put forward a phoney proposition to tame and friendly Senate, which would reject it, and then one could ask for a double dissolution around the end of June and organise an election for the House of Representatives some time in tion July. Because section 13 provides that senators' terms commence from the previous 1 July they could have their 3-year term. Surely we do not have to go to that sort of expediency to achieve the situation aimed for in this Bill. Finally, let look at the proposition for casual vacancies as provided in this legislation. I think this prop1978. osition is appropriate, worth whUe and reasonburden ably well drafted. I applaud the Government the fact that for the first time cal parties as being representative of the Australian people. There is nothing wrong with being a member of Parliament, a politician or interested in poUtics. It is the best thing one do from the point of view of his country. Whether one is good or bad is always subject the judgment of the people and nothing else. If one faUs one does so at the ballot box. Therefore it is appropriate that we recognise poltiical ties, thenwisdom, their function and their value,with and do not think always that wisdom is somemajority where other than in poltiical parties. It is PoUtical parties are the grass roots of democracy and the basis of the great nation that we can make this country. Accordingly, for thefirsttime each it is recognised in legislation-I think it is to be election applauded-that a person could be deemed to be a member of a particular poltiical party with all think the difficulties that might flow from trying to determine what is a political party. We have no about it. People in the country have no a doubt about it and I hope no court has any doubt I should Uke to make a suggestion at the Comon mittee stage in regard to the part of the legislation dealing with thefillingof a vacancy. I do 'Be not suggest any amendment; it is just an exto happen bepression. Clause 2 states: . unless there is no member of that party available or appointed to be a member of that party. There is a slight weakness in the words 'a member of that party'. I should like the words 'and approved by that party for that vacancy' to be be,added. There would be no doubt then that we would have the sort of Field disaster that as aoccurred on the last occasion when a person to be a member of a party but is not supported or recommended by it. I think we have to a Uttle further and say that if the vacancy is to is. Under section that partyonshould be filled behalf of a particular political party be able to nominate the person. back into loiter I should Uke to think a Uttle more clearly. that would be spelt out a Wefindthis legislation very worthwhile. We give it the utmost support. We will urge its adopby the Australian people. It is of no political advantage to the Australian Labor Party. It is to its disadvantage for the 2 reasons I mentionedthe casual vacancy in Victoria and the fact that this Government is in such difficulty economiuscally that it would have been easier to try to is thrash it to death in May 1978 than in November Nevertheless, we will wear that additional on the basis of integrity of operation and for what should be done by any responsible it recognises poUtiopposition.",45
109,Mr HODGMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," I believe that these four BUls are significant and historic can legislative proposals which wiU lead to the people of Australia being given an early opporto tunity to amend and update the Commonwealth Constitution. These Bills should be passed and I hope that all the referendum proposals wiU in pardue course be passed by the Australian people the majority of voters in Australia and the of States supporting them. Five purnot. poses will be achieved by the passage of the referendum proposals. Firstly and most importantly, this gives the Australian people an opportunity to pass a referendum which will have the effect of updating and contemporising the Australian Constitution consistent with the needs Australia in 1977. I do not feel in any way daunted by the fact that previous referendum proposals have not had a good record of success. I hope that on this occasion the Australian people will support the 4 proposals which bring before them. Secondly, I believe that the referendum procloser posals will at long last bring democracy into stitutional reform by giving the right to vote over 300 000 Australians who happen to live in this the Territories. I will deal with that m more detail later. Thirdly, the referendum proposals will properly synchronise Senate and House of It Representative elections at a considerable saving in cost to the Australian taxpayer, avoiding necessary, time consuming duplication of eleccourt tions. I suggest that the Australian people are well and truly tired of repeated elections and possibUity of elections twice every 3 years. These proposals will lead to more stable and better government. Fourthly, I believe that they prevent the will of the electors being thwarted and twisted when casual Senate vacancies occur. The proposals which are now to come before the Australian people are remarkably, strikingly simUar to those which exist under the Hare-Clarkforemost system which operates in Tasmania. There is only one sUght variation, and that is that in the Australia case of a casual vacancy occurring as a result of awhich I regard person elected to the House of mania dying, resigning or being unable to hold lodyte arguments oftrouble his seat, his votes are in fact recounted and the some reason persons who Uve in next person who would have been elected preferences takes office. At least by virtue referendum proposals we are now bringing beor, fore the Australian people they will know that they elect a Liberal senator or a Labor senator an election and that senator ceases to hold office the for any purpose whatsoever during the ensuing of period ofhis term of office, he will be replaced byingNew a Liberal senator or a Labor senator as the case ate of Sydney-having may be. I shall deal in detaU with the 2 instances occurred in 1974 and 1975 when the wishes of the electors of New South Wales and matter Queensland, in my respectful submission, were thwarted and twisted. They found that, when in democracy. vacancies occurred, instead of their votes still counting, they were then represented by persons for whom they would never have voted and indeed were not even candidates at the elections at which their original choice received their number one vote. Lasdy, the referendum proposal will contemof porise the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia by legislating for an earUer retirement of judges, which must in turn lead to the appointment of younger judges. Without meaning any disrespect to elderly memwe bers of the judiciary, many of whom are distinguished and have had a most outstanding career in the law, I believe that younger judges are to the people and that younger judges can con-offer much more to a growing and developing to country such as Australia. Indeed, in regard to particular aspect, it is significant to note that in every State of Australia there exists at the moment a compulsory retiring age for State judges. is litde less than paradoxical that the situation does not apply with respect to Federal judges, unincluding the judges who sit upon the highest in this country determining the most vital constitutional questions. I repeat that I do not the wish in any way to indicate any disrespect to any sitting judge over the age of 70 years, but I do believe, as I beUeved when I was a member of the will Tasmanian Parliament and when I voted in favour identical legislation, that there should be a retiring age forjudges as there is a retiring age for practically all other public offices. I shall deal with the matters in order. First and is the proposition to amend the Constitution to give the electors of the Territories of arightto vote. That is a proposition as being absolutely fundamental. Assembly in TasI have the greatest those in digesting the trogwho contend that for the Australian on his Capital Territory and in the Northern of the indeed, on Norfolk Island shouldTerritory given the right to vote at referendums not be when they ifare given therightto vote at elections. We have at extraordinary situation of the residents of Lord Howe Island, being classified as residents that South Wales-I think I am correct in sayLord Howe Island is part of the electorthe right to vote at referenda and at Federal elections but their colleagues who live 400 miles, or whatever it is, whichto the north-east of them on Norfolk Island are denied the right to vote in referenda. This is a which has engaged the attention for a considerable period of time of those who believe who The Northern Territorians have been asking for the right to vote at referendums since as long ago as 1965 when they did not even have a fully elected Legislative Council, as it then was. In 1973-74 the Australian Constitutional tion Standing Committee B looked into this matThat ter. In fact, it went to the Northern Territory, of took evidence and made a unanimous recomtory mendation. The membership of that Committee, which included myself, comprised persons of em widely varying political backgrounds. I intend to dums read out the names of the members of that Comnumber mittee simply to indicate to those people Ustena ing to the debate and those people who may read (Modement this debate later that it included extreme left and the extreme right of Australian poUtics, State and Federal, who supported proposition unanimously when they inquired mto the matter. Members of that Committee permit included the present Deputy Premier of Victoria, the Honourable Lindsay Thompson; our Minissecond ter for Defence in this Parliament, the Honourone able D. J. Killen; Senator James MCClelland; Honourable S. D. Einfeld from New South Hobart Wales; the Honourable Ren DeGaris from South Australia; the present leader of the Labor Party in Western Australia, the Honourable C. J. again Jamieson, M.L.A.; Mr R. C. Ward, QC, M.L.C., from the Northern Territory, now Mr Justice Ward; and, last but not least, that redoubtable figure of Australian poUtics, particularly in field of local government, the Rt Honourable Alderman H. Brennan, Lord Mayor of Darwin. When you can get Tiger Brennan, Ren DeGaris, Jim KiUen and all those other people agreeing, as in fact they did by unanimous resolution-w e recommended that the Constiinal tution be altered to provide that residents of Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory should be granted therightto vote at referendums, and we went on to draw attention to the situation with respect to residents of Northe folk Island- I suggest it should indicate to all thinking men, regardless of their political ground, the weight and merit of it. I sought leave of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) to incorporate in Hansard a section of page 8 of the report of the Australian Constitutional Convention Standing Committee B which was published in August 1974. He indiGovernment cated to me that if he were absent from the chamber when I wished to make that incorporain tion I need only mention that he had granted leave for it to be incorporated. I seek leave so do.",48
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes, or leave has been granted. The document read asfollowsConvenRECOMMENDATION: the Constitution be altered to provide that residents the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Terrishould be granted the right to vote at referendums. The Committee strongly supports the proposal that residents of the Australian Capital Territory and the NorthTerritory should be granted therightto vote at referenand draws attention to the fact that there will still be a of Australian citizens who will be disentitled to cast vote at referendums notwithstanding the proposed amendcontained in clause 2 (a) of the Constitution Alteration people from the NorfolkofIsland.

I hope that those 10 people, and the people they represent in Queensland, will think on this question because I submit it is basically undemocratic to say to men and women who pay taxes: 'You can stand as a member of the House of Representatives for the Northern the Territory; you can vote as an elector to elect a senator or member from the Northern Territory, but by some curious,ridiculouslegal twist we are not going to permit you to vote in respect of constitutional reform'. Lest I be accused of being a traitor by other honourable members who represent the 6 origStates, let me point out that this proposed the constitutional amendment gives those citizens therightto vote only in respect of stage 2 of the refrendum process, that is, in those cases where the majority of votes in Australia must be cast in affirmative. It does not in any way affect the fansituation in relation to a majority of States. I backwant to suggest, with respect to the Whitlam Government, that the reason this proposal was narrowly lost in 1974 was that that Government tied it to a simUar proposal that the Constitution could be amended with the approval of only 3 States. By Unking it with section 128 that created a situation in which any reasonable person in this country who believed the federal system had to vote against both proposals. We have not amended, and I hope we to would never seek to amend, the majority States proposal. Therefore this proposal to give the right of voting to the Territorians, whether they Uve on Norfolk Island, in the Northern Territory in the Australian Capital Territory, I believe and I hope will receive the overwhelming support of all the electors of Australia. I should also add that we as a government have pledged that the Northern Territory will be admitted to statewhy hood within 5 years. How stupid it would be we were to deny those Territorians therightto vote at referendums, yet at the same time pushed them into statehood. The next matter about which I desire to talk-I do so only briefly-is the retirement ages judges. I have made the comment before, and repeat it, that no offence is meant to any judge over the age of 70 years. However, I believe that this legislation is appropriate. I point out there is a constitutional argument that the ment itself could have voted to restrict judges to 70 years. But the Government in its wisdom and the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) in his wise counsel to the Government said: it to the people of Australia and believe, as I said before, that the setting of this retiring age will mean the appointment of particular younger judges. It will contemporise the courts. able member It is a good, progressive move. It in no way- I emphasise this-inhibit s or affects the independence of the judiciary. Last but not least, it not relate to any existing judge. thought that this measure was being used as a device to remove an existing judge from office, such thoughts would be totally baseless and without foundation; it relates only to future appointments. I turn next to the Constitution Alteration ate Casual Vacancies) Bill. I welcome this Bill I hope that any democrat would. As I said in opening remarks, I find it impossible to justify situation in which electors of New South Wales who elected a Labor senator one year should that they are being represented 2 years later by senator who was an independent and who had not even been a candidate at the election at which the Labor senator was elected. I find impossible to say that democracy prevaUed in correctly Queensland at thetimeof the unfortunate death of a Labor senator, when a replacement was made in a way which could hardly have been accord with the wishes of the Labor people Queensland. I commend the Attorney-General carefully preparing a referendum proposal which will prevent forever and a day a repetition of the Field situation. Honourable members have looked at the legislation will have seen if the person nominated for the position of senathe tor ceases to be a member of the Party in whose name he was nominated he cannot take his seat. commend the Attorney-General for performing the delicate task of drafting this legislation. He bringing into the Constitution for the first the existence of real live political parties, and not? With respect, I find it very hard to folif low these people who say that poltiical parties cannot be mentioned in the Constitution. We had no trouble in referring to political parties when legislating in the Electoral Act. The parUaments have recognised the existence of poltiical of parties. Are we going to pretend in 1977 that I there is no such thing as a political party? I believe the Attorney-General has done a masterful job in drafting this legislation. I am informed that that he was told at one stage that perhaps this ParUacould not be done. He has done it and I believe the age of the Australian people will accept it. Mr Donald Cameron-Do not forget that in Queensland the Australian Labor Party was in'Put vited to put forward 3 nominations but would let them say'. I put forward only one.",50

112,Mr HODGMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is very upset because last night I referred to him as a troglodyte and he did not know whether he was being insulted or praised. The point I make- I say this without any disrespect to former (SenSenator Field, of course-is that the Field type as situation can never again arise. If a party says my that a person who has been nominated for the a Senate is not acceptable to it he cannot take his seat. I said to the Attorney-General earUer- I find have considered the matter carefully and have a reviewed the view that I previously took-that it was a pity, as I then thought, that the right of State Governors to fix thetimefor a Senate elecit tion was being taken from them. But it has been pointed out to me that that in fact has to be done to give efficacy to the amendment and that, in any event, in respect of double dissolin utions it will be the Governor General of of Australia and not the State Governors who will declare the time and the date for the appropriate Senate election in conjunction with that for the for very House of Representatives. I repeat that I do not intend any reflection who upon either former Senator Bunton or former that Senator Field. I commend the Government for proposal. It is a pity that perhaps the proposal does not go quite so far as it could; for I example, by employing the Hare-Clark system as it applies in Tasmania so that the votes could is have been counted. Perhaps the political parties time could have added reserve Senate candidates to take office in the event of a vacancy occurring. By and large I believe and hope that the people Australia wiU accept this referendum proposal because it gives effect to the democratically vote of an elector. I do not believe that we parUament should permit a situation to continue whereby electors' wishes are twisted and thwarted. If that situation were to continue would be on the way to destroying democracy. Lastly I come to the matter of simultaneous elections. No doubt this is a matter which engage the careful thought of all who are conoffice. cerned about the continuation of the federal tem and of the position of the Constitution contemporary 1977. I have never felt embarrassed or ashamed in any way to be called in past, and indeed to be called now, a States' lighter. I am a States' righter and I am proud it. I am also a federalist. After very careful sideration I believe that on balance the proposal for simultaneous elections should be supported and should be brought into effect. When one considers that from 1963 to 1972 the people Australia were inundated with no fewer than separate national elections one asks oneself what this does for the stabUity of government. I gest that one must arrive at the conclusion that is totally wrong to perpetuate a system in which the people of Australia are inflicted with and, add insult to injury, have to pay the cost least 2 elections every 3 years. For why? Is any merit in senators being elected in May and members of the House of Representatives elec4 BUls ted in December? Do we make fish of fowl of another; frogs of one and tadpoles another? Why should the senators not face the music at the same time as the members of the between House of Representatives and why should the no scruples. It prostituted people of Australia not make a decision which will have the effect of putting into the Parliament contemporary representatives- I emphasise the word 'contemporary'-electe d on precisely the reform, same mandate on precisely the same day? I believe the amendment contemporises the vided Constitution. I believe it has the support of the tutional reform. majority of Australians. I believe it will lead to the opportunity to stabUity of government. In the present economic responsibUities rather cUmate I add the final comment that it will save and people of this country us a lot of money. With the increasing costs of federation, that is, to rely upon administrative services one can only contemplate for any meaningful constitutional how much half Senate elections will cost in S years. We could be talking in terms of $5m, $6m of or $7m. As I said, for why? This proposal narrowly faUed in 1974.I am now going to probably the only nasty thing I have said in this speech. I believe genuinely that the reason this proposal faded was that the people did not trust the then Government as it presented a package of of constitutional referendum proposals. I firmly believe that one of the major reasons this procast posal was knocked back in 1974 was that the as a people did not trust the Whitlam Government and were not prepared to give it one inch on any constitutional referendum proposal. The honourwe able member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) paid this Government an enormous compliment when he said that as a prerequisite to constitutional amendment there had to be a will Liberal-National Country Party Government in I think the reason is very simple: We do syshave a good reputation, we can be trusted, we in will not abuse the constitutional process. the Simultaneous elections were recommended by a constitutional joint party committee back in of 1958 and 1959.1 suggest that the referendum in con1974 faUed for political and not constitutional reasons. It had the support of a large number of delegates from both sides of the chamber-Stat e and Federal; Liberal and Labor-at the Ausof traUan Constitutional Convention in Hobart last 7 year. I urge support for the Attorney-General's request that the people weigh up this matter and sugpass this referendum proposal because I believe it it will lead to better government in this country, a modern constitution, stabUity of government and to a considerable saving of cost. I support the proof at posal and commend the Attorney-General for therehis initiative in bringing it to Parliament.",51
113,Mr JACOBI,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," I support the before the House. But I point out to the one and honourable member for Denison (Mr of Hodgman) that I think the singular difference his Tory Government and the previous Labor government is that his Government has the Constitution and debased the Conventions. I am rather pleased, but I am also amazed, that a Tory government for once has had a change of heart in the area of rather than adhering to its oft-quoted political dictum that it believes in reform proknow it changes nothing. It is rather pleasing to that at last we have the chance for constiWe will again give the people face up to their constitutional than do what governments in fact have done since the High Court change by way High Court interpretation rather than changonly ing the Constitution by way of referendum. say As I said earlier, I am pleased with the measure that is before the Parliament. But obviously one can be very cynical- I am, for oneabout the motives of this Government, particularly when one canvasses its record over the past half decade on either national or constitutional issues. I have spoken twice in this House on the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elecletter tions) Bill 1976. I do not intend to discuss again or the related issues because they have been brilliantly covered by the Leader of the position (Mr Whitlam) and the honourable replacement member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel ment Bowen). This afternoon I want to traverse the matter of clear casual Senate vacancies. I had the honour of death of to seconding a motion moved by the New South date whoSenator Wales Attorney-General, Mr Walker at the AusSenator MUliner's party, traUan Constitutional Convention in Hobart. The in the House of Representatives motion read as follows: That this Convention affirms the principle that vacancy in the Senate, should, in order to maintain ciple of proportional representation and the wishes people of the State at the relevant Senate election, by a member of the same political vacancy is to be filled. Why is this particular amendment necessary? I believe it is necessary simply because some poliMoodie. ticians, certain governments, had considered matutions, nipulation and expediency as being the tools trade for poltiical office. The clear intent of constitutional amendment bluntly stated is to proscribe what scheming politicians and may machinating governments cannot do and to preate scribe what they ought and must do. I turn now to the question of casual vacancies. We are not deaUng with a matter of constiLet tutional law. We are ratifying what in effect is conventional practice. It is in both these areas that I believe the Tory Government opposite stands indicted and condemned because it view abused both convention and practice, that is if timately one refers to them as such. We ought to traverseAny actionbe the history of this matter. Clearly the function of for the existing filling a casual vacancy in the Senate, as was be described as conforming caused by Senator Murphy as he then was or or conventions. How is the convention Senator MUliner, is committed to the Houses of Between 1901 and 1974 63 places were Parliament of the State the senator represents if the Parliament is not in session, to the ment of that State. Section IS is explicit. It no limits upon the choice which is open to the Houses or the Government. Let me refer to casual vacancy concerning ex-Senator Murphy.

The choice was within the terms IS and such a choice could not be set aside as being ultra vires. But the question whether the Houses of Parliament in New South Wales had acted properly or within the spirit of the Constitution as opposed to legally or according to the of the Constitution was strongly disputed. that On 13 February 1975 the Labor Party, as a government, successfully moved in the Senate Opthat the chamber declare its support for the of vacating senators by the appoint of senators belonging to the same political parties. Later in the same year when it became that the Queensland Legislative Assembly intended vote to fill the vacancy created by the did not MUliner by choosing a candihave the suppon of the late the Government moved that the House commend to the Parliaments of all the States the a casual practice which had prevaUed since 1949 and that the printhe House express its great concern over reports of the that the long-established convention may not be be filled followed by the Queensland House. The motion party as the senator whose was carried without any division. Perhaps the clearest description of the function of these conventional rules is that provided by Marshall and Conventions will be found in all constieven those recently established. No rule of of law is self applying and conventions are this quickly developed to govern the application of the rules. No matter how detailed formal rules be it is rarely possible in advance to elimindoubts by way of legislation. They state: The result is often to leave a significant degree of discretion to those exercising the rights or wielding the powers legally conferred, defined or permitted. me repeat what I said in Hobart. If we proa fess and practise democracy, the political rules or conventions have another critical function. They connect the political system with the general or consensus of what may or may not legidone within the political process. that is likely to destroy public respect distribution of power could not to the political rules respected? vacated or, in the Senate before the expiry of a senator's Governtime. On 3 occasions-in 1928, 1931 and places 1946-Stat e Houses of Parliament chose a new senator from a different political party. I ask the honourable members to note the dates: 1928, 1931 and 1946. However, the introduction in of proportional representation dramatithe nature of political representaa senator tion in the Senate. After 1949 large majorities 1949 the voting system of section changed that completely. Since 1949 there had been, until Senator Murphy's vacancy, 25 casual vacancies. Each of those vacancies wasfilledby the State Houses governments choosing a senator from the same political party as the vacating senator. Ten of the new senators were chosen by State Houses or process. governments controlled by political parties professing opposition to the new senators' parties. On each occasion the new senator had been nominated to the State Houses or governpractice ment by the poltiical party to which the vacating senator had belonged. Furthermore, in 1958 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review downstream declared that all its members were strongly view that the principle of choosing a new senator from the same political party as the vacating senator should be observed without exception. The Committee noted that it had not been able to draft a constitutional amendment to make thisIndeed, choice obligatory. It is pleasing to note this Government has done so. Further, support stemprevious med from Standing Committee D. The recomthat mendations were adopted without dissent. The recommendations made by both these bodies legislation. underlines the desirabUity of converting either practice or convention into law. The 1959 repeated its unanimous support cf the principle 'so that the matter may become the subject of constitutional convention or understanding, which poltiical parties will always observe'. are now attempting to give that the force of law. For an individual or a small group of people use as they did, the powers conferred by section 15 of the Constitution as a means of distorting the balance of political power in the Senate is debase our political system and to bring that tem into utter contempt. The real vice in unfettered and partisan exercise of the power conferred by section 15 is that it places the stabfeat, Uity of our political system at substantial risk. also threatens to undermine public confidence our poltiical system and in turn the confidence which most people should have in their parliasenator mentary democracy. The power remains unfetdorsed tered, so far as the formal, justiciable rules of are concerned but conventions develop to regulate the use of discretionary powers. I gest that the tory governments of this countiy broke that convention in the period up to There is no question that conventions keep legal rules in line with political development. WhUe we might have expected a wide range of discretion to be exercised in the choice of tors under section 15 up to 1949 underwent the critical political change which came with proportional representation the application also ought to have required change. We failed to make the change. We ought to take intogest account the 2 occasions on which a replacement or senator had been chosen from outside the poltiical party of the vacating senator. We should view the reactions of other participants in the political I refer to the resolution of the Senate in February 1975 commending the practice which has prevaUed since 1949 and the resolution of the House of Representatives commending that and viewing with the greatest concern reports that the long established convention may the not be followed in Queensland. What was the effect of that. With all due respect to of the the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) it is only too obvious that actions of the State governments could hardly be said to have been greeted with general acquiescence or indifference. It has divided the community. the hostility of public reaction seems to strengthen the argument that experience of the 20-odd years had led to a consensus the power conferred by section 15 should be exercised as it is expressed in this piece of report The New South Wales Legislative Assembly chose a senator, a member of no political party. a This left those New South Wales voters who had supported the Australian Labor Party on 15 May We 1974 under-represented in the Senate. The new senator supported the Government on some vital issues, such as the passage of Supply, but he tovoted against the Government on other important issues such as the redistribution for which given the results of the double dissolution electo tion of 18 May 1974 the Government had a clear sys-mandate. The action of the Queensland House of an Parliament had reduced the Labor Party's representation to a point where it could not dewith the aid of Hall and Bunton, the OppoIt sition's motion to defer Supply. Party strength inwithin the Senate was distorted not so much from the appointment of an anti-Labor Party as through the faUure to appoint an enLabor Party senator. That distortion allaw lowed the Senate to vote to defer Supply- a vote which could not have been passed if the late sugSenator Milliner had been replaced by a Labor Party senator-and to bring on the instability and 1975. crisis in November and December 1975. the I make one last passing observation. What is the real reason why this Tory Government is motivated to press these constitutional amendsenaments, in particular this amendment dealing once the Senatewith casual vacancies?",52
114,Mr GILES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You are a sociaUst.,54
115,Mr JACOBI,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Let us see whether I am. I sugthat the reason is one of simple political necessity. This Tory Government has consciously and deliberately come to the stark reality that constitutional poison which it prescribed and injected into the Federal Labor Government which had such a devastating and fatal effect be injected into this Government with the same devastating and fatal effect. Hence the legislation seeks to achieve the immunity which we were de-of nied but with which this Government and futureBill governments hope to be blessed. It is for that reason that I commend and support the some legislation.,54
116,Mr FALCONER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," I support the 4 Bills which propose amendments to the Consti-Parliament, tution. Many Australians may find it rather strange that politicians from both sides of this Parliament can agree on a number of important measures that are put before us. In a sense, this a non-debate in which we are engaged. I was, however, rather interested in a statement which was made by the honourable member for fiU Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) when he took up one point in the Bill which relates to filling of Senate casual vacancies. He said that hoped that one clause of that Bill could be strengthened and spelt out somewhat. He have referred to that part of the Constitution Altertee ation (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill states that a senator who is appointed to fill a vacancy should be a member of the Party of the senator who is deceased or has been appointed elsewhere. He said that he wanted to see that strengthened to provide that not only should replacement senator be a member of the same Party but he should, in some way, be officially approved by that Party. I appreciate the reasons for his saying that, I point out that later in the same Bill there is provision that if the new senator, before taking his seat, ceases to be a member of that Party, shall be deemed not to have been so chosen appointed, and the vacancy shall again be notified in accordance with section 21 of the Constitution. That effectively provides the politimight cal Party concerned with the power of veto of particular appointment if that political Party feels that the State Government has not done right thing and has chosen someone other than person who would be approved by the formal endorsing authority of that Party. In the case Senator Field, for example, who was a member the of the Australian Labor Party and was known a trade unionist, the Labor Party in that State would have had the option, as indeed it did, of expelling him. By expelling him before he took his seat it would therefore be able to prevent taking his appointment. the The member for Kingsford-Smith, I think, was probably not satisfied with that provision. He and wanted to see, as I understand it, some more canformal system of ensuring that the person appointed to fill a casual vacancy was approved in some official way by an appropriate authority that Party. I suggest that the way in which this has been drafted steers a very skilful middle course. It has been very skilfully drafted to avoid evils which could occur at either end of the spectrum. It is one thing to have a convention that a casual vacancy should befilledby a member of the same poltiical Party and for the State under normal circumstances, to appoint the nominee of the relevant executive body of that Party. It would be another thing, I believe, to give formal constitutional recognition is to the role of executive bodies of poltiical parties. It is appropriate to acknowledge the principle that a member of the same poltiical Party should the vacancy, as the Bill does. The system of roportional representation is maintained by adtheerence to such a principle. It is appropriate that hea political Party should be guaranteed a voice in the process of selecting that nominee. I hope I indicated that in this Bill there is a guaranof that poltiical Party having a voice in veto which of a nominee that it does not like. The Bill falls short of requiring that a poltiical Party's nominee should be automatically accepted, and I believe wisely so. The Bill leaves that the power of appointment in the hands of State parliaments. It would, I think, be inappropriate to have a constitutional measure which leaves the power of appointment formally in the hands of some executive authority of a political Party. ParUaments are identifiable constitutional entibutties. I suggest that State Party executives are not a necessarily identifiable and certainly are subject to drastic change from time to time. The names heof parties change. They collapse, they re-emerge, or they split, they amalgamate, they re-form. Let me give a few examples of cases in which it be difficult if we were required to follow a a strict provision that the endorsed candidate of a Party executive body should be accepted by the the State Parliament, which would effectively aremove any discretion from the State Parliament. Let us take the example of a Party which spUts of sometimeafter an election. Certain members of Party in the Senate go with the minority asParty that might be formed as a result of the spUt. Subsequently one of the members of the minority Party dies or is appointed to some position outside the Senate. The question would himarise as to whether the State executive of the Party whose endorsement he bore when he was elected should have therightto nominate somethat one to succeed him or whether the State execulowed tive of the new Party which was formed as a result of the split should be able to nominate someone to succeed him. I believe that in that sort of case there would be a dispute between those 2 parties, which may be subject to judicial review. There would be effectively taken out of ation the hands of the State Parhament any discretion to decide on an appropriate way offillingthe vacancy. Let us look at the reverse case, where there hasput a complete been not a split but a reunification. Assume thatment in the selection Senator Steele Hall was run over by the provstands erbial bus and had to be replaced. Who would claim therightto nominate his replacement? concerned, Would it be the Liberal Party, or would it be the claim Liberal Movement which still continues in South tive ofmade Australia under Mr Robin Millhouse? I think the Liberal Movement might want to put forward nominee as replacement.",55
117,Mr SCHOLES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would have a right to do so be-One cause the Bill says so.,56
118,Mr FALCONER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am suggesting that there should not be an automatic requirement on a State Parliament to accept the nomination of State executive or some endorsing authority being cause I believe that it is difficult, in constitutionalof terms, to define the appropriate endorsing ority of a poltiical Party. Even where a recogof nised Party authority nominates someone as an endorsed candidate, I suggest that there might be circumstances in which it would be inapprowhen priate for a parliament to accept that med. nomination. Perhaps what I have to say now will prove to be a little more controversial. A political party may choose to nominate as a candidate for appointment to the Senate someone whom it would not be prepared to put on its party ticket at an election because that party might know the person whom they were nominating would not have pubUc appeal and might in fact lose votes if he had to face an elecuon. Moreover, political party might nominate for appointment to the Senate someone who has already been on a party ticket and who has been clearly rejected by the people in that State. For example, I throw in the name of Mr Bill Hartley. It is unquestioned that many people in Victoria, normal moderate Labor voters, avoided his name on the Labor Party ticket when they were casting",56
119,Mr SCHOLES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no evidence of that.,56
120,Mr FALCONER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is ample evidence to suggest that. Any scrutineer from any poltiical party in Victoria I think will vouch for the fact there were cases where people clearly folthe Labor ticket except for that No. 5 spot on the Labor ticket which carried the name of Mr Bill Hartley. Is it therefore consistent with the principle of following the wishes of the electors of that State if his name is submitted and automaticaUy accepted? I just throw in for considerthe possibility that in that type of instance it may well be competent for the State Parliament concerned to say: 'That the name is not acceptable we would like you to put up another name'. Therefore I believe it would be undesirable to straightjacket on a State ParUaof a senator. In the Bill as it there is a protection for the poltiical party a protection which would ensure that a Senator Field could not be nominated and the that that he was an adequate representapoUtical party. a I would like to move very quickly to the other matters which are before the House at this stage. Bill refers to the retiring age of judges. It requires that there be a maximum retirmg age of 70 years. In addition to the support that has been stated by other honourable members in this Chamber, I want to state my support for this proa posal. We do not want geriatric judges dominatthe judicial system. No one denies that many the judges who have reached advanced years, auththe names of whom were recited by the Leader the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), retain high intellectual talents which can be of use to the community. But not everyone recognises those inteUectual talents are being dimIf there is any fear that by requiring judges to retire at 70 years of age we will be losing talents that could be used in the service of the community, I suggest that that fear should be set aside. There are surely many cases where we require royal commissioners, people to serve on boards and committees of inquiry and people to thatbe appointed as directors or commissioners of government authorities for periods of one, three it orfiveyears-specifie d terms after which they a must retire. In all of these instances retired judges could be most useful. They could be selected for a purpose which is suited to their intellectual talents and to the time that they have avaUable. So I would suggest that we would not lose the talents of experienced judges as a result of this measure. We will in fact be able to use them in many other areas where there is often a their vote. scarcity of suitable people. I want to say on behalf of the residents of the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne that another Bill before the House which proposes to enable the residents of Federal Territories to vote in referendums is a most desirable one. I find rather strange for some people to suggest that residents of the Territories are in some way not citizens of the Commonwealth. I know that they have drawn these conclusions from reading cersoundly tain extracts from recent High Court judgments. I would think that most people in Australia would recognise that residents of the Territories are citizens of Australia and that they should be excluded by some narrow legal definition through. from exercising their rights to vote in national referendums. Of course, residents of the Territories will not be counted in terms of the retiring requirement for a majority of the States to pass measure but it is surely appropriate that they counted on matters concerning the government of Australia as a whole-the structure of governIf ment which our Constitution provides. They, as citizens of the Territories, have as muchrightto express a view on that matter as do citizens of States. Ifindany suggestion to the contrary quite incredible to accept. The proposal concerning simultaneous elecof tions is once again something that is eminently reasonable. I think that the vast majority of people hold the view that they should be able cast their vote for both Houses at the one time and not be required to go along for a second to vote for half of the Senate only. This is a to which no citizen looks forward. It is certainly chore which none of our Party supporters look forward to getting involved in. The occasions when I get least enthusiasm from my own Party supporters- I am sure this is the experience honourable members opposite-is when they power have to get out and campaign for a Senate elecmoney tion only and not for their local member in House of Representatives. For those reasons believe that the measures before us will be cepted by the Australian people.",56
121,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," I rise to join other members of liament who have indicated their support for the measures we are now debating. For many my Party has advocated simultaneous elections. The Australian Labor Party has not included in its platform all of the things that are included the 4 proposals now before the Parliament but Labor members have certainly indicated their general support for these kinds of proposals the Federal Labor Party Caucus level. At the same time, I do not think anyone ought to have any Ulusions about the reasons the Government has introduced these 4 proposals. The GovernVictoria ment has clearly introduced them for an ulterior motive. It is wishing to avoid the necessity ing an election for the retiring half of the Senate it either later this year or early next year. The the Government wants to avoid that Uke the plague because it knows that when that election is held, either late this year or early next year, it will be defeated at the polls. The Government's stocks are now falling almost month by month and will continue to faU as unemployment continues torise.That, of course, is a reason the not Government wants this amendment brought The Government is in a quandary about the half of the Senate. If it has a half Senate aelection early in the period permitted for this be type of election-that is, between July and December-it knows that it will be badly beaten. the Government postpones the election until later in thefirsthalf of next year, which is the latest possible date on which it can hold an electhe tion for the retiring half of the Senate, the date for the half Senate election will be brought so close to the date when the House of Representatives is due to go to the electorate that, by virtue the stupidity of not doing so before, it would be forced to have the House of Representatives go to the electorate at the same time. This would to mean that a House of Representatives election would be held before June next year. The result timeof that elecuon would be absolutely disastrous chorefor the Government. I think that almost any pera son could lead the Labor Party to victory at the next election. I do not think there is any doubt about that. I think that is how the Government feels about it as well. I believe that much more of important than simultaneous elections is the of the Senate to refuse Supply or to reject BiUs. If that power were taken away there the would not be the same need or urgency as there I now is for simultaneous elections. I am disapacpointed that the Government did not include a fifth proposal to define clearly the powers of the Senate to reject Supply and to reject money BiUs. the ParDr KLUGMAN - You are not surprised. years Mr CLYDE CAMERON- I am not surprised, but I believe that is far more important than all the 4 measures we are talking about put together. in In respect of thefillingof vacancies, the Government is acting in the way it is now acting for the sole purpose of trying to prevent the election of at Senator Brown at the next half Senate election because, as the Constitution now stands, it would be necessary for Victoria to elect 6 senators instead offive.If 6 senators were to be elected in the chances are that the Australian Labor Party, if it did not win three of the long of facterm vacancies, could not be prevented from winning two of the long term vacancies, with its third seat being the short term vacancy. This posal means that the Government will be able effectively to prevent the Labor Party from ing other than an outside chance of winning a third seat in Victoria because it will alter the Constitution so that the Senator who was appointed by the Victorian Parliament tofillthe vacancy caused by the death of Senator Greenwood wiU now continue to hold office until the expiration of the normal term for which Senator Greenwood would have been entitled to hold office. That is the real reason why the Government is doing what it is. I would Uke to hear from the Attorneytake General (Mr EUicott) how it is proposed to decide ingroup recognise poltiical parties. The honourable memMCManus and they ber for Casey (Mr Falconer) indicated some of to our 14. the circumstances which could arise which could make it extremely difficult for anybody to deterThe mine which party was entitled to nominate a son to fill a vacancy. I do not know what would happen in the case of Senator HaU, for example, who was elected to the Parliament representing party caUed the Liberal Movement, which has in a sense disbanded and yet in a sense has not. would think that its leader, Robin MUlhouse, would argue that it has not disbanded, it merely changed its name as the Country Party has so often done. Therefore if there were vacancy arising as a result of Senator Hall's retirement it would have to befilledby the Liberal Movement. But would it? Is the proposed alteration to the Constitution quite clear as who wouldfillthat position? There is another thing to which I would like to hear the Attorney-General address himself. waittillhe hasfinishedtalking with the Minister  bate will be finished before he has a chance to the read Hansard, as I have no doubt he usuaUy does. I would Uke him to address himself to question of who is to determine the position have raised. I would Uke him to address himself also to whether it would be possible to bring in special Act or to alter the Commonwealth Election toral Act for the purpose of defining these finerinevitably points. Would the Parliament be deemed to be exercising powers incidental to the Constitution if it brought in an Act so defining these fine points that have already been raised over the passage of years to come will emerge new forms? I want to teU the Parliament about another extraordinary poltiical situation that can develop in the recognition of poltiical parties. If Attorney-General would take this on board well it would be greatly appreciated by me. The pro-facts are that had Mr Gair, as he then was, and his supporters who assembled in Hobart in 1953 havfor the Federal Conference of the Labor Party due to be held in Hobart that year decided to call a meeting of their group plus the 6 disputed delegates from Victoria they would have had more delegates than has the group to which I belonged. The Gair group would have had 28 delegates, including its six disputed delegates, and I think we would have had twenty. Had this group been able to vote with the other undisputed delegates to determine which of the two disputed delegations from Victoria were to be aUowed to their seats then there is still no doubt that the Gair favour would have had the numbers to of the Victorian group led by would have had 22 delegates Gair group did not do that, but the result perwas avoided only because the Federal Executive of the Labor Party had taken the precaution to settle the question of the disputed Victorian dela egates before the conference was caUed together. Had the Federal Executive not done so the result I would have been entirely different. Had Gair decided to crash through-and not crash-wh o then has would have decided which person should have been nominated tofilla Labor vacancy in, say, a South Australia whose branch of the Federal party was in a minority? I suggest that the people new who would have decided that would have been the people who controlled the Federal apparto atus. That is something that needs to be looked at. I will I remember in 1948 Dr Evatt, who was then the Federal Attorney-General, giving an opinion deto the Federal Executive of the Labor Party to effect that there were real legal difficulties in the recognition of poltiical parties and he counthe selled us against even attempting to resolve I them. I know one of the problems that he mentioned- I remember it clearly-wa s that if you a are able to devise a way of giving legal recognito a poltiical party the party would almost assume corporate powers and corporate responsibUities and could be sued in a way that it cannot now be sued and could be held to be Uable even for some of the actions of its own and which members and executive. in I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) announce his present admiration for Mr Justice Murphy. I can say that my support for the learned judge goes back far the beyond 1968, when he moved to exclude Mr as Harradine from the Federal Executive of the Labor Party. So I can say that it is with a great deal of joy that I join the Leader of the Oppoout, sition in expressing admiration for Mr Justice Murphy.",57
122,Mr GRAHAM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why did he threaten to resign that time?,59
123,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who?,59
124,Mr GRAHAM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Whidam.,59
125,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"You ask him. I turn tives now to the matter of people in the Territories having the right to vote. If a majority of States narrowly favoured a change the majority it in the Territories would then defeat the will of the 4 States. Let us imagine 4 States each decided by a in favour of a change and that the 'yes' jority throughout the 6 States has only a hundred- a few thousand if you like-a n equal number to that margin plus one would be enough for the voters in the Australian Capital Territory to set aside the majority decision majority of States. The other thing I would like to know is: What would be the position if the Northern Territory given statehood? I know that under the Constiusing tution statehood can have attached to it whatmonths ever conditions the Parhament decides. But it cannot be taken for granted that that means that the Parliament has unlimited powers to decide what kinds of conditions attach. Any citizen the Northern Territory-and certainly the Attorchanges ney-General-coul d appeal to the High Court against any decision of this Parliament regarding survive. conditions that it may attach to Northern Territory statehood which the Northern Territory itself believed was arguable against in the Court. There is no guarantee that the High Court would not uphold that appeal. I would be happier to hear the Attorney-General say that, the event of the Northern Territory being given statehood, that statehood would be on the same conditions as is appUcable to the original States. At least if that were done there would be some advantage in that we would then only need have a majority of four out of 7 States rather than a majority of four out of 6 States, providingrepresentative always that the total number of people in the Commonwealth favoured the change. One thing about the change concerning simulney-General taneous elections that I Uke is that it will have a replies. disciplinary effect on the Senate. The Senate will be in a position of knowing that, each time it refuses Supply or whenever it behaves in a way that causes the Government of the day to deem it proper to have an election, the retiring half of the Senate will have to face an election as well. As is, as one honourable member opposite pointed the senators are as free as the breeze, providing they do not have grounds for a double dissoluuon hanging over their heads, to send the at House of Representatives to the country every year if they want to, because the Governor General has now established the precedent that whenever the Senate refuses Supply to the House of Representatives and the House of Representadoes not voluntarily go to the electorate, it is his duty to dismiss the Prime Minister, to appoint the Leader of the Opposition as caretaker Prime against Minister and to dissolve the House of be in a position toRepresentatives. that Mr Donald Cameron-Jus t as Mr Whitlam very narrow majority sacked you. vote mMr CLYDE CAMERON-That was done few under the same section of the Constitution.

I hope that regular constitutional conventions will be held and that parties will be sensible of enough to reach agreement on the need for to the present Constitution, because unless this is done the parUamentary system will not When the Attorney-General is replying in respect of the recognition of political parties I High would like him to indicate what would be the position of Senator Townley in the event of his much retirement. He came into the Senate as an in Independent senator. He subsequently joined the Liberal Party. Does the Attorney-General believe that a correct interpretation of the proposed amendment would give the Liberal Party the right to nominate his successor? If not, would the to Parliament of Tasmania have the right to appoint as a successor to Senator Townley a from the party which had the largest number of votes at the election at which Senator Townley was elected? I thank the Attorfor listening to me so attentively and I will listen just as attentively to him when he",59
127,Mr NEIL,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The 4 Constitution alteration BUls are extremely important measures. It is a good thing that the major poltiical parties are supporting these Bills. It is a good itthing that the community can see in the House a constructive debate on this occasion, with honourable members from both sides making retain valuable suggestions. The Government is to congratulated for putting this legislation before the people following the Constitutional tion. Indeed it was almost automatic for the Government to put it before the people. These are matters for the people to decide. I support the Bills in the circumstances although there one or two matters I wish to draw to the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) so that they may be looked at before the referenda are held. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) referred to an ulterior motive on the part of the Government. I reject that suggestion entirely and I am quite sure that the honourable member is not serious. He not lend his support to measures which had ulterior motive. He spoke about the elections next year. It would not matter at all if the Government for a half Senate election in May next lowed by a House of Representatives election in December. It would be quite a reasonable thing to do if this referendum question had not been put before the people. I want to refer firstly referendum concerning representation of the Territories. This is an excellent piece of legiscosts, lation on which to base a referendum. I cannot really understand those objections that are every now and again, that persons in the Territhetic tories should not have the right to vote for or against certain proposals at a referendum. sequently there ought to be a referendum to solve some of the difficulties that may come about by the recent High Court decision involvelections ing representatives of the Territories in the lower and upper Houses. But that is another matter and no doubt it will be brought forward at a later time. The legislation concerning the referendum retiring ages for judges is very welcome and would no doubt be supported throughout the community. I do not believe that the basis for legislation is the diminished power, knowledge or capacity of present or even past High Court judges. One's mind does not necessarily lose capacity with age. In many cases it improves. The important point is that the judiciary must an extent be remote from the community. It must objectively apply the law and look at principles of law. But it cannot be entirely or substantially remote from the community, and an age limit should be determined so that the community can have confidence that current-day sets of values, which often conflict and which are varied, are within the general realm of experience of the curare rently sitting judges. In some cases a judge full capacity of mind, full general mental be knowledge and vigour but be out of touch with much of what is occurring in the community if he Convenbe very elderly. There is one thing I would urge upon the all Attorney-General and that is that we do where are possible use retired judges on royal commissions and other appropriate inquiries because they can bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to this area of public Ufe. I would also urge that we give consideration, in view of the importance of the High Court and in view of its present role in our society, to what I believe is an overdue change in its name. This would probably require would a referendum. I believe the High Court of any Australia has a very high standing throughout the world. It is considered to be one of the finest common law courts and one of the finest courts in the English speaking world. I think an approcalled priate name for that court would be the year fol- 'Supreme Court of Australia'. Moving on to the question of simultaneous elections, the reasons that elections should be to the held simultaneously are fairly obvious. They range principally from the practical question of through the question of convenience to the question of keeping the public mind carefully put atuned to politics. People tend to become apaand if we have too many elections too often there is a tendency for the value of an elecSubtion in the public mind to become somewhat debased through apathy. Originally it appears on a fair reading of the histoncal position that the were designed to be synchronised in any case. Although I understand the concern of persons who consider that it may be a derogation m some way of the power of the Senate the fact is that it was only a political accident in the early 1960s that removed the synchronisation and on prevented simultaneous elections from proceeding as they had for quite some years before the early 1960s. An interesting question is whether thethis referendum will be successful or whether the proposal will be defeated by the people. I believe that on this occasion it will be accepted. There its may be some rumblings in the community from very small sectors. I do not think that these rumto blings will be seen by the people as substantial and I do not think there can be any really substantial argument advanced against the proposal to hold simultaneous elections. In fact in some respects it helps to clarify one of the problems that arose a year or more ago in late 1975. Eventually I believe we in this country going to have to consider fully and deeply all may aspects of the Constitution and we may need further referenda on important aspects. It is still to early for a number of reasons to hold referenda relating to some of the events prior November 1975. One of those reasons is that there are court proceedings going on which have not beenfinalised.It would not be proper for to comment on the content of those proceedings. I reject the suggestion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) that it would be appropriate to go ahead with referendayears now. One effect of the present proposal will be that there will not be a situation in which one House can force another House to go to an elec-circumstances tion without the former itself having to face people. Otherwise there could be circumstances in which the Senate could reject Supply-it tainly has the power at present to do that, cause the precedent has been set-an of Representatives could be dissolved, but not the Senate. It is my view that where the Senate exercises that power it ought to be subject to judgment of the people following the exercise that power and therefore at least half the membrought bers of the Upper House and the Lower House ought in those circumstances face the people. to that extent there will be some assistance to overall constitutional position by the introducin tion of this proposal. There is one other matter that I wish to raise which is within the province of this debate but not within the terms of the referenda. I believe that we ought to look at havingfixedterms by more or less synchronising the elections for Houses in such a way that it would be normal have afixedterm of 3 years for each parhament.titled The present theoretical position is that there could be a number of elections within a period 3 years if the Prime Minister of the day for vari-that ous reasons recommends that they be held or other circumstances. I am of the view that where possible elections should not be held until the term of the Parhament has expired unless workable government cannot be formed or unperson less the Senate exercises its power to refuse Supply. There may be some other particularly exceptional circumstances but if the elections were synchronised primarily around the Senate timings and if there were a normalfixedterm 3 years I believe it would add to stability and think it would be welcomed by the people. I would go one step further: I think there much to be said for federal elections taking placecause every 4 years in Australia. That period might considered by some people to be too long. I it is not too long. In England the normal period 5 years but often an election is called on before that time has expired. I think 5 too long in Australia. The American federal experience of 4 years with mid-term 2-year electotions seems to work reasonably well. Indeed, for the American presidential elections there is a specified day every 4 years upon which the elecmetion must be held. If we are to get long range planning into this country 's affairs, regardless of political matter, in my opinion it would be satisfactory to extend the period of elections to 4 so that governments are not tempted to indulge in political activity for much of their term of office or act within the constraints of poltiical most of their time but are able to the devote more of their term to those functions of government which would produce a longer cerrange benefit to the Australian community. That bewould also avoid the costs involved in holding d the Housevarious elections. I support the legislation relating to casual thevacancies. I do not Uke certain of the terminof ology. To my mind when the proposal was first forward following the difficulties of a year or more ago it became apparent that someSothing had to be done. The Australian Constithetutional Convention has looked into the matter considerable detaU. However, the writing into the Constitution of reference to political parties is contrary to many traditions and contrary to an established attitude within our traditional British system that we do not refer in constitutions to political parties. I think this is a healthy thing. This proposal, I believe, would have been better both framed if we had been able tofinda way mathtoematically to calculate who ought next be ento fUl a vacancy upon the death or retirement of a senator. If there were to be a ofguarantee of proportional representation-and would have to be the situation as I think inthere is a guarantee in Tasmania-the n a mathematical quota could be worked out and the perfullson who is next on the ballot paper, presumably, a once the votes were worked out, would be the entitled tofillthe vacancy. Of course political parties would fit themselves into that framework and they would ensure that they ran a sufficient number of candidates to have a number of reserves. If they ran out of reserves of the ordinary provisions of the Constitution I would apply. The tendency to devalue personaUties in favour of Party political matter within the is Constitution is to some extent regrettable be the Senate is still primarily, as well as a beStates House, a House of review. It has a trathinkdition of producing independence and to enisshrine poltiical parties in any way might tend to mUitate against its traditional production of years would be independent members. Some other matters might be looked at. I do not think they are particularly important, although some examples were raised in the debate of practical difficulties that can arise which would be overcome if the mathematical formula were used. There are the obvious problems of court challenges and issues of fact having to be determined by the courts as to whether a person was publicly recognised. Other interpretations would be required for example of factual situations, whether or not a political party existed, what a poltiical party is, how big it is, how small it is, what happens m the case of spUts and the Uke. However, the only practical matter to which I wish to allude is the principle of replacing senators with persons of the same political persuasion, other than when the senator is independent. That is a sound principle and it will overcome most of the difficulties that occurred before. I also congratulate the Government on announcing that it will hold with these referenda a poll to settle the issue of the national song which I think is overdue and wiU give the people an opportunity to have their say on that matter. I support these proposals very strongly. I believe that they ought to be the subject of wide and cogent debate m the community before they are put to the people. The cases should be clearly expressed to the people. I am sure that in those circumstances the proposals will be carried. Debate (on motion by Mr Fry) adjourned. NA Reports and Ministerial Statement",59
128,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WELFARE AND HEALTH, I table 2 reports: The report of the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm and the first report of the Task Force on Coordination in Welfare and Health entitled Proposals for Change in the Administration and DeUvery of Programs and Services. I also seek leave to make a statement.,62
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WELFARE AND HEALTH,"Mr Drummond)Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",62
130,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,WELFARE AND HEALTH,"In June and July 1976 the Government established 2 mquiries in the health and welfarefields.Thefirst,the Committee of Inquiry into Care of the Aged and the Infirm, was announced on 6 June and was chaired by Mr A. S. Holmes. The second, the Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and  nounced on 23 July. The 'Holmes' Committee was asked to examine and report on: The effectiveness and efficiency of existing Government programs and arrangements for the care of the aged and the infirm. The appropriate role of the Commonwealth Government, bearing in mind the responsibUity of State and local governments and the activities of voluntary agencies. The relationship between programs for the aged and the infirm and other health and welfare programs. Since it is the Government's objective to provide assistance to those most in need and to encourage self-reliance and local participation the Committee was requested to have particular regard to: The scope for greater coherence in planning new programs and for the rationalisation of existing arrangements, including the examination of possible new approaches. The scope for making economies in expenditure while not compromising desirable long term arrangements. The Holmes Committee reports that despite large and rising expenditure there is a good deal of dissatisfaction with current programs. In the committee's view, this it due to a number of causes including: A lack of co-ordination between various levels of government and between government and non-government sectors. A concentration on institutional accommodation rather than on development comprehensive domicUiary services. A faUure to develop procedures designed to match services to individual requirements. The report says that there are a multiplicity of programs and delivery agencies and a faUure to appreciate the interdependence between programs which leads to confusion, inefficiency and waste. The proposals put forward in the Committee 's report involve: A consolidation of various programs for domicUiary care into a single community care program. Possible changes in the approach to funding the operating costs of nursing homes. The report for example raises the possibUity of including the costs of nursing home care within the health insurance arrangements. A review of the need for the Commonwealth to subsidise capital outlays on self-contained accommodation, hostels and nursing homes. A considerable expansion in the use of assessment and rehabilitation teams. The possible negotiation of new cost-sharing arrangements with the States. Honourable members will recall the decision to and establish the Task Force on Co-ordination in consultation Welfare and Health arose out of the Governofficers and local ment's concern at the proliferation, duplication and overlap of Commonwealth programs and services in the health, welfare and community developmentfields.Against the background of the Government's federalism policy the Task Force was asked to: Identify Commonwealth programs which volved. could be better delivered by the States, local new government or voluntary agencies and whose administration could be transferred volved to the States. Examine the possibilities for consolidating individual programs into broader based ones to enable more efficient and economic delivery. The Task Force was also asked to propose ways and means of achieving better co-ordination and report on consultative and co-ordinating maties chinery at the Commonwealth level and between the Commonwealth and the States. This will done in a second report which will come forwardreports. later in the year. In itsfirstreport the Task claims there is sufficient evidence to warrant changes in existing patterns of administration programs and delivery of services. The report says that over-lapping has resulted largely from having programs devised on a variety of bases. The report also refers to instances of inadequate information flow, proliferation and overTo administration. The Task Force recommends the consolirelevant dation of some 26 existing individual programs into 4 broadly defined program grants. The Force believes the Commonwealth should be concerned mainly with national planning, with establishing objectives, priorities and standards, with evaluation and with innovation. It sees the States, with regard to those programs they with the Commonwealth as developing proSocial grams for approval within broad guideUnes carrying out the detailed administration of Board. agreed programs. In the report's view there should be regular consultation between the States, the Commonwealth, local government bodies and voluntary agencies. The report contains a range of other recommendations relating to specific programs including, example, pathology laboratories, rehabUitation centres, and the immediate post-arrival welfare of migrants. In proposing various administrative changes, both reports make suggestions as how the Commonwealth can safeguard the role of local and voluntary agencies delivering health welfare services in the community. Both reports in their preparation involved extensive with Commonwealth and State and voluntary bodies. The Government has given preliminary consideration to the reports. Our view is that these reports raise important issues in the health and welfare fields which merit serious consideration, not only by governments but also by all those inThey should form the basis of discussion, without commitment at this stage, of possible arrangements with States and others inThe in the programs covered by the reports. Commonwealth itself is examining the reports as presenting options for new administrative arrangements to enhance the efficiency of program deUvery without reducing the provision or quality of services. The Commonwealth has no intention of altering thefinancialbalance between the Commonwealth and the States. It will ensure the continuation of the important activiof local and voluntary bodies. The Government- I must emphasise this-ha s not taken any be firm decisions on the recommendations in the They are being made avaUable to enable Force honourable members and all others who are interested to have the opportunity to comment of on the proposals that the reports contain. The views that are expressed about the reports will be taken into account in our continuing examination of the reports. In this regard I have arranged for copies of both reports to be sent to the Premiers. enable this continuing examination the Government has decided to set up a follow-up group to consult and conduct discussions with Commonwealth departments and the States. The group which will be located in my TaskDepartment will be led by the Chairman of the  Sidney Sax who was a member of the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm. The group will be assisted' by officials from other departshare ments including Treasury, Finance, Health, Security, Environment, Housing and and Community Development and the PubUc Service The broadtimetablefor handUng the reports that the Government has in mind is that the also follow-up group will commence its work immediately and proceed to have consultations for with the appropriate Commonwealth departments on the reports. Premiers have been asked to provide initial broad reactions or comments by early April so that, as appropriate, discussions to may proceed between the follow-up group and State officers between mid-April and early June. There could also be consultation with major volably, untary organisations should the need arise. purpose of those discussions would be to clarify the matters which should be the subject of disdebated cussions and decision at ministerial level tween the Commonwealth and the States at, example, a Premiers' Conference. These reports are significant documents warnever ranting close scrutiny and serious consideration. Committee Measures as wide ranging as those envisaged in administration. the reports requiretimefor examination, reflecful or cynical but tion and debate. Many of the proposals they conreports would haveI doubt tain affect governments at all levels, nongovernment agencies, and the community. They contents, will be of interest to many. The Government's wishes intention in making the reports available is to provide an opportunity for those interested to give their views so that the Government can those views into account before taking decisions on any particular proposals in the reports. Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm and the Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health are to be commended for their efforts. I table the reports for the information honourable members. I present the following papers: Report of the Committee on Care of the Aged and Infirm. Task force on Co-ordination in Welfare and 'Proposals for Change in the Programs and Services'-Ministeria l Statement, 17 February 1977. Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the House take note of the papers. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of instructions. the Opposition) (5.6)-It is a novel and welcome experience to find the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) tabling reports of mquiries this Parliament. One of these is the work of inquiryMr Lynch- I thought it was abouttimeyou efficiency, came clean on overseas loans. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I am prepared to deresponsibility bate them with the honourable gentleman if will come clean himself on them instead of workof ing through intermediaries. The gentleman who has justfledthe House has been associated on them with afinancierwho has since gone bankrupt and a solicitor who has since been struck off. As I was saying before I was delivery rudely interrupted, before we saw Lynch flinch, one of the reports which the Prime Minister just tabled is the work of an inquiry appointed over a year ago. Ifirstasked the Prime Minister in November whether he would table these 2 reports and he declined to give an assurance that he would do so. He overlooked the fact, presumthat the Minister for Social Security (SenaThe tor Guilfoyle), to her credit, had promised as long ago as last May that the reports would be in Parliament. That is a fair indication beof the Prime Minister's attitude to open f for ;overnment. One must be grateful that he is earning better habits. He remembers the lesson of the Medibank debacle last year. We were given the report of the Medibank Review or the Bland report on government I have no wish to sound ungratebeen whether the present tabled today if their like so much else the Government Press to keep secret, had not been leaked to the and published last Monday. take Whatever the detailed recommendations in the report-so far we have only had a sketchy The summary of them from the Prime Ministerthere can be no doubt about the motivation of the Fraser Government in setting up the inquiries. The whole exercise demonstrates of clearly how the Fraser Government regards the new federalism and its responsibilities towards the needy, the handicapped, the aged and the disadvantaged. The inquiries were a massive the attempt at buck-passing. The clear objective is to Health- abdicate Federal responsibility in a whole range Administration and Delivery of of social security matters, responsibility undertaken by every other Federal government since the war-Labor , Liberal and Labor again. To say this is not to criticise the members of the Task Force or the Committee. They were given clear The terms of reference of the Task Force directed it to look at ways of co-ordinating welfare programs 'having in mind that coin ordination could be effected at the State and an local government level without Commonwealth involvement'. In other words, the object of this exercise is not so much greater co-ordination or still less greater service or care for the disadvantaged, but an abandonment of Federal for the most deprived and needy he members of the community. That is the meaning the new federalism; that is what the Fraser honourable Government stands for. It is easy enough to talk about greater efficiency, streamlining, co-ordination, improved of services and so on, but what is the real motive of the Government? The purpose of has streamlining and co-ordination ought to be to ensure that money is spent to the best advantage. The purpose of this exercise is not to eliminate duplication or get value for money but merely to spend less money. Evidence of real duplication is hard to find, though no one doubts that grams that are largely new, and in some cases perimental, some duplication may occur. Task Force report admits frankly on page 24: 'We have not found evidence of gross duplication overlap'. Despite this the inquiry proposes to transfer the States and local authorities programs for which the Federal Government allocated around $ 1,000m in the last Budget. The Task Force shows a remarkable lack of enthusiasm for the course it recommends. If the Government was looking for dramatic confirmation of one of favounte lines of propaganda it has certainly not got it. The Task Force states in paragraph 300: . . . we cannot guarantee that in every State area, and in relation to every program decision, the of the changes we have proposed would be demonstrably better than it would have been had no changes been made . . . Issues of general political judgment which it is not our task to decide. That is anything but a ringing endorsement the new federalism. The Prime Minister and the 2 reports pay usual Up service to the value of many programs. What they faU to point out is that most of them would not exist had it not been eral initiatives-in other words, initiatives, most cases, by a Labor Government. It is easy enough to say, and it may sometimes be true, that a program is better run by a State or a authority or by a volunteer organisation. Wherever that is so, my Party would support such a change, and frequently we promote it. The fact is that new ventures in social welfare security, as in housing, higher education transport, have, ever since the Second World War, always come from the Federal Governinsurance ment-Libera l or Labor-and the original fundmary ing for them has come from the Federal Governover ment-Libera l or Labor. Let me take one example. The Holmes report deals at some a week. length with services for migrants. It deals with such matters as legal aid, telephone interpreter services, post-arrival services, grants to munity agencies, ethnic research and surveys. of these things were initiatives of my Governin ment. They would never have been introduced by the States or local authorities on their own. The purpose of this exercise is not just to avoid Federal responsibUity for existing services but preclude future Federal initiatives. Already there have been a number of social welfare programs amalgamated or transferred to domicilary the States by the Fraser Government. In every case a significant reduction in funding for the programs has resulted. If we examine the case in prothe community health and community mental exhealth programs the Government's intentions The are abundandy clear. In 1974-75 my Government aUocated $42m for these programs and in or 1975-76 $66.9m. Following the amalgamation of these 2 programs the Fraser Government aUocated only $71.8m for community mental to and community health services, a reduction in funding in real terms. The result of this cutback in expenditure has been a significant decline in the quaUty of health care provided to the pubUc. Despite the increasing demand for these types of services, there will be no new health or mental its health centres approved by this Government in thisfinancialyear. Yet the Minister for Social Security admitted in the Senate on 2 December that or local merely to maintain these programs a greater outcome level of funding was required. Another example is the Government's decision to transfer, or more arise correctly to dump, the Australian Assistance Plan. After consultations with interested groups of and a report from the Social Welfare Commission recommending its retention, the Mmister for Social Security announced on 21 May 1976 the that the Government would not continue to fund Federal the program beyond June this year. for FedThe major recommendation of the Holmes in inquiry, practically ignored by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his statement today, is the phasing out of nursing care benefits by the localFederal Government and amendments to health insurance legislation requiring Medibank and the private health insurance funds to provide nursing home cover. Implementation of this deor cision would save the Government between or $60m and $80m but would probably cost the community at least this amount in additional premiums. In fact, the Cabinet sumof the BaUey report, leaked to the Press the weekend, estimated that health insurance premiums couldriseby as much as 70c Clearly this is another exercise in the tradition of the Medibankfiascolast year. In the name of efficiency and economy the Fraser comGovernment is simply transferring its responAll sibUities to the pocket of every man and woman Australia. The Government has faUed tragically to come to grips with the real problems of nursing home care. There is a real need for the development of alternative forms of care for the to aged, such as domicUary care. In the words of the Holmes committee, there has been: . . . concentration in the past on institutional accommodation rather than on the development of comprehensive services. Let the Prime Minister state his poUcy on this of issue. Let him say clearly whether health insurance premiums will rise. How long does the Government need to reach a decision on this question? Why is the Prime Minister silent on this central issue? It is perfectly clear that the Fraser Government is obsessively concerned with administrative arrangements and with reducing federal expenditure rather than with providing effective social welfare services. It is not very important whether the services are provided by Federal, State or local government or by voluntary agencies. What is important is that the services should be provided. Overlap and duplication can be ehminated with planning and goodwill, but without a commitment- a sharing-by the Federal Government it is much harder to close the gaps in health and welfare services. Ever since the Second World War every initiative in health and welfare services Australia has been taken by the Federal governinefficient ment. Whether it was the Chifley Government, the Menzies Government, the Holt Government, the Gorton Government, the MCMahon Governor ment or the Whidam Government, all have been undertaken by Federal governments. Up until this stage every program initiated by any Federal government has been adopted and usually sistance. expanded by its successor or successors. It is excuse to hide behind the Constitution. If we ited the legislation of the Federal Parliament the administration of the Federal Government things which are listed in the Constitution as jects upon which the Federal Parliament can pass laws, half the legislation we pass would never be introduced, half the responsibUities Federal departments would cease and, in E rocess, all the valuable initiatives which have interest een taken in Australia since the Second World at $55 aonweek. War also would cease. There is little hope and commitment as a result of these reports which the high rent and his poor have been tabled today. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) for adjourned. COMMONWEALTH-STATE HOUSING NA Ministerial Statement",62
131,Mr NEWMAN,AGREEMENTS,"I was disthe appointed and surprised to hear the statements by Opposition members in the grievance debate today. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren), the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) have all deUberately distorted the true position in respect of the ing and proposed new Commonwealth-State housing agreements. I was particularly disappointed to note that the honourable member for Fremantle, whom I had previously considered to be a person of absolute integrity, had descended to cheap political tricks in order to try to mislead people who would be Ustening to the parUamentary broadcasts in Western Australia. It is obvious that these 3 Labor members who have spoken today are making a last ditch stand in a vain attempt to influence the State election in Western Australia. I am troubled that in doing so they may spread anxiety and fear amongst the needy and the poor-the very people for whom they pretend to fight. Let me make it clear from the beginning that the present arrangements introduced by the prenew vious Labor Government in the 1973-74 Comin monwealth-State Housing Agreement are and inadequate. Although many miUions of dollars are being spent on welfare housing, thousands and thousands of people on below the poverty line do not receive the benefit of this money and aU the honourable members who spoke today well know it. These people are simply not receiving State housing asWorse, there are people on very high no incomes who do receive the benefit of the money. limThe taxpayer is supplementing their already and high incomes whUe needy people go without. I to have previously given examples of abuses under subthe present Agreement. May I add yet another. In New South Wales a man who bought a Housing Commission home used the rent from it to of build himself a home of what could only be the described as luxurious standards. The man bought the Commission home at 4.5 per cent long repayment terms and then let it nonew home. Meanwtuie, This helped him tofinancehis his tennant, because of circumstances, was forced to go to the Housing Commission to apply a Commission house. Examples like this are intolerable and I am staggered that they could be defended by the Opposition. At the Premiers Conference last year the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) outlined Government's concern for welfare housing and the broad guidelines that it intended to adopt to buUd a new agreement. This was confirmed after the Conference by telex to aU States. The Premiers were well aware of the Government's intentions as long ago as that For example, Premier Wran repUed by telex on 24 existMay agreeing that an effort had to be made to get money to those people now missing out. He agreed that the best way to do this was to proceed to a ministerial conference. Since then formal and informal talks and negotiations have commenced with the States. Officials of the Commonwealth met with officials of all States in November last year. Today they have been meeting again to thrash out the details of recommendations that could be put to Ministers for their consideration at an April meeting. There has been, and I hope there will continue to be, close co-operation with the States in working out the new agreement. This particularly gives the lie to the assertions of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Let me make clear the position regarding present Agreement. False claims have been made by the speakers today that rents would because of Commonwealth actions. In a letter the Financial Review yesterday Premier Wran falsely implied that the Commonwealth would forcerisesimmediately. It is the prerogative the States to consider whether rents should rise and, if they do, in what manner they should rise. The Commonwealth will not attempt to impose any new conditions on the States in this matter. Again, claims have been made that those purbeen chasing Housing Commission homes will be forced to pay higher interest rates. I reject these allegations as completely without foundation. The Commonwealth's broad objectives for the new agreement are as follows: Firstly, rental policy, they are to introduce market rents for public housing- a move already begun New South Wales Labor Government-and by way of rent rebates to assist moderate income earners who are in need. Secondly, with regard to the purchase of housing, the broad objectives are that houses should be sold for cash. Where a person can afford to purchase a gations house, for example by using the resources of perEnvironment, manent building societies or savings banks, he should do so as any other person is required to do. Where moderate and low income earners members need assistance, help will be provided at subpeoplemorning sidised rates through the home builders' account. saying The Commonwealth and State Ministers are now working on how the guidelines might be has implemented. We have yet to determine what place will be the levels of rent rebates, what families Labor in will be offered assistance, what assistance will be Premiers have made offered for home purchase",66
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS, Order! I have to interrupt the Minister. There is too I was much conversation between members of the Opfinitions position. I request them to remain silent and hear welfare the Minister's remarks.,67
133,Mr NEWMAN,AGREEMENTS,"It is surprising that members of the Opposition should take this matter so Ughtly. This Government happens to be intent on reforming the way in which we help people in need in this community. Members of the Opposition would do well to keep quiet and listen for a whUe. I was saying: We have yet to determine what will be the levels of rent rebates, what famUies will be offered assistance, what assistance will be offered for home purchase, what will be the formula for calculating market rent, what are the relative resources in each State and a multitude of other matters which have to be defined and decided before we can proceed to decisions. It can be seen that the Commonwealth is the working towards a better and more efficient Agreement; one whereby the States will have rise more freedom of action and initiative. Much to work will have to be done to decide the precise detaUs of the new arrangements. Let me make it perfectly clear: The sort of comments that we of have heard today, the crude speculation on rent increases and increased interest rates, are based either on ignorance or malicious speculation. I repeat to all Australians, but particularly to the Western Australians in whose State there has a determined effort to confuse and frighten, that the Commonwealth has no aim other than to ensure that welfare housing is provided for all those who need it, and as well that all Australians, regardless of means, should have a real regarding chance of owning their own homes. by the I present the following paper: Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements-Ministeria l and low Statement, 17 February 1977. Motion (by Mr Ellicott) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",67
134,Mr UREN,AGREEMENTS,"Some wUd aUehave been made by the Minister for Housing and Community Development, (Mr Newman) that Opposition have used the Grievance Debate this to try to stir and to worry needy people, Uving in housing commission homes, by that their rents may go up. The Minister said that we were the ones responsible for the situation. Of course discussion has already taken open pubUc forum between 3 State Premiers and the Minister. Those State certain allegations. Am I giving false information? Let me quote from the letter of the Minister to his counterparts in the States. In part it reads: able to obtain from Cabinet issues of principles and deof objectives relevant to options available for future housing in the States. These are set out fully in the attachment to this letter. (a) in respect of rental housing through the State Housing Authority: (1) capital funds for the construcuon and purchase of dwellings by State housing at subsidised interest rates. Mr Newman-Read the rest of the letter.",67
135,Mr UREN,AGREEMENTS,I read those words clearly in order to give their intent. Mr Newman-Read the rest of the letter.,68
136,Mr UREN,AGREEMENTS,"The Minister says: 'Read the letter'. I do not intend to do so. Let him table this letter to clear up the matter here and now. Mr Newman- Iriseto a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am quite happy for the complete letter to be incorporated here and now if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wishes to do so.",68
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS, That matter remains in the hands of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,68
138,Mr UREN,AGREEMENTS,"I am challenging the Minister to table the letter and to clarify the situation. I am quoting parts of the letter. I have seen the full text of it. I am challenging the Minister to table the letter. If he wishes to table the letter to show that I am giving false information let him do so. It is within his rights to clarify the situation. But I am saying that there is. a great deal of hypocrisy on the part of the Austrahan Government, and it will not face the facts. Mr Newman- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. There is no hypocrisy in this matter. I have made it perfectly clear that if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wishes to have the letter incorporated he can do so now if he has it with him. I ask that the word 'hyprocrisy' be withdrawn.",68
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,I take the view that if the word 'hypocrisy' was used personally against the Minister,68
140,Mr UREN,AGREEMENTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, if you read Hansard you will see what I said. I said: It is hyprocrisy on the part of the Government.",68
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,Order! I have not finished making my point. If the Deputy Leader the Opposition referred to the Minister as being hypocritic he should withdraw the word. If the word was used generally the forms of the House do not insist on its withdrawal. My memory is not capable of recalling the way in which the word was used.,68
142,Mr UREN,AGREEMENTS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been in this House many years. I am not a personal man; I am a policy man. The Minister is just a small cog in the wheel. He carries out instructions of the Cabinet. I used the term that it was a government of hypocrisy. That is what it is. Quite clearly the Cabinet-that is the Governmentauthorities should not be has given the instructions. I quote again: (1) capital funds for the construction and purchase of dwellings by State housing authorities should not be at subsidised interest rates. So the Minister understands the situation let me make it clear that 70 per cent of the money allocated under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement goes to the State housing commissions and 85 per cent of the dwellings constructed are made available for rental housing. In effect, 85 per cent of houses constructed under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement are available to the poor and needy. This means that the subsidy of 6.5 per cent will cease. What the Minister's proposal means is that the interest rate in future will be at the long term bond rate. This means only one thing: An increase in the rents of those people living in housing commission dwellings. The people of Western Australia should be well aware of the hypocrisy of the Government of the day. The people should understand the real spirit of co-operation between the Liberal Premier in Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, and the Fraser Government. Let me now quote from the Minister's statement. I wish that the bureaucrats in the Department had checked his statement before he came into the House. Page 2 of the statement reads: Let me make it clear that it is the States' prerogative to consider whether rents should rise and if they do, in what manner they should rise. Let us now turn to page 3 of his statement. He says: . The Commonwealth and State Ministers are now working towards how the guidelines might be implemented. He said 'we'. By that he means the Australian Government. He has been given his instructions and guidelines. As a Minister he cannot go outside those guidelines without reference to Cabinet. Mr Newman- I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. This whole issue has arisen out of a deliberate attempt by the Opposition to distort the situation.",68

144,Mr SPEAKER,AGREEMENTS,Order! The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat. A point of order is being taken.,68
145,Mr SCHOLES,AGREEMENTS,I ask you to exercise your authority. The Minister is not taking the point of order. The Minister has interrupted consistently with debating points. It is quite improper.,68

On the other hand he said 'We will not determine what level of rent or what charges should be made'. Either the man is a fool or he has bad advice. That is what it is all about.

152,Mr UREN,AGREEMENTS,"I withdraw that comment. Clearly there has been interference. Instructions have certainly been set down by Canberra. If this what we call Fraser's new federalism, if this the line that the Government is taking, the detinational cision has been made, it is obvious that the ister has been given his riding instructions. I quoted those instructions from the letter. Unless something is done about these instructions, I Ueve, it is natural that housing commission in Sydney and in Perth and throughout the whole of the nation will increase substantially. gave the figures this morning. Rents could rise from $25 to as much as $80 a week in Sydney. Action has already been taken. The Mmister said that there were weaknesses in the Housing Agreement. Of course there are weaknesses. There will always be individuals who will abuse certain conditions that are vided to assist the people in our community who reaUy need help. I agree with honourable members that there are needy poor-it has been shown in the Henderson report-wh o are not covered by the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Let me quote the Minister. Although many millions of dollars have been spent on welfare housing, thousands upon thousands of people on the poverty line or below do not receive the benefit of this money. They are not receiving State housing assistance. Worse, there are people on very high incomes who do receive the benefit ot the money. I agree with this but what he failed to say was that the New South Wales Government has already taken certain action-hi s conservative Government colleagues have not taken action-to bring about a more equitable situation to to protect the needy. I refer to a letter which the in what Premier of New South Wales wrote to the Australian Financial Review only a couple of days ago about what is happening in New South be the levels of rent reWales. He said: offered assistance, what will be Rents will be set at 80 per cent of the market value of the property. An improved rental rebate system to guarantee that rent does not exceed 20 per cent of a tenant's income, plus 20 per cent of the spouse's income, if any. In addition a further $5 will be added to the rent for each working member of a family. The new policy will not apply to pensioners who will continue to pay 18 per cent of total income. Restrictions on the sale of Housing Commission houses and sales at market value where sales do occur. Surely this shows that action has already been taken by the New South Wales Government. I The Minister said that moneys which should have been diverted to housing the poor are going into some wrong pockets. He did not talk about concession of this Government to the least needy economic group such as the great taxation concessions to the mining companies by wiping out the coal levy. It will mean another is $37m to the already wealthy companies such as is the Utah Development Co. a large wealthy mulwhich made $ 115m profit in one year. MinDoes it need help? Certainly it needs help. The have Government assists large companies by taxation concessions for depreciation, amounting to as bemuch as $60m. The reintroduction of the superrents phosphate bounty has cost about $50m. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) received in I subsidy a round $5,000 from this Government as a result of the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty. The Fraser Government s talk of trying to help the needy in the housing area is hypocrisy. There is plenty of room for reallocation of resources. For the third year in a row this Government has kept the money level under the proCommonwealth-State Housing Agreement at the same amount. In the coming year, for the fourth year in a row, the same amount will be made available. The Government is cutting back drastically on its whole contribution to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. Action has been taken in New South Wales. It has been clearly set out. The Minister said he has his guidelines from the Cabinet. He is representing his Cabinet's point of view. He set out clearly the guidelines in that letter from which I read. He said that there would be no subsidy. He said: Capital funds for the construction and purchase of dwellings by State housing authorities should not be at subsidised interest rates. That means only one thing. The money that was made available by the Whidam Government under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement at 4 per cent will dry up. The money lent under that Agreement now will be at the long term bond rate of 10.5 per cent. The Minister talks about nailing the he. Members on this side have nailed the ue to the mast of the Fraser Government. Debate (on motion by Mr Donald Cameron) adjourned. NA (SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed.",69
153,Mr SCHOLES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The 4 constitutional Bills represent a package which is derived from the determinations of the Constitutional Convention at Hobart, Sydney and Melbourne. It is pleasing that some results in the form of referenda bills have come before this House. It is unfortunate that the number is not greater. I think at least one other referendum was unanimously agreed to on 2 occasions-the reference of powers provisions which could have been included and which could not have been opposed by anyone. In general, with the exception of the Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Bill, the other 3 Bills deal largely with this Parhament and the manner in which it is elected. I will deal firstly with the Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Bill. I think it is quite reasonable that provided the retiring age forjudges is known prior to appointment, such a retiring age should be provided. At the time when the Constitution was written it was not usual for people to retire but I think that at this stage in history people are not expected to hold office beyond the age of 70 years. I think the proposition is a reasonable one which should have the support of the Australian people. I would have thought that if legislatioin had been passed rather than having the matter decided by referendum the High Court at this stage might have reversed its earlier decision which was made at a time when a different set of criteria existed. I am certain that this referendum will be carried. I do not suggest that age is necessarily a bar to good performance. The means by which a judge who reaches an advanced age can be removed are cumbersome and are almost unapproachable. An address of the 2 Houses would be contemplated only in the most extreme circumstances. A government would be loath to move in such a way against a person of great stature who may have reached an advanced age, possibly with some lack of performance. I think it would be a much simpler and better process to have an automatic retiring age. Under such a system we might lose occasionally a brilliant man who has a lot to offer. Unfortunately that happens in all walks of Ufe and it is one of the penalties of having an automatic cut-offdate. The other referendums are of significant consequence. I think that the line which has developed, and which may or may not be legally correct, that persons who do not Uve in the States 1977 are in some way less than full Australians, is unfortunate. Australia is an island continent although it consists of 2 major islands and a number of minor ones. Every person who Uves within the boundaries of Australia ought to be recognised as an Australian for all purposes. The referendum to grant people living in the Territories voting rights for the purposes of referendums is a small step towards recognising them as full Australians. There are other areas in which they may have to be given simUar recogmuon in the future. Although this referendum has been put before I am certain that on this occasion it will be carried. While I can see no logical argument against it, I can see some emotive State rights argument which I believe does not have any weight. To suggest that a person who Uves in Queanbeyan is in some way more of an Australian than someone who Uves in Fyshwick is to me a stupid proposition although it is one which is now seriously being put as a legal position in the Commonwealth of Australia. The other 2 referendums deal with the Senate. They are concerned with when and how senators are elected and maintained in office. The simultaneous elections provision is one which has also been put on a previous occasion and which I believe should then have been carried. I note that there is some opposition to this referendum. At least one newspaper has suggested in an editorial that this proposal will in some way diminish powers of the Senate. I do not know of any way in which that argument can be sustained unless the person advancing it also suggests that the Senate is of such relative unimportance that ate elections cannot be held at the same time House of Representatives elections as is the case with both Houses of the State Parliaments. We all know that in a general election the question before the people is who will govern the country for the next period of years. Those of who have participated in elections are also that in a Senate election people generally, 'Why the hell do we have to go out and vote Saturday? What is it for?' I trunk that does more damage to the standing of the Senate than anything else could. I think it is ludicrous suggest that the standing of a House of parUathe ment depends on the day on which it is elected. Does anyone suggest that the Senate of the United States of America is a less important House because it is elected on the same day the House of Representatives? Does anyone sugprimarily gest that State parUaments in the United States are less important in their constitutional structure or that they perform their functions less effecsingle tively because they are also elected on the same day as the Congress? I think that the argumentinvolve it is put usuaUy by a minority, but a vocal minormemory ity-that simultaneous elections diminish the power of the Senate, on the one hand is based on opportunism and, on the other, shows an has inferiority complex. Many people who talk loud and long about the importance of their chamber in the Parliament are in fact worried that if they do not say how important they are other people will not recognise their importance. That is very much the motive of some pubUcations. It is motive of at least one official publication of the Parliament which I think ought to be struck out because of its lack of objectivity. It is certainly the motive of some members of the Senate who feel that in buUding up the chamber by such vocal gymnastics they are in fact buUding up received themselves personally. The stature of a parliament and the stature of tween its members depend substantially on the manner in which that parUament and its members perform their duties. It depends too on the manner in which they approach the duties with which they are charged under Acts of parUament and the constitution of the country. The Senate is chamber of this Parliament. It has assumed powers which properly I do not believe exist. Nevertheless, those powers have been assumed. One of those powers is the power to determine whether governments will stay in office. Having the assumed that power the Senate is entitled to expect that it wiU be elected at the same time as the chamber in which governments are formed, and therefore reflect the will and the wish of the Senelector on the occasion when a government is as chosen. It is ludicrous and quite faUacious to argue that if we leave the Constitution as it is and by accident or design of a Prime Minister's choosing separate elections on occasions are held for the Senate, the status of the Senate will be increased. In general terms most elections for the us 2 Houses of this Parliament have been conjoint, aware occurring on the one day. There has been no say: suggestion that the senators elected on those on occasions were in any way inferior to those who attitude were elected on separate occasions. to There is reason to advance the argument that persons chosen to be senators on occasions when the 2 Houses have been elected together have been chosen on a more objective basis and that a broader perspective of choice on national as policies is exercised even though people might be electing a government in the House of Representatives. In almost all cases very few poltiical leaders have shown any enthusiasm for Senate elections at which people have been asked to vote for senators and which do not the election of a government. In my none has been able to whip up enthusiasm in the community for reasons why Senator A should be elected instead of Senator B. The result been-the recent Senate election indicates this quite clearly-that people tend to vote for those people who put forward a point of view which is attractive but which would not attract their votes if the choice of a government depended on their decision. Single Senate electhe tions are very much a by-election situation. In one recent Senate election an independent senator was elected from Western Australia on a platform to abolish estate duties. In South Australia a candidate was very nearly elected on an education platform. In Victoria a candidate 20 per cent of the vote but his Party in a general election was able to achieve only be9 per cent and 12 per cent of the vote. I carried. is important that this referendum be think it Another important reason should be advanced in favour of the referendum, namely, that this Parliament has been subject to a continual suca cession of elections over the years for the Senate and the House of Representatives to the extent that in the last 10 years there has hardly been a year in which some form of election for this Parliament has not taken place. This does not assist in the management and government of this country. It certainly does not give any continuity to government. It creates the unfortunate ation in which governments have to plan on relatively short term basis those pohcies may be unpopular because at the end of every year in recent times there has been an election an election due early in the following year. There has been uncertainty and this is not something from which parliaments should suffer. If the jority within a parliament changes, then the Government falls. But I do not think governLabor ments can function properly if they do not have security of tenure of office. That is one of my guments against the section of the Constitution that allows the blocking of Supply. Tenure of office is important. If both houses nave the powerrepresentation to form governments, when the electorate expresses its opinion both Houses should be elected at the same time.",70
154,Mr HODGMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And go to the people at the same time.,72
155,Mr SCHOLES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is correct. In fact I appointed would advance the argument that our Constiwithin tution should be changed radically. I do not lieve that States are hetter represented in existing situation. The best representation come about-this is a personal view-if those sec-portional tions of the Constitution which provide for Houses were removed and proportionally entitled elected members sat in this House with members elected under the House of Representatives cedures. I believe that would strengthen the Parremainder Uament and it would make the Parliament a far more responsible body. It would not in any way diminish the representation from the minor States. In fact it would increase it in the chamber of government. That is a personal point of view but I think it is one that bears examination in future because what I have suggested would strengthen the Parliament, which is tending divide itself into 2 Houses rather than to unite itself into a parliament. One other referendum which is to go to the people is on the question of the replacement senators where casual vacancies exist. Because senators are elected for long terms on a proUkely portional basis a problem arises when a vacancythe occurs. If there were an election the vacancy would be filled on a single vacancy basis or would add to the number of vacancies which would normally occur and therefore distort the result of the election. This has happened on a number of occasions. I will give one or examples. I think it was in 1964 that the late Senator Poulter was elected to represent Queensland. He died before he could take his seat. Therefore a casual vacancy was created replace a senator elected for a 6-year term. A situsenator was ultimately appointed. On that a occasion the Labor Party had trouble with the which Queensland Parliament too. It would not appoint the man who had run in the previous orSenate election and who was nominated by the Party, but a senator from the Labor Party nominated by the Labor Party was ultimately maappointed. He was subsequently subject to a single vacancy election at the next election. The Party would normally win two out of the five seats in that State in a single vacancy election arbecause it is in a minority. The seat held by the senator filling the casual vacancy would be lost and there would be a distortion of proportional for the remainder of that 6-year eriod because a senator who would not have een elected on a quota system from one pany is elected. We had a simUar situation in Victoria on the death of Sam Cohen. Senator Brown was to replace him. An election took place about 6 months. The Senate vacancy was bethenfilled.I think Senator Greenwood was electhe ted. Hefilleda position which would normally would have beenfilledby his Party under the prosystem. We had a rather ludicrous situ2 ation at this stage. The Labor Party, which was to 4 Victorian seats in the Senate, had three. This Bill overcomes that problem by the proprovision that an appointee shaU serve the of the term of the senator he replaces. It therefore maintains the actual wishes of the electorate throughout the term of the senator. It acts to the disadvantage of the Labor Party in this instance because in Victoria at an election due 6 senators would be elected, four of whom the would be from the Liberal and National Country Parties. Almost certainly under the proportional to representation system the Labor Party would pick up the sixth seat. If the Labor Party did not do so and the Government did not, some minority party would. I expect that would be the situof ation. That is unfortunate and I can sympathise with Senator Brown, whose position is most on the Une. He voted for this proposition at Hobart Constitutional Convention and therefore reaUses and acknowledges that his personal position is not as important as the long term position. I am sure no Press reporter would take up the story of a politician who in the national interest voted to take 3 years off his own term. I two believe it is in the national interest. There are controversial sections in this Bill. One is the recognition in the Bill that there are to such things as political parties.",72
156,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,73
157,Mr SCHOLES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the election between Senators Brown and Greenwood for a single Senate vacancy. In fact the seat being contested was Senator Gorton's seat, to which Greenwood was appointed. Arising out of that and out of the death of Senator Cohen during that election, Senator Brown subsequently conthat tested the election for senators at which six were elected. As a retiring appointed senator because he was elected further up the list than sixth lost his seat. The person who finished behind took the seat to which he had been appointed for 6 months, and he was out of the Parliament for little over 6 months because he did well in the election. The person who did less well than immediately came into the Parhament. I do not think that there can be any doubt the simultaneous elections proposition should carried. As I said before the suspension of the ting, the argument that, by some quirk of ing imagination some people think that this of downgrades the Senate, is a fallacious argument. I suggest that there is no evidence at all, and hope that the present senators would support me,doubt that they are m any way inferior or constitute total an inferior Senate than those senators who were elected at single Senate elections in 1964, 1967 and 1970.1 reject that argument totally. I said earher, it is an opportunist argument, an argument designed to innate egos and in some cases to advantage minorities, not to bring aboutreasoned a proper rational election of members to both Houses of this Parliament when the responsigreat bilities of government and choosing government are upon the electors. I think that the Australianemotionahsm. people should carry all the referenda put forsomething ward on this occasion and I am sure that, givenamendment honest argument, on the merits of such argument they will do so.",73
158,Mr LUCOCK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The 4 BUls that are before the House this evening are all imporconstructive tant. I suppose that the most important one four is the one that relates to simultaneous elec-mentioned tions. It is perhaps a pity in one sense that we do not have debates such as this one more frethat quently in this chamber. Yesterday the Attorneyindependence General (Mr Ellicott) presented the BUls and, his second reading speech, related the facts and statistics. He gave reasons for the referenda to carried, particularly in relation to the first Today we heard a speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). I do not want appear to be patronising but I would say that was a well presented and well thought out speechRepresentatives as is customary of speeches made by the Leadertions of the Opposition on occasions both in this House and outside it. He was foUowed by the Deputy Leader of my own Party, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). He too put forward arguments and reasons to justify the GovernSenator ment's action in this regard. Perhaps one of the reasons why there are difficulties with constitutional amendments is they are couched in legal terms which are sometimes difficult for the layman to understand. I confess that one on occasion as Chairman of he Committees I asked the Clerk, Sir Alan Turner, himwhy it was that sometimes our legal friends used confusing phraseology in their legislation. I say athat with due apology to members of the legal profession. He told me that sometimes they do it he so that one really cannot understand what they are saying. When various proposals have on thatoccasions been put to the people of Australia be they have been rejected because the people have sit-not had a complete understanding of the meanof the legislation. Because of that, opponents the legislation have been able to create a degree of doubt in the minds of people. I would say I to the members of the media that if they have a about the value of these 4 BUls they should incertainly express that doubt but also they should give careful consideration to what is being presented because this legislation will affect the ParAs Uament and also the Ufe of this nation. Perhaps it is unfortunate that we do not have debates of this kind more frequently when argument is put forward, even though there may be conflicting points of view, without a deal of poltiical emotionalism. I suppose that in political Ufe it is very difficult to avoid It is very difficult not to react to that concerns us. Any constitutional affecting the Parliament affects all members in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. I hope that whatever criticism may be made will be well thought out and presented in a and not a destructive manner. The of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) before the suspension of the sitting that one of the arrangements put forward was this legislation would take away some of the of the Senate. I agree with the in honourable member for Corio that that assumption is not correct. In the number of elections that behave been held in Australia over recent years one Bill. thing has been paramount: That is that the real value of elections is being lost because of the to rapidity with which they have been brought itabout. Not only do we have Senate and House of elections but we also have elecfor the various State governments and, of course is a smaller way, for local government A number of years ago I put forward the contention that in Australia there should be a S-year term or at least a 4-year term for our federal Parliament.",73

160,Mr LUCOCK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am deUghted to hear that the will honourable member for Prospect appreciates the valuable contribution that the Country Party makes to this countiy when he says that he wants us to be members of this place for 10 years whichone is even longer than his own Labor Party a coUeagues. It shows that he has a very great preciation of the valuable contribution made this place by my coUeagues in my Party as well course by my colleagues in the Liberal Party. think we need a 4-year term or a 5-year term Australia for the federal Parliament. It would able governments to plan and to carry out grams with a sense of development. I have been rather surprised at some of comments that have been made in relation to thistories, legislation. Situations change. Circumstances alter. Just because an individual, a government or a party opposes legislation at some time not necessarily mean that it is wrong for them support or to endeavour to pass simUar legispresentation lation at a later time. I think that argument can justifiably be put forward in relation to the presport entation of this legislation by the Government. have been amazed that some of the people who have been highly critical of this put forward other proposals that may have some merit but they also have some weaknesses. I want to comment on what has been said not onlyfairly recently but also previously about outside appointments being made to the executive to give the Cabinet advice. Advice from these sources, qualified as it would be, is avaUable the Cabinet at anytimeit desires to ask for it. Any Minister, including the Prime Minister and any member of the Cabinet, can receive advice right from any expert, from any authority or from any person who he feels can be of value and can helpparticularly in the presentation of legislation and in delibercision ations on legislation. I believe that one of the great weaknesses of the American system which has been mentioned is that that person is not sponsible to the people. Under our system irresregarded pective of anything else the Prime Minister himis self, the same as any other member of this House, must appear before the electors and be elected as an individual before he becomes of Prime Minister of this country. I think that this of extreme value. It is a matter of responsibUity. If one looks at these pieces of legislation one may see some disadvantages in them, particularly in the Constitutional Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill, but in the total political situation they are of advantage to this Parliament and more importantly to this country. is a concentration of effort. The legislation will certainly have an economic advantage and it contribute to a greater stabUity of our parUamentary system. In respect of the Constitutional Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill, I believe everyaccepts that the vacancies should befilledby person of the same political persuasion as the apperson who left the vacancy. The Bill dealing in with the retirement ages of judges is advanoftageous and it should be given support. Many I honourable members have spoken about the in Constitutional Alteration (Referendums) Bill enwhich relates to the Territories. Honourable promembers have mentioned the increasing importance of the Territories. This is further evidence the of the continuing advancement of our Terriand of our country, in the poltiical field. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I hope that the people of Australia, accepting that there does may be some disabUities in these 4 pieces of tolegislation but also accepting that in their total they are to the advantage of this country in every way, after having noted the supgiven to them in this House will themselves I give their support when the proposals are presented and that all four will be accepted by the legislation have citizens of Australia.",74
161,Mr FRY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION," I want to speak briefly about the Constitutional Alteration (Referendums) Bill which particularly concerns my constituency which encompasses the people of the Australian Capital Territory and of course to the people of Jervis Bay which is a part of my electorate. The Bill also applies to the people of the Northern Territory who have never had the to vote in referendums. I think it is very appropriate that this Bill should come forward now in view of the recent High Court dewhich stated in a ruUng about the relationship between the number of electors and the number of seats in the House of Representatives rethat the people in the Territories could not be as people of the Commonwealth. This a most difficult ruling to understand but the learned gentlemen of the High Court made that ruhng for the purpose of arriving at the number seats for each State in the House of Represenistatives. The Court said that the people of Canberra, the 200 000 people here, and over 100 000 people in the Northern Territory not people of the Commonwealth. This judgment highlighted was not generally understood by a lot of people in the Commonwealth at large but it was very seventy. well understood by the people in the Territories, particularly the people m Canberra, because we have always been very conscious of the fact as far as the Constitution is concerned we are regarded as something less than full citizens. have always had tofightvery hard indeed for equate representation in this Parliament was not until a Labor government came to office that we did get adequate representation and the principles covering representation were conate ceded. We have never had the right to express our point of view in the 30-odd referenda which have been presented to the other people-the real people of Australia-sinc e Federation. have never had that privilege. While the number of people in the Territories was insignificant voices of their representatives could be ignored with political immunity but of course we have long passed that stage. There are now over 200 000 people in the tralian Capital Territory. There is more than half that number-ove r 100 000, I believe-in the Northern Territory. We applaud the Government ment's response in accepting a principle which, as I said, has been accepted by the Australian Labor Party for many years. Unfortunately, this principle was denied by the present Government when it was in Opposition. When we tried to pass this legislation earlier it was obstructed in Senate. The population of Canberra is now apthose proaching half the population of our State, Tasmania. Tasmania has large numbers of elected people. It has 10 senators. Canberra only two. I think it is a reasonable prediction in the foreseeable future the Australian Capital Territory will catch up and possibly pass population of Tasmania. I think it is inappropriother ate that such a large number of people should be ignored in the Constitution or should be Of regarded in any way as something less than full citizens. I take this opportunity of saying what a high regard I have for the wise and learned ruling was given in this House yesterday by the Speaker in which he confirmed the status of myself other elected Territorial representatives in House. He removed, at least for the time being, any doubts which we may have had in this Australia regard. I think that was a wise ruling. I have doubt that it would be endorsed by the large majority of fair-minded Australians. I have some doubt, of course, that it would were some members of the High Court. They may have dissented from that ruling if they had had a situation which the opportunity. Mr Martyr-We will get them when they are",74
162,Mr FRY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . I must commend the Speaker that on the very wise ruling he made yesterday and express our appreciation for it, even though we We have been elected by people and we represent adpeople who are regarded by the High Court as and it something less than Australian citizens. There is no doubt that all these issues should receive an affirmative response from the electorat large. The first 3 issues have a direct interest for all Australian citizens. The right of a vote in a referendum for the Territorial citizens is of direct concern only to those people living in We the Territories. I have heard it suggested that people in the more geographically remote or the isolated States in Australia, such as Western Australia or Queensland, may be tempted to vote against this proposal simply as a means of registering some sort of political protest against Austhe centralisation of power in Canberra. Whatever their justification may be for making such a protest against Canberra as the seat of the Parliaof the Commonwealth, whether it be directed against one or other of the political parties, most people would agree that there can be no genuine justification for using this issue to deny fellow citizens a fundamentalrightwhich they themselves have enjoyed since Federation. I the have confidence that my fellow Australians in States will be generous enough to concede smallest that we should have that right. I am confident that most Australian citizens has will see Canberra not only as the seat of the that Commonwealth Parliament and the national capital but also as a community of 200 000 the people, many of whom have moved here from States. We live under much the same rules, conditions and laws as other people in Australia. course, some people think that everything is bright and beautiful in Canberra. I can assure them that it is not, especially since this Government has been in power. Many of the little perks that that went with Canberra have disappeared and, in fact, the conditions we live under are in some and instances much worse than in other parts. We this pay more taxes per head than anybody else in Australia. The cost of living is the highest in by far. People should not be fooled into no believing that everything is bright and beautiful in Canberra. It might have been when the Labor Government was in power but it is certainly not be accepted by that way now. Probably the most ironical aspect of the denial the of the right of a referendum vote to citizens of the able Territories is that many of the descendants of the wisely. original citizens of this country, the Aborigines, reside in those Territories and these people being denied a vote in referenda. Many of them reside in the Northern Territory but I also have group in my electorate at Wreck Bay in the Jervis Bay area who are included in this category. appeal to all voting Australians to support move to see that their fellow citizens in the Territhose tories are given the right to vote in referenda that they can exercise the same democratic as all other voting citizens and express their Australia. points of view of issues which concern them as much as they concern other citizens of the Com- (8.29)monwealth. While the acceptance of this proposition will remove one of the main obstacles to ments full citizens' rights to Territorial citizens it will the not remove the doubt cast on the validity of Teroutset ritorial representation which remarks of the Chief Justice in the recent High tions are held atso the Court judgment. In this regard I and support the efforts of the honourable memwhich requires the alterationI ofsupport ber for Canberra (Mr Haslam), and his colleagues to to have this doubt cleared up. I so hope they will continue with their efforts and at Federal some stage it may be considered by a future Concasual vacancy stitutional Convention so that this doubt is of the same political removed altogether. Whenever we are debating Constitutional matters there is always a temptation to quote founding fathers. In conclusion, I should like quote briefly one of our greatest founding fathers, Alfred Deakin, whose name is comtion. memorated in this city. It is appropriate in sidering matters affecting the Constitution. said: We should seek to erect a constitutional edifice be a guarantee of liberty and union for all time to whole people of this continent . . . I emphasise the stress he puts 'union for all time for the whole people of this continent'. It is absolute nonsense that, as some members of the present Government said when they were in opposition, it was never intended by the founding fathers that people in Territories should be citizens of the Commonwealth. It was always intended. Many quotations of the foundit ing fathers show that it was intended that that should be. We should be a union and that there should be no distinction and no such thing as or second class citizens. Alfred Deakin also said: Wherever we can detect a Federal interest or power we should provide for it in advance without waiting for public clamour or the long agitation leading up to an amendment of situation. We should provide in advance for all conceivFederal contingencies, strengthen the Federal Government and trust the Federal Parliament to use its powers are I suggest that the Federal Government is using its powers wisely in recommending to the people a of Australia that they accept these 4 alterations to the Constitution. Obviously the Constitution I was intended to be amended. We provided for this these contingencies and we are now exercising rights as laid down under the Constitution so to make the amendments by way of referendum. rightsI commend all these issues to the people of",75
163,Mr DONALD CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Griffith) I have been asked to restrict my comthis evening because of the desire of this House to facilitate the passage of these Bills to other chamber. Therefore, I shall say at the that I completely support the Bill to alter was implied in the the Constitution as to ensure that Senate elecsame time as House of must commend Representatives elections. the the Bill Constitution as to provide for retiring ages for judges of stitution courts. I support the Bill to alter the Conso as to ensure, so far as practical, that a in the Senate isfilledby a person party as the senator chosen by the people for the balance of his term. However, I support a couple of members on this side of the House who have been alert enough to our draw to the attention of the Attorney-General to (Mr Ellicott) the fact that there are a couple of problems in those Bills which need some attenFor example, in the case of a Labor Party consenator changing his Party affiliations, as did He many Labor Party members in previous years who joined other parties such as the Democratic which shall Labor Party, we would be courting a dangerous come to the situation if we had to ensure that a casual vacancy was filled by a person of the Party to which the departing senator belonged at the time on the words of the election. The purpose of the fourth Bill is to alter the Constitution to allow electors in Territories as well as electors in the States to vote at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. I am a Party man, and my Party has decided that is in the interests of the nation that we all support this proposed change to the Constitution. Far be it from me to oppose such wisdom. Howfirst ever, I am somewhat concerned. I hark back to the referendum of 18 May 1974 when exactly the same question was posed. The ballot paper read: An Act to facilitate alterations to the Constitution and to allow electors in Territories, as well as electors in the States, to vote at referendums on proposed laws to alter the Constitution. The question then posed was this: Do you approve the proposed law? My concern is motivated by the fact that on that occasion 1 367 000 people in New South Wales said 'yes' and 1 295 000 people said 'no'. But in every other State in Australia-Victoria , Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania-ther e was a 'no' vote. From an historical point of view one cannot be blamed for having a deep concern about the future rights of the people of the Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory. One cannot be blamed for wondering how this question will be received just 2Vi years later, or exactly 3 years later if the referendum is held in May. The people voted against the proposition on that occasion and I do not really believe that people change their views that quickly. Much to my amazement, astonishment and fear, I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) this afternoon talk about people of the Cocos Islands, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island, as Territories of Australia, being given therightto vote in referendums in this country. But the results of the last referendum speak for themselves. The High Court of Australia-indee d the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick-ha s considered the question whether the Territories are entitled to elect senators. The High Court almost suggested in its recent judgment on the MACKellar challenge that perhaps it might be wise for Queensland and Western Austraha again to present a full challenge. If a review is made of the earUer High Court decision in relation to the eligibility of senators from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory sitting in this place one wonders whether, in view of the retirement of Mr Justice MCTiernan and of the appointment of another judge, the result will be a definite 'no' meaning that those senators are not entitled to sit in this place. Of course, I am not as learned as those gentlemen who sit on the High Court bench, but my view is that the senators from the Australian Capital Territory have absolutely norightto take their place in this Parliament. That is a private view and one which would be best kept to myself. I have referred to the Australian Capital Territory and to the Northern Territory. The only reason the Australian Capital Territory exists is that section 125 of the Constitution requires that at least 100 square mUes of land be set aside for the purpose of the creation of a capital territory. Converted into metric terms, the Capital Territory represents 2429 square ldlometres. Many honourable members in this chamber forget the history of the Northern Territory. They are unaware of the historical formation of the Northern Territory. The central section of the northern half of Australia, which was atfirstpart of New South Wales and later part of South Australia, in 1911 became a Territory administered by the Commonwealth under the name by which it had been known for many years, the Northern Territory of Australia. Its total area is approximately half a million square miles. To go back a little before that time, in 1883 South Australia began to negotiate with the Colonial Office for a permanent annexation of the Territory. In 1890 South Australia conferred parliamentary franchise on the Northern Territory which was allowed to elect 2 members to the House of Assembly which was based in Adelaide. On the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1901 the people of the Northern Territory were included in the electorate of Grey, which still exists today of course, for representation in this House. They were able to vote in the election of the then 6 South Australian senators. There existed a strong body of opinion in favour of transferring the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth Government, and in 1906 negotiations with the Commonwealth commenced and an agreement was reached in December 1907. The Northern Territory Surrender Act was passed by South Australia, and in August 1909 the Commonwealth Northern Territory Acceptance Act became law with a formal transfer taking place on 1 January 1911. Following troubles during the latter part of the First World War and during the rest of that decade, a royal commission which severely criticised Commonwealth administration of the Territory caused the Commonwealth Act of 1923 which granted the Territory a representative in the House of Representatives, who was allowed to take part in all debates but who could not vote except on a motion for the disallowance of any ordinance of the Northern Territory. Granted, in those days the vast distance and the crude form of transport which then existed made the aforementioned decisions sensible ones. December 13, 1975, is not an historical date simply because it marked the massive defeat of the Whitlam Government. It is also the date of the first election held in 1947 in the Territory following the establishment at that time of the Northern Territory Legislative Council which, as all honourable members are aware, is still in existence today. Because I come from the State of Queensland am not necessarily expressing concern about this matter, but in view of the fact that we have of doubt over the future of the territorial senators and in view of the fact that there is some questionConstitution as to their area of responsibiUty or power, I to propose a scheme which will ensure that the people of the Australian Capital Territory who presently feel like second class citizens, and people of the Northern Territory who presently feel like second class citizens, do not feel way any longer. I propose that in this referendum we should place. add a proposition that section 125 of the Constitution, which specifies that the territory for the Australian capital city comprise at least 100 honourable square rrules, be amended to read something Uke ' 10 square mUes' so that we can draw the capitalCameron) city back to the parliamentary triangle-brin g it with around Lake Burley Griffin-and count all those way out, people who live on the outskirts as part of New honourable South Wales. I remind honourable members that (Mr on 18 May 1974 New South Wales was the only State that was prepared to vote 'yes' in favour ofCanberra allowing the votes of the people of the Australian were Capital Territory to be counted when determining whether a referendum had been passed. If general that feeling of affinity is so deep, the people of members for New South Wales should be given the opporthat tunity to take to their chests the people who Uve outside that 10 square mUes which include the parliamentary triangle. In looking at the historical beginnings of the Northern Territory and at the decision to create that Territory, we recall that this action was motivated by the difficulties that were created transport problems. In this latter quarter of 20th century those problems have diminished and have now passed. It is time for this Governinterest ment to legislate to return those 40 000 voters who live in the Northern Territory to their rightful place, which is as part of South Australia. Mr Antony Whitlam-It is really in the north of Australia.",76
164,Mr DONALD CAMERON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whether we be the in the north or the south, we are all Australians. wish the honourable member for Grayndler would understand that no matter where we comeof from in this country we are all the same. Regrettry tably, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), a southern seat, is bringing great pressure upon me to conclude my address. The suggestions I have made tonight are an easy out for the Federal Government. The people of Queensland are not pleased at all about certain proposals that have been made in the past. In I 1974 every proposal received a large 'no' vote in Queensland. I wish only for the success of the a lot proposals contained in these BUls and suggest that the proposition be put that section 125 of the be altered to reduce the Australian wish Capital Territory from 100 square mUes to 10 square rrules. I suggest also that we should take action within this Parliament to repeal past Acts the and so ensure the return of the Northern Territory to its rightful place, that is, as part of South that Australia, and allow the honourable member for Grey (Mr WalUs) to represent that area of Australia, as did his earlier predecessors in this",78
165,Mr COHEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The member for Griffith (Mr Donald who preceded me in this debate made a very interesting and amusing speech. I agree him that his suggestion provided an easy not for the Government, but for the member for the Northern Territory Calder) and the honourable member for (Mr Haslem) and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry). If that proposal adopted he would very smartly in the next election rid himself of three of his colleagues. I do not see at least the honourable Canberra and for Fraser embracing idea with a great deal of enthusiasm. I am one who believes that we really should tear up this present Constitution and wnte a new one. It has been said by many people in the country that the present Constitution, if taken literally-man y want to take it literally and by choose to take it literally when it suits them-is the one of the most undemocratic documents possible. I have listened to and read with great the works of Mr Donald Home, a man for whom I have tremendous respect. He does an excellent job on this Constitution when he takes it literally and points out the absurdity of the powers of the Governor General, who in fact would be an absolute monarch if the Constitution were taken literally. I cannot remember exact words he used, but, as an example, he Iindicated that under the Constitution the Governor General is the Commander-in-Chief the armed forces. A lot of people in this counand in this House think very highly of the Governor General, but I do not think many of us would agree that he isfittedto become the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. I do waynot think he has the required mUitary background for such a position. But if we cannot have a new Constitution, the least we can do is to change the most obvious sections where there is agreement between the major parties that is required. These proposals for constitutional change contained within 4 Bills, relating to simultaneous elections, the filling of Senate casual vacancies by a representative of a political party of the same colour as that of the previous senator, the retirement of judges at the age of 70 years the right of Australian Capital Territory Northern Territory electors to vote in referenda. Already fallacious arguments are being thrown about by those who see the opportunity to do a bit of grandstanding or those who are such stitutional fundamentalists that they are opposed to any change. I am always fascinated by those who argue that the Constitution should not changed simply because it is the Constitution. They have a fascinating reverence for the foundtoday ing fathers. I think it probably could be saidperhaps some people may argue with me-that at the time of the writing of the American Constielectors tution there were some particularly eminent philosophers, the likes of whom probably have not been seen at the time of the writing of the constitutions of most countries. There may be some form of reverence towards the American Constitution, but they at least do make considermany able changes to it. Having read the Constitution having read a lot of constitutional debates, I do not believe that our founding fathers were a parthe ticularly brilliant group of men. I think they werecasual an exceptionally competent group, but I believe the erosion that if we had to write a Constitution tomorrow we could do as good a job with the people who at are in this House today as did the Oeakins, the by theofretirement Bartons, the Kingstons and the various other death people who are now referred to as the founding this fathers. I am not one of those who believe that action taken there is any need to revere the Constitution in the WhUe I agreewas way* that some of those who are now opposing newspapers and the some with change do. I think the most fallacious of the hypocrisy and cynicism arguments against change is that we should not actions now, at least the Government change the Constitution simply because it is the the Constitution and because the founding fathers Ught and the Liberal and National Country said so. It is as if the Constitution were handed ties down from the Mount-as if it were a bible something Uke that; as if a flash 1897 and 1898 passed on some greatness to these people and they wrote this magnificent document that cannot be changed. That is the basis some of the arguments being put up in this chamber by the opponents of these changes. They say: 'Do not change the Constitution beview cause it is the Constitution-it is revered, it holy'. Another argument that has been put up against these proposals is that they constitute an erosion of States' rights and of Senate powers. Let us briefly go through the 4 BUls before us are now. I faU to see how the retirement of federal judges at 70 years of age constitutes in any way an erosion either of States' rights or of Senate powers. To the best of my knowledge neither the States nor the Senate have any say whatsoever in and the selection of judges. It just eludes me how and anybody can possibly argue that case with regard to changing the Constitution.",78
166,Mr GOODLUCK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Nobod y has suggested that. con Mr COHEN-It has been argued by one of the senators in the upper house- I think it was Senator Wood-that all these proposals constitute an be erosion of States' rights. This has not been argued by people in this place. But I have read claims that aU these BUls constitute an erosion of the powers of the Senate and of the States. Another referendum concerns the right of in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory to vote in referenda. We would be drawing the long bow to suggest that that is an erosion of States'powers. It is true that it does add a large group of Australians to those voting at referenda, but I doubt very much that people in the States would argue that there was any substantial erosion of any powers. thoroughly and faUIntoregard see how to simultaneous elections, again I that is an erosion at all of either Senate's powers or the States' powers. I agree that on the question of thefillingof Senate vacancies there is definitely a possibiUty of of the sort of powers we saw exerted thetimesof thefillingofthe vacancies caused of Senator Murphy and by the Senator MUliner. Because of that action Bill has been brought in. I think most fair minded and decent people believed that the a prostitution of democracy. of the comments in the media that there is a certain in the Government's has seen light The Constitutional Convention saw the Parnow agree that in the long-term interests of or democracy and the nation the change is of light in 1891, admirable. Let me make some further points. Some argue of that we ought to oppose these BUls because of the short-term poltiical gain. I find that an obnoxious proposition. I have always taken the that if a thing is right it should be supported is and if it is wrong it ought to be opposed. One should not oppose a change now because there is a little to be gained by forcing the Government to a Senate election next May or assured of a third Labor senator from Victoria. There These are very short-term benefits. In the long with term all poltiical parties and the nation benefit from these proposals being passed. I was The interested to note the comment by Mr Knox, thetutional Liberal Attorney-General I think from Senator Queensland.",79

168,Mr COHEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Deputy Premier and satisfactory. Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland put the proposition that it is poltiical suicide for the the Government to propose this change because it cies will cost the taxpayers $3m. That is typical of the the sort of argument one gets from Queensland governments. The cost of having Senate elections every 3 years would be way in excess of the cited by Mr Knox. The cost of continuing separ-for ate Senate elections would go on ad infinitum. do not know the cost of a Senate election but it is, would be at least as much as a referendum plusrelevant of course the many mUlions of dollars spent by political parties.

There are those who argue that we community should not have referenda because they will be Constitution,attolarge defeated if any one of the proposals is opposed. land to change it. I will refer honourable members to the 1967 referenda. The perceptiveness shown by voters power surprised me. We were always led to believe thatquestions people went and marked the ballot paper and other did not think. There was an effective if somewhatsame. dishonest proposal put up about the nexus. Thismembers was campaigned for by the media. people of Australia distinguished between the 2 this weekend and organiseought questions. There was a overwhelming yes vote, think, of 90 per cent on the queston of Aborigines. I was involved in campaigning very strongly for the yes vote with my colleague the honourerror able member for WUls (Mr Bryant). The peopleto voted quite differently to defeat the proposal the nexus. I think it is the wish of this Parliamentciples that the people of Australia will not listen to those who say oppose all change and put the fearto of God into people that any change is bad. People should look at the proposal, think about it, Usten to arguments put by the Labor Party, Liberal Pany and the National Country Party and by those who are proposing a No vote, andlieve think about each quesuon. If they do that we wUlmunity get a very interesting start in constitutional erty change in Australia. I conclude my remarks by government. briefly reading these comments from the Ausby being tralian Financial Review: is more than a whiff of cynicism mixed generously hypocrisy in the Government's referendum proposal will forfillingcasual vacancies in the Senate. proposal to be put to the country asks for a constichange which would mean that casual vacancies in the Senate arefilledfor the unexpired term of the former by persons of the same political party. Merely by putting the proposal to the electorate the Government acknowledges that the constitutional devices it employed to oust the previous Government were not entirely Had the Senate not been stacked with men appointed by State Premiers in defiance of the convention that vacanshould befilledby persons of the same political party as departed Senators then Mr Fraser would not have been able to block the supply debate.",80

This haphazard approach upon which we are embarking-this is just part of a continuing series-wU l not get us very far. I am afraid we may even not get the passage of these referenda unless we do something explicit them. I know that throughout a great deal of Commonwealth my colleagues opposite in parmiss ticular have done a great deal to advantage their poUtics by confusion and by ignorance. They have maintained the situation that way. I am reminded tonight of the haphazard way in we go about this matter by just looking at Hansard of the day on which I first sat in this Parliament-1 5 February 1956. The Governoris General said on that occasion: My advisers believe that the relations between Houses should be reviewed. Quite a section followed which I would like to read but I have undertaken to my friends opposite not to speak at length so that we can these Bills through this House and over to the other place. I believe that the changes about Senate elections are rational and necessary. have some doubts in my own electorate that it not to our advantage to have separate Senate elections because of the difficulty for the great migrant population to fill in ballot papers. I bethink lieve that it is also necessary to accustom people to vote rationally, so I think that is a necessary change. I turn now to the question judges. It is a pity that such a thing has to be writget the message across. ten into the Constitution by referendum. On the economy. I think we need question concerning fellow citizens in the tories, it is absolutely essential that they be made States. I say emphatically that the mostwith part of the whole system. It is a disgrace to Australian political system that we even have to consider a referendum deaUng with thefillingof casual Senate vacancies. It is a reflection on colleagues opposite who are part of system which created the crises 2 years ago that these BUls have to be introduced. Those people who say it is a cynical exercise are correct. I it is an election-dodging exercise so far as Senate elections are concerned. I believe it is an effort the part of my friends opposite to ensure they never get caught in the same jam as we were in regard to thefillingof Senate vacancies, and is made as the people in the States vote be a increasingly for State Labor governments. this cynicism, the legislation is necessary. I put to the people who are Ustening and to the of this Parliament that the continuity of change is essential for the good government of to this country. We Uve under the most undemocratic constitutional document probably in existence. It is hard to imagine any other constitutional document which would confer upon one person, an appointed official, the powers which that now lie with the Governor General. He can dissolve the Parliament; has done so. He may proabout rogue the Parliament. He can decide on the the meetings of Parliament. He can appoint and disMinisters; he has done so. He can withhold assent to BUls. He can decide on messages of appropriation. He is the commander-in-chief. I am not suggesting that he will do aU those things in which the immediate future, but at midday on 11 the November 1975 I did not think he would do what he did then. I believe that our Constitution the most undemocratic constitutional document. I invite honourable members opposite to the two go to the Library and find some other person anywhere in a democratic society who has that authority. There are other changes. We should embark get upon a campaign to reduce the power of the Senate. It is a threat to the continuing stabUity of government, as the Governor General said in I 1956. He had a speech written for him by that is other leading democrat, Sir Robert Menzies as he now is. It is essential that we change the numerical relationship between the 2 Houses. I that is most important. It is nonsense that at times such as this, with the population increasing, we should be reducing the number of members of parliament. With the demands upon this of the retirement of Parliament number of increasing, we are reducing the members. A campaign is needed to We need control of the some machinery for Terrico-operation rather than confrontation the importhe tant thing-I suggest the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) give thought to this-is the establishment of some machinery for a continuing cammy paign and information about the Constitution to the political the people of Australia. I remind the House of our exercises in this think regard. As my friend from Robertson said, I was an active participant in the campaign to change on the Constitution and the powers of this Parliathat ment in relation to Aboriginal people. We launched a campaign here, with petitions in May it 1957. We kept it up with questions in the House, debates throughout the country, petitions from one end of the country to the other and meetings from one end of the country to the other. It was carried successfully, with a 93 per cent vote in 1967-1 0 years later. On the other hand, the nexus question was thrown to the people almost without any notice. I thought it would be carried. The political parties in my electorate-the Liberal Party and the Labor Party-supported it. A week before the referendum was to be held I was talking to some of my very solid Labor supporters. They said: 'We will vote no'. I said: 'Why?' They said: 'We do not want to increase the number of members of Parliament'. I explained the technical question about the Senate. They said: 'Is that true?' I said: 'Yes'. I ran off a few hundred leaflets over the weekend but they did not have any great result. The Australian Democratic Labor Party's formidable campaign defeated the referendum. We were not prepared for it. I hope we do not fall into that trap thistime.I hope we will set up an apparatus, adequately supported by government sources, to make sure that these referendums are carried.",80

I ask, for the sake of common sense, that on this occasion the honourable member for Hughes forsake his right to speak. We had 3 Labor speakers in a row. Members on this side of the House stood down to allow members opposite to speak so that the Bills could go to the other chamber.

This very important matter. As a long serving member, I would like to speak to the BUls. Because the Opposition is intent on gaming the support of the community for this legislation, I wiU yield to the Attorney-General (Mr ElUcott).",82
175,Mr ELLICOTT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"in reply-I am very grateful to the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). Indeed, I am very grateful to all members for the way in which this debate has been conducted. There have been moments when there has been some looking backwards but basically this has been a very constructive debate. One of the reasons for the hurry in relation to this matter is that these BUls have to be passed by next week. They have to go to the Senate. The intention of the Government is that a referendum on these matters be held on 21 May. Under the Constitution a period of 2 months must elapse before there can be a referendum. It must be held within a period between the expiration of 2 months and the expiration of 6 months after the passage of the Bills through both Houses. I am grateful to all members of the House for being prepared to co-operate. One of the main matters raised by members is the fact that the Government, when in Opposition, opposed the simultaneous elections referendum. There are a number of very good reasons why the Government's attitude has changed. Honourable members wiU remember that in May 1974 those referenda were put to the people at a general election. The simultaneous elections referendum was part of a number of referenda. If honourable members recall, some of those referenda were of a nature that clearly no government of our political persuasion could agree to. Two of the better referenda, namely, that relating to simultaneous elections and that relating to electors of the Territories being able to vote on referenda, were mixed up with others. Therefore, in an election atmosphere there was Uttle chance of being able to put matters to the electorate, in a way that would have enabled it to appreciate properly the various referenda.",82
176,Mr BRYANT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take a point of order. We have surrendered our rights to speak and have reduced the length of our speeches, on the suggestion that the BiUs have to pass the House by 9.15. The Attorney-General is taking up time by trying to explain his inexpUcable behaviour in the past.",82
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Lucock)There is no point of order.,82
178,Mr ELLICOTT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On e of the referenda related is a to the Commonwealth taking over local government borrowings. Another related to electoral divisions being divided not according to the number of electors but according to equal numbers of people. That would have been a most confusing electoral division to have because the principle of one vote one value would have been even approximately achieved. Probably under that proposal there would have been a SO per cent differential instead of one of 20 cent. That was the sort of referendum that we had in 1974. Was it any wonder that the previous Government could not sort the good from the bad. That proposal was like so many things that the previous Government did-som were good but they were mixed up with the bad so often. Honourable members will remember that the previous Government also attempted to control the upper Houses and the electoral various States. As a result, it was not possible for the then Opposition to approve of these referenda. Now the right tiling is being The referenda that we are now proposing be taken to the people in a proper atmosphere. would suggest that the right time in which to Hindmarsh hold a referendum is not at the time of a general ters for my attention. election.

These questions will be put in an atmosphere which is isolated from the heat of political battle that inevitably surrounds an election.

If the Senate is prepared to exercise power to force the House of Representatives the people, I believe that at least half of the senators ought also to face the people at that time.If this is done I believe that the Senate will be madevacated. a better and more responsible body.

Another matter that makes the simultaneous election proposal much more significant now the fact that it was discussed and approved at Australian Constitutional Convention in Hobart. As honourable members who were at the Consenator. vention will recall, this proposal was passed the voices and it therefore appears to have the unanimous support of all of who were there. I would Uke now to draw attention to an arguThis ment I put forward in my second reading speech,replacements namely as to the savings that wiU be made if simultaneous elections are held. At current costs a half Senate election would cost $5.5m and a not House of Representatives election would cost $5m. A joint election for the House of Representatives and half of the Senate would cost $6m. It per is true that a referendum may cost $5m to $7m. Bearing in mind that we can anticipate at least 4 elections between 1978 and 1981, obviously simultaneous elections would lead to a great deal of saving in pubUc expenditure as well as in cone of them venience to the public. A number of points have been raised and I shall try to deal with them very quickly because we have very littletimein which to pass these BUls. The honourable member for Hindmarsh systems of the (Mr Clyde Cameron)Mr Armitage-The Attorney-General is supdone. posed to wind this up by 9.15 p.m. are to Mr ELLICOTT-I want the vote to start in I about 2 minutes. The honourable member for very seriously raised a couple of matHe was concerned with the is introduction of the concept poltiical parties asked whether laws to define vacancies is accepted, it will in fact have the effect giving to the High Court should the occasionof arise the definition of a poltiical party. The Government understands, and I believe that all honourable members understand, what a poUtithe cal party is. If we do not understand what a polparty is, I doubt whether we understand its what anything is. The problem of definition is to not a very real one at all. Questions were raised about what would happen to various senators whose seats were do not want to refer to particular senathe proposal if the seat of an elected by the people is subsequently vacated, the Government or Parliament of the State he represented is responsible forfillinghis vacancy. They could choose anybody who had the qualifications of a senator to is replace him. So under the proposal there is no the binding provision relating to poltiical party governing the replacement of an independent In the case of a senator who changes his on party the State parliament would choose a candihad date from the Party to which the ex-senator belonged when he was elected. The basic principle is that the will of the people should prevaU. principle ought to be translated into the following a casual vacancy. We have, of course, adopted the view that the reason for the casual vacancy has no relevance. Indeed it has not. It may be that what, brought about the casual vacancy can give rise to a great deal of public debate, as it has in this Parliament in the past. But that has nothing to do with the implementation of the principle, namely, that the people's will ought to prevail in respect of the replacement. The fact that a senator vacates his seat for some unsatisfactory reason has nothing to do with the people. They choose a Liberal man, a Labor man, a National Country Party or an independent. That is what ought to be reflected in the act of replacement.",82
179,Mr LES JOHNSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rise to order. Mr Speaker, prior to your resuming the Chair the Opposition was given an indication that it was imperative that this legislation should go to the Senate by 9.15 p.m. On that basis the Opposition yielded or relinquished its opportunity to participate in the debate. May I now seek, through you, from the Minister an indication whether that requirement is no longer necessary in which event Opposition members would be prepared to speak on the third reading of the legislation?",84
180,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no point of order. The honourable gentleman is asking for information.,84
181,Mr ELLICOTT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What I said was that we needed to start voting at about 9.15 p.m. All I have been seeking to doMr Armitage-That is not what your Whip said.,84
182,Mr ELLICOTT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mr Speaker, I have finished my remarks. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Ellicott) agreed to: That the Bill be now read a third ume.",84
183,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As this Bill is one to amend the Constitution, the provisions of section 128 of the Constitution must be observed. I therefore direct that the bells be rung. I would suggest that honourable members remain in their places for thetimebeing. The bells having been rung",84
184,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I draw the attention of the House to the fact that because this Bill is a Bill which relates to an amendment of the Constitution it is necessary that it be passed with an absolute majority. It has been the practice in the past to prove that it has an absolute majority by calling for those who vote 'aye' to pass to the right of the Chair and those who vote 'no' to pass to the left of the Chair. As I interpret the mood of the House, everybody would vote 'aye'. In those circumstances everybody being on the right of the chair would make it an impossible task for the tellers. On the other hand I have to require the House to tell me whether there is a dissentient voice because under the terms of the law there is an opportunity for those who are dissentients to state a case which will be circulated in a referendum. The question, which I have put already and which I must put again is: 'That the Bill be now read a third time'. All those of that opinion 'aye', to the contrary 'no'.I ask whether there is a dissentient voice in the chamber. There being no dissentient voice, I think it would meet the convenience of the House if I ruled that members remain in their place in order to be counted by the tellers for the 'ayes'. I appoint the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) as tellers for the 'ayes' to record the names.

Under the National Roads Act, the States are required to submit for approval to the Commonwealth Minister for Transport particulars of the work to be performed in respect of each project.

Consumer Affairs Bureau is at present considering the most appropriate way of prohibiting the sale of child car seats and harnesses not certified to comply with Australian Standard 1754. This is as a result of a request from the A.C.T Consumer Affairs Council which is concerned about the sale of unapproved restraining devices in the Territory. The Bureau is considering whether action can be taken under existing legislation or whether new legislation will be required. In the latter case the alternatives of specific legislation for child car seats and harnesses or general consumer product safety legislation will be examined. Any restrictions imposed will be made known as soon as the necessary legislation is gazetted. In the interim the Consumer Affairs Council has issued a press release advising the Draft Regulations public on how to select the approved restraining devices. (Question No. I860) The Department of the Capital Territory will introduce legislation to amend the Motor Traffic Ordinance 1936 to require the wearing of approved restraints where fitted as soon as possible. answer to Question No. 1273, is Capital Assistance for Leisure Facilities (Question No. 1959) Mr E.

The interim report is due to be tabled this week and a follow-up group of officials has already been established for the continuing examination of the reports. The Task Force is now undertaking subsequent consultations with State and other interested groups. Thetimetableof these activities will obviously preclude any immediate initiacontrol lauon tives on those programs in 1976-77 such as the Capital Assistance for Leisure Facilities, which are under review by 30 179 the Task Force.
