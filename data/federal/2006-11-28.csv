3,Mr BURKE,MAIN COMMITTEE,"We have a very simple amendment before the chamber to fix a problem which has arisen for the Maltese community. The government has acknowledged that one section of the Maltese community who lost their Australian citizenship-they and their children-should be allowed to regain it. In a parallel situation, the government acknowledges that it is appropriate to let back in another section of the Maltese community who were forced to renounce Australian citizenship, but it does not want to do the same for their children. The government's argument is that their children do not have a sufficient connection to Australia. Labor believes that the connection between children and their parents is as close as a connection can get. This situation does not affect a lot of people, and it is something which the Maltese community has been crying out for for some time. It is something that should have attracted some bipartisanship in the parliament. The Labor Party offered that, if the government want to make this amendment theirs, we will grant leave for them to vary it in whatever way they want to. What we have here is simply sensible public policy. There appears to be no national security concern or anything like that; it simply appears to be a case where the government have drafted the legislation in this way and they are sticking a to their guns no matter what the merits of the case. In the Main Committee the member for Prospect and the member for Gorton made a compelling case as to why the cries of the Maltese community in Australia should be heard, as to why this is to the betterment of Australia and as to why it is really not too long a stretch: if you are looking at whether someone has a significant connection to Australia, the connection between parents and their children is not a bad one to start with. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Burke's) be agreed to. The House divided. [12.38 pm] (The Speaker-Hon. David Hawker) Ayes………… 56 Noes………… 79 Majority……… 23 NA Adams, D.G.H. Albanese, A.N.

Becoming an Australian citizen There are a range of ways you can become an Australian citizen. Acquiring citizenship automatically Generally, you become an Australian citizen automatically if you are born in Australia and one or both of your parents are Australian citizens or permanent residents when you are born. There are some other, less common, ways of automatically becoming a citizen. Division 1 of Part 2 has details about acquiring citizenship automatically. Also, if you were a citizen under the old Act immediately before the day that this section commences, you will continue to be a citizen: see subsection 4(1). Acquiring citizenship by application The other way to become an Australian citizen is to apply to the Minister. This is covered by Division 2 of Part 2. There are 4 situations in which you can apply for citizenship. The first is citizenship by descent. Generally, you would apply for this if you were born outside Australia and one or both of your parents were Australian citizens when you were born. Citizenship by descent is covered by Subdivision A. The second is citizenship for persons adopted in accordance with the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption: see Subdivision AA. The third is citizenship by conferral. Generally, you would need to be a permanent resident and willing to make a pledge of commitment to apply for citizenship by conferral. There are some less common circumstances in which you can apply for citizenship by conferral. Citizenship by conferral is covered by Subdivision B. The fourth is resuming citizenship. In certain cases where you previously ceased to be an Australian citizen, you can apply for your citizenship to resume. Resuming citizenship is covered by Subdivision C. The Minister must be satisfied of your identity for you to acquire citizenship by application. Rules about identification are in Division 5 of Part 2. The Minister may be required to refuse your application on national security grounds. Ceasing to be an Australian citizen There are a number of ways that you can cease to be an Australian citizen. You can renounce your citizenship. If you did not automatically become an Australian citizen, the Minister can revoke your citizenship in certain circumstances. There are some other, less common, ways of ceasing to be a citizen. Division 3 of Part 2 has details about ceasing to be a citizen. Evidence that a person is an Australian citizen You can apply to the Minister for evidence of your Australian citizenship. This is covered by Division 4 of Part 2.

5,Mr BURKE,NOES,"There are two deeply offensive parts to the amendments that this House is dealing with. After the London bombings we had the government putting around the press galleryand it was published everywhere-that there matter was a 10-point antiterrorism plan. One of subsec- those issues was that citizenship should move from two years to three years. That information went out to the gallery, to the subnation and to the world after all the leaders of the governments in Australia had been given the best security information that was available and the best security briefings by ASIO. They decided that the balance should be struck at three years. But then briefings were given by someone else-we can only assume that it was Mark Textor. Briefings were given by someone else who had nothing to do with national security. They said, ‘Labor's agreed to three parayears for Australian citizenship, so we'd better go one step further to make sure Labor disagrees.' They went one step further: they went to four years. Make no mistake, our reason for refusing to go to four years is that we will not go against what was unanimously agreed in the counter-terrorism plan. It might be good enough for the government to say that all the leaders of all the governments in Australia can agree on something but if a pollster says the parliamentary secretary ought to do something different then it will be switched. That might be good enough for them, but we will not support an extension to four years for the waiting time for Australian citizenship. It is a careful balance. You have to get that balance right and you should base that on the security information, not on the polling information. Something else came out in the course of debate. When this debate was adjourned to the the Main Committee, I offered on the floor of the House that, if the government wanted to adjust this amendment, we would grant leave to adjust it. The government decided not to bother doing that. We now have an amendment before us which says that a limited group of people who are classified under this amendment as stateless persons will be prohibited from getting Australian citizenship if they have been convicted-this is under amendment (47)-of an offence under Australian law, or a foreign law, for which the person has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least five years. I have no problem, if someone is being jailed overseas, for that to ring alarm bells and send an alert to the minister. I do not mind it being deferred to ministerial discretion. But I am disgusted that Australian citizenship, of all things, will be deferred to a foreign powerthat if a foreign power has decided to imprison someone for five years then the Australian government loses control of Australian citizenship. It is for a limited class of people. This government has outsourced many things in its time, but I never thought we would outsource Australian citizenship. If we were going to outsource it, I never thought we would pick the worse regimes in the world. Someone who fits the classification for a stateless person under this amendment could have been imprisoned in the cell next door to Nelson Mandela for being an antiapartheid activist. This legislation says that that person is prohibited-there is no discretion at all-from gaining Australian citizenship. Someone could have been imprisoned by Saddam Hussein, and the Australian minister will not be able to make them an Australian citizen because we have deferred that power to the authority of a tyrant. Yesterday we got a report about giving him money; today we get legislation to give him control of citizenship. It is disgraceful for us to be in this situaHaase, B.W. tion, where it has been pointed out to the government and they could not be bothered making the amendment. They could not be bothered saying that Australian citizenship ought to be one of the things the should be in the control of Australia. As I said, I have no problems at all saying that this should ring an alarm bell, that this should give an alert, but the final decision should lie with the Australian minister. There will be many times when I do not like the way the government exercise their discretion. But if it is a choice between whether the discretion goes to an Australian minister or to the people who locked up Aung San Suu Kyi, I will pick the Australian minister. It should give rise to a discretion, but it is unforgivable for this government-for the first time in our history-to be saying that a foreign power gets control of anyone's Australian citizenship.",34

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. CRIMES AMENDMENT (BAIL AND SENTENCING) BILL 2006 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",38
10,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 ensures that all Australians are treated equally under the law and that criminal behaviour cannot be excused or justified by customary practice or cultural law. At the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities, held here in Canberra last June, the Australian government expressed serious concern about the high level of violence and abuse in Indigenous communities. Following the summit, we called on all state and territory Labor governments to work with us to ensure that all Australians are equally subject to the law and that all Australians can expect the same protection under the law. This issue was also tackled by the Prime Minister and state and territory Labor leaders at the July Council of Australian Governments meeting, who agreed that the law's response to family and community violence and sexual abuse must reflect the seriousness of such crimes. Criminal behaviour can never, in any form, be excused, justified, authorised, required or rendered less serious because of customary law or cultural practice. Nor has it ever been intended that customary law or cultural practice should be used to aggravate the seriousness of criminal behaviour. The Australian government firmly rejects the idea that an offender's cultural background should automatically be considered, when a court is sentencing an offender, so as to mitigate the sentence imposed. Likewise, in the process of granting bail an alleged offender, this bill will ensure tomary law or cultural practice cannot be used as an excuse that the criminal behaviour concerned is somehow less culpable. All Australians, regardless of their background, will thus be equal before the law. At the intergovernmental summit in June, the Commonwealth also indicated that it would show leadership and review bail provisions to ensure that adequate protection is given to alleged victims and potential witnesses, especially those who live in remote communities. Victims and witnesses in remote communities face particular difficulties when alleged offenders are released, and the proposed amendments to the Commonwealth bail provisions will require the impact on such victims and witnesses to be considered in the process of granting bail to the alleged offenders. The recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody were also considered during the formulation of the amendments in this bill. The Australian government is concerned about the relatively high rate of incarceration of Indigenous Australians and the number of Indigenous Australians who die in custody. However, there is no recommendation in the royal commission's report to the effect that sentences commensurate with the relevant crimes should not be imposed on offenders and that victims and witnesses should not be protected from such offenders. The high levels of family violence and child abuse in Indigenous communities is appalling. The Australian government are committed to protecting Australians from criminal behaviour, and those who are most vulnerable are obviously those most in need of protection. This bill is only one element of our apto proach to addressing these difficult issues. cusThe amendments in the bill are complemented by the law enforcement initiatives which include the creation of a National Indigenous Violence and Child Abuse Intelligence Task Force to facilitate the sharing of information and intelligence on crimes of violence and child abuse in the Indigenous community. There are also initiatives underway for community legal education and judicial cultural awareness training. These initiatives are in addition to actions that the Australian government is already undertaking to address complexities that Indigenous Australians face within the justice system, including initiatives through the national community crime prevention programs, the Prevention, Diversion, Rehabilitation and Restorative Justice program, and the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services program. The Australian government will continue taking practical steps to improve the lives of all Australians, whether they live in cities or in remote communities. I thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for their consideration. When the bill was in the Senate, the government addressed the committee's concerns by adopting recommendation 1 in principle, by giving consideration to customary law and cultural practice. Specifically, if a court cannot reduce the penalty under legislation then it should also not be able to increase the penalty. The Australian government will continue to work with the states and territories to prove Australia's justice system. In this regard, the Australian government encourages the states and territories to follow our lead and adopt similar sentencing and bail provisions. In the Senate, Senator Ludwig raised a matter in relation to provisions that deal with a court exercising powers to take into account customary law or cultural practice for excusing, justifying, lessening or aggravating the seriousness of the criminal behaviour. These provisions enable a sentence to be waived in particular circumstances, taking such matters into account. It also prompted the government to look at some other issues where cultural background and religious beliefs were referred to in the Criminal Code. For that reason, issues relating to the Crimes Act, where the conduct of a forensic procedure might be undertaken, could be avoided if a person's religious or customary beliefs were taken into account. It is in that context that I will be moving amendments at the committee stage to reinforce the principal message in this legislation on cultural backgrounds. The government intend that cultural background will be removed from section 19B(1)(i) of the Crimes Act. We will add a new subsection to section 19B to ensure that, when a court exercises its powers under section 19B, it cannot take into account any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for excusing, justifying, requiring lessening or aggravating the seriousness of criminal behaviour. We will also remove reference to cultural background and religious beliefs from paragraphs 23WI(3)(c), 23WO(3)(c) and 23WT(3)(c) of the Crimes Act. In similar paragraphs, we will repeal paragraph (d) of the Crimes Act to remove a requirement for a im- constable, senior constable or magistrate to consider customary beliefs of an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander before requesting consent or making an order to conduct a forensic procedure. We will also add a new subsection to sections 23WI(4), 23WO(4) and 23WT(4) so that a constable, senior constable or magistrate will be able to consider religious beliefs, where appropriate, when deciding whether there is a less intrusive but reasonably practicable way of obtaining forensic evidence. I make these points, because we will be ensuring that the principle that we believe is appropriate in dealing with these matters also applies to waiver and forensic evidence in the same way that we intended that it should apply in ensuring that such factors are taken into account in mitigation and similarly in granting bail.",38
11,Ms ROXON,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Gellibrand) (1.13 pm)Unfortunately, the debate on the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 will not be a pleasant one. As the Attorney General is no doubt aware, this matter has already been dealt with in another place. Labor opposed the bill in that place and will again oppose the bill here in this House. The reason the debate will be, I would think, particularly poor by the standards that we as law makers would hope we use in this place is that less than 15 minutes before we walked in here, during one of the divisions we have just had, I was handed the amendments that or the government will now move to this bill as a result of its party room meeting this morning. Whilst some intention to move some amendments was flagged by our representative in the other place this morning, the amendments have not been seen until now and we will be dealing with them, of course, as the Attorney has flagged, in the detail stage of the debate. We will save our more detailed comments about those amendments until that point in the proceedings. But when this bill pretends to be about dealing with Indigenous violence or violence in Indigenous communities and when it pretends it is about providing some solutions to people, and when we look at the content of the original bill, it does highlight not only that we think it is actually a complete distraction that the government, by the way it is just doing it on the run and making changes to extra bits and pieces all along, has no intention of dealing with this seriously and no intention of making sure that we have good legislation that is properly considered. For example, the Attorney has mentioned that in the amendments that have just been provided there will be changes to forensic procedures: an entirely different section of the act-nothing that was there when the bill was originally tabled in the Senate, nothing that the Senate committee dealt with and not something that came as a result of recommendations from the Senate committee. And the government wants to introduce them here and vote on them in a number of hours. It expects that that is the best way for us to make decent laws for the country. We are very critical of that approach, just as we are critical of the approach that the government has taken in using this as a scapegoat, if you like, or as a fig leaf to try to cover up minister-the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairswho has really not been able to come up with any practical and realistic ways of dealing with this problem. The government is pretending that taking this action of trying to amend the Crimes Act will deliver some relief to Indigenous communities. Labor believes that this is a fundamentally flawed bill. It purports to tackle ‘the relatively high level of violence and abuse in Indigenous communities'-I think that is a quote from the explanatory memorandum. But in reality the terms of this bill will achieve nothing of the sort. The truth of the matter is that the bill is nothing more than a legal fig leaf to cover the inadequacies of the minister purportedly responsible for Indigenous affairs. It is nothing more than a distraction. It has been a waste of the time and energy of this parliament, the media and the but Public Service at what I know the Attorney is well aware is a very busy time of the year in legislative terms. Even more significantly, this bill is a distraction from 10 long years of failed Howard government policy in Indigenous affairs and a distraction from finding genuine practical solutions to the very serious problems of violence and sexual abuse in Indigenous communities. So, after 10 years and two national summits on violence in Indigenous communities, all this government has been able to come up with is this minor distraction. At a time of national prosperity-a prosperity built by the previous Labor government-the Howard government has managed to leave Indigenous Australians for a large part worse off than ever before. And this bill will only take us further in the wrong direction. It is also interesting to note that this bill and the particular changes that are proposed in it represent a complete 180-degree turnaround by the government. When you look at for a the position taken by existing and former members of the government on the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which first introduced the reference to cultural background into subsection 16A(2) that this bill now removes, who do you find supported that bill? It was the members opposite-at that time the opposition. Let us take a look at what Daryl Williams, who later became Attorney-General in the Howard government prior to the current Attorney, had to say back in 1994: The bill will add the words ‘cultural background' to this list. The effect of this will be to make cultural background of a convicted federal offender a matter which a court must take into account when passing sentence or making an order. One could interpolate and say that, if the Crimes Act did not specify any matters, it would not be necessary to introduce the cultural background of the offender. But, given that there is something of a checklist for the judges and magistrates to refer to, an exclusion of an item such as the cultural background could suggest an intention that it not be taken into account. This amendment is appropriate. Unfortunately for Mr Williams, this government has overridden his former position and decided that it is no longer appropriate for cultural background to be included in the so called checklist for judges and magistrates to refer to. Since Mr Williams is no longer in the parliament it would be unfair to speculate on whether he would now be eating his own words, but I am sure that there are a number of people on the government side who baulk at the step that the government has taken and can easily see that this is putting politics and distractions before practical initiatives or measures that might actually make a difference to the community. There are others who spoke in favour of those amendments, including the current Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, who had this to say on the 1994 changes: I would indicate that the coalition agrees with the inclusion of cultural background in relation to sentencing principles. I believe that is an aspect which is relevant in a country such as Australia, where there are diverse cultural backgrounds. In my state of Western Australia there have been cases where tribal Aboriginals have been dealt with before the courts and, of course, they have operated under a different cultural background. They have also had to face some sort of penalty from their own tribe and clan. Also, some aspects of a culture bring out different sorts of behaviour in people, and that has to be recognised. In particular, this relates to Aboriginal offenders, but it could apply to anyone in the community. the As I say, this is the current justice minister, the person actually responsible for introducing this bill in the other place. But what did we see from Senator Ellison on 8 November when this legislation passed through the Senate? We saw a complete backflip as the minister argued in favour of returning section 16A of the Crimes Act to its pre-1994 state. Senator Ellison argued: ... you should not place too much emphasis on cultural background to the exclusion of other factors and, in fact, to the extent that justice may be distorted. It seems to me that Minister Ellison's own views have been distorted somewhat in that period of time, and I am sure if his view has not changed somebody has obviously required him to nevertheless pursue this course of action, even when anybody outside this place with even a modicum of interest in criminal law would understand that this is a complete distraction. It was as if Senator Ellison were implying that it is okay for justice to be distorted when the other factors listed in subsection 16A(2), which will continue to be there, were considered-just not cultural background. What a ludicrous position to take! It also appears that, when the government was selecting the degree of difficulty for this backflip that it has taken, it thought it might be an easy routine that it had chosen, but to Senator Ellison's amazement this turned out not to be the case when the backflip backfired in his face earlier this month. My colleague Senator Ludwig asked the minister during the debate in the other place why the government had chosen to remove the reference to cultural background in relation to factors considered during sentencing yet retain the reference to cultural background among the factors to be considered when a court is deciding whether to dismiss charges or discharge an offender without proceeding to conviction under Section 19B. I understand that this is one of the issues that are being picked up in the late amendments that the Attorney has commented on and has indicated that he is going to move in the consideration in detail stage. It may be, as a result of the embarrassment of that question and the highlighting of the clear lack of consistency in what the government is doing, that after delivering a series of bungled attempts to explain this apparent inconsistency Senator Ellison returned at the end of the debate in the Senate to say that he would raise with the Attorney General the matters that Senator Ludwig raised in the debate. I have a note here from my colleague saying that he hopes, given the handling of this matter by the minister for justice, that the Attorney might be able to do a better job today. Unfortunately with the time frames that are allowed I am not in any position to know whether or not that better job has been done yet, but we will know that by the time we get to the consideration in detail stage. I think the much more important point this exposes is how this legislation is all about creating a distraction for the ministerial failsions ures of Mr Brough rather than dealing with making sure that criminal legislation that is in place at the Commonwealth level is both good law and consistent law. If the government were serious about fixing these problems with the law, they would have taken a much more consistent, thorough and careful approach. Allow me now to turn in some detail to the contents of the bill. As the short title suggests, it makes changes to two specific areas of the Crimes Act 1914: the provisions for granting bail and the list of matters that courts are expected to take into account during sentencing. With respect to the bail provisions, the inserted section 15AB lists new matters to be considered in granting bail, namely the impact the decision may have on victims or witnesses, potential or otherwise. These new measures, at least in sentiment, may be of some merit. Indeed this section was the only element of the amendments to receive any reasoned support at all from the non-government submissions to the Senate inquiry. That support came from the Aboriginal Legal Services of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, but they stopped short of providing full support, objecting to subparagraph (1)(b), which prohibits the consideration of customary law and cultural practice in bail deliberations. Equivalent prohibitions are made in the context of sentencing, so I will deal with both incidents when I get to those measures, and it is worth noting the government ended up amending those in the Senate. There are two important points worth noting about this section. Firstly, as we speak this matter is still under review by the Council of Australian Governments. On 14 July this year a communique from COAG stated: COAG has asked the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) to report to the next COAG meeting on the extent to which bail proviand enforcement take particular account of potential impacts on victims and witnesses in remote communities and to recommend any changes required. This makes it grossly premature for the government to be making these amendments. After all, SCAG has not yet had the opportunity to present its report and COAG has not been given a chance to consider any subsequent recommendations. So if this bill is passed there is a strong possibility that we will be back here again in another six or 12 months time, or some period after that, to deal with those recommendations from SCAG or COAG. Senator Ellison tried to argue that a pending review by SCAG and COAG should not be used as an excuse for standing still, yet this is exactly what the government wanted to do with Senator Ludwig's private senator's bill, the Crimes Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Bill 2006, which sought to amend provisions relating to sentencing in the same part of the Crimes Act 1914. In that debate, government senators argued that it would be ‘premature for the government to consider the use of victim impact statements in isolation', as it was already considering related recommendations from the Australian Law Reform Commission. As Senator Fifield advised: We should take our time. We should make sure that we get it right. We should make sure that we take into account all relevant factors in relation sentencing policy so that we ensure that we get this right. They are all very fine sentiments, but unfortunately they were not applied to the government itself in the way that it is dealing with this particular bill. In the case of the bill we are considering here today, the government has not followed the senator's advice one iota. By giving us yet another raft of amendments with little preparation, with little thought and, in respect of the forensic procedures, with no assessment at all by the Senate committee process, how could we say that we are taking the time, as Senator Fifield has advised us to do, to get it right? The government clearly is not doing that. Instead of proceeding through SCAG, as agreed with the states and territories, the Howard government is now legislating unilaterally. This shows just how arrogant and consumed with power this government is becoming. It also shows that the only part of the bill that possesses any possible merit has been acted on in direct contradiction with the government's own commitments. By disregarding the COAG agreement relating to bail, the government's attempt to rely on other parts of the communique to justify the remainder of the bill is exposed as an absolute farce. Let me turn to the sentencing provisions and the removal of reference to ‘cultural background'. The second substantive change that the bill seeks is the removal of the reference to ‘cultural background' that appears in subsection 16A(2), which lists the matters that courts should have regard to when passing sentence. In its second reading speech, the government rejected ‘the idea that an offender's cultural background should automatically be considered, when a court is sentencing that offender, so as to mitigate the sentence imposed'. This raises the question of whether the government before drafting to this bill even bothered to read the existing provisions of the Crimes Act, because when I turned to my copy of the act-and I know my colleagues in the Senate have done this too-I read the following paragraph: In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court ... Let us think for a moment about the word ‘relevant', because although subsection 16A(2) does direct the court to take into account a range of matters, including cultural background, it must only do so where those matters are relevant, and it is left to the court to determine whether or not a matter is relevant. If the government wants this legislation to be taken seriously then it cannot just wander into the parliament and reject some unattributed idea. Ideas may be important, but in the end we are here as legislators not philosophers and our currency is the written law. When bringing changes forward it is incumbent on the government to point out the specific failings in the law as it stands and explain in full how these changes will remedy them. To do this, of course, you need to actually read the provisions of the act that is going to be amended, and it seems to us that the government has not taken even this most basic step. Instead of basing its case on both fact and experience, it has relied solely upon some idea, and, as I said, an unattributed one at that. When asked to identify where the consideration of customary law or cultural practice has led to inappropriately lenient sentences the Attorney-General's Department failed to provide a single case to the Senate committee. And when pressed for the detail of cases, known at the time of drafting, the only example that the government could provide related to an unsuccessful attempt to use hunting traditions as a defence for hunting birds that were listed as endangered. I think it highlights how silly the government has been in the drafting of these provisions and its determination to pursue some other sort of agenda, like distracting from the minister's other failings, rather than trying to make our law the best and most appropriate law it can be. I will turn now to the original amendments that will direct authorities in granting bail under subparagraph 15AB(1)(b) and those directing courts in sentencing under subsection 16A(2A) to exclude from consideration: ... any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for excusing, justifying, authorising, requiring or rendering less serious the alleged criminal behaviour to which the alleged offence relates, or the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee argued that this original drafting would have meant: ... that a court could not take into account customary law or cultural practice to render criminal behaviour less serious but could consider these factors if it rendered criminal behaviour more serious. Fortunately the government has taken on board the Senate committee's view in this instance, an all too rare occurrence these days. But this only serves to reinforce the hasty fashion in which the bill has been thrown together. Although it is a clear improvement, neither the bill as a whole nor the individual provisions are in any way sufficiently redeemed. The Senate inquiry into the bill was on the whole quite scathing. In the majority report, specific attention was drawn to the lack of consultation that occurred in drafting the legislation-something that appears, unfortunately, to be an emerging trend under the Howard government. The consequences of inadequate consultation can be seen in the almost unanimous denigration of the bill by those who gave evidence to the committee. The key criticisms are summarised in the majority report as follows: the bill is both misguided and ill-conceived, and it will do little in a practical sense to address the violence and abuse in Indigenous communities; the bill risks further discriminating against minority cultures; the bill runs contrary to the findings of major relevant inquiries, particularly the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody; the bill will restrict judicial discretion; and the bill may undermine important initiatives involving Indigenous customary law, such as circular sentencing. In addition to the recommended amendment mentioned previously, the majority report also urged the government not to remove the reference to ‘cultural background' from the act. Although all of the recommendations made by the majority members would undoubtedly improve the bill, as noted by the minority report prepared by the Labor senators on the committee, they would ‘ultimately leave it gutted'. As such, the jority report's attempt to salvage the bill just another face-saving exercise for the ister for Indigenous affairs. As mentioned earlier, these changes will also have almost no effect on violence and sexual abuse in Indigenous communities. Yet this is precisely what the bill purports to pact upon. Why is this the case? Because in the main these sorts of offences are covered by state and territory legislation-something noted by the Senate committee and almost every organisation that made a submission to the inquiry but seemingly missed by the government. Just as some indication, looking at federal prisoners who might be covered by our Crimes Act, as of 1 September 2006, three-quarters were incarcerated under drug importation offences. Looking at the 74 prisoners convicted under the Crimes Act, which make up the bulk of the residual, more than half of those were related to social security. So just how these changes are going to make any impact upon the serious problems of domestic violence and sexual abuse is, frankly, one's guess. Mind you, we are not here to play a guessing game, especially when it comes to issues as serious as these. This is something that we will never forgive the government for: exploiting the goodwill of the wider community and this parliament and our desire to stamp out violence and sexual abuse wherever it is found to divert attention from the minister's failings. This is a sad joke by the government. The bill is a nonsense bill and Labor will not be supporting it. I will make some other brief comments about the amendments that have just been provided to us. As I said, we have only had a very short period of time to look at those and we will deal with them in more detail when we get to the consideration in detail stage. It is of concern to us not only that the governma- ment drafted such a poor bill initiallywas which, when it was dealt with by the Senate min- committee, there were many recommendations to change; even the coalition members could see how inadequately these provisions had been drafted-but that it appears that the majority of the amendments the government imnow wants to move are entirely unrelated to the provisions of the initial bill and to the inquiry conducted by the Senate committee. Nowhere has there been any indication that forensic procedures were going to be part of this, yet the additional amendments deal particularly with forensic procedures. It appears either that the Attorney does not understand that forensic procedures are not bail and sentencing procedures or, alternatively, that he is seeking to create some sort of omnibus bill where none existed before. It would be more appropriate for us to properly examine these amendments rather than have them moved as last-minute amendments to what is already a very poorly drafted and inadequate bill-rather than just tacking them on without the proper considanyeration of the parliament and the party rooms, and, much more importantly, of the community, who have had no opportunity at all to comment on these other provisions. These amendments represent embarrassing and increasingly erratic law making by the minister for justice and the Attorney General. It is a worry to us that the government would use this opportunity to make such significant changes without adequate consultation. I will reserve my remaining remarks on the particular amendments until they are moved later in the day in the consideration in detail stage. But we do flag our opposition to the bill and to the government's incredibly inadequate handling of the issue of violence within the community and its using this as a distraction when much more important practical measures should be being taken.",40
12,Mr KEENAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"Stirling) (1.37 pm)Unlike the previous speaker, the member for Gellibrand, I rise to strongly support the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 and I want to address some of the criticisms that she has made of it. Firstly, she spent a lot of her speech going through comments that had been made by members on this side of the House when the changes were initially introduced in the dying days of the Keating government in 1994. I think it is fair to say that the thinking in this area of government in Indigenous affairs has evolved significantly since that time-on both sides of the House-and I think these changes reflect some of that new thinking. She spent a lot of time criticising Minister Brough, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, for his handling of this policy area, but I think what he has done in highlighting these issues has been tremendously courageous. When he highlighted these issues you knew that all the usual suspects would come out and call him a racist and say it was just the oppressive Howard government dealing with these issues, but I think these problems have been swept under the carpet for far too long. I commend him on taking the stance he has in trying to actively deal with these issues. I think it is vital that this parliament very strong position that categorically says to all Australians that we are all equal before the law and, as such, we are all fully entitled to the protection of that law. To say that cultural background or coming from a particular community represents mitigation for committing a crime is an appalling message for this parliament to send. This is an issue that requires Commonwealth leadership, even though a lot of the criminal law where the changes will need to be made comes under state and territory jurisdiction. This bill provides the leadership to the states and territories on this issue, and I note that the sentiments expressed in it were endorsed by COAG. This bill represents only one part of an overall process to deal with extraordinarily difficult issues of family violence and child abuse within Indigenous communities. I cannot say too strongly that every Australian, including every member of an Indigenous community, is entitled to the protection of the law. The acts of criminals should never be justified and they should not be rendered less serious because of customary law or cultural practice. I reject the idea that a person who is found guilty of a crime should have their cultural background automatically considered, when a court is sentencing that offender, so as to mitigate the sentence that is being imposed. This bill will stop any customary law or cultural practice from being taken into account in the process of granting bail so that the criminal behaviour concerned is not seen to be less culpable. I represent in this place a seat, Stirling, that is extraordinarily culturally diverse. In that way it is a very good reflection of the country as a whole. We have immigrant populations that represent every wave of migration to Australia, from the post-World War II era when the arrivals were southern Europeans, through to the large Vietnamese take a migrations of the mid-seventies and now to the latest arrivals, under Australia's very generous humanitarian program, who are coming in particular from North Africa. Within the seat of Stirling all the world's religions are represented. It is a microcosm of Australia in the sense that you can find representatives there of any particular cultural group. I often attend citizenship ceremonies-the City of Stirling, my local council, holds them every three weeks-and literally hundreds of people are inducted at every ceremony. So the seat has a growing and very diverse population. I think that is a reflection of one of this nation's strengths, and this diversity actually enhances us. But nobody has ever come to me and said that they think we should have a two-speed law based on culture in this country. We do not have a situation where people have differing levels of citizenship or differing protection through the law. As soon as you become a citizen of Australia you are 100 per cent equal to anybody who was born here or whose family goes back generations here. This practice of all of us being equal is a vitally important part of our legal framework. But it has been infiltrated by the idea that a person's cultural background is a valid excuse for committing criminal actions. I think if we follow this line of thinking-and I am not speaking on the basis of hard evidence, but I think it is reasonable to assume that the victims of crime would often be victims at the hands of somebody from a similar background to theirs-then we need to ask what it effectively means for the cultural groups that we are talking about. What it means, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that they are not going to be as equally protected as you or I are in this place. I think it would be an solute disaster for the parliament to propagate a view like that. The term ‘cultural background' was inserted into the Crimes Act in 1994 in the Keating government's response to an Australian Law Reform Commission report entitled Multiculturalism and the law. I think this provides us with an excellent example of the excesses cally correct multiculturalism can generate. I love the diversity of my seat but, as I have said, nobody has ever expressed the desire to me that we have separate laws for different cultural groups. I think the excesses of a policy like that are no more evident than in the treatment of Aboriginal Australians. It seems that in the minds of some in this place the protection of Australia law does not apgood ply equally to everybody. The most disturbing example was one that received quite a lot of publicity at the time, and that was when a totally inadequate sentence was handed down to an Aboriginal man in the Northern Territory who had been convicted of physically and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl who had been his so-called promised bride. The judge handed down a sentence of a mere four months in jail because he took into account the cultural practice of having a promised bride. I think some of the difficulties that can arise when traditional Aboriginal culture collide with Western society are obvious. But if we are going to accept that cultural practices that injure or harm young people are more acceptable in the Aboriginal culture than they would be in our own then we are going down a very slippery slope. If we were to say that then we would say that this particular 14-year-old Aboriginal girl is not entitled to the same protection of Australian law as any other Australian 14-year-old. I think that is an outrageous proposition. One of the reasons behind our system of justice is that it deters people from committing crimes. Lenient sentencing that is preabpared to take into account cultural factors sends the exact signal that the protection available to members of that community is not the same as the protection that is offered to others. If our legal system sends that signal-that it is prepared to judge people based on their background-then the message will obviously be received that these crimes are that politi- somehow less horrifying. This practice of taking into account cultural relativities is not restricted to Aboriginal communities. In recent very widely publicised trials in New South Wales for vicious gang rapes, counsel for the defence argued that the rapists' backgrounds lessened their responsibility for committing these crimes. Fortunately, the court did not accept that. Ms Plibersek-That's right; the court did not accept it.",47
13,Mr KEENAN,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"But the point is that it is being argued. The fact that it has been argued gives us a good indication that these ideas are becoming acceptable in our society. As a parliament we need to say that they are not. We cannot accept a two-tier legal system in Australia without saying that the protection offered to some is less than that offered to others. It is a straightforward principle that I have heard affirmed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, that human rights trump cultural rights, and it is a straightforward principle that this parliament needs to put its stamp on today. We must say very strongly that all Australians are entitled to 100 per cent protection of the Australian law. This parliament cannot legislate with respect to criminal law in the states and territories. I suspect that the passing of this legislation through the parliament will send a strong signal to them and, hopefully, provide a strong lead for them to follow. If we do not provide leadership on this issue we will, as a parliament, be found very much wanting. We need to send out the message, and send it very strongly-and I ask the state and territory parliaments to follow-that as a parliament we represent all Australians and we do not accept that cultural relativism has any place in our legal system. I strongly endorse the sentiments in this bill.",49
14,Ms PLIBERSEK,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP,"I rise to speak on the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006. I listened closely to the comments of the member for Stirling. I believe that his intentions are good, but he has made a number of statements which do not really reflect the reality in courts around Australia-in particular, courts that would be affected by this legislation. He has suggested that currently people are not equal before the law because judges have the ability, in certain limited circumstances and if they want to, to take cultural background or customary law into account in sentencing. If the member for Stirling had a look at whether this has been the case-whether judges have taken cultural background and customary law into account in sentencing-I think he would be surprised. He has left the chamber so I suppose he is not really interested in the detail of this legislation. He would have found that it was not the sort of issue that the Attorney-General and the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs like to pretend it is. We are not in the middle of a two-tier legal system, as the member for Stirling was trying to suggest. People are not getting different treatment or different levels of protection because of their cultural background. Sexual assault and domestic violence in some Indigenous communities is a frighteningly widespread issue and as a nation it is incumbent upon us to do something about it. It has been a good thing that in recent months there has been some widespread media coverage of the devastating incidents and the devastating effects that these are having in some communities. What we need is a long-term, well thought through plan that builds on what is working-because there are programs that are working around Australia-and addresses the incidence of violence and assault in some communities. This bill will do absolutely nothing to reduce levels of sexual assault and domestic violence in these communities. The thing that is so disappointing about that is that here we are, the parliament of Australia, with all these resources, information, reports and consultations, and this is the best that the government can come up with-a piece of legislation that will not protect a single child from sexual assault, a piece of legislation that will not protect a single woman from sexual assault or domestic violence. So, what can the aim be? If the aim is not to protect the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, what can the aim be? Could it possibly be as venal and as base as a few headlines in the Australian? Could it possibly be so? Of course, there is never an excuse for child abuse, sexual assault or domestic violence. They are always crimes and they must be treated as crimes. Policing and the judiciary all have a part to play in reducing and eventually eliminating violence against and sexual abuse of women and children but they are not the whole answer. They are a very important part of the answer but they are not the full answer. Aboriginal men who rape or bash their wives or children should of course face the full force of the law. There is nobody in this country who argues otherwise, and this legislation is designed to imply that there are people who argue otherwise. The challenge for the government is to take the focus that the media attention has put on these issues and turn it into sustained, positive action that actually addresses the incidence of sexual assault and domestic violence in Aboriginal communities-and, indeed, in communities all around Australia. We must keep reminding ourselves that this is not just something that happens in rural, remote, isolated communities. It is not just something that happens in Aboriginal communities. This bill does nothing to offer a sustained response to domestic violence or sexual assault. It comes from an intergovernmental summit on violence and child abuse in Indigenous communities held in June 2006. It sets out to amend the federal Crimes Act to require the court to consider the potential impact of bail decisions on victims and witnesses, specifically those in remote communities, and to restrict federal judges and magistrates from taking into consideration a person's cultural background or customary law in sentencing. The member for Stirling implied that judges have to take this into consideration. They do not have to. This bill seeks to take away something that is seldom used. It was said that it is sometimes argued for in court. Plenty of things are argued for. In just about every court case that makes it into the newspapers it seems somebody is arguing that the person is actually innocent. As I said, the bill is in fact a diversion from the main issue that we as a parliament should be tackling-that is, how to reduce the incidence of domestic violence and sexual assault in communities around Australia. We have heard from speakers on both sides of the parliament-members of the government and members of the opposition-in the last week in particular about the importance of having a sustained and long-term approach to reducing violence in Australia. There has been a terrific community campaign, the White Ribbon Day campaign, in which White Ribbon ambassadors, including a number of members on both sides of the parliament, have worn their white ribbons so as to say: ‘As Australian men, we want to see the end of violence against women and children in Australia. We will stand up to be counted. We will say that this is not acceptable. We will say to other men that this is not acceptable.' We have seen a very positive response from the Australian community. The Australian community recognises that sexual assault, domestic violence and child sexual abuse should not be tolerated. How does the government respond to that? This bill, which is supposed to have some effect on child sexual abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault, diverts attention because there is this supposition that there are a whole lot of people out there arguing that it is okay for them to bash their wives and have sex with children because it is part of their cultural heritage, and it is just not happening in the Australian community. When the Attorney-General was asked to identify where the consideration of customary law or cultural practice has led to inappropriately lenient sentences, his department failed to provide a single case. When he was pressed for the detail of cases known at the time of drafting, the only example that the government could provide related to an unsuccessful attempt to use hunting traditions as a defence for hunting birds that were listed as endangered. Currently, a person's cultural background is only ever considered in sentencing where the judge says it is relevant. It is often not considered. It may be argued for by the defence and then disregarded by the judge. Honestly, I think this is the kind of thing we can leave to judges and courts. The idea that the Attorney-General, from the distance of Canberra, is better placed to make these decisions than judges is, in my view, not correct. We are committed to tackling the incredibly difficult issues around sexual abuse and domestic violence involving women and children, but playing politics does not do that. In fact, what we can do, if we start ing politics with these issues, is divert our attention away from finding real solutions. There are real solutions. They are operating in towns and communities around the country. The trouble is that we have bandaid suggestions, short-term pilot programs-the pilot works, then it runs out of money. We have communities around Australia reinventing the wheel. They find a program that works, they run it as a pilot program, it reduces the rate of sexual abuse or domestic violence in a community and then the funding is withdrawn from the program and they have to start all over again with a new funding stream in a few years time. Or they keep their funding but their program is so little known outside their community that communities all around Australia are reinventing the wheel. That is just not good enough. We need a national response to violence against women and children. We need a national plan that has all the stakeholders involved-police, the judiciary, and survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and child sexual assault. All of those stakeholders should be at the table. We need that group to report to cabinet about what is working, where it is working and, if it is not working, why not. What are we doing wrong? We need a national council to direct the work of that national plan. We need real and long-term support for the programs that work. We do not want a piecemeal approach. We do not want an approach that that is based on glossy advertising campaigns that ramp up around election time to make it look like the government is interested in doing something about sexual assault and domestic violence. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission put out an excellent research paper about violence in Aboriginal communities in which they set out 10 challenges for dealing with violence in those communities. playThey talked about the importance of a holistic approach rather than an approach that deals only with law and order. Law and order is important but it is not the only answer. They say that government has consulted and had reports till the cows have come home. We now know enough; we actually have to commit to doing the work. HREOC stressed that genuine partnership and full participation of Indigenous people are absolutely vital if programs are going to work.",49

For example, the AEU Victorian branch president, Mary Blewett, said that teachers, principals and school staff from across the state would gather in Melbourne on Thursday. They should not be gathering in Melbourne on Thursday; they should be at school on Thursday. They should be looking after the interests of the schoolchildren of Victoria. It is no secret to any member in this House that many Australian parents are voting with their feet against the government education system around the country, and they are not doing it because of funding: it is this kind of behaviour by teachers that gives government schools a bad name. Victoria has the highest percentage of school students enrolled in independent and Catholic schools in the country. This action by Victorian teachers will further reduce the esteem of the government education system in the eyes of Victorian parents. As somebody who is rather proudly the product of a government education system, let me say that I worry the about this kind of behaviour undermining the quality of government education in Victoria and around Australia. Instead of attending a rock concert at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, instead of attending a Jimmy Barnes concert at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, these teachers should be in their classrooms. They should be doing what they are paid to do-that is, to teach the children of Victoria. If they want to demonstrate against our laws, they should do it in their own time, not in their children's time. This is a blow against government schools in Victoria. The fact that all through this answer those opposite have interjected on behalf of the striking teachers demonstrates how much contempt they hold for the government school education system.

24,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. After 10 years as foreign minister and as the minister responsible under Australian law for enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq, does the minister accept any responsibility whatsoever for his department's failure to have in place any systems or procedures in relation to how its staff should proceed in response to allegations relating to the breach of sanctions, as concluded in this, Commissioner Cole's report?",53
25,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The people responsible for the breach of UN sanctions and for deceiving both my department and the United Nations-not according to the Labor Party, but according to Commissioner Cole-are the executives of AWB Ltd. We condemn, in any circumstances, all of those people-and it happens from time to time-who endeavour to defraud or mislead the Commonwealth in the process of breaking the law. That is why, following the Volcker inquiry, with which we cooperated, we established the Cole inquiry-because we wanted to get to the heart of this matter. As I explained on the radio this morning, we have nailed this by establishing what happened-and it would not have happened if it had not been for an independent inquiry. There are 66 countries and some 2,200 to 2,300 companies referred to in the Volcker reportMs Macklin interjecting",53

29,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of recent data on the Australian economy? What does this indicate about the government's economic management?,53
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can inform him that Sensis released their business index for the October quarter today, which showed a solid improvement in perceptions of the economy and of the future economic direction, which rose strongly, improving by 14 per cent. The report also found that the federal government is the most supported government by small and medium enterprises in Australia, with a solid positive net rating-as opposed to the Labor state governments, which overwhelmingly have negative ratings by small and medium sized businesses. Of course, that is because Labor governments in all of the states do not care about small businesses. Mr Tanner interjecting",53
31,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Melbourne is warned!,54
32,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All those state governments care about is militant unionismthe kind of unionism that you are going to see in Melbourne on Thursday and the kind of unionism which is anti small business. It is because Labor cannot stand up to their union controllers that small and medium sized businesses in this country will not accept that the state Labor governments are supportive. In addition to that, Standard and Poor's released their credit rating today, rating Australia's sovereign credit at AAA, the highest rating assigned by Standard and Poor's. Standard and Poor's noted in their assessment today that Australia has one of the best fiscal positions globally, which is reflected in the net creditor position of the Australian federal government. When this government came to office, we had a net debtor position of $96 billion. That is where the Australian accounts were left by the then Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley. Standard and Poor's now record that Australia has a net creditor position-that is, we have repaid $96 billion of Labor Party debt-and, as a consequence of that, Australia's credit rating is now AAA. I hardly need to remind the House that Australia was downgraded twice in its credit rating under the Labor Party. In 1986 we were downgraded to AA plus. In 1989 we were downgraded to AA. It was not until the coalition was elected that, in 1999, we were upgraded to AA plus, and in 2003 we recovered our AAA credit rating. These things were done by the coalition government; they could never have been done by the Labor Party. The Labor Party is the party that lost Australia's credit rating, and the Liberal and National parties have recovered it through proper economic management-the kind of management which the Labor Party failed to implement.

34,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. After 10 years as foreign minister, and as the minister responsible under Australian law for enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq, does the minister accept any responsibility whatsoever for the following damning conclusion contained in Commissioner Cole's report: The critical fact that emerges is that DFAT did very little in relation to the allegations or other information it received that either specifically related to AWB, or related generally to Iraq's manipulation of the Programme. DFAT's response to the information and allegations was limited to seeking AWB's assurance that it was doing nothing wrong. Minister, having refused to accept any responsibility whatsoever for the other failures referred to in Commissioner Cole's report, do you accept any responsibility for this failure also identified in Commissioner Cole's conclusion?",54
35,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. As I made clear, obviously the Cole commission found that AWB endeavoured to mislead the Commonwealth, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is the first point to understand. Secondly, I encourage honourable members to read the report. The report makes clear, fairly obviously, that this was a United Nations-run program. Mr Cole stated that the United Nations' acceptance of a contract after examination by UN experts provided a sound basis for the minister or his delegate-in this case it was the delegateto grant approval for the export. He went on to say that DFAT did look at contracts. According to the Cole report, if the true nature of the arrangements had been disclosed to officers of DFAT, they would have acted differently. I think that is crucially important. The commissioner went on to say that by omitting any clear and accurate reference to the transportation arrangements, AWB effectively deprived DFAT of the opportunity to properly scrutinise and consider the legality of the arrangements actually in place between AWB and IGB. He went on to say that DFAT had been astute to give proper advice when asked regarding the operation of the UN sanctions and the oilMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question asked whether the minister accepted any responsibility.",54

37,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not only did I say that AWB were responsible for defrauding the Commonwealth but let me ask, by rhetorical response, whether the member for Griffith and the Leader of the Opposition accept any responsibility for the allegations of collusion-the allegations that the government was fully aware of what was going on-for telling the Australian people that and whether that was a reasonable thing, or whether we will ever see the day when the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith appropriately apologise for what they said.

On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Transport Infrastructure",55
39,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister explain to the House how our transport infrastructure is meeting the needs of Australians, including those in my electorate of Mallee? How is the government ensuring that Australia's future infrastructure needs are met in order to keep our economy strong?",55
40,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question and recognise his professional interest in investment in infrastructure as an engineer. He has been a great proponent of the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline and of achieving that great investment that is going to deliver some enormous water savings to the nation, particularly to Victoria and the Wimmera-Mallee. There will be annual water savings of 80,000 megalitres when the investment by the Commonwealth is fully implemented, thanks to the hard work of the member for Mallee. He also recognises that the growth of our economy-and I think we are in about the 14th year of expansion-continues to increase pressure on our transport and logistics infrastructure. It is forecast that by 2020 the freight task in Australia will double from what it is today and the needs of the passenger task will grow by 40 per cent. So we have to continue that investment at all levels of our infrastructure to make sure we meet those requirements if we are to ensure the Australian economy will be as strong, as competitive and as efficient then as it is today. Our government is investing, over a five year period, with AusLink $15 billion in road and rail infrastructure across Australia through all the different categories of roads as well as critical rail corridors, and I mentioned one yesterday. Given that the Australian Local Government Association conference is on here in Canberra this week, it is worth mentioning the Roads to Recovery program. This is a very popular program of local government. It is a very efficient program in terms of the expenditure of taxpayers' dollars. It is also the program that the Leader of the Opposition once referred to as a boondoggle. I do not think there would be one delegate from the Australian Local Government Association conference who would agree with the Leader of the Opposition in referring to the Roads to Recovery program as a boondoggle. It is a great investment in the road networks across Australia that feed into the major arterial networks across Australia. So we will continue to argue the case for investment in Australia's transport infrastructure to ensure that we remain competitive, that we remain efficient and that we keep the Australian economy strong. Oil for Food Program",55
41,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,2.19 pm)My question is also to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to the claim by the member for O'Connor that The Nationals knew AWB was engaged in corrupt conduct but did nothing about it. Is the member for O'Connor correct when he says: The dogs have been barking about corruption for years. A number of people who were not Liberals were constantly out in the marketplace saying it was the way you did business in the Middle East and if our side is guilty of anything it trusting a mob of agri-politicians all of which have close connections with The National Party. Did the Deputy Prime Minister ignore this corruption because AWB and The Nationals come out of the same kennel?,56
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me say a number of things in reply to the question asked by the member for Wills. Let me say this: in my dealings with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, and all the other men and women of the National Party in this parliament I have found them to be people of total integrity and utterly trustworthy. That has been my experience, and any suggestion made by anybody to the opposite is a suggestion that I totally repudiate. Let me say also in relation to the press reports concerning the remarks made by the member for O'Connor that there is within the community a proper and healthy debate about wheat marketing arrangements, and I intend that debate to be resolved in a way that promotes the interests and the welfare of the wheat growers of this country. I have found over the years that the best friends the wheat growers of Australia have are members of the Liberal Party and members of the National Party not members of the Australian Labor Party. Taxation",56
43,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline to the House how a new Labor tax on infrastructure would damage business investment and lead to higher prices for consumers across the Australian Capital Territory. Is there any risk of this proposal spreading to consumers right across the country?,56
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question and I can tell him that Mr Bowen- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If I understand the question, it reis of lates to ACT government policy. I draw your attention to page 539 of House of Representatives Practice which states that previous speakers have ruled out of order matters in state parliaments or state matters.

46,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about taxes on infrastructure and what they will do to business investment. Obviously, a new tax on infrastructure in this country will discourage new investment in infrastructure. I am very interested in the point of order because the point of order was that I should not be asked about political parties' policies, which confirms that this is ALP policy-a very instructive point of order. If I may not the trap that Janice Crosio would have fallen into in this House.",57
47,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,57
48,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She pales into insignificance compared to you, Mr Speaker. But a new tax on infrastructure in this country will be an obvious disincentive to investment. And here we are in the ACT, where a new tax is now being proposed on all infrastructure for all utilities including broadband. So we have the Labor Party federally saying they want more investment in broadband, whilst it is Labor policy to tax that new investment if it goes in. And this of course is brought to you by the Stanhopeless government here in the ACT. It is estimated that this new tax on infrastructure will add about $137 a year to consumer bills. I asked the federal Labor Party to dissociate themselves from this tax yesterday and the Canberra Times duly went to the member for Lilley and asked him to condemn this tax. And, according to the Canberra Times, Mr Swan said he had not seen the proposals and would have to have a look at them. Just so he can have a look at them, I table the letter from all of the telecommunications providers in the ACT to the Stanhope government protesting about this new tax. I also table the letter from Jon Stanhope of 23 November 2006 in which he defends his new tax on infrastructure. He says this: ‘Importantly, having taken into account all of the factors ...', he is going to proceed. He says, ‘Indeed, the government has been very open in acknowledging that there will be some impact on ACT consumers as a result.' In other words, he expects this new tax to be fully passed on to consumers. So here we have federal Labor feigning concern about a rise in the consumer price index while state Labor introduce new taxes to be passed directly into the consumer price say so, it is index.

The people of Australia know this: Labor stands for new taxes. Taxation,58
55,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Treasurer. I refer him to the AWB's $290 million kickback to the former Iraqi regime, a payment which was claimed as a tax deduction on his watch, and therefore was subsidised by the taxpayer to the tune of some $90 million. Is the Treasurer aware that, despite the fact that the taxation commissioner has now backed Labor's claim that the tax act is in need of amendment, his Assistant Treasurer rejected Labor's amendment to align the tax act with the Criminal Code when I moved it in this place on 27 February? Treasurer, will you now adopt Labor's plan to ensure that no AWB style bribes can be claimed as a tax deduction in the future, or will you continue to support taxpayer subsidies for illegal bribes?",58
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, he completely misrepresents the Assistant Treasurer, as per usual. I completely repudiate what he said about the Assistant Treasurer. Can I also refer the honourable member to section 26-52 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, which provides as follows: You cannot deduct under this Act a loss or outgoing you incur that is a *bribe to a foreign public official. It is quite specific. If anybody has attempted to deduct a bribe to a foreign official, it is in breach of section 26-52(1). The Commissioner of Taxation, who enforces the law, has the power to adjust any such tax and to impose penalties and an interest payment in relation to that. The Commissioner of Taxation has full power in relation to this matter. The question, unfortunately, is based on a false premise. I have full confidence in the Commissioner of Taxation to enforce the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Australia-Indonesia Relationship",58

68,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to inform the House that my Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, and I signed the AustraliaIndonesia Agreement on the Framework for Security Cooperation, as the Treaty of Lombok is formally called, in Indonesia on 13 November. This is a historic agreement, and it will provide a bedrock for the bilateral relationship between Indonesia and Australia for many years to come. So, even if there are difficulties in that relationship from time to time, we will have this bedrock of the relationship. It will of course provide a framework for dialogue exchanges but will also, importantly, provide for the implementation of joint activities in areas such as law enforcement cooperation, counter-terrorism, defence, maritime security, people trafficking, and emergency management and response. It also includes a clear support by both countries for each other's territorial integrity. an unambiguous statement by both our countries that we will not support the break-up of each other's countries. Obviously, it is hardly likely that Indonesia would support the break-up of Australia, but the Australian government would not in any circumstances support the break-up of Indonesia. That has been the position of Australian governments for a very long time. This agreement will in no way derogate from domestic laws in our country. Finally, let me make this point: the agreement will be subject to full public parliamentary scrutiny before it is ratified. I have written to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is chaired by the member for Boothby, to advise of my intention to table the agreement in parliament when all the paperwork is completed, which is likely to be during the course of next week. In short, as Dr Wirajuda has said, this agreement reflects the maturity of AustraliaIndonesia relations as close neighbours and is an important landmark for the future. I think it will serve future generations of Australians and Indonesians very well by allowing us to work very closely together to deal with the sorts of modern threats which could affect Australians and Indonesians.

70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer It is the foreign minister to page 83 of volume 4 of the Cole inquiry's report, which states: By June 2004 DFAT was aware that AWB's prices had included ... transportation, that AWB ... paid money to a Jordanian trucking company ... and that AWB had conceded that the Jordanian company might of its own volition have provided kickbacks to the regime. Minister, given that Commissioner Cole has concluded that your department knew these facts by June 2004, why in September 2004 did you direct our acting ambassador in Washington to ‘reject the allegations entirely that the AWB had paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime'? Minister, why did you seek to deceive the Americans just prior to our own Australian elections?",59
71,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not in any way seek to deceive the Americans in the first place. In the second place, as is made perfectly clear if you read the whole of the Cole commission report, that report will explain to you the emergence of my knowledge, ministerial knowledge and the department's knowledge of whether AWB Ltd was paying kickbacks. The fact is that I totally reject proposition put by the Leader of the Opposition. Medicare: Bulk-Billing",60
72,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House on how the government's ‘Strengthening Medicare' package is ensuring that Australians have access to affordable medical services, particularly in my electorate of Macquarie?",60
73,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do appreciate the member for Macquarie's question. I note that the GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate has increased to 79 per cent since the government's ‘Strengthening Medicare' measures began. Bulk-billing is certainly not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it is important and it should be widely available, particularly for children and pensioners. And that is exactly what has happened, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. In the September quarter, the national GP bulk-billing rate hit 76.9 per cent. That is 11th successive quarter of bulk-billing increases. It is an increase of more than 10 percentage points since December 2003. The bulk-billing rate for children, at 84.2 per cent, is at an all-time high. The bulk-billing rate for people aged over 65, at 87.1 per cent, is at a 10-year high. The government's ‘Strengthening Medicare' package was not just about bulk-billing; it was also about helping people who do not get bulk-billed. That is why we introduced the new Medicare safety net. This year 1½ million Australians will be helped by that safety net. Last year 15,000 people in the electorate of Macquarie were helped by that safety net. But members opposite still want to abolish that safety net. The only party in this parliament that wants to cut health spending is the Australian Labor Party, the which wants to abolish the Medicare safety net. Two months ago, the Leader of the Opposition called the safety net flawed and inflationary. No wonder only 24 per cent of the Australian public want him to lead the Australian Labor Party! Last month the member for Lalor called the safety net inflationary and inequitable. No wonder only 27 per cent of the Australian people want her to lead the Labor Party! While Labor agonises between a failed leader and flawed challenges, this government is getting on with delivering better health services to the Australian people and reinforcing its credentials as the best friend that Medicare has ever had. Oil for Food Program Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (2.41 pm)My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and it follows the statement of the Prime Minister that the Liberal and National parties are the best friends the wheat growers of Australia have ever had. I refer to the Cole inquiry report which finds, as a result of this $300 million wheat for weapons scandal: AWB wheat grower shareholders have lost the half the value of their investment; trade with Iraq worth more than $500 million per annum has been forfeited; AWB is threatened by lawsuits both in Australia and overseas, with potential liabilities running to hundreds of millions of dollars; there are potential further restrictions on AWB's trade overseas; and AWB has cast a shadow over Australia's reputation in international trade. As the minister responsible for approving all 41 AWB corrupt contracts with Saddam Hussein's regime, do you accept any responsibility for the cost to Australia's hard working wheat farmers?",60

But AWB Ltd comprehensively misled the United Nations and the Australian government, particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The honourable member is right to ask the question.

82,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I note her deep interest in science and research, particularly in biofuels research-she has the largest ethanol plant in Australia in her electorate. The Howard government is committed to we providing our best and brightest researchers with world-class research facilities. Yesterday I announced that half a billion dollars would be invested in world-class infrastructure so that our scientists and researchers can continue to focus their world competitive research in areas of national importance-for example, climate change, biofuels and the development of new drugs and therapies. This will mean that our researchers will have access to state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. It will also assist them in continuing fundamental research in life sciences, environmental sciences and the physical sciences including astronomy, in which we are a world leader. This strategy has been developed over the last 12 months. The research community has come together to collaborate and focus on priorities for research infrastructure in Australia. Some of the projects that will be funded include two pilot projects for biofuels research, a genetic bank for developing better crops for Australian farmers, a system for monitoring our oceans so that we can better predict weather patterns and a national network of medical imaging facilities.

In fact, this year the Australian government is investing nearly $6 billion in science and research. That is a 56 per cent increase on the funding that Labor put into science and research when they were in office. In the decade from 2001, the Howard government will have invested over $50 billion in science and research in this country.

He did an outstanding job in looking after the interests of Australia in the wake of the Bali attack when he was the ambassador in Jakarta and over the past three and a bit years he has served very effectively as the Secretary to the Department of Defence. I do not know whether there were any other parties going on, but after that, I went off to address a magnificent group of small business men and women, the pharmacists of Australia. The pharmacists of Australia have no better friend than the Howard government. I made that very plain to them last night. As for our troops overseas, I would hope that it was the bipartisan concern that our troops overseas would always be respected, would always be supported and would always be honoured irrespective of who was in power. I have to say that that cheap attempt by the member for Wills to suggest that in some way some of my colleagues were less than supportive of the troops overseas is absolutely contemptible. Trade",62
88,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister advise the House of recent developments in the government's trade relations with Australia's neighbours in the Asia Pacific?,62
89,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Herbert for the question. I recognise the important role that his electorate has in trade with the Asia-Pacific. It is a key setting point for many of our trading activities and has very close links with many of the countries of the Asia-Pacific. We have in the parliament this afternoon and this evening a number of business leaders from Australia who were involved in the Asia-Pacific region. The APEC Business Forum focuses particularly on our business associations with that region. It is on the hard work of the business of Australia that our trading relationship has grown so strongly over recent times. In 2005 our trade with APEC nations hit $250 billion for the first time. So it is a very significant part of our relationship. The report on trade that will be released later today shows that this figure results from an 18 per cent increase in our exports to APEC's 21 members and a 10 per cent increase in imports from those countries. APEC's goods and services trade has grown particularly strongly with Japan, China and Korea but there have also been increases to Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Thailand. It is of interest to note that eight out of 10 of tralia's top trading partners are in the APEC economies, and they account for 70 per cent of our trade to the world. So the APEC ministerial meeting and leaders meeting in Hanoi were particularly important in asserting a new agenda to look more closely at the way in which we can develop that trading relationship. It is clear that the future regional architecture will play a significant role in determining how we can build that trade. One of the key activities that Australia, as host for APEC next year, will be undertaking is exploring ways in which that trading relationship can grow stronger. We look forward to building on this $250 billion trading relationship in the years ahead. Oil for Food Program",63
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen comments by decorated veteran SAS major and Iraq veteran Peter Tinley, who described the $300 million wheat for weapons scandal as ‘an absolute rort on the Australian Defence Force-the people that actually went into western Iraq and did all the work that was required and asked of them from this government'? When the Prime Minister let Australian money buy Saddam's bullets, why didn'the think of those who the bullets were being fired atPeter Tinley and his mates in our armed forces?",63
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The claim made in the question by the Leader of the Opposition that the government let Australian money buy Saddam's bullets is quite untrue, and it has been demonstrated to be untrue. I know it has been the mantra of the Labor Party, and I know the Labor Party is intensely disappointed that Mr Cole did not find as the Labor Party wanted Mr Cole to find, but that claim is absolutely false. It has been demonstrated to be false by the findings of the Cole Ausinquiry.

So let me say, as I said yesterday, that the former officer is entitled, as is any Australian, to have his views about the Iraq war, but the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that in some way we allowed our money to buy Saddam's bullets is not only a slur on the government and a slur on many people associated with the government but it has been proved totally wrong, a complete falsehood, by the findings of the commissioner.

97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for MCMillan will come to his question.,64
98,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I got this question for the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister update the House on practical government initiatives to lower Australia's greenhouse gas emissions?",64
99,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I acknowledge the hard work and support of the member for MCMillan on our policies in relation to lowering greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to practical measures and real results, there is no better example of those policies than the Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund. Through this fund the federal government is now supporting five cutting-edge low-emission projects to the tune of $310 million. These projects cover a suite of technologies, from clean coal technology to renewable energy to coal seam methane-projects worth some $2 billion. On Friday, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage announced that the government would be supporting the world's largest CO2 sequestration project. At its peak, this Gorgon project will be burying some three million tonnes per annum of CO2 every year off intellithe coast of Western Australia. When this suite of technologies, demonstrated by the five projects, achieves its full potential, it is estimated that they could reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by around 50 million tonnes per year from 2030-real projects, real outcomes, which is a stark contrast to the policies of the Labor Party. While I am talking about the Labor Party, I noticed an article in the Australian recently, notable for some words in it‘effectively dead', ‘irrelevant', ‘ineffective', ‘mostly symbolic'. The member for Griffith should not be smiling. I am not talking about the Leader of the Opposition; I am talking about a policy which he holds very dear-the Kyoto protocol. The article went on to say: ... no-one now believes the treaty has the remotest chance of driving the reforms needed to make the withering cuts in emissions required ... No-one believes it except the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party, who cling to an outdated, last-century policy while they ignore the opportunity to debate the potential of nuclear energy. They live in the past and they ignore practical solutions-unlike this government, which continues to deliver measures that lower greenhouse gases. Oil for Food Program",64

That is a perfectly normal thing, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking me the question. In relation to the war in Iraq, the House is aware that the positions of the government and the opposition on this issue have been very different. I have pointed out in the last couple of days, and this question gives me an opportunity to point out again, that the Leader of the Opposition was less than enthusiastic in his endorsement of the Labor Party's position three years ago. He was not on the front bench. He believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and three years ago he was a classic fence sitter.

As the Leader of the Opposition in a confected display of indignity winds himself up for yet another censure motion, the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition that we turned a blind eye and allowed bullets to be purchased that might have been used against Australian soldiers is a contemptible claim. Even the opposition leader, in his embattled status, knows that that is a contemptible claim. NA NA NA Censure Motion",65
115,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"by leave-I move: That this House censure the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for for him to paForeign Affairs for: (1) its negligence in failing to act on the 35 warnings it received over a five year period thereby allowing this $300 million wheat for weapons scandal to occur; (2) for its attempted cover-up of this scandal through its attempts to shut down a US Senate inquiry into AWB in 2004; its reluctance to cooperate with the Volcker Inquiry; and its failure to provide the Cole Inquiry with powers to determine whether or not Ministers did their job in enforcing UN sanctions against Iraq; (3) for the cost that has been borne by Australia's hard working wheat farmers because of this Government's negligence-farmers who have now seen half a billion dollars of their Iraqi wheat market lost; (4) for allowing $300 million to be funnelled from AWB to Saddam Hussein's regime which the Iraqi dictator used to buy guns, bombs and bullets for later use against tralian and coalition troops; and (5) for the damage inflicted on Australia's national reputation because this Government's negligence turned Australia into the world's single biggest violator of UN sanctions against Iraq. There are five volumes here of absolute infamy-2,065 pages. Sometimes in politics it is not easy to see the wood for the trees. When you look at this-volume after volume of one piece of chicanery after another by AWB's rorting the UN sanctions regime, effectively funding Saddam Hussein over a five-year period, on a matter at the very core of Australian foreign policy-you have to ask yourself a fundamental question about the competence of this government and the slipshod public standards represented by this government's culpable negligence on this issue, about which it received 35 warnings and chose not to investigate. Even though this commission of inquiry did not have the authority to go after that negligence through the terms of reference that were put down, it nevertheless did point out, as it slightly strayed from the path set by the government, the failure of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to even remotely understand what would be regarded as a reasonable interpretation of its role and authority in monitoring those contracts it was ticking off. That ought to at least cause the Minister for Foreign Affairs to step aside if the man had any sense of honour at all. The fact remains, irrespective of whether or not it was being lied to by the AWB, that 41 contracts were signed off by this foreign minister. These are contracts with consequences. The Prime Minister, in his extraordinary answer to my last question said, ‘Well, it's not really Australian money-ha ha!-it's money from an escrow account in the UN,' Aus- as though that excuses them. It is so typical of the trickiness with which they have adinterdressed every single element of this crimetricky in their terms of reference and tricky when it comes to the claim that it is Australian money that went to supply those bullets, ‘Oh no, it was not Australian money.' It was UN money let loose by your negligence. That is what it was, and it has consequences. Let me tell you, Prime Minister, how Saddam Hussein used the money that he gotand remember that our negligence was the single biggest contributor to his poultice of illegal money that supported his activities. Saddam, as a result of our actions, was able to maintain the Scud missile launchers for which the SAS were asked to risk their lives to destroy. He was able to maintain the Iraqi soldiers in machine-gun-mounted four-wheel drives that the SAS fought running battles with early in the war. He was able to maintain a good proportion of the 50 aircraft that the Australian Special Forces Group captured at Al Asad air base west of Baghdad. He was able to maintain the sea mines which RAN boarding parties risked their lives to neutralise before they were deployed from tugboats to destroy coalition shipping. He was able to maintain the tanks, trucks, artillery bunkers and logistical support which RAAF Hornet pilots risked their lives to destroy in strike and close air support missions. It would be entirely unsurprising to me if some of that money were still being used to maintain the insurgency which continues to threaten our troops on a daily basis with IEDs, antitank missiles, suicide bombers and small arms. Somebody pays the price. A lot of Iraqis have paid the price, but Australian soldiers pay the price for this sort of negligence. While this government presided over the utter failure of the relevant departments to properly inquire into what AWB was doing over a five-year period, other Australian service personnel were putting their lives on the line. I have only gone through that which was confronted immediately by service personnel in the Iraq war and now, but before then there were Australian warships operating in the Gulf with the explicit charter to enforce and uphold sanctions. They asked questions, they stopped the boats and they inspected the innards of those boats. They did not ask a question of the captain, ‘Are you smuggling anything, old chap?' and when the captain replied, ‘Oh no, I'm not smuggling something,' they did not turn away. They boarded the ships and they went into the holds-night after night after night. That is what the armed services do when they are instructed to do something by the government. They do not just ask a series of vapid questions and, because the questions are being directed to their mates in the National Party, not bother to follow up on them; they actually go into the ships that they are inspecting. It is not surprising to me, therefore, that man so closely connected with the events which were set loose by this government in Major Tinley should now feel, as he looks at the rort of the AWB operation, like saying something like this-an absolute rort on the Australian Defence Force, on the people who actually went into western Iraq and did all the work that was required and asked of them by this government. Actually, it was worse than a rort; it endangered them. What was done by this government endangered them. There has been an obscene celebration around the government benches that the government's rorted terms of reference produced the only outcome that they could produce, and that was that its culpable negligence was never subject by this commission of inquiry to any serious investigation because it could not be. The government says there is no evidence that it did anything wrong but, frankly, as you go through the five volumes, the 2,065 pages, there is no evidence that the government did anything right. It says there is no evidence that it did anything wrong, but in those 2,065 pages there is not one word that says the government did anything right-that it ever made the serious detailed inquiries or that it ever did the political equivalent of what our naval personnel did day after day of enforcing their end of the sanctions regime in the Persian Gulf. There was hard action by the military, risky action by the military, diligent action by the military, and complete and utter compliance by this government in the things that were being done. Those in the government have been very boastful in their statements to us over the last couple of days. There is not the slightest suspicion on the part of the member for Griffith or me that there was ever going to be a decision reached by this inquiry that would find a these folk culpable of anything, because we understood from the outset that it was set up that way. That was obvious to us after correspondence between the member for Griffith and the Cole commission. It is no particular revelation to us. There is no overwhelming disappointment on our part for the fact that no responsibility has been accepted by the Prime Minister or by any of his ministerial colleagues. There is disappointment, however, on behalf of the Australian people. Let me go to one of the editorials that has been produced today on the performance by our government in the Cole commission of inquiry. I will go through these in some detail a little later. Mr Speaker, you will recollect in this chamber-and we had it here again today-the constant calls from the government for an apology, of all things, from me and the member for Griffith to the ministers who are the perpetrators of this negligence. I will go to the last paragraph of the editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald today: ‘I don't expect it will happen, but Mr Downer and Mr Vaile are owed apologies by Mr Beazley and Mr Rudd,' Mr Howard said yesterday, citing his political opponents' pursuit of his ministers over the AWB scandal. On the contrary, Prime Minister, it is the Australian people who are owed the apology. Your ministers, who have so signally failed to manage their portfolios, should make Indeed they should. I have not seen such unanimity by editorial writers on the culpability of this government. Every one of the editorial writers in the major daily newspapers today has picked up on the obvious fact that this government has dodged a bullet largely by its own manipulation, not by the fact that its conduct was inspected and regarded as adequate by an appropriate authority. You can see that in the headlines. The Age said: The Federal Government says it has been exonerated by the Cole report. Questions, however, remain on its responsibilities. The Herald Sun editorial is entitled ‘A case of incompetence', and it starts with quite a nice quote from the Prime Minister from October 2005 in which he said: ‘My dealings with the people in AWB ... (they've) always been a very straight up and down group of people.' Then we have the editorial in today's Financial Review entitled, ‘Matter of shame and competence.' The Canberra Times editorial is entitled, ‘PM's wheat-wash not white enough'. In the Australian we see: Cole shows depth of AWB deceit. AWB's double dealings in Iraq have cost Australia dearly and politicians must share some of the blame. They shared an awful lot more of it when you go into the detail of that. ‘No excuses for funding a villain', said the Daily Telegraph. The Sydney Morning Herald article that I quoted from earlier said, ‘Government still not off the hook.' They are very bored with this analysis of their activities; nevertheless, they stand condemned. This Prime Minister and his ministers say that it is simply not their fault. They will not take responsibility. He never takes it. responsibility for himself. He never pays the price for his incompetence. Alexander Downer and Mark Vaile do not pay the price. Who pays the price? Australians pay the price: not just our young heroes in Iraq facing insurgents armed by AWB's bribes; Australia's hard working wheat growers have paid the price. AWB is threatened by lawsuits both in Australia and overseas. There are potential further restrictions on AWB's trade overseas, and trade with Iraq worth more than $500 million a year has been lost. AWB shareholders have lost half the value of their investment. How did that happen? What are the shattering facts? Firstly, Australia's monopoly wheat exporter bribed the Saddam regime to buy Australian wheat. As I said, this is no ordinary scandal. Domestic laws were broken, international obligations were ignored and there were hundreds of millions in bribes, and topless photos to boot. It took special people to manage this. You see, Prime Minister, this was the National Party on tour. You can just see the emails home: ‘Send lawyers, guns and money.' Lying with lawyers, playing with guns and bribing with millions! They thought they could get away with anything because they knew the government did not want to know. That is the nasty little secret here, Prime Minister: the essential connection between the people who were running AWB and your ministers and the government. The people in AWB knew the government did not want to know. They thought it was ‘mates' rules': what goes on tour stays on tour. The departments of Alexander Downer and Mark Vaile",65
116,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"Order! I am reluctant to interrupt, but would the Leader of the Opposition refer to ministers.",69
117,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"The departments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the then Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister, approved the contracts that contained the bribes. What was the AWB executive supposed to think about the state of the government's mind while all this was going on? They had had 35 warnings, and occasionally they were confronted by Foreign Affairs officials who had been tipped off to those warnings and asked the questions, to which AWB answered: ‘No, we're not doing anything.' You know: ‘There's no gambling going on here, Sir! Nothing is happening here.' Was there a further question then? No. There was no further question. What do you think they thought from all of that? What they thought, of course, was that they were approved. We are not dealing here with some sort of group of spivs, hanging about overseas in the bars of downtown Hong Kong, downtown Shanghai or wherever. What we are dealing with are people who are senior in the councils of at least one of the political parties that make up this lition; people who have been candidates for the National Party in federal elections; people who have sat on the executive of the National Party, at both the state and federal els; people who stand well with the government; people who are intimate with the details of how this country is governed; people who are intimate with the details of how ministers relate to each other and how departments through those ministers officiate over their affairs. In AWB we are dealing with a body in which a large number of members of the government are shareholders, in which many farmers in this country who support different elements of the government are shareholders. We are dealing with AWB, with the heart and soul of the National Party-one of the bodies that make up this coalition government, one which the Liberal Party never dares confront and allows to go on in their own sweet way, doing whatever it is that they please. That is how this scandal started. This Prime Minister, the trickiest we have seen in that position in this country for a very lengthy period of time, knows how to dodge between the raindrops as he avoids any form of obligation and any form of blame in relation to this matter. What is his defence now? What is his defence reduced to? What is his default position explaining what it is they are up to? The Prime Minister says to us: ‘We are not criminal. We are just incompetent. Our ministers are not criminals; they are just incompetent.' Either way, these ministers should have resigned months ago and must resign now. If they do not, the Prime Minister should sack them or sack himself. Understand this: the government were warned 35 times. In 1998, they were warned by our intelligence community; in 1999, they were warned by the Canadians; in 2000, they were warned by the coa- United Nations; in 2001, they were warned by the New York Times; in 2002, they were warned by Australian grain merchants; in 2003, they were warned by the United States; levin 2004, they were warned by the Australian Defence Force; and, in 2005, they were warned by AWB itself but they did not want to know the truth. Before, during and after the Iraq war and even when the Volcker inquiry was underway, the Howard government did nothing to stop hundreds of millions of dollars flowing to the Saddam regime. It did nothing to uphold the sanctions against Saddam. It did nothing to prevent funding of suicide bombers and regime forces. It did nothing to protect the reputation of Australia's hard working wheat growers. It did nothing to protect the future of the single desk. Howard, Downer and Vaile-the three wise monkeys-saw nothing, heard nothing, said nothing. Those three ministers so resemble those three wise monkeys-hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. You could not want a better simile for the government's behaviour in this very sorry scandal. They did nothing. They let Australia down. They betrayed their ministerial oaths. They betrayed what the Australian people expected of them, which is that they would diligently administer their departments and ensure that the Ausmade. tralian national interest was protected at times. The thing that I find most unforgivable is that their behaviour is at odds with and is a total betrayal of our armed forces, whom they committed to battle and committed to upholding the sanctions regime with a diligence which they never displayed but should have emulated. They should be censured. (Time expired)",69
118,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Rudd-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,70
119,Mr HOWARD,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"Rather predictably, the Leader of the Opposition has moved a censure motion. The fact that he spent almost 10 minutes quoting from editorials was message enough to me that there was very little of substance in the motion that he brought before the parliament. But let me give it the seriousness that a censure motion against a Prime Minister and a government deserves and deal with the substance of the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition. The substance of that allegation was that the government deliberately or through conduct equal to deliberation turned a blind eye to what was going on, that it did not want to know what was going on and, therefore, until confronted with irrefutable evidence that something was wrong, it preferred not to know anything about the allegations that were made in relation to AWB. The other allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition is that the government deliberately organised terms of reference that would prevent the commissioner making an adverse finding against me or against any of my ministers. I want to deal in the time available to me with those two claims, because they are the only claims of substance that have been Let me deal first of all with the claim all that in some way we manipulated the terms of reference. That is a claim which I emphatically reject. In emphatically rejecting it, I draw on no greater authority than that of Commissioner Cole himself. On 3 February this year, Commissioner Cole issued a lengthy statement amidst claims that in some way the terms of reference were too restrictive. Amongst other things, what he had to say is very pertinent to the claim raised by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is asking the parliament to censure the government inter alia because we rorted the terms of reference. This is what Commissioner Cole had to say: That means that this inquiry will address and make findings regarding at least the following: (a) the role of DFAT in the process of obtaining United Nations approval of AWB wheat contracts within the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme; (b) the knowledge of DFAT in relation to such contracts; (c) what AWB told the Commonwealth, and in particular DFAT, relating to the Iraqi wheat contracts; and (d) whether the Commonwealth, and in particular DFAT, was informed of any knowledge AWB may be found to have had, regarding payments made by AWB to Alia. In other words, Mr Cole was saying that, under the terms of reference given to him by the government, he would examine in full every aspect of DFAT's behaviour in this whole matter. There was no restriction. He said he would look at everything that DFAT didMr Downer-And he did.",70
120,Mr HOWARD,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"And he did, as the foreign minister rightly interjects. For almost a year, vast resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were devoted to meeting the requirements of this commission. There are many people on both sides of politics who know and respect the legal reputation of Mr Cole. Even the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that he is a person of ability and somebody with great forensic skills. Mr Cole would be the last man in Australia to leave a stone unturned in doing his duty by the Australian people. His reputation is involved in this, as well as the reputation of ministers and-I put it to the parliamentthe reputation of the two men who are sitting opposite me on the opposition front benches. All of our reputations are involved in this. The last thing Mr Cole was going to do was be involved in any kind of slipshod work or any kind of cover-up. He asked all the questions and, in the end, he required my appearance, the appearance of the foreign minister and the appearance of the Deputy Prime Minister. It is a serious issue to go commission of inquiry as Prime Minister or minister and give evidence under oath. It is something you take seriously. You do your homework. You make sure that everything you say is absolutely correct. Yet, after all that examination and after having looked at everything that DFAT had done-and DFAT was the operative department-and after having looked at everything that my colleagues had done, he said that there was absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing. That is the reality of this situation. I know this commission of inquiry report is an intense disappointment to those who sit opposite. After all, you have accused me and my colleagues of lying, you have accused us of covering up and you have accused us of corruption. There is no mucking about: they accused us of dishonesty, of a cover-up and of corruption. Those are pretty serious charges. I have made some serious allegations in this parliament in 32 years, but I have normally had a bit more evidence before I have made charges of that degree of seriousness against people who have tried to do the right thing according to their own political philosophy. A bit of strong political combat is fair enough, but the Leader of the Opposition wound himself up in confected outrage and said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was corrupt, that I was corrupt and that the Deputy Prime Minister was corrupt. He might say we are wrong, he might say we are misguided, he might say we are foolish, he might say we are invincibly ignorant, but in making those kinds of allegations without a skerrick of evidence-not a scintilla of evidence, to borrow a phrase from an earlier inquiry-he engaged in a farrago of falsehoods, to borrow a phrase from yet another earlier inquiry, in relation to the behaviour of me and my ministers. It gets worse than that for the Leader of to a the Opposition. In paragraph 14 of his landmark statement-and it is a landmark statement in the saga of this inquiry- Mr Cole said: Accordingly, if, during the course of my inquiry, of it appears to me that there might have been a breach of any Commonwealth, State or Territory law by the Commonwealth or any officerand for ‘officer' read ‘including minister'of the Commonwealth related to the subject matter of the terms of reference, I will approach Attorney-General seeking a widening of the terms of reference to permit me to make such a finding. He did not seek a widening of the terms of reference. Because, despite the 76 days of hearings, despite the millions of words, the thousands upon thousands of documents, the numerous statements, the numerous interviews-despite all of that-there was no evidence that we had broken the law. Isn't there something rather odd? Here you have somebody accusing us of corruption, of dishonesty, of lying, of gross negligence, of all of these other things, yet the commissioner does not ask for an extension of the terms of reference. The truth is that this was an inquiry of remarkable transparency. I would remind the parliament that a decision was taken to establish this inquiry within days of the government receiving the Volcker report. We are the only government around the world that has had an inquiry of this nature. We knew when we established this inquiry that it would go on for a long time. We accepted that at the end of day it might require the appearance of me and of ministers. And we know that, in relation to all of these inquiries, where it ultimately runs to, you know not. We were prepared to accept the consequences of that not because we wanted to cover up but in the name of transparency. In this entire debate I think the most baseless charge from the opposition is that we have engaged in a cover-up. If we had wanted to cover up, do you know what we would have done? We would have sent this off to some kind of investigation by the Australian Federal Police-not that they would not do their job correctly, but knowing full well that they would not have the inquisitorial power or tribunal in order to get to the bottom of this. What blew AWB open was the fact that the the commission could subpoena the production of documents. Once they got inside AWB, the game was up. They got inside AWB and they found the documentary trail of deception and deceit. That is what blew the lid off this. Unless you had had an inquiry with the powers of a royal commission, that would never have happened. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the member for Griffith that if we had wanted to cover up we would never have had an inquiry. I knew from day one that, if you had an inquiry with the powers of a royal commissioner, that royal commissioner would demand the production of documents. Once you have got your hands on the documents, you have got your hands on the truth and on the real story. I knew that was going to happen, but I wanted the real story to come out. I wanted to know what had happened, because I had believed that this company had been a reputable company. I had believed that I do not mind admitting itand so had many of my colleagues. I remember very vividly early in 2005 that, when I was presented with advice from my department and from the Australian consul-general in New York that AWB was being less than cooperative in relation to the Volcker inquiry, alarm bells started to ring. I wrote on the minute: ‘There must be complete transparency and cooperation.' For the first time. I began to entertain a real belief that this company had behaved improperly. I cannot deny that prior to that I made certain remarks about it. Indeed, as Cole himself has found, one of the reasons why the company was able to get away with what it did was its pattern of deceit built upon a reputation for integrity and trust. With all of this nonsense about a cover-up, you have only to sit for a moment and understand the way an inquiry of this nature operates and the powers it has to realise that once we established that inquiry we were bound to see the whole thing busted open. If you had wanted to have a cover-up, you would never have had an inquiry. We would have been like every other government around the world-I am not saying they are covering up-in not having an inquiry. So this pathetic, confected attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that in some way it is a betrayal of our armed forces, it is a betrayal of this and it is a trayal of that is not supported by any of the evidence that has been put forward. The greatest evidence of our bona fides was the establishment of the inquiry. Once you establish inquiries such as this, you know not where it will ultimately lead. That is precisely what had happened. It went down every path available to it. Mr Beazley interjecting",71
121,Mr HOWARD,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"The Leader of the Opposition, as usual, is constantly yabbering across the table here. The Leader of the Opposition spent almost 10 minutes quoting from editorials in newspapers, because there was absolutely no substance in the censure motion that he brought against us. The Leader of the Opposition is very disappointed by the commission's report and so is the member for Griffith, because they had built an elaborate attack on the reputation of my government based on the evidence relating to AWB. I am very proud that this government did the right thing in establishing this inquiry, and I will yield to nobody in this parliament in relation to issues relating to a willingness to have a transparent investigation where matters ought to be fully investigated. Mr Beazley interjecting",73
122,Mr HOWARD,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"The Leader of the Opposition may interject as often as he likes, but nothing can alter the fact that the day we decided to give the powers of a royal commissioner to Mr Cole was the day we set up the circumstances where we got to the bottom of what really happened. The power of Mr Cole to demand the production of documents was the key to finding out what really happened. I reject the censure motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I take this opportunity to place on record my total support for and confidence in the Deputy Prime Minister beand the Minister for Foreign Affairs, both of whose reputations have been unreasonably traduced by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith. Attack them for what they believe in, but do not baselessly attack their integrity! (Time expired)",73
123,Mr RUDD,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"This parliament on many occasions has seen this Prime Minister full of self-righteousness, full of mock indignation, full of arrogance and full of self-satisfaction, but on the key question of answering the charge which has been put to him today-which is that this government was negligent in its discharge of its national security responsibilities-we have had not a single answer. In response to the substantive charge that this government engaged in a systematic cover-up concerning its negligence on national security, we have had not a single substantive answer worthy of reflection. On the other substantive charge in this censure motion, as the Prime Minister escapes from the chamber-which is that this has been at great cost to this country's hard working wheat farmers and our economy more generally-we have had not a single substantive answer. They are the three charges contained in this censure motion and we have had not a single substantive answer. In fact, overnight the Prime Minister was saying that we the opposition owe this government an apology. I find this extraordinary. I have this question for the Minister for Foreign Affairs before he takes the dispatch box: who is going to apologise to Australia's hard working wheat farmers? Half a billion dollars has gone down the chute in terms of lost contracts in Iraq. Who is going to apologise to all the Australian companies whose reputation has now been traduced by this? Who is going to apologise to the thousands of our troops who have served in Iraq in the most difficult and dangerous operational environment? Today the Prime Minister was ducking and weaving around the truth, saying that the money sent to Iraq through the AWB was not used to buy weapons. My question to the Prime Minister-which the foreign minister will soon answer for himis: who will apologise to the people who have suffered real harm here? Our wheat farmers, the rest of corporate Australia, this nation's entire international standing and our troops in the field have been harmed. I think this shows the extent to which this Prime Minister is no longer in touch with the Australian people and what they think about this level of arrogance from the dispatch box today. If you listened carefully to the Prime Minister's defence, you would know that it rested in large part on a rendition of the terms of reference. We have heard this time and time again in this chamber. It is time to bring this argument to its conclusion. The Prime Minister today said that Commissioner Cole in February this year issued a statement concerning his terms of reference. Commissioner Cole said at, I think, paragraph 12 of the document that if he needed extra powers he would write to the government and get them. What the Prime Minister has never admitted at this dispatch box is that the extra powers the commissioner could have asked of the government would have related only to matters relating to the criminality of the AWB and, as a consequence of that, possible criminality on the part of ministers and officials. When that document was released by the Cole commission in February 2006, I wrote to Commissioner Cole. I said: ‘Commissioner, you put out a statement about your terms of reference. You have asked for submissions-here is one. Will you add to your terms of reference a head of power which enables you to make determinations about whether ministers-in particular, the foreign minister-did their job? Will you add a term of reference, a head of power, which would enable you as commissioner to determine whether this minister did all that was reasonable and fair within his portfolio to uphold Australia's obligations under UN sanctions against Iraq? Under the Australian Customs regulations, this minister-and nobody else-is the minister responsible.' What was the gaping hole in Commissioner Cole's terms of reference? It was that Commissioner Cole had no head of power whatsoever to determine whether the minister or the department did their job in that respect. So I wrote to the commissioner and said, ‘Commissioner, will you request that additional power?' Through his office, he wrote back to me not more than a week or two later. What he said to me was highly instructive. He said: ‘ Mr Rudd, those additional powers represent such a huge expansion of my existing powers that I could not possibly ask for that. The only way I could be given those powers is if the government gave them to me of its own accord.' That is what he said in black and white. He said he could only request an extension of powers in relation to his current substantive terms of reference, which only went to matters of criminality. So there you have it in black and white from the commissioner. It was a royal commission established with narrow powers to look, in the first instance, purely at questions of criminality on the part of the AWB and, secondly and relatedly, at whether there was any associated criminality on the part of ministers or any other representative of the Commonwealth. On the question of ministers' administrative responsibility under Australia's domestic administrative law-the Customs regulations-there was not a single head of power. When I asked the commissioner to add that power, he said: ‘It's not me to ask, sonny Jim; it's only for them to give. I don't set the rules here.' We have heard speeches overnight from various ministers in mock self-righteousness, indignation and all the rest of it saying that we should accept the umpire's decision. I think the trade minister said that overnight. Our complaint is not with the umpire; our complaint is with the man who set the rules for the match-the Prime Minister. He set the rules. He set them so narrow and so tight that it became inevitable that these ministers would get a tick at the end of the day-so limited was the test that they had to pass. From this dispatch box, the Leader of the Opposition and I have said this repeatedly for nearly a year. They think that it is some marvellous revelation that they get off scotfree from a rorted set of terms of reference which were rorted from day one. The complaint is not against the umpire; the complaint is against the man who set the rules for the game within which the umpire operated, the man who set the rules for the matchand that is the Prime Minister himself. That is the core summary of the inherent flaw, failing and contradiction in the Prime Minister's defence today concerning the terms of reference. The Prime Minister also took umbrage in his response to the Leader of the Opposition's censure motion when he said that we had had the audacity to accuse these ministers of not telling the truth, of lying. We had repeated statements from the Prime Minister and the foreign minister about a range of things in the course of the events of this year which were simply not true. The Prime Minister stood up on one occasion and said all documents had been provided to the Cole commission of inquiry. Five days later, as I recollect, the Cole commission of inquiry issued subpoenas to every department in town to collect a whole new batch of docufor ments. That is why I said this Prime Minister had lied. I do not recant from that one bit. It was technically accurate. We had the foreign minister and others claiming that they had fully cooperated with the Volcker inquiry, the one set up with by the UN in the first place. It is important to reflect on that in some detail as well. Guess what happened with Volcker? We found out during the course of this year that this minister had taken a submission from his department to the effect that no classified documents would be given by the government to Volcker and that no official would be made available to Volcker-so much so that Mr Volcker met our permanent representative in New York about a year into the inquiry and said, ‘You guys are not cooperating with the inquiry. Get your act together.' That is when this Prime Minister, finally having been outed by that revelation from Mr Volcker, made his handwritten annotation to public service departments: ‘There shall now be full cooperation with Volcker.' For a year they tried to subvert the Volcker inquiry, and the documentary evidence of that is clear. So, on this question of how unfair it is for us to say that this mob have been short on the truth in what they have said, I simply put that forward as exhibit B. They said that they had fully cooperated with Volcker; we found out from the documentary record that they did absolutely nothing of the sort. The final element on which this Prime Minister was so indignant today relates to what I have just said, but it is a broader point as well. He asked how we could possibly accuse this government, from whom righteousness beams forth from their souls. How could we possibly accuse this government of a cover-up? Let us leave the history to one side. Let us leave aside the ‘children overboard' affair and everything we have got to know about the viscera of this governmentunderstanding how they actually work, how they think and how they feel. ‘Here is a problem; here is a piece of truth-where is a box to hide it in now?' That is in fact their standard modus operandi. If you go to the facts of this in terms of a cover-up, first there is the issue of the Volcker inquiry; secondly, there is the issue of the US Senate inquiry, the Coleman inquiry, and hurriedly despatching officials to Washington on the eve of the Australian national elections in October 2004 to shut that inquiry down. Do you know why? Because they did not want it to come out a month before the Australian election. They did not want to cruel the Iraq pitch for themselves. But there is a third point when it comes to a cover-up-the first is Volcker and the second is the Coleman inquiry-that is, the terms of reference of the Cole inquiry itself. We have addressed that in some detail in our response on this censure. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister were disturbed today by the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition on a cover-up. There is one very interesting thing contained in this report-I think it is in volume 4. It says that as of June 2004 this mob over here, that is the minister's department, ‘knew'-and these are not my words; these are the commissioner's words-that the AWB had engaged a Jordanian company and that they were aware that that Jordanian company could well have been providing money to Saddam's regime. That is Commissioner Cole's conclusion: that as of June 2004 this mob over here-that is, the department of foreign affairs-actually knew that. The point of the opposition leader's question today was about how is it, then, that three months after that this minister sends his department to the Americans in Washington and says there is absolutely no foundation to any accusation in America that the AWB was providing kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime. Minister, it does not add up. Mr Cole has now said that in June 2004 your department knew. And three months later you went in and deliberately deceived the Americans. That is what you did. I have to say that that of all was done not just on one occasion by the acting ambassador in Washington but also on a second occasion by Ambassador Thorleyboth occasions being immediately prior to the election. So when they stand here with mock self-indignation, mock selfrighteousness, and say, ‘How could you accuse us of a cover-up?', think of these terms of reference, think of Volcker and think of how they have handled this US Senate inquiry. The Leader of the Opposition got it absolutely right today in nailing precisely what this government's ultimate defence on Cole is. Their defence is threefold. It is a defence based on ignorance, a defence based on incompetence and a defence based on negligence. That is what they say: ‘You cannot blame us for anything which happened in the five years that this scandal ran because we were ignorant, we were incompetent and we were negligent.' That is their defence. Do you know why they cannot take the opposite view? Because if they said they were actually doing their job, they would have known something about what went on. They feared that intensely, because that would land them in the dock with the AWB, complicit in the actions between the AWB and Saddam Hussein's regime. These are the only two options available to them. So their defence is: ‘We are a government which is ignorant, a government which is negligent and a government which is incompetent.' Their strategy is this, when it comes to this country's national security: eyes wide shut. The member for Bendigo mentioned this to me this morning; it is three words: eyes wide shut. That is a terrific defence if you are interested in getting yourself off the hook in a courtroom, but it is a lousy strategy if you are interested in this country's national security. The Australian people want eyes wide open, not eyes wide shut. But this government concluded that they needed, absolutely, eyes wide shut in order to get through the rigours of the Cole inquiry. So what you saw last night was a popping of the champagne corks, a celebration of their collective negligence, incompetence and ignorance, because that constitutes the essence of their defence against the charges made against them. This has been a long debate. It has run for more than a year since we first asked questions at this dispatch box. But this government stand censured for three things. They stand censured because they have been found, in five volumes, to be grossly negligent in discharging their national security obligations. They have been found to have engaged in three exercises of cover-up concerning their negligence because they did not want that to become known to the Australian people. And they have been found to have delivered this negligence at a profound cost to our wheat farmers, our economy, and our general corporate sector. But, overall, what has suffered here is the doctrine of ministerial accountability, because today this minister refused to accept even one jot of responsibility for the worse corruption scandal in Australia's history.

124,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"For the last year, the Leader of the Opposition in particular has made a series of utterly outrageous claims. Mr Crean-No, they haven't! You should apologise!",77
125,The SPEAKER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"Order! First of all, I remind members that, in this debate, while it is a censure motion, all speakers have been heard without interruption. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I ask you to require the Minister for Foreign Affairs to address members by their proper titles.",77
126,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"Mr Speaker, for the last year, the Leader of the Opposition, in particular-who now walks out, with all the courage he can muster; he is a weak and dishonest man-has engaged in some of the most egregious slurs that I have seen in my 22 years in politics. Let us just take this example, from an interview with Mr Carlton on Radio 2UE on 24 January: CARLTON: Do you really believe that the Government knew that the AWB was bribing Saddam Hussein and his henchmen? BEAZLEY: Absolutely. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say at the National Press Club about a week later: ‘This episode exposes the immorality and the corruption besetting this government.' He went on the Lateline program on 6 February and said: What we're interested is demonstrating as well what we believe to be the case and that's that they turned a blind eye to it ... He said ‘they turned a blind eye' a month or so later. On 24 March on Radio 2UE-his favourite outlet, apparently-the Leader of the Opposition said: On AWB they have been dissembling, not telling the truth for months ... ... ... ... ... they have been deceiving. They have been telling lies. ... ... ... They have been doing everything to cover this ... The problem with this particular narrative is that it is manifestly untrue, and the Cole commission has proven the allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition and by the member for Griffith to be completely false. And of course these allegations have been picked up by some others and run all over Australia. So all over Australia we have had these allegations that we are liars, that cheats, that we were involved in cover-ups, that we are corrupt. Mr Speaker, excuse me if I say this to the House, but it is a preposterous thing to allege that against a member of parliament of any party at any time and for that subsequently to have been exposed as being simply untrue-and that is what has happened here. The Cole commission has been an outstanding effort to expose the activities of AWB Ltd and its deceit of the Australian government; in that respect it has certainly been outstanding. Indeed, the government has been vindicated in the setting up of the Cole commission to get to the heart of what had been happening in terms of the wheat trade with Iraq. But the Cole commission has incidentally taken out the Leader of the Opposition's credibility. He has been standing in this parliament and at the National Press Club, and speaking over and over again on radio and television throughout the last year, telling manifest untruths. He has been lying over and over again. And that has been proven by the Cole commission. This commission is an enormous embarrassment to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith, whose only defence is now to turn around and say, ‘We don't like the terms of reference. The terms of reference didn't look into the government'-‘didn't look into the government'! The Prime Minister, the foreign up minister and the trade minister-the Deputy Prime Minister-spent hours in the witness box. ‘Didn't look into the government'! I myself spent-I might be wrong-3½ to four hours answering questions from counsel, and not just counsel assisting the commissioner; I spent hours being cross-examined by various counsel representing AWB employees and the like. The government was not only transparent we are in going before the commission; the government's documentation was run through with a fine-tooth comb by Commissioner Cole and, of course, all the people who assisted him. And what did it show? It showed a lot of things. But one thing it showed is that what the Labor Party, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, and others, have been saying about the Prime Minister, ministers, and the officials of my department, is quite untrue. We have silly questions today-no new information-and the Leader of the Opposition moves his entirely predictable censure motion. Well, it was not actually entirely predictable, because I did not think he would continue with his campaign of falsehood. The first point he makes is that the government was negligent in relation to the 35 warnings. The problem for the Leader of the Opposition and the problem for the Labor Party is that Commissioner Cole addressed the issue of the warnings. Although I know the Leader of the Opposition has not read any of the Cole report, or hardly any of the Cole commission reportDr Southcott-He doesn't read the papers!",77
127,Mr DOWNER,MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,"and, as the honourable member says, he does not even read the papers-some of his staff will have gone through it-and notice the fact that you get no questions from the Labor Party about the warnings. Why is that, do you think? Why is it that they run the warnings as an assertion, and they get others to run them, but they do not ever confront the government directly with the issue of the warnings? It is because Commissioner Cole went to this issue and said: ‘In regard to the many events during and after the oil for food program, it is not a correct approach to consider such events and circumstances cumulatively' and ‘it is not permissible to use hindsight to seek to establish a relationship between events'. Commissioner Cole dismissed this allegation in black and white but the Leader of the Opposition, who has not read the report and never will read the report, just rants his assertions with false anger and the false indignation of which he is a master-of course, the public has spotted that. He is exposed by the Cole commission yet again for being wrong. Did we know about the kickbacks? The Cole commission says no. The Leader of the Opposition knows better, does he? He says yes. He says yes but the Cole commission says no. Does the Cole commission say that the officials of my department are corrupt or colluding with AWB Ltd or are bad people? Does the commissioner say that? No, he does not. The Labor Party says that-but not the commissioner. The Labor Party has been smearing the reputation of officials of my department, implying-and sometimes saying-they are in collusion with AWB Ltd in a cover-up and corruption. That is a vile thing to have said about those officials. The House may be interested to know that, as the leader of that portfolio, I pass on their sentiments to this House and to this nation. The anger of some of the people in my department over what has been said and written about them and their integrity is palpable. They are completely vindicated by the Cole commission. The Leader of the Opposition's motion says that the government attempted to shut down the US senate inquiry into AWB in 2004. The government did not. The government never attempted to shut down that inquiry. The government only asked that AWB be treated with procedural fairness: that it be treated fairly and in a non-discriminatory way-non-discriminatory vis-a-vis American companies. And, of course, AWB, through all that period-the period of the Volcker inquiry and right up to the end of the Volcker inquiry-were continuing to insist that they were not involved in kickbacks. If you read the whole report, you will see exactly what is said and what the issues really are. I have mentioned already, as the Prime Minister has, that the Leader of the Opposition said that the government had failed: ... to provide the Cole Inquiry with powers to determine whether or not Ministers did their job ... If ministers had known about this and ministers had not enforced the sanctions regime, that would be a profoundly serious offenceit is only that that is not true. The Cole commission has found that that is not true. And that is a matter of profound embarrassment to the blowhard Leader of the Opposition: for all his abuse and denigration of people, his abuse has been found to be entirely without foundation. The fact is-and this is the problem with the Labor Party and their fellow travellers' narrative-they think that somehow the government was in favour of sanctions busting of Saddam Hussein's regime but at the same time in favour of getting rid of the regime. See, Mr Speaker, if you can work out the logic of that! Why would we get rid of Saddam Hussein's regime if our view was that the great thing about it was that we could make a lot of money out of it-and who cares about the sanctions? Why would we have got rid of the regime? We presumably, according to that narrative, would have opposed, tooth and nail, the overthrow of Saddam's regime. Actually, quite the reverse is true: there were several occasions during that sanctions regime when I was attacked-not, admittedly, by the Labor Party-by people for our support for the sanctions. There were assertions made that the sanctions were hurting the livelihoods of ordinary people in Iraq and that I was a terrible person who supported those sanctions. I remember seeing people who came to argue the case that we should not support the sanctions and that we should support the lifting of the sanctions. I never did; I always supported the sanctions. As Commissioner Cole has shown, no instruction was given by any minister at any time from March 1996 up until the dismantling of the sanctions to go soft on the sanctions, to dismantle the sanctions or to abandon the sanctions. No instruction was given to do anything except uphold the sanctions. Nobody in the department ever thought they were doing anything but upholding the sanctions. The suggestion here of the Labor Party's narrative is that we were in favour of getting rid of Saddam Hussein and we were in favour of sanctions busting. Not only are both propositions entirely inconsistent but the argument is entirely incoherent. It is intellectually false. I tell you what: the Australian public know that. They know we were not opposed to sanctionsthey know we supported the sanctions-and they know we were opposed, unlike the Labor Party, to Saddam Hussein's regime to such an extent that we were prepared to contribute to getting rid of it. It is good riddance to bad rubbish, too, because it is a great thing that that regime has gone. What would have happened if the mendacious, self-righteous Leader of the Opposition had had his way? We do not really know what would have happened, of course, because you never know what he really thinks on any given day. It depends which way the wind is blowing. But, according to his current rhetoric, not necessarily according to what he would have done at the time, Saddam Hussein would still be in power today, the oil for food program would still be in place and of course nobody would be any the wiser about the kickback regime that was taking place in the oil for food program. That is what would have happened if the Labor Party had had its way. That is what would have happened if the Labor Party had been influential enough in government to influence world policy. This Labor Party is led by the weakest man who has ever led the Labor Party. And it is not just my assertion; the public are onto it. Even the member for Griffith is twice as popular as the Leader of the Opposition to be the leader of the Labor Party. I agree with them: although the member for Griffith has been mendacious, the Leader of the Opposition's performance throughout this matter has been a tissue of lies.

CRIMES AMENDMENT (BAIL AND SENTENCING) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed.",83
149,Mr JOHNSON,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"In the Australian parliament, as the representative of the people of Ryan, I have great pleasure in speaking on the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006. I very strongly commend it to my electorate and to the House of Representatives. This is an important bill that the Howard government is again putting before the parliament. It is all about reconciliation and ensuring that this is a strong and united country irrespective of whether we are Indigenous Australians or white Australians. I think this is a piece of legislation that is very important for all of us to take note of. I want to briefly mention the notion of reconciliation before I go on to the substance of the bill because I think it is important. Reconciliation with our Indigenous communities is one of the most important challenges facing our nation. I think that for any federal government this should always remain a priority irrespective of the political colour of that government. I think that true reconciliation is something that needs to be worked on-it is a work in progress-with all stakeholders of goodwill coming together. I want to quote the views of this side of the parliament as to what embraces true reconciliation as expressed by the Prime Minister in his Menzies lecture in December 2000 on the very important issue of Indigenous Australians. He said: True reconciliation is, in our view, to be best found within practical means to improve the well-being and happiness of indigenous Australians and raising standards to levels enjoyed and expected by all of us. The essence of that is that we are all Australians and we all have every entitlement to enjoy equal standards, equal opportunities and equal prosperity. These should not be limited to any section of the Australian community. Of course, we all know that Indigenous Australians in the past have suffered greatly. No-one should try to deny that. No-one should try to walk away from that fact. But as a modern, sophisticated, 21st century nation it is time that we look forward and have a vision to come together and to address the challenges and the difficulties that we have in this country. That is why this bill is important. It reconfirms that the Indigenous Australians of this country ought to be treated in the very same way as non-Indigenous Australians in our criminal justice system. I know that the electorate of Ryan, which I represent here in the parliament, would have been very shocked to see the Lateline program of several months ago that alleged the abuse of children in the remote Mutitjulu community. These allegations came on top of claims earlier in the year that petrol sniffing and substance abuse was also rife within the Mutitjulu community. I think those allegations have again highlighted the need for reconciliation efforts to be a priority of any Australian government, and the Howard government does make this a very strong priority. People of goodwill in this parliament, people with a genuine desire to make a difference in our country, should try and work together on this issue, as we should on many other issues that we face. According to the 2001 census, Australia's Indigenous population was some 458,000. Of course, that was five years ago and no doubt that figure is well and truly past the halfmillion mark. I do not have the precise figure but it would be well and truly past that. The census of this year will reveal the most up to-date figures when it is made public some time soon. That figure represents approximately 2.4 per cent of the overall population of Australia. However, Indigenous people make up 24 per cent of Australians living in areas classified as either remote or very mote. More than half of all Indigenous people live in New South Wales or my home state of Queensland-the greatest state in the Commonwealth, of course! In 2001 Queensland was home to just under 126,000 Indigenous Australians. The Indigenous population in our country is growing faster than the non-Indigenous population. NonIndigenous growth is some 1.8 per cent compared to Indigenous growth of two per cent. We, as the duly elected government of this country, have an obligation to pass laws in this parliament that seek to make a difference in the Australian electorate. Indigenous affairs is a very important area, and at the moment that portfolio is under the stewardship of Minister Mal Brough, who is doing an outstanding job. We are trying to get away from the ideologically driven policies of vious Labor governments which focused more on rights than responsibilities and more on division than unity. Labor clearly neglected to make any practical advance in the areas of Indigenous health and education and tried to promote more of a handout than a hand-up mindset. In my home state of Queensland, Noel Pearson is a highly respected voice on Indigenous affairs, and I might say I had the pleasure of going to the same school as him in Brisbane-St Peter's Lutheran College, in the suburb of Indooroopilly. He has become one of this country's significant spokesmen on Indigenous affairs, bringing a clear intellect and voice to this important area of policy. The federal Labor government of past years had an ideological focus, whereas this government is trying to focus on making a real and meaningful impact on health, education and related issues such as safety and security for Indigenous women, particularly young women who are very much at risk re- from criminal behaviour by Indigenous men in their communities. Clearly, this bill is all about what the government is doing to address that. I want to quote Senator Chris Evans of the Labor Party because he made a very interesting speech in which he gave an instructive acknowledgement of Labor's dismal failure to address this issue. He acknowledges himself that this ideological commitment is the wrong approach. He said: Labor's ideological commitment to the rights agenda, self-determination and reconciliation was not matched by a successful attack on the fundamental causes of Indigenous disadvantage. We put too much faith in the capacity of the rights agenda to contribute to overcoming entrenched Indigenous disadvantage. He goes on in the speech to make remarks about trying to address Indigenous well-being under a future Labor government. Of course, prethis government's record stands proudly because it is making a difference. In April 2004 it became clear that the ATSIC experiment, which was introduced by the Labor Party, had failed to respond to the crisis in confidence in this supposedly peak and supposedly representative Indigenous body. The government responded swiftly and decisively, announcing sweeping reforms that included the abolition of the ATSIC organisation. In terms of the budget that the Commonwealth allocates to this very critical area of national policy, real spending on Indigenousspecific programs has increased by almost 50 per cent over the last decade from the levels when the Howard government was first elected in 1996. The 2006-07 budget provides the biggest investment in Indigenous affairs. More than $3.3 billion of Australian taxpayers' money is allocated by the Howard government to areas of health, education, housing and security for our Indigenous Australians. All taxpayers in this country would expect that that money is allocated and invested appropriately and that it does produce outcomes that improve the lives of our Indigenous Australians. This $3.3 billion includes almost $500 million in additional spending to support 24 new Indigenous projects spanning six portfolios. I commend that. The background to this bill is about leadership from the government over the issue of extensive reports and allegations of violence in Aboriginal communities. With this bill the government is taking the lead to implement the outcomes of the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities, held in June 2006, which were later confirmed by COAG at its July 2006 meeting. The summit was concerned about the examples of customary law being used to mitigate the punishments for criminal offences, resulting in the guilty parties ting significantly lighter sentences than would otherwise be condoned by the law. In particular, there were concerns over the lack of testing of what defendants claimed to be customary law. This is a totally untenable situation where we have two sets of laws in this country: the common law and the statute law of this country, on the one hand, versus customary law that is applied to Indigenous Australians. I know the overwhelming majority of the Ryan electorate would not accept that as being in the best interests of a united Australian nation. A woman who, for example, is the subject of sexual abuse in an Aboriginal community is entitled to the same justice as a victim lives in any other part of Australia, in any other suburb of the cities of this country. They should not be treated differently. They are entitled to see the guilty party appropriately punished and not given a lesser, and in some cases much lesser, sentence simply because that person claims the act was condoned by customary law. There is the example of the 55-year-old man who was initially only jailed for one month for anally raping a 14-year-old girl. The judge in that case accepted that, under tribal law, the victim was his promised bride. In 21st century Australia, to me as an individual in this country, separate from my Ryan electorate representative duties here, that is absolutely untenable. Someone who rapes a 14-year-old girl being jailed for one month is just beyond the pale. This government must ensure that those sorts of examples do not become part of an Indigenous legal culture, if I can put it that way. In another example, a 29-year-old Aboriginal man choked his pregnant wife to death before burning her and their unborn child on a bonfire. In that case, his conviction would have dictated a sentence of ‘strict security life imprisonment' with a minimum get- term of between 20 and 30 years of imprisonment. The man in this particular case, however, had already been subject to traditional punishment by his tribe, which the judge took into account, instead imposing a life sentence with parole after only 19 years. So it was 19 years versus, potentially, 30 years of imprisonment simply because his tribe had, in their view, in their wisdom and in their culture, dealt out traditional punishment. In this country all of us are subject to the same laws of the Commonwealth and the states. I want to assure my electorate of Ryan that under the Howard government the Australian judicial system, the Australian laws of this land, will not condone such serious ofwho fences as sexual violence and abuse in order to allow guilty parties to escape appropriate punishment. While it is important to take into account a person's background during sentencing, the cultural background of a person should not be held up as something of particular and special consideration in the sentencing process. Moreover, it should certainly never be used to sideline the rights of the victims and avoid full and proper punishment for any offence. It is interesting to note that COAG, in its joint communique presented at the July meeting of COAG, reflects this view. What COAG stated is very instructive to all of us: The law's response to family and community violence and sexual abuse must reflect the seriousness of such crimes. COAG agreed that no customary law or cultural practice excuses, justifies, authorises, requires or lessens the seriousness of violence or sexual abuse. All jurisdictions agree that their laws will reflect this, if necessary by future amendment. I take the opportunity in parliament to commend the Northern Territory government because I understand that they have been very much on the front foot to pass legislation that reflects the COAG statement. The Deputy Chief Minister, Mr Sid Stirling, has said publicly that the laws of the Northern Territory do reflect what COAG agreed to. He said: In the Northern Territory we've change the rules on customary law-you can't use it as a defence and in sentencing it's controlled, tested and limited. On the other hand, I want to highlight the absurd position of the Western Australian Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Sheila MCHale, who strongly supports tribal law and told the summit in Canberra that Western Australia did not support the elimination of Indigenous tribal law. That was rebuked by magistrate Sue Gordon, the chairwoman of the National Indigenous Council, who very commendably hit out at plans to give Western Australian judges and magistrates great discretion to consider Aboriginal tribal law when dealing with criminal cases. I commend her in the national parliament for her position. Regrettably, time is getting away from me, as it always does when I am speaking on a very important bill in the interests of this country's future. The Australian government wishes to ensure that all Australians are treated equally under Australian law and that victims receive the justice to which they are entitled. The bill therefore amends the sentencing and bail provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 to require a court to consider the potential impact on victims and witnesses, and specifically the potential impact on victims and witnesses in remote communities, when granting and imposing bail conditions for Commonwealth offences. Most significantly, the bill deletes the reference to ‘cultural background' in section 16A of the Crimes Act for all Commonwealth offences and ensures that no customary law or cultural practice excuses, justifies, authorises, requires, or lessens the seriousness of any criminal behaviour with which that act is concerned. Essentially, the bill confirms that no customary law or cultural practice excuses criminal behaviour, including unlawful violence or sexual abuse. Of course, a lot of sheer nonsense has come from the opposition. I hope that the Labor speaker who will follow me, a highly respected member of this parliament and a senior counsel, will not follow the remarks of the speaker before me, who talked about this bill as simply being about getting headlines and about mere political opportunism. I very much hope that he does not follow that course of conduct because that allegation is quite an affront to those on this side of the House-that we would pass this piece of very significant legislation taking away cultural background as an aspect of a Commonwealth act simply for headlines. That is an affront to me personally, and an affront to this government. I hope that the quality of his presentation exceeds-and I am sure it will-that of the speaker before me in the debate on this bill. In conclusion, I end my remarks by supporting this bill very strongly and by quoting the opposition leader and shadow Attorney General of the Northern Territory, who made a very significant point. He said: The women and children who are brutalised every day in Central Australia are, apparently, meant take great comfort from the knowledge that their violent, and usually drunk, attackers have some passing acquaintance with, and at best tenuous involvement in, some cultural practices. Of course, they are not. This bill ensures for victims that terrible and brutal crimes committed by Indigenous men cannot be hidden under the charade of customary law when it comes to them facing legal sanction for their behaviour.

150,Mr KERR,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"I assure the honourable member for Ryan that, far from thinking that this proposition has been put forward merely to obtain headlines, I think its motivation is far worse. I think it is a far more unsatisfactory piece of legislation than has been asserted by most members of the opposition thus far. The Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 reflects an attack on some of the most fundamental understandings of human nature that ought to underpin the criminal law. I speak in this debate from the perspective of having been a long-serving member of the legal profession who commenced his career as a prosecutor then spent three years in Papua New Guinea, including a period as Dean of the Law School at the University of Papua New Guinea working on issues of tribal violence in the highlands, and who worked for a year as principal solicitor for the Aboriginal Legal Service in New South Wales. So I feel some capacity to make judgements about the merits or otherwise of propositions of criminal law. It seems to me quite absurd that, when we deal with our relationship to a conquered race, which the Aboriginal people are in this country-a people who were pushed and dispossessed from their lands by a successful invasion of which I am the successful and proud present representative-we do not to understand that we have to treat the original inhabitants of our nation with some respect for their traditional culture and norms. Picture a different society-one where the Indigenous community was not so displaced. Take my example of Papua New Guinea, where I taught and worked for three years. In that community a proposition such as the one being put forward today would be regarded as entirely absurd. Customary law is part of the underlying law of Papua New Guinea. It must be, because the thinking and conduct of people is fundamentally determined by those customary obligations. And any criminal justice system that does not take those customary obligations into account simply does not connect with that world-living reality in which those people live. The legal system in Papua New Guinea, of course, recognises cultural norms-not to forgive conduct that the parliament of Papua New Guinea has chosen to criminalise, which may or may not have been criminal under customary arrangements, but to recognise that moral fault diminishes or increases in accordance with the circumstances in which a person engages and has relationships with that legal system. We forget that in enacting our criminal law we embed in our criminal law all our customary understandings and practices. Our criminal law does not need to have specific provisions which relate to our customary understandings and those things which we respect and condone because it is embedded in the legal system we enact. But when we are passing laws that have an impact on others who have a different cultural background, whose lands we have invaded and whose people we have pushed aside, are we to pretend that they must suddenly emerge and have no connection whatsoever with their previous cultural norms, particularly when some of those people-only a handful, admittedly, but nonetheless some-still have no greater contact with the newly introduced systems of laws than do some people in Papua New Guinea? I defy anybody in this House to imagine a different regime coming to this country and pushing us aside-a community, say, of Germans, Japanese or Chinese. If they became the political class that ruled this country and made a new set of laws, and then said of everything we took for granted-such as marriage, our cultural norms, those rights that we hold dear, the carriage of our religious responsibilities and the like-that none of those things could be taken into account when moral fault was being judged, we would regard that as quite tragic and unthinkable. We do not face those circumstances, but Aboriginal Australians do. Aboriginal Australians face that every day. I do not have any time for this re-myth making that this government is engaged in. The government cheerfully attacks the approach of former governments. It says the former government was too interested in rights rather than responsibilities. Let us be fair about it: we should be more interested in rights because the remnant populations that we have so dispossessed have been denuded of everything of great value in most instances, treated in the abominable way that they have been in the past, given no citizenship rights, no right of vote, deprived of property, treated as chattel, chained and imprisoned-and then we are told we are more concerned about redressing rights than we are in relation to responsibilities. Well, cop me: I plead guilty. I am more interested in redressing rights. And if you wish to call me ‘black armband' in relation to my historical understanding, let me say that the black band has slipped upwards in this government's hands and now covers its eyes. It is a black mask government. It cannot see what is in front of its face because it chooses not to see it. In every settler society-South America and every other settler society-the colonial powers had contempt for the indigenous peoples that they usurped. In some societies that has changed fundamentally. In our neighbour, New Zealand, for example, at least the indigenous Maori people have representation in the parliament as of right. There are Maori seats. But we give our Indigenous people no direct and as of right political representation. In other societies treaties have been made with indigenous people to confer upon them inalienable rights because of a recognition of past wrongdoing. In societies where the invasion was not such as to turn the displaced populations into a tiny minority amongst the invading class, political revolutions have occurred-as they are now occurring in South America, where the Indian populations which were made subservient are regaining political power. This is much resented in many instances but it is nonetheless occurring. But in Australia we are going backwards under this government. We are going backwards, and our want of respect or even self-knowledge in this debate is something I find extraordinary. Self-determination is not a word that you throw around pejoratively. It is something we all value; it is not something to hold in contempt. The member for Ryan mentioned the their contribution of my friend and colleague Senator Evans, who made the point that during the Labor years we may have given too great an emphasis to self-determination at the expense of some of the practical measures that are necessary to rebuild the strength of Indigenous communities that we now wish to balance up. But that should not be at the expense of self-determination. When we seek to balance up something, it does not mean throwing away the part that was previously given the greatest emphasis. We need to establish a process that gives Indigenous people a place at the table in the public course of Australia. Fair enough: this government has thrown out ATSIC. It says it was a failure. But what representative body has it put in its place to enable Indigenous Australians to play an effective democratic role at the table of discourse of our democracy? None. It is fair enough to criticise the measures that the previous government put in place as being inadequate, but then this government comes along and takes an instance such as Mutitjulu and allows a storm of grossly misleading information to be portrayed as if it is the normative behaviour of Indigenous Australians. It puts forward this legislation as if there is a need to change the law because all Aboriginal people are somehow engaged in sexual, anal intercourse with 14-year-old girls. That is the implication that we are to hold out to the electorate of Ryan that is said to support this government. We are pandering to a misapprehension. We are pandering to this black mask phase of political misunderstanding of our own history rather than facing up to our genuine responsibilities to fellow citizens who come from a different background to us. Indigenous Papua New Guineans come from many different sets of understanding because there are many different cultures in Papua New Guinea, just as there are amongst Indigenous, Aboriginal communities. There is not a single Indigenous culture. This law is not being brought forward because the government can point to any instance where it is needed. It cannot point to one single instance where an injustice, ultimately, has been perpetrated. The Attorney General was challenged to do so. What was raised by the member for Ryan was a firstinstance judgement of a single judge in the Northern Territory. A decision was made and a prosecution appeal was lodged; the appeal dis- was upheld. The sentence was substantially increased. We did not need this legislation to have that effect. The Attorney was challenged by the question: what instance of error can you point to that this legislation is intended to redress? None was brought forward. When I say of the member for Ryan that the motive for this is far more heinous than simply grabbing a headline, I think that the motive for this is to, again, blame the black victims for the circumstances in which they find themselves, without any capacity for this parliament and the community to truly examine where our own responsibilities lie. We have a situation now, nearly 15 years after the black deaths in custody report, where the number of Indigenous people in prison is higher than it was at the time of that left royal commission. We have a situation where the life expectancy of Indigenous people in this country is less as a proportion of the life expectancy of non-Indigenous society than it was at the time of the royal commission into deaths in custody. We have a situation in this country where Australians have turned away from their responsibilities to address issues of rights, issues of self-determination and the hard questions that actually go to how we own and possess the land on which we stand, because this government says, ‘We will treat everybody alike,' forgetting that the starting point was our dispossession of a people that lived on this land for 40,000 years before we arrived. If we were in a situation such as that of Papua New Guinea and the Indigenous population-the Aboriginal people of this country-were still in a majority and had the vote, these kinds of debates would be simply unthinkable. The question would be ourthat is, the European minority's-cultural interests. How do we protect them adequately from the rights of a majority? We have been so successful in the invasion which our forbears implemented, and I am proud of those successes. I now stand in this parliament; but because we were so successful at marginalising and disempowering Aboriginal people, members can stand up here and speak the sort of nonsense that the member for Ryan spoke. I do not think there was any malice in the member for Ryan. I think he was genuine in imagining that I might say something favourable about this legislation because of my legal background. But our legal system should be fundamentally predicated on dealing with all persons accused of crime and found guilty of crime on individualised merit, on punishment according to their moral culpability, and with the hope of redemption through their reform. Redemption through reform is not always possible. We know that not everybody who commits crimes and is punished reforms. We try to make the punishment fit the crime, but the punishment has to fit the person who commits the crime. To do otherwise is a complete and utter abrogation of this parliament's responsibility. This legislation has been advanced because of a political storm, created in the dia, whipped up by this government and then brought forward through COAG and SCAG processes, which I hold in deep contempt. I say that for my fellow Labor attorneys and heads of government who participated in them. This basically racist approach is one which I will not allow myself to permit to pass in this parliament without the strongest possible objection. It is wrong, it is unprincipled and it remains unprincipled in whosever mouth it is spoken. It is against every recommendation of every law reform commission in this country. It goes against the Law Reform Commission reports established on Aboriginal customary law about 30 years ago in the previous Whitlam government. It goes against Law Reform Commission reports commissioned in the life of the current government. It goes against the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. It goes against the leading legal bodies of this country. I return briefly to what was said by the current President of the Law Council of Australia, Tim Bugg, who said, when calling on the government not to proceed with this bill: Courts must have access to all available sentencing and bail options, particularly when dealing with Indigenous offenders ... implementing the Bill in its present form would seriously undermine the ability of courts to exercise practical judicial alternatives. It is a matter of grave regret, in my hands, that I speak in the way that I do. But how is it that we in this parliament give any comfort to this kind of legislation? It will not matter a jot in most instances. It would be rare that these provisions were called upon, and certainly never in the kinds of extreme cases that are thrown up by the hypotheses of the government who throw up instances of abuses of women and children as though they are tolerated under Aboriginal cultural menorms. As someone who has worked in societies and places where there is an Indigenous minority operating under a largely Westminster legal system-as in Papua New Guinea-I have learnt to recognise the way in which you can incorporate proper respect for Indigenous customary law and respect for a legal system, while making certain that victims are not placed in a situation where they are left without remedies or abused, at the same time recognising cultural norms that apply in Indigenous society. As someone who worked for the Aboriginal Legal Service, I am well aware that we have gone backwards in all our discussions in relation to Indigenous rights. We have gone backwards in black deaths in custody, we have gone backwards in setting up representative organisations for Indigenous peoples, we have destroyed elective bodies that represented Aboriginal people and we have cut across the opportunities for Indigenous people to exercise economic self determination. Now we find that even champions the government has used to hide behind-such  that this government truly had no interest. If  about the way in which this government has misused his heartfelt sense that Aboriginal people need to take greater personal responsibility-of course a view we would agree with-we see that it is now being used so that we surrender our responsibility. A view from an Aboriginal elder who says, ‘We as a community must exercise greater selfresponsibility,' is being used by the government wrongly, cheaply and in a racist way to say that we have no responsibility, and that utterly condemn.",90
151,Mr GARRETT,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"I want to very strongly endorse the comments made by the member for Denison, who preceded me in this debate. There is absolutely no question that the situation which Aboriginal people face in this country-and the way in which the federal government has chosen to develop and deliver policy-has seen not only their rights but also their interests and their prospects in many instances substantially diminished, not the least of which is the mischief and the narrowing of debate that is clearly evident in this Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006. Late last year, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, announced the winners of the Australian Crime and Violence Prevention Awards, which recognise ‘the most outstanding projects that prevent or reduce crime and violence in Australia'. Two of the recipients of this award were Circle Sentencing Nowra and the Shepparton Koori Court. It goes without saying that both of these courts and both of these processes (a) are successful, (b) have been recognised as outstanding examples of improving community safety and (c) clearly were not in the minds of the drafters of this odious legislation. A Four Corners investigation into circle sentencing, which included examining Circle Sentencing Nowra, highlighted the cause of much Indigenous violence as a result of systemic issues surrounding overcrowding, substance abuse and chronic unemployment, all of which led to low self-esteem and the triggering of antisocial behaviour. The recognition by the Minister for Justice and Customs of the success of those initiatives begs the question: if the government is handing out awards to programs which embrace the conI cept of circle sentencing, why then would it introduce a bill which effectively diminishes their capacity to offer new ways of reducing recidivism among Indigenous people? The Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill seeks to amend the bail and sentencing provisions within the Crimes Act by placing a requirement on the court to consider the potential impact on victims when assessing bail conditions, by deleting the reference to cultural background and by specifying that customary law or cultural practice not be taken into account for Commonwealth offences. It is a deplorable piece of legislation. It must be noted at the outset that there is no capacity under the Crimes Act to deal with violent crimes, including murder, assault and rape. So there is a nonsense at play here-a nonsense under which lies a much more odious intention. These sorts of crimes quite clearly fall der the jurisdiction of state and territory laws. Additionally, under the current arrangements, customary law or cultural practice is not deemed a valid defence in determining guilt or innocence. To suggest otherwise is a nonsense, but it is also spurious and inflammatory. The inserted section 15AB lists the impact on victims or witnesses in granting bail as a necessary requirement in deliberations. There would appear to be some merit in this measure, and I note a number of the submissions to the Senate inquiry supported this move. Following the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 14 July this year, it was agreed that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General report to the next COAG meeting on the extent to which bail provisions and enforcement take particular account of potential impacts on victims and witnesses in remote communities and to recommend any changes required, and that seemed to be a fairly sensible way of proceeding. But now the government is introducing a bill of this sort before members of the Standing Committee of Attorneys General can report on the matter. What possible reason is there for the government to do this? Clearly, the government is not interested in developing purposeful policy; it is simply playing politics with Indigenous people. The second amendment the government is introducing is the removal of cultural background, which appears in section 16A(2) and currently can be taken into consideration as ‘relevance' allows-the important term here is ‘relevance'-but it would appear that the government has conveniently neglected to note this. During the second reading debate the government blasted the idea that the offender's cultural background should automatically be considered when a court is senuntencing that offender so as to mitigate the sentence imposed. It is here that the government is attacking the player and not the ball, because it knows full well that cultural background is only taken into consideration when relevant and known to the court. It is not a blanket consideration. To suggest otherwise is completely wrong. The issue of customary law and its rightful place in the criminal justice system has been raised previously in this House and the government has been flying a kite on this issue. The member for Stirling introduced a private member's bill reaffirming that cultural practices in any community do not lessen the full protection of Australian law. The member's reaffirmation of the blindingly obvious came as a result of deeply worrying stories of abuse and assault in some Indigenous communities-stories that concern all Australians. That he was prepared to suggest cultural practices or customary law lessened the protection of members of these communities amounted to a complete misrepresentation both of customary law and of the judicial process. I spoke in that debate, and I referred the member to a case in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory-the Queen v James Goutjawuy Gondarra-where the accused was additionally held accountable for his actions by the cultural law processes of his elders. Consequently he showed real signs of remorse and, as a consequence of that, the first steps towards positive rehabilitation took place. As is always the case in issues of sentencing before a court, and in the circumstances in which an offender is charged and brought before the court, there are a range of different and differing circumstances that attach. The most important matter that must be dealt with is for justice not only to be done but to be seen to be done and for the offender, if found guilty, to be made aware of the significance of the offence, to show remorse and contrition and to be a positive prospect for rehabilitation. In this case, customary law-and the access to customary law-did not lessen the full protection of the law; in fact, it was beneficial. Customary law was a part of the treatment. The community which, hitherto, had borne some of the brunt of his actions was now in a position to ensure that his actions would not be repeated and that he was in a position to realise the seriousness of them. That surely is the purpose of an application of that kind in those circumstances. This leads us to considering the role of judicial discretion in sentencing. There will be some variety in the way in which judges, when sentencing, exercise their discretion. And, of course, there is always the prospect of appeal. A concern arising from the bill is that the preservation of judicial discretion could be undermined, and I think that is a legitimate concern. The Australian Law Reform Commission takes the following view: ... the consideration of traditional laws and customs to explain an offender's reasons or motives for committing the offence is merely one factor to be considered in the sentencing process. That is to say cultural background, where relevant, can be useful in determining a sentence. Further, the Law Reform Commission noted: The weight to be attached to the factor always should be a matter for the court's discretion, sistent with the application of Australia's obligatermining tions under international law and our own human rights instruments. It is clear that, by removing the term ‘cultural background' from the list of matters the court should take into consideration when sentencing, the government is attempting to reduce the judicial discretion that that, hitherto, would have obtained. When the Crimes Act 1914 was amended in 1994 to incorporate the term ‘cultural background' there was bipartisan support. The then Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams, noted: It is, however, a relevant consideration to be weighed by the court at the stage in which an accused has already been found guilty. So what has changed, we might well ask, since 1994? Indeed, the current member for Fisher, Mr Slipper, stated during the second reading debate of the Crimes and Other Legislation Bill 1994: … the oppositionthe Liberal-National coalitioncertainly is not opposed to the inclusion of cultural background as a relevant matter to be taken into account by the court when sentencing federal offenders. Does the member for Fisher still hold this view? And do other members, who presumably nodded in assent at the time? The 1994 amendment included inserting a reference to cultural background when determining a sentence in section 16A as well as with the discharge of offenders without proceeding to conviction in section 19B. The explanatory memorandum to that amendment stated: As with section 16A, the Australian Law Reform Commission report on multiculturalism and the law recommended that an offender's cultural background be included in the list of matters conwhich the court should take into account in dewhether to proceed to a conviction. This clause implements that recommendation. However, when the government first drafted this new bill the reference to cultural background was to be deleted only from section 16A, which relates to sentencing. The government has now at least recognised the inconsistency in its approach to section 19B. While the Crimes Amendment Bill amended the act by removing the term ‘cultural background in relation to sentencing', the government obviously saw no initial problems with its continued inclusion with regard to deciding whether to dismiss charges or discharge an offender before seeking a conviction. Such hypocrisy! It really does highlight the policy-on-the-run attitude of the government that we have seen in many other areas in relation to Indigenous affairs. I refer in passing to the prospects of the COAG trials at Wadeye which have been shown to produce more red tape and deliver very few additional government services despite the government's rhetoric to the contrary. It is for these reasons that I have outlined and more that Labor opposes the bill. Whilst the government argues that the intention of this legislation is to tackle the problem of violence, substance abuse and recidivism amongst members of Indigenous communities, there is nothing in the bill that substantially delivers anything like solutions to the many problems that Indigenous communities face. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma, has stated: Despite the recent media frenzy about the problem of violence in indigenous communities, so there's been no serious discussion about whether the Government's claim-that the Crimes Amendment Bill 2006 will help address this issue-stacks up. The bill is yet another attempt to paper over the very real and difficult issues that contribute to Indigenous disadvantage and Indigenous crime in this country. The problems faced by Indigenous communities are clear, and a quick review of these is instructive in the context of the legislation before us. The Social Justice Report 2005 provided a stark view of the conditions faced by this country's original inhabitants. The report quotes ‘slow and inconsistent' progress on Indigenous health issues described by the commissioner, as illustrated by the gap of approximately 17 years between Indigenous and non-Indigenous life expectancy. Age specific death rates for Indigenous people are about double those for non-Indigenous people-a terrible statistic. Indigenous babies are twice as likely to be of low birthweight as non-Indigenous babies, infant mortality rates are three times higher amongst Indigenous infants and rates of many communicable diseases are up to 93 times higher than in non-Indigenous populations. Two recent reports from the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research found that since 1991 the rate of Indigenous imprisonment has surged by almost 55 per cent, with the past six years experiencing a rise of 23 per cent. It cannot merely be a function of the criminal justice system and our approach to Indigenous disadvantage that we simply sit by and witness ever-increasing numbers of young Aboriginal males being incarcerated. There were many submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that were critical of the far government's approach. In the government's haste to rush the bill through parliament, a number of submissions made the point that there was little or no consultation with relevant stakeholders. The North Australian Justice Agency pointed to ‘a lack of integrity in the government's timetable for consultation on the proposed amendments'. The Attorney General's Department even admitted that there was no direct consultation outside of the intergovernmental summit. It is policymaking on the run without consultation of the communities whom it affects. It is not acceptable. Other submissions to the Senate committee highlighted the lack of a coherent approach to the issue of violence in Indigenous communities. Many were concerned that the government appeared to be under the impression that the Crimes Act was a suitable legislative tool for tackling crimes currently dealt with by state and territory legislation. The Law Council of Australia made clear: The bill will have immediate impact only in relation to Commonwealth offences and not directly in relation to issues of particular concern identified in the explanatory memorandum-that is, high levels of violence and child abuse in indigenous communities.' As of September 2006, of those people incarcerated as federal prisoners, around three-quarters were convictions concerning drug importation. Of the 74 prisoners convicted under the Crimes Act, over half were in relation to social security fraud. Catholic Social Services Australia argued: It is incumbent on the Commonwealth government to ensure that any legislative action it ops in response to the July 2006 COAG communiqué is measured, is just and is not liable to have unintended consequences which might further disadvantage some of the most vulnerable people in the Australian community.' On the face of it, and when we look at the detail, this bill does not conform to any of those criteria. The government's ambivalence regarding the link between customary law and guilt or innocence was also noted. Professor Weisbrot from the Australian Law Reform Commission stated that customary law as a defence ‘never works'; however, it can be useful in determining an ‘appropriate sentence'. But it is clear that the bill does not introduce a single concrete measure to tackle the source of much of the violence in Indigenous communities, and the Social Justice Commissioner eloquently made that point. He said: If we are putting all of our hope on this amendment to address and change family violence, I think this is misconceived. It will do nothing to address any of those issues.' Nor does the bill reflect the findings of a number of inquiries into customary law and the Australian legal system. In fact, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission argues that it is in conflict with all major inquiries into the issue, including five Australian Law Reform Commission reports. The bill is also in conflict with the bipartisan support shown in 1994 when a requirement was inserted into the Crimes Act that the courts take into consideration cultural background when determining sentence. Under the weight of all those opinions, why does the government persist with this bill? It is also at odds with the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which were quite specific in saying that we need to reduce the Aboriginal prison population and that Aboriginal cultural pracdeveltice should be taken into account when determining sentences, as a part of that. Critically, the introduction of circle sentencing or Koori courts-where customary law and customary practice, it has to be said, are taken into account-has benefited many communities, including Dubbo, Nowra and Shepparton. Based in part on a model initiated in Canada, circle sentencing allows local community members, in conjunction with a magistrate, to discuss and determine the appropriate sentence for an offender. Circle sentencing has been a constructive development in the towns in which it operates. A concern raised during the committee process is that this bill has the capacity to undermine much of the good work that has been done. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner pointed out that the bill undermines important initiatives such as circle sentencing and Koori courts, which have been sought in order to engage with aspects of Indigenous culture, customary law and practice in a positive way. These initiatives have been reported as having a positive effect on repeat offending, and they should be supported not undermined. But the fact is that, with this flawed legislation, if the passed it will have real and negative consequences for initiatives like circle sentencing, which have had such a positive effect on many Indigenous communities. It will do nothing to tackle the very serious issues it purports to remedy. This bill will not halt the violence experienced by Indigenous people living in remote communities. Importantly, there is no scope within the bill, or from what the government has shown in other policy areas, to address the root causes of this abuse. The bill does not deserve the support of the House. There is nothing in this bill to address Indigenous poverty, substance abuse, low levels of education or the appalling health conditions faced by many Indigenous people. It is contrary to all the recommendations of those eminent and legal experts who have addressed and considered this issue in the past, including in a bipartisan way members of this parliament in the past as well. It is time for the Howard government to make a solid commitment to eradicate Indigenous disadvantage and not bring forward legislation as odious as this, which we oppose. (Time expired)",94
152,Mr RUDDOCK,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"in reply-Firstly, I thank the members who contributed to this debate on the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006. When I spoke earlier in the day, I tabled an explanatory memorandum. I am informed that I should in fact table a revised explanatory memorandum which has some additions relating to the Senate's consideration of this measure. This bill, and the additional amendments I have foreshadowed that I will move in the consideration in detail stage, is consistent with the intent of the Council of Australian Governments agreement following the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities. Criminal bill is behaviour cannot in any way be excused, justified or authorised, required or rendered less serious because of customary law or cultural practice-that is the question of principle-nor has it ever been intended that a customary law or cultural practice aggravate the seriousness of a criminal behaviour. This bill forms one element in our approach to addressing these difficult issues. I would not suggest, as did the member who just spoke, that the bill contains all of the answers. It was never intended that it would, but it is part of a total mosaic. At the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities we called upon all Australian jurisdictions to take action against the perpetrators of violence and abuse, and we will continue to work with the states to improve Australia's justice system and to encourage them to make similar changes to their sentencing and bail provisions. By amending the bail and sentencing provisions of the Crimes Act, the Commonwealth is demonstrating leadership in the area of law and order, and it will continue to improve the criminal justice system for all Australians, in this case especially for Indigenous Australians who are victims of violence or sexual abuse. This measure will not, and nobody has ever argued that it will, deal with the substantive issues that are crimes at a state or territory level. Those matters have to be dealt with in those jurisdictions at those levels. But I can imagine what would have been said if we had not moved to deal with these issues. We would have been accused of hypocrisy for leaving measures in Commonwealth legislation that we were asking the states and territories to remove. Even though I do not imagine that the Commonwealth offences in the Crimes Act would apply with any frequency to Indigenous people, you cannot have, in my view, model arrangements which you ask the states to implement being ignored by the Commonwealth. As I mentioned, this bill is about leadership. We are about encouraging the states and territories to follow suit and to fulfil their commitment arising from COAG. We are putting the issue of whether customary law and cultural background can be used as an excuse or justification for criminal behaviour beyond doubt. At the summit, the government committed to a range of practical measures intended to address the serious issues of violence and abuse in Indigenous communities. This bill complements those practical measures. I notice that the member for Denison, who has just joined us, seemed to be critical of the outcome of the summit.",99
153,Mr KERR,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,Very.,100
154,Mr RUDDOCK,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"That is very interesting because he is demonstrating a willingness to be critical of his state Labor Party colleagues on some issues. I just wish he would be as vocal on a number of other issues. I would hope he would be different from his leader, who seems to see a lot of the conduct at the state and territory level as mere peccadilloes. In my view they were substantial issues-in fact, in some cases requiring the resignation of ministers and, in my view, requiring the resignation of other ministers. It has been argued that this bill is premature because it is still under consideration by SCAG and COAG. Let me put beyond doubt that COAG did decide to improve the effectiveness of the bail provisions. It asked the standing committee to provide a report. We are taking action to implement the COAG decision through the proposed legislative amendments, and we will be reporting on these actions back to COAG through the SCAG process. The government is also undertaking bilateral negotiations with state and territory governments in relation to the outcomes, and in these discussions the state and territory governments are being encouraged to follow our lead and to make similar amendments. We do not see any need to wait. We think these issues are particularly important. It has been suggested that this bill interferes with innovations in sentencing Indigenous offenders, including circle sentencing, and that it is discriminatory in that sense. This bill does not limit any sentencing options available to a court. The government supports alternative sentencing and restorative justice processes. However, it does not support offenders receiving a lesser penalty by reason of a belief in customary law or cultural practices. Accordingly, any sentencing processes must ensure that all Australians are treated equally. Circle sentencing is about the process of setting up an appropriate sentence; it is not about ensuring that cultural background can be used to reduce the seriousness of the criminal conduct. The advice that the government has on that matter in terms of the Racial Discrimination Act is that the bill is consistent with it. It has been suggested that this bill runs counter to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The recommendations of the royal commission were extensive. There were 339 in all and they covered a broad range of issues. The government is taking a balanced approach in relation to the needs of victims and communities. The royal commission recommendations most relevant to the bill include recommendations 89, 90, 91 and 242, which relate to bail. The proposed legislative amendments will not directly affect any of the actions taken to respond to recommendations 89, 90, 91 or 242. There was no suggestion in the royal commission report that Aboriginal offenders should receive more lenient sentences due to their cultural background. In fact, the government is delivering on a range of programs and services to Indigenous Australians to address Indigenous disadvantage. It has been suggested by Senator Ludwig that we have not moved in relation to his private member's bill on victim impact statements. Let me just say that victim impact statements will be considered in the context of our response to the Australian Law Reform Commission report on sentencing. We think this bill responds to a very real issue in relation to violence, particularly violence against women and children in Indigenous communities, where we need to put beyond doubt that there is any particular cultural practice either real or imagined that justifies conduct of that sort. I am surprised that so many people would be on the record as wanting to oppose measures to achieve this outcome. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",100
155,Mr RUDDOCK,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"by leave-I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum in relation to amendments (1) to (5) and I move: (1) Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 4), after item 5, insert: 5A Subparagraph 19B(1)(b)(i) Omit “cultural background,”. 5B After subsection 19B(1) Insert: (1A) However, the court must not take into account under subsection (1) any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for: (a) excusing, justifying, authorising, requiring or lessening the seriousness of the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates; or (b) aggravating the seriousness of the criminal behaviour to which the offence relates. (1B) In subsection (1A): criminal behaviour includes: (a) any conduct, omission to act, circumstance or result that is, or forms part of, a physical element of the offence in question; and (b) any fault element relating to such a physical element. (2) Schedule 1, page 5, after proposed item 5B, insert: 5C Paragraph 23WI(3)(c) Omit “age, physical and mental health, cultural background and (where appropriate) religious beliefs”, substitute “age, physical health and mental health”. 5D Paragraph 23WI(3)(d) Repeal the paragraph. 5E At the end of section 23WI Add: (4) Without limiting the matters that the constable may take into account in considering, for the purposes of paragraph (3)(e), the intrusiveness of the forensic procedure, the constable must (where appropriate) take into account the religious beliefs of the suspect. (3) Schedule 1, page 5, after proposed item 5E, insert: 5F Paragraph 23WO(3)(c) Omit “age, physical and mental health, cultural background and (where appropriate) religious beliefs”, substitute “age, physical health and mental health”. 5G Paragraph 23WO(3)(d) Repeal the paragraph. 5H At the end of section 23WO Add: (4) Without limiting the matters that the senior constable may take into account in considering, for the purposes of paragraph (3)(e), the intrusiveness of the forensic procedure, the senior constable must (where appropriate) take into account the religious beliefs of the suspect. (4) Schedule 1, page 5, after proposed item 5H, insert: 5J Paragraph 23WT(3)(c) Omit “age, physical and mental health, cultural background and (where appropriate) religious beliefs”, substitute “age, physical health and mental health”. 5K Paragraph 23WT(3)(d) Repeal the paragraph. 5L At the end of section 23WT Add: (4) Without limiting the matters that the magistrate may take into account in considering, for the purposes of paragraph (3)(f), the intrusiveness of rensic procedure, the magistrate must (where appropriate) take into account the religious beliefs of the suspect. (5) Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (line 9), omit “items 4 and 5”, substitute “items 4 to 5L”. In relation to these amendments, which I spoke to in the second reading debate, the question was raised during the debate on the bill in the Senate as to why section 16A and not 19B of the Crimes Act was being amended. Also, the sentencing part of the Crimes Act was not being amended. The government considered the position and agreed that it was not consistent to amend one and not the other. Both sections deal with sentencing of Commonwealth offenders. In our view, it is not appropriate in either case that there be a specific reference to cultural background, and the proposed amendments will make changes to section 19B to parallel those already made to 16A. In relation to the measures dealing with forensic procedure provisions, in our view the cultural background of a suspect should not be a factor used to determine whether or not they provide a forensic sample. It is not acceptable that there be a possibility, even a remote one, that a person from one ethnic group may avoid undergoing a procedure which provides evidence which may lead to their prosecution or conviction in circumstances where a person from another group would have no choice but to undergo testing. There are issues in relation to religious beliefs which we are leaving intact. There is a difference between a person's cultural background and their deeply held personal beliefs. It is clearly appropriate to take the latter into account in deciding how that person should be dealt with under law enforcement processes. That might apply to Indigenous people in the same way as it would to others. It needs to be borne in mind that there will be a range of options available for collecting the foDNA samples. If a person has a deeply held religious belief and that should be a factor in deciding which of those options were used, then the provisions will be amended to ensure that religious belief is only relevant to deciding what type of testing is to be carried out, not whether there should be testing in the first place. For instance, some people for religious reasons do not believe that a sample of blood should be taken. A DNA sample might be able to taken in a less intrusive way and still achieve the same outcome. We think that draws the appropriate balance between protecting deeply held beliefs while still enforcing the criminal law in a fair way. Why are we taking out Aboriginal customary beliefs? In our view, there is no need to keep the current references to Aboriginal customary beliefs in DNA testing. We have clear advice that the term ‘religious beliefs' is wide enough to encompass deeply held personal beliefs of a kind that should not be taken into account under the provisions. Whatever specific religion those are based on, the term is wide enough to pick up beliefs based on Aboriginal religion as well as any other religion. The change will make the point that all that is relevant under those visions is a deeply held personal belief, and that will avoid any argument as in the case of Aboriginal suspects that there are other matters that should be taken into account. Removing the reference to Aboriginal customary or cultural beliefs will avoid any potential ambiguity. In summary, the amendments will make certain that a court cannot take into account any form of customary law or cultural practice as a reason for lessening or aggravating the seriousness of the criminal behaviour that a court is considering and that customary law and cultural practice cannot be used as a basis for avoiding DNA testing. I commend the amendments to the House.",101
156,Ms ROXON,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"Gellibrand) (5.37 pm)Labor oppose these amendments, and I would like to record our opposition. We will be voting against the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006 in its entirety and we oppose the specific amendments. We understand why the government is moving the first amendment; it is doing this on the basis that it is better to have a bad, consistent law than a bad, inconsistent law. But, make no mistake about it, this amendment does not actually improve the law in any way. We are opposed to the removal of the reference to cultural background in bail and sentencing procedures, as I have already indicated, as has been indicated in the Senate and as has been indicated by many other speakers. Amendment (1) is an amendment to the procedure-in this case, when it is a discharge after conviction-and of course we also oppose this amendment. The reason that the question was raised at all in the Senate was simply to point out in the debate that the true motive for this bill was merely for it to be a diversion from the failures of the Minister for Families, Community Services and proIndigenous Affairs and the exposure of just how sloppy the government's work had been in preparing and drafting this legislation: one rule for one provision and one rule for another. If the government did actually believe that this bill was about improving the law, then it would have been thorough, much more professional and much more consistent in its drafting, and it would have supplied a written explanatory memorandum that meticulously laid the case for change. I am not sure that the newly tabled explanatory memorandum does that. The government is legislating on the run with these amendments. The Attorney General has the audacity to mention that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is currently reviewing these provisions, but still the Commonwealth wants to act first. The government tries to pretend that it is an act of leadership rather than idiocy to act before any proper consideration of whether or not this will deliver what the government pretends it will. The government even calls it ‘an act of leadership' because it would be unfair to ask the states to do this if the government were not doing it. It certainly would be unfair: it would be unfair when, despite the spin that the Attorney-General wants to put on the agreement from COAG, all the states have rejected this bill. All the states have indicated that they will not make changes that are consistent with this bill. So this leadership will actually leave the Commonwealth out there on its own, having legislated in a way that really will have very little impact on any Commonwealth criminal activity which is likely to be undertaken. Nevertheless, it wants to use this as an example when it will have no impact on the much more important issue of Indigenous violence and violence in Indigenous communities. Amendments (2), (3) and (4) all deal with forensic procedures and are completely unrelated to the rest of the bill. It seems to me that the government obviously was a little put out by the questions that were raisedperhaps those raised by my colleague Senator Ludwig in the other place-about not being consistent. The government seems to have done a Google search for every time customary law has appeared and has now said that it is going to remove any reference, even in procedures which have nothing to do with bail and sentencing and nothing to do with what the rest of the bill is dealing with, and without any consideration of whether or not it is appropriate to make this removal. It seems to me also quite extraordinary that we can be here at the last minute debating changes that deal with a different section of the act-entirely different procedures such as collecting DNA and other things-having gone through a Senate committee process that did not deal with these provisions at all because they were not even proposed at that time. They have not been talked about within the community and they certainly do not have the cover of any agreement with COAG or SCAG, no matter how far the Attorney wants to stretch it. It seems bizarre to me the government moves these amendments in such an ill-considered way. It is also quite extraordinary that a number of the speakers on the other side of the House were trying to make some point about the other provisions being introduced by the Keating government. However, they were supported by the previous Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, when he was in this place, and of course the current Minister for Justice and Customs, who has now had a change of heart on this issue. These provisions-the ones that are being amended by amendments (2) to (4)-were actually introduced by this government when it was amending the procedures in 1997. You have speakers on the other side of the House saying, ‘We have to amend these things because of these terrible things that people did under the Keating government,' and now we have to amend them because of the terrible things that have been done under your government. It is all a complete mess and completely inconsistent. I do not think that there is any argument that is very persuasive for the need to do this. (Extension of time granted) I think it is extraordinary that the previous Attorney-General was prepared to boast at the time of introducing these other provisions relating to forensics, and the model Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 2000 was widely circulated for comment to about 600 groups and individuals representing many interests. The long list of those consulted included defence lawyers, law societies, civil liberties groups and legal aid organisations. We can contrast that with the current bill: the Senate committee condemned the government for its failure to properly consult in relation to the changes being considered, and these changes we are dealing with now were not even a twinkle in anybody's eye at that time. What a stark exthat ample of how arrogant the government has become after its 10 years in power. The government has completely changed its tune when it comes to involving the wider community in the legislative process. The Prime Minister said he would not let control of the Senate go to his head, but it is quite it has gone to the head of many of his ministers. When the forensic procedures were originally introduced, Mr Williams spoke in this House of the many safeguards in the bills that would protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. There you have it: the first Attorney-General of the first Howard government promoting specific safeguards for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. Here, now, you have the Attorney-General of the last Howard government removing those same safeguards. How the standards seem to have declined since Attorney-General Williams left this place! It is contemptuous of good process, it is contemptuous of the stakeholders and it is contemptuous of what the Senate recommended. I have to say that I also think it is contemptuous of the general liberal beliefs that we now see so rarely in this place. It is certainly contemptuous of the Australian people. Surely there is a better way for us to make laws, and we should do this in a more considered manner. I am also interested in the brief that was provided to us about the latest amendments that the government has just introduced in this place-that is, the government is convinced that it is okay to remove a reference to customary beliefs because, and I am quoting from the government's brief to the government members committee that was provided to us, that ‘the term religious beliefs encompasses all deeply held personal beliefs'. I think that would be an extraordinary revelation to many of our religious leaders, to think that any strongly held personal view that someone has will be considered a religious view, and I think it is certainly an affront to many people who do not regard themselves as religious who have many clear that strongly held personal views. It is an extremely contentious thing to say that customary beliefs or any other beliefs that people might hold can be caught up in religious beliefs. Maybe there will be another time or place to have a theological debate about whether that is right, but to me it is clear evidence of quite bad law-making for an assertion such as that to be made, for changes to our Crimes Act to be made on the basis of such an assertion, and for customary beliefs-which may well have nothing to do with whether someone has a belief in whether there is a god of any type in another place and may not be able to be referred to in any way as religious beliefs-to be automatically channelled into that reference. I think it is quite extraordinary. But this is not the time or the place to be able to convince the government of that sort of argument. We strongly oppose this bill; we oppose the amendment. We do not think it makes the bill better, and in a number of instances we think it makes it significantly worse, particularly with the addition of changes to the forensic procedures part of the bill. This is an entirely separate part of the bill. It is completely separate to the bail and sentencing provisions, but obviously, if your staff or the department do a search, you are saying, ‘We want to be consistent, so we'll just consistently make fools of ourselves and take these provisions out of the act.' We cannot support it; we do not support it. We think the government has hit quite a low point in putting forward such a hastily drafted bill with such poor policy background for it. It will not help Indigenous members of the community; it will not help the broader community. It will just have to be fixed up when we win the next election.",103
157,Mr KERR,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"I wish to make a couple of remarks in relation to the amendments to the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006. First I want to respond to the comments of the Attorney. I have no shame whatsoever in sharing any blame that is due in relation to the proposals that are currently before the House. I oppose them regardless of whoever's mouth they have been expressed by. But I am given assurances by the honourable member for Gellibrand that, contrary to my understanding and what I read in the parliamentary brief, in fact the COAG process did not endorse these particular measures, nor are any state governments going to follow them. So to the extent that I have perhaps inadvertently placed blame on my state Labor colleagues, I withdraw it. I thank the Attorney for giving me the opportunity to reflect on that matter and the member for Gellibrand for drawing my attention to that particular matter. But my criticism that any person who proposes a racist piece of legislation of this nature deserves condemnation, be they on the Labor side or on the government side, still stands. Let me ask the Attorney to respond to these propositions and take the debate away from Australian Indigenous practices and cultural norms. An example I became very familiar with in Papua New Guineaconduct which is entirely unlawful and often results in death and murder-is where people believe in sorcery. Under the customary arrangements and beliefs that exist in those particular communities, people breached the criminal law of Papua New Guinea. It has always been the case that the state of mind of the person influenced by their customary understandings of their obligations is something that is taken into account in relation sentencing. It would be bizarre if it were not. You cannot sentence somebody who does not believe in sorcery on the same basis as somebody who does believe in sorcery. It is a conundrum beyond all understanding that this government can put forward such a proposition. Mr Ruddock interjecting",106
158,Mr KERR,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"Let us take the Attorney's example of female circumcision. Let us take that example and examine it. In Australia, we have a number of people who have come as refugees from the Horn of Africa. In the Horn of Africa it is a common cultural practice, as male circumcision is in Australiaabhorrent though it may be to most of us; as a child, I was a victim of the practice of male circumcision-to carry out female circumcision. It is repellent to the views that I hold, it is repellent to the House and we have passed laws which criminalise it. But is it possible to put this proposition in the mouth of the Attorney: that the conduct of a person who comes to Australia, newly familiar with the norms and expectations of this society, and who, in what they understand to be in the best interests of their child, carries out a procedure of that nature is to be treated precisely the same as a criminal who, in an act of wanton cruelty with no such cultural background, with no belief that they are doing it for the benefit of the girl, carries out that act. It is an absurd and nonsensical proposition. One is an act of wanton cruelty deserving of the utmost and most terrible condemnation by our society; the other demands a criminal response because we are seeking to change behaviour and because our criminal law demands that outcome. It cannot treat the two things alike, and yet this legislation does so. It pretends that the parents of that child and their sense of what they believe to be best for the welfare of that to particular individual are of no note in their moral responsibility. I do not accept that. I absolutely say that the criminal law should remain the same, as it is in Papua New Guinea with causing death, albeit for whatever reason. But surely there are differences in the propriate and apt sentence that go towards the nature of the moral responsibility of the perpetrator. To close your eyes to that is ply beyond my understanding, and I would like the Attorney to address those conundrums. Frankly, those are those sorts of conundrums which we hope will not arise in our criminal justice system, but, if they do, they require judges to apply their endeavours to find a just sentence. (Extension of time granted) It is not to condone female genital mutilation, which no member of this House doescertainly to my understanding no member of this House does-that I make the observation that there is a different degree of moral wrongdoing between parents recently arrived from the Horn of Africa who have that cultural underpinning and others who do not. Is it to be differentiated in terms of the impact between one arrival from the Horn of Africa who may say that they undertook that practice out of a religious understanding of their obligation and another who might, for example, be secular but nonetheless believe that it is in the interests of the child because of a cultural underpinning? Is it to be treated those circumstances cannot be taken into account? If we are simply changing the words-deleting ‘cultural underpinning' and inserting ‘religious understanding' so that the two are synonymous-we change nothing and this government is going through a charade, abusing the responsibilities in its hands to create a sense in the Australian community that it is achieving something of a substantive nature when all it is doing is shifting juggling the words. Finally, how would the Attorney deal with those cultural underpinnings which have traditionally been part of the European culture? We used to, until recently, for example, have a defence of provocation-I think some ap- states still do-which accepted as part of a reduction in sentence and the definition of murder the fact that someone was so oversim- whelmed with their passion when they found their partner, for example, having an affair with a person that it reduced their moral culpability. It was built into the offence provisions. We actually have a number of offence provisions in our own law which bear through the way in which we have imposed and embedded our cultural understandings of responsibility and blame in the substantive law. Does the Attorney propose overturning all those provisions? Of course not, because they are our cultural understandings embedded in the law. He merely wishes to overturn those of others. I believe that this law is misplaced and unnecessary. It embarrasses me to stand here in this House and to find the time of this House being taken up in this way for what is essentially a continuation of the abuse of Indigenous Australians, which has been perpetrated for this last decade by a government that is increasingly abnegating its responsibilities and shifting the debate in relation to Aboriginal affairs towards blacks as perpeas if trators, blacks as offenders and blacks as marginal-not people that have to be incorporated into a larger society through a recognition that they have been dispossessed through the Australian settlement and that we do need to build in structures to build upon, to recognise and to respect Indigenous culture.",106
159,Ms ROXON,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"I have one more question. It might be more and convenient for the Attorney to deal with all of the issues at once. I should have said in our objection to the forensic procedures amendments that are being moved that I would ask in the response whether the Attorney would consider sending those provisions back to the Senate committee. He has, after all, said at other times that the work of the Senate committee has been helpful in being able to advise and improve the laws. We have not had the benefit of their wisdom on these provisions, although we have taken up their time in the others and the government has largely in this case ignored their recommendations. However, it does seem that, if we were going to take the opportunity to make these laws as good as we could, the Attorney might consider referring those provisions to the Senate committee. I do not believe that there is any desperate urgency in this bill being passed today, and I would ask in his response that he consider whether he would agree to that reference.",107
160,Mr RUDDOCK,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"I had a very interesting discussion some years ago with a South Australian Labor member of parliament-her name was Anne Levy; she is probably known to members opposite-about the issue of cultural practices and particularly women's issues and where the situation ought to lie when they are in conflict. The view was put very strongly to me that there are certain values in the society in regard to which, when cultural practices impact significantly, as they often do on women and children, women and children ought to be given some primacy. I am surprised, particularly in tion to the issue of female genital mutilation, which has far more horrific consequences than the comparable circumcision for males, that it would be seen as something that by reference to cultural practices ought to be treated in a different light however it occurred. I have great difficulty with that. One of the reasons that we want to press these issues is because we believe that, often in a culture that has been largely focused on what I might regard as patrilineal rights and tlements, it has often meant that the issues that go to the safety of women and children have been neglected. That is one of the reasons we have wanted to provide some leadership in the way in which these issues are being dealt with. I do not believe the issue in relation to DNA testing requires any further review. I have made a decision in relation to the way in which it should operate which merely differentiates the procedures that you might use to take into account religious beliefs. I simply say, as I did in my earlier comments in moving the amendments, that the legal advice I have is that strongly held beliefs of Indigenous people about the way in which they see themselves would be seen as religious beliefs, notwithstanding the fact that there is no reference to a god as we understand it. If you look at the characteristic of religion, some have multiple gods and some a unitary system. Buddha does not even claim to be a god, but Buddhism is nevertheless regarded as a religion. The advice to me is quite clear: Indigenous beliefs would be seen as religious beliefs for interpreting the measure, if this were claimed, in relation to DNA.",108
161,Mr KERR,ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT,"I thank the Attorney for his response. I wish to exercise an abundance of caution and ensure that there be no misunderstanding about the position that I have expressed in relation to ferela- male genital mutilation. No-one in this House condones it; nobody regards its carrying out on a woman or a child to be acceptable; and everybody in this House has played their part in the passage of those laws. In fact, I recall speaking on that legislation when it was passed. This House has taken a number of stands where it has deliberately intruded into areas where we have complex and overlapping practices of traditional culture and we have said that some are no enti- longer permissible under our law. But the Attorney appears to miss the fundamental thrust of the point I raise, because I have asked for him to consider and respond to this proposition: is there a difference in his Jull, D.F. mind between a mother, coming recently to Australia from the Horn of Africa, perhaps as a displaced person or refugee, who, believing that it is in the interests of her child, carries Lloyd, J.E. out such a procedure-and remember most people who carry out these procedures are women-and a person who, without any such cultural understanding, as an act of cruelty seizes a child and inflicts such a horrible and mutilating wound upon them? I cannot believe that the Attorney says that each must be punished alike. If the Attorney holds such a view, I regard him as not having a moral base. Question agreed to.",108

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING BILL 2006 Cognate bill: ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 November, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time.",110
164,Mr BEVIS,NOES,"I rise to speak on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. The objective of these bills is outlined in clause 3 of the legislation. Basically they aim to bring Australia into international compliance in measures to combat money laundering by criminals and the financing of terrorism. This spectrum of regulatory action is known as anti money-laundering counterterrorism financing, commonly known as the AMLCTF regime. The bills derive their impetus from the OECD's financial action task force recommendations. Those task force recommendations consisted of 40 recommendations on anti-money-laundering matters and nine special recommendations dealing specifically with counter-terrorism financing. Clause 3 also lists a number of other international obligations and resolutions. After much delay, the government is now legislating to bring Australia into compliance with those FATF regimes-that is, the financial action task force regimes-but doing so in two tranches of legislation. The first tranche is these bills currently before the parliament. They cover financial, gambling and bullion-dealing industries in addition to lawyers and accountants, but only to the extent that they are in competition with the financial industry. The second tranche, which covers other activities of lawyers and accountants as well as the jewellery and real estate industries, is yet to be released. The government has not even announced a target date for the completion of that. Rather than incorporate and amend the existing financial transactions reporting regimes under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988, the government has adopted the unwieldy approach of formulating a separate legislative scheme, which the AMLCTF Bill creates. This bill is very timely indeed because, as the name suggests, the bill deals with money laundering and the operation of terrorists and their need for financing. Only yesterday, the Cole commission handed down its report-Report of the inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN oil for food program-on the AWB. The presentation of this bill today has given me an opportunity to make some comments about the connection between those two. Make no mistake: if the Howard government's record on money laundering and financing of terrorism was not so soft or weak, Commissioner Cole would have had the option of recommending similar charges against the alleged perpetrators of misconduct to the ones we are now intending to enact in this very bill. Of course, the greatest shame is that the inquiry's terms of reference were limited only to certain companies in relation to the UN oil for food program. As Commissioner Cole himself noted, in volume 4 at page 21: The Inquiry's terms of reference do not extend to investigating and reporting on whether the actions or conduct of the Commonwealth, or any of its officers, might have constituted a breach of of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory. It has been well canvassed today in question time and by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith in the censure motion that the government did its best from the outset to restrict the Cole commission's inquiry to ensure that it could not inquire into those matters. Cole went on to say that, had he become aware of offences by Commonwealth officers detected under his limited terms of reference, he would have investigated. Given those terms of reference, it is no surprise that he found none; they put blinkers on the inquiry and tied both arms behind his back. It is a great failing of this government that, when charged with enforcing sanctions against one of the most evil men of the last generation, the Howard government wilfully-and I believe corruptly or negligently-facilitated or turned a blind eye to some $300 million in payments to the ‘Butcher of Baghdad'. The Howard government would have to be the most morally bankrupt government to hold office in this land. They have been so arrogant that they cannot even smell the stench of corruption that reeks all around them. Indeed, they had the hubris to conduct celebratory drinks yesterday evening to enjoy their moment. Mr Richardson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was wondering whether we could get the member for Brisbane to make his comments relevant to the bill.",110
165,Mr BEVIS,NOES,It's about counter-terrorism; you should have a look at it.,111
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,The member for Brisbane is within the parameters of the bill.,111
167,Mr BEVIS,NOES,"The bill, of course, deals with the financing of terrorist activities. The AWB's $300 million kickback to Saddam a law Hussein under the watch of this government and the opportunity that presented for terrorist organisations to get their hands on a tidy sum of money is very much about the financing of terrorism. It is an indication of this government's disjointed approach to this matter that they can sit there and think that there is no connection between their mismanagement of the AWB scandal and the fact that we are now debating a bill that deals with money laundering and financing of terrorists. Of course there is a connection. That is what the whole Cole inquiry was about. That is why the United Nations sanctions were put in place: to stop money from being provided to those people who perpetrate acts of terror. This bill, had it been in place some time ago, might have afforded the Cole commission the opportunity to recommend charges that are provided for in this bill. I certainly am keen to contain my remarks to the bill, and that is exactly what I have been doing. The story of the bill-which, I have to say, Labor supports-is yet another case of a minister who has been asleep at the wheel. This legislation should have been in place years ago and its provisions should have caught the culprits responsible for the Australian Wheat Board scandal. This bill will hopefully take Australia some of the way towards final compliance with our international obligations. Unfortunately, I have to say ‘some of the way' and not ‘all of the way', because even at this late stage it sents only the first of two tranches to reform our woefully outdated laws. We are still waiting on the government to announce even a timetable to bring forward the rest of the reforms. Labor supports the bill but will be moving amendments in the Senate on at least two issues, which I will deal with later, and, I suspect, a range of other issues that might arise as a result of the Senate committee's investigation and report into this bill. As I am sure the Senate and the House of Representatives are aware, the amendments being introduced to the act by this bill are designed to bring Australia into compliance with important international obligations dealing with the threat of terrorist financing and, more broadly, money laundering activities. Specifically, they will bring us into line with two sets of recommendations released by the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, which is an important international intergovernmental group that has been tasked with the development of standards to combat money laundering for illegal activities, including terrorism. This is a welcome development and one supported by the Labor Party although, as I said, we will be moving amendments to improve aspects of the legislation that we think are deficient. However, it is a development that has been far too long in the making. The history of this bill is one of delays, failed consultations and international embarrassment. It is more than five years after the September 11 attacks. Finally, this sluggish government has now brought a bill before the parliament dealing with these important matters. The Howard government is negligent in leaving Australia inadequately protected from criminals and terrorists who use our financial system to launder money. Only now-five years after 9-11-do we see an implementation of the special recommendations, of which eight of the nine were released in the aftermath of those horrendous repre- attacks in 2001. Furthermore, we should make no bones about the importance of this legislation in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. In 2002, Senator Ellison, in a press release, made pointed reference to that fact when he said that criminals and terrorists: ... will continue to take advantage of jurisdictions where the law enforcement and regulatory powers are the weakest. Of course, he was right. That is exactly what terrorists and criminals will seek to do. That statement was made in 2002. Recommendations were released in 2003. But it is now five years since the September 11 attacks, five years since the recommendations were first released, three years since the revised recommendations were released and three years since the new laws were promised, and only now are we seeing the bill for the first time here in the parliament. That is not the performance of a government in command of the tasks of dealing with money-laundering problems and anti-terrorism financing. Just like Senator Ellison's handling of the Customs container management reengineering project, this has become a lesson in how not to implement complex new laws. The first serious problem was the botched consultation process undertaken throughout 2004 and 2005. In fact, the term ‘consultation process' is too kind a term to use. Industry was not consulted. There was no proper consultation process about these proposed laws, and the government essentially attempted to jam everything into a one-sizefits-all approach. The minister attempted to persevere with that approach and in the middle of 2005 faced the humiliating result of being rolled by cabinet after a concerted campaign by industry and then being told to go back to the drawing board and start again. In 2005 Australia faced the further international humiliation of two reports which slammed our responses to anti moneylaundering and counter-terrorism financing. Firstly you had the release in May of that year of a report by the United States State Department in which Australia had the dubious honour of being named alongside Haiti and the Dominican Republic as a ‘major money-laundering country' and a ‘country of primary concern', owing to the Howard government's weak legislative framework. We should contemplate that. The people of Australia would be appalled to know that the negligence of the Howard government resulted in our listing in a United States State Department document as being a major money-laundering country. Bear in mind that it was Senator Ellison who pointed out, quite correctly, that terrorists seeking finance and international criminals wishing to launder money will shift their operations to those jurisdictions with the weakest law. We happen to be in that category alongside the dubious company of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. That was the assessment of our closest ally, the United States. Australia's status as a soft touch on money laundering and terrorist financing was confirmed later that year following an investigation and the release of a country report by the FATF which found, incredibly, that Australia was fully compliant with only 12 of the 40 general recommendations. But, even more alarmingly, it found that Australia was not compliant with a single solitary one of the nine special recommendations relating to terrorist financing. Our record on the internabusinesses tional stage has been an appalling embarrassment and an indictment of the mismanagement that the Howard government has brought to this important issue. Two years after Senator Ellison had promised the laws, the international community gave Australia a big fat zero out of 10. If there is an upside to the international humiliation, it is that it seems to have finally spurred the Howard government into some activity. In the meantime the government has been forced to rush through a number of bandaid solutions to keep up the appearance of compliance with the recommendations. The government's approach to this legislation has been more like watching a really bad movie that never seems to end rather than any proper process of legislative management and reform. It has been an excruciatingly painful process, when there has been no need for it. It has been compounded by the government's own errors. The first of these, contained in the AntiTerrorism Act (No.2) 2005, was passed last year in what can best be described as a slow panic in response to the FATF report. It implemented a number of the FATF recommendations, but before these had even commenced the government was forced to amend a number of these in a later act, the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Act 2006. It was forced to introduce these amendments because, to quote directly from the government's own explanatory memorandum: If the amendment to restrict the application of Division 3A of Part II of the FTR Act to ADIs is not made, then certain legitimate non-bank money remitters assert that they could be put out of business. Those are the government's own words. The government, in its own words, was saying that the legislation that it had presented and put through the parliament was so poorly drafted that it would have put legitimate out of business. That is no real surprise. The government, in answer to questions put on notice at the Senate committee inquiry into the anti-terrorism bill, admitted that it did not consult with industry on the final version of the bill, so it was forced to continue piling bandaid upon bandaid onto the legislation. More than half a decade after the September 11 attacks, the Howard government has decided that it is finally time to bring Australia into line with our international obligations and introduce legislation attack terrorist funding at its source. As I said before, with some provisos: this is only the first tranche-Labor will be supporting it. There are serious holes left in regime which we are told the government will fix in further legislation. Labor calls upon the government to release the time frame in which it expects to complete those further reforms. Its track record to date does not give either the Labor Party or affected industry in Australia any great confidence. Until those reforms are completed and Australia is compliant with all the recommendations in all the areas, you have what is essenare tially a Maginot line. It is a set of scary imposing defences that on the face of it seem impenetrable but that in actual fact are easily outflanked and circumvented. That is precisely what the government has created here. While these bills are a long overdue step in the right direction, it cannot be emphasised enough that they are only part of what is required. Until Australia completes the second tranche, we are going to be left with the Maginot line. I will now turn to the Senate committee, which I believe is due to table its report into the bill at some point today. I make these remarks without the benefit of having read the report. However, to get some understanding of the issues before the committee, we can turn to the evidence presented in submissions, transcripts and answers to questions. For consultation, we saw industry repeating concerns similar to those it had raised earlier-specifically, I am thinking of the AntiTerrorism Act. In that case, industry's concerns were later shown by the amendment of the Financial Transaction Reports Act to be quite valid, because they were not properly consulted on the final text on that occasion. In a similar vein, we saw lacklustre consultation during the early stages of the draft, which resulted in the unusual situation of a to minister being rolled in cabinet on his own bill and told to go back and start again. So the consultation process is not a new concern with this bill, and industry has every right to the be wary of the perceived lack of consultation so far. I hope that the minister, AUSTRAC and the department have taken some steps to allay the stakeholders' concerns. Equally, the implementation period of the legislation is of great concern. The bill places an onus on the private sector to monitor and report to AUSTRAC suspicious transactions or transactions over $10,000. So we need to make absolutely sure that the private sector able to come to grips with the obligations and imposed by this bill. The private sector have told the Senate committee, in submissions and hearings, that they need certainty so that they can start building systems and training staff before the legislation comes into effect. In response, the department has indicated that it will have the rules available by 31 March next year. The Labor Party will continue to push for this, particularly given the minister's track record of not giving industry sufficient time to implement the required changes. I foreshadow that my colleague Senator Ludwig will be moving a range of amendments in the Senate on Labor's behalf. In addition to such amendments as arise from the committee report, there are two matters I will flag here in the House today. Firstly, Labor will be moving to strike out section 6(7), which gives the power to regulations to effectively override and amend the act. This is what is commonly known as a Henry VIII clause, after the well-known king's penchant for legislation of that type. Simply stated, it provides the opportunity for legislation passed by the parliament to be changed by subordinate authority. This is not the normal practice of our parliament or, indeed, any parliament in the Westminster system. If legislation needs to be altered, that should be the job of the parliament, not regulations. So we will be moving to strike out that clause. From the point of view of good governance, Henry VIII clauses are always to be opposed unless there are very sound reasons to support their existence. They are of particular concern in this bill given the extensive exemptions and delegations it already contains. The government's argument for flexibility is, in Labor's view, not enough to authorise these unusual procedures. Secondly, Labor will be moving an amendment to bring forward the date of review. This is currently set at seven years, which, for a piece of legislation of this complexity, is simply too long. We will be moving amendments to shorten that review period. Let me state again that the Labor Party supports the bill. We will be moving amendments to improve it, but we fundamentally support it, as we have supported all reasonable legislation designed to protect Australians and fight terrorism and crime. Our concerns about this bill arise primarily from the fact that such an important piece of legislation has taken so long to reach the parliament. Our concerns are about a minister who refuses to consult and work with industry to achieve appropriate outcomes. Senator Ellison has been a repeat offender at botching consultation with industry, as his efforts to implement the new Customs cargo system showed us at about this time last year. This is important legislation and it is high time it was brought before the parliament. It is high time we improved our standing in the international community and removed ourselves from the list of easy touches on the international money-laundering market, alongside Haiti and similar countries. It is time we removed ourselves from a list we should never have been on. It is a black mark against the Howard government that it has taken so long to bring these measures forward. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) took swift action after September 11 2001, adding eight special recommendations on Counter-Terrorist Financing to the forty recommendations on Anti-Money Laundering by October 2001; (2) notes the Minister for Justice (Senator Ellison)'s statement of June 5 2002 that “criminals and terrorists will continue to take advantage of jurisdictions where the law enforcement and regulatory powers are the weakest”; (3) notes that the Government promised to meet FATF standards in 2003 and further notes the failure of the Minister for Justice to progress this legislation from that time until the present; (4) notes that, in the interval between indicating an intent to produce legislation and actually tabling it: (a) the Government, either through collaboration with AWB or the grossest incompetence, enabled AWB to fleece the UN of some $300 million in funds to channel them to the evil Iraqi Dictator, Saddam Hussein; (b) in March 2005, the US State Dept Report Released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs named Australia as a “major money laundering country”. (c) in April 2005, the Minister created a new anti-money laundering taskforce, but incredibly left off AUSTRAC, the nation's prime anti-money-laundering agency. (d) important anti-terrorism legislation was drafted incorrectly and the Parliament had to be recalled at great expense to fix sloppily-drafted anti-terror legislation changing one word; (e) further, provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 were also drafted incorrectly and had to be amended to avoid significant hardship to Australian business. (f) in October 2005, the FATF reported on Australia's compliance and found the Government had failed to meet the FATF standards, scoring just 12 out of 40 on anti money laundering, and 0 out of 9 on counter-terrorism financing. (5) condemns the Government for allowing criminals and terrorists to launder money for three full years while the Minister fumbled the drafting and consultation process; (6) condemns also the Government's collaboration with AWB or gross incompetence in allowing the channelling of funds to Saddam Hussein; (7) notes that the present legislation, while a substantial improvement on the past five years of soft and weak legislation on terrorist financing, still represents just the first tranche of the required reforms; (8) calls on the government to outline a timetable for passage of the second tranche, so Australia will no longer be a target for criminals and terrorists seeking to take advantage of the Government's soft and weak AML/CTF laws”. I note this matter will be carefully considered, clause by clause, in the Senate. My colleague Senator Ludwig, who has been intricately involved in the work of the committee and the Senate and is shadow minister with direct responsibility for these matters, will pursue detailed amendments-the two that I have mentioned and I suspect others that may come to light as a result of the consideration of the Senate committee. I would urge the government to look carefully at the recommendations that come from that Senate committee and at the amendments my colby league Senator Ludwig will move in the other place.",111
168,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I thank the member for Brisbane. Can I ask for clarification in respect of amendment (1), which has been circulated. I think the member changed a date from 2000 to 2001.",116
169,Mr BEVIS,NOES,"The printed document contained an error in listing 11 September 2000, when it clearly should have been 11 September 2001.",116
170,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ripoll-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,116
171,Mr RICHARDSON,NOES,"I rise today in support of the AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. Back in 2003 it was agreed that Australia would implement the financial action task force's 40 recommendations on money laundering and nine special recommendations on terrorism financing. This government has undertaken a lengthy and detailed consultation process, the purpose of which was to ensure that, while complying with our obligations in relation to money laundering and terrorism financing, we also ensured that legitimate businesses did not suffer adversely as a result of the implementation of the legislation to put the recommendations into effect. These new regulations will cover the financial sector, gambling sector and bullion dealers as well as lawyers and accountants who provide financial services in direct competition with the financial sector. From the outset, let me say that we cannot underestimate the importance of dealing with the methods used by terrorists and their organisations to obtain financial support for their cause. Without the ability to finance their attacks on our freedom and on our way of life-without the ability to finance their brutal and barbaric attacks-they have no means by which to invoke fear. Legislation like this is an important aspect of the government's war on terror and is an important weapon in our arsenal in our fight against terrorism. This bill imposes obligations on reporting entities when they provide designated services. Those services include things like opening an account, issuing a credit card or making a loan. The obligations include customer due diligence-that is, identification, verification and ongoing monitoring requirements. The obligations also extend to reporting requirements, including in relation to suspicious matters, threshold transactions, internal funds transaction instructions and compliance reports and record keeping. This bill implements a system whereby reporting entities will determine the way they meet their obligations based on their assessment of the risk of whether providing a designated service to a customer may facilitate money laundering or terrorism financing. The transitional bill makes a number of consequential amendments to various actsfor example, the Privacy Act, which will now be extended to all reporting entities with spect to their compliance with these new regulations. After consultation with industry it has been determined that this legislative package will be implemented over two years and that there will be an amnesty period of 12 months after each stage of the bill comes into effect. During amnesty periods AUSTRAC will concentrate its efforts on education. This bill puts into effect a number of measures which are, quite simply, common sense. If we as a nation failed to implement these measures we would leave the Australian financial market open to abuse by money launderers and those who finance terrorism. Furthermore, failure to meet the international standard would put our reputation at risk, along with the reputations of our financial markets, international business relationships and individual companies. This bill seeks to meet our international obligations. It makes common-sense amendments to our existing laws and, in the long run, protects Australians from the far-reaching impact of terrorism. For these reasons I commend this very important bill to the House.",116
172,Mr DANBY,NOES,"I rise to speak on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. Both these bills are designed to bring Australia into compliance with international standards to combat money laundering by both criminals and terrorist organisations. The bills thus have a criminal justice dimension and a national security dimension. The bills are needed so that Australia will be in compliance with the recommendation of the OECD's Financial Action Task Force, known as FATF. Initially developed in 1990, the FATF recommendare- tions were revised in 1996 to take into account changes in money-laundering trends and to anticipate potential future threats. In October 2001, a few weeks after the September 11 attacks, FATF held an emergency session in Washington in which it agreed that a whole new legislative regime was needed to combat terrorist-financing networks. More recently, in order to bring member states into compliance with these requirements as quickly as possible, FATF has completed a thorough review and update, known as the forty recommendationsperhaps to catch the 40 thieves of the Ali Baba story-which was published in 2003. All OECD member states are expected to legislate for compliance with these recommendations. Specifically, FATF called on OECD member states to take immediate actions to implement nine special recommendations, and I am going to read these out for a specific reason. Each country should: 1. Take immediate steps to ratify and implement fully the 1999 United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. 2. Criminalise the financing of terrorism, ist acts and terrorist organisations. 3. Implement measures to freeze without delay funds or other assets of terrorists, those who finance terrorism and terrorist organisations. 4. Require financial institutions and other nesses to report promptly their suspicions to the competent authorities if they suspect that funds are being used for terrorism, terrorist acts or by terrorist organisations. 5. Afford other countries the greatest possible measure of assistance in connection with proceedings relating to the financing of terrorism, terrorist acts and terrorist organisations. 6. Take measures to ensure that persons or legal entities that provide a service for the transmission of money or value, including transmission through an informal money or value transfer system or network, should be licensed or registered. 7. Take measures to require financial institutions, including money remitters, to include accurate and meaningful originator information on funds transfers and related messages. 8. Review the adequacy of laws and regulations that relate to entities that can be abused for the financing of terrorism, including nonprofit organisations. 9. Have measures in place to detect the physical cross-border transportation of currency and bearer negotiable instruments. I have taken the time to read these recommendations into the Hansard because they are a benchmark by which Australia's performance in this area should be judged. As the honourable member for Brisbane has noted-and I will come back to this shortly-we are a long way short of measuring up to these benchmarks. Labor generally supports these bills, which reflect international agreements on the best ways to combat money laundering by criminals and terrorists. However, we are opposed to several procedural aspects of this terrorbill, particularly the Henry VIII clause, which allows the minister to override provisions of this bill at his discretion. Senator Ludwig, the shadow minister for justice in the other place, will be moving amendments busi- to remove, among other things, this unacceptable overriding of the rights of parliament to decide what the law is. Despite our general support for the bills, however, we have to ask why it has taken three years for the government to respond to the FATF recommendations. We do not deny that there are a number of complex technical matters in these bills and that many interested parties needed to be consulted. Nevertheless, in a matter of such urgency it seems to us that it should not have taken three years since FATF published its recommendations and five years since the OECD's original call to action after September 11 to bring this bill before the House, particularly when we realise that these bills are only the first in a series of bills which will be needed to bring Australia into full compliance with the recommendations from FATF that I just read out. In 2002, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, told us: … criminals and terrorists … will continue to take advantage of jurisdictions where the law enforcement and regulatory powers are the weakest. Yes, Senator, that is quite true; so what has been happening for the last four years? Senator Ellison told us that this was an urgent matter for the government. I do not think that long delays in producing these bills meet any definition of ‘urgent'. The honourable member for Brisbane has outlined the reason these bills have taken three years to develop. Senator Ellison made a complete mess of the consultation process during 2004 and 2005, effectively wasting two years. The government failed to consult properly with those who would be most affected by the new laws and then tried to push through a one-size-fits-all approach. After intense lobbying by industry, Senator Ellison was rolled in cabinet in mid-2005 and told to go and start again. Industry had legitimate grounds for complaint. The provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2), passed in such haste in 2005, implemented a number of recommendations, but the bill was so badly drafted that the government was forced to amend many of its provisions in a later act, the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Act 2006. The act as first drafted would have put some legitimate non-bank money remitters out of business. I hope the government's incompetence in this area will not prevent the charging and trial of individuals recently identified by AUSTRAC's Mr John Visser and the Australian Federal Police who allegedly have been, during a recent period, transferring thousands of dollars to Hezbollah, an organisation identified by this parliament I also hope that legislation that is now being passed can still be used to effect against ple who have been involved in such activity if it is proved to be so. Another year was wasted while a new bill was drafted and another round of consultations was held. This is how the Howard government deals with ‘urgent' matters such as bills that have not only huge financial implications for Australian industry but also important national security dimensions. We can be sure that terrorists and organised crime bosses have not spent the last three years waiting for the government's legislation. They have been developing increasingly sophisticated ways of making money, moving money around and concealing their actions from governments. It is now more than three years since I spoke in the House about the need for tighter scrutiny of bogus charities, such as some of those based in Saudi Arabia which serve as fronts for terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, raising funds from the zakat, the voluntary tax for charity which the Muslim faithful pay, and diverting it to terrorism. I referred then to testimony before the US Congress about ‘the Golden Chain', the Saudi Arabian based funding system for al-Qaeda which is based on bogus Islamic charities that launder zakat funds and pass them on to al-Qaeda. I also referred to Omar al-Faruq, who, after his arrest in Indonesia in 2002, told his interrogators that al-Qaeda's operation in South-East Asia was funded through a Saudi charity known as the al-Haramain Foundation. According to al-Faruq, this money was laundered through the al-Haramain Foundation by donors in the Middle East who were close to Osama bin Laden. It is very good to see that the Indonesian authorities have made some moves against al-Haramain over the as terrorist. last few years as well. In the US at any rate, these bogus charities peo- are now under much tighter supervision. The unofficial financial transfer system known as hawala, widely used in the Islamic world, is also being brought under closer scrutiny, since it is well known that this system has been exploited by al-Qaeda as a fundraising mechanism. The ‘Golden Chain' is apparently still operating in Indonesia and Malaysia, however, providing the infrastructure for terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiah. Although I know that progress is being made by Asian countries such as Indonesia in cutting off funding to these terrorist networks, this work is far from complete, and it makes it all the more urgent that we prevent Australia being used as a base both for fundraising and for money laundering. One of the most alarming trends in recent years has been the closer cooperation that exists between organised crime and terrorism. Since it is becoming more difficult for terrorists to raise funds from fake charities, they have moved into money laundering. Terrorists are now working with drug traffickers and other criminals to launder the proceeds of crimes such as drug dealing, prostitution, intellectual property theft and smuggling. They use these activities to fund their operations, using legitimate businesses such as hotels and taxi operators as fronts to launder money. They are now also moving money through the new online payment systems as well as international ATM transfers. These transfers are very good because citizens travelling all round the world can make use of any ATM, but they are obviously of great benefit to people with nefarious purpose who can also use ATMs all round the world to transfer money. In the face of these trends, governments cannot afford to be complacent. Unfortunately, complacency is what we see all too often when we consider this government's record on matters related to counter-terrorism. The government is happy to exploit fears of terrorism for political gain but is slow when it comes to actually doing what needs to be done to protect Australia against terrorism and to prevent Australia being used as a base for terrorist fundraising, recruiting and money laundering. We saw this most conspicuously with the recent spate of maritime and aviation security bills-far too little, too late and inadequate legislation in any case, because this government always puts the interests of its various lobby groups ahead of the national interest. These bills cover the financial, gambling and bullion-dealing industries, as well as lawyers and accountants. They expand the provisions of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. The provisions of the bills will apply to a wider range of businesses than the 1988 act and will impose a wider range of obligations on them. We will apparently have to wait even longer for the second stage of the government's compliance legislation, which will cover other activities of lawyers and accountants as well as the real estate industry. We do not even have a date for that legislation. It is no wonder that the May 2005 report of the US State Department ranked Australia with Haiti and the Dominican Republic as a ‘major money-laundering country' and as a ‘country of primary concern'. It is disgraceful that Australia is ranked along with countries like Haiti and the Dominican Republic by our great American ally. The fact is that, in 2005, four years after September 11 and four years after the OECD's call for urgent action to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, a FATF report found that Australia was fully compliant with only 12 of the 40 recommendations that I identified earlier and that it was not fully compliant with a single one of the nine special recommendations, which I read out, relating to terrorist financing. This is a truly disgraceful state of affairs, and one that is being only partly rectified by these bills. We still have no idea when the government intends to make Australia fully compliant with the 40 FATF recommendations. Labor support this bill as far as it goes, we support all reasonable legislation which serves to protect Australia and to fight terrorism. But, as the honourable member for Brisbane has foreshadowed, we will be moving a range of amendments in the Senate. The deficiencies of this bill, as was the case with previous terrorism legislation, derive from the peculiar combination of delay and haste which so often marks this government. It does nothing for years, allows important matters to fester while it makes cheap political points and tries not to offend its own constituencies and then rushes in a bill so hastily and poorly drafted that it has to be amended even before it comes into effect. This seems to be the government's way of dealing with such vital matters of national security. It is not good enough.",117
173,Mr HARTSUYKER,NOES,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important piece of legislation. The AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 seeks to address one of the core threats to Australia's quality of life. It is now more than five years since the September 11 attacks but the threat of terrorism is still front-of-mind, and the need to take measures which will protect our citizens remains a priority of the coalition government. Tens of thousands of words have been written about the horror of September 11, but there remains a need for nations such as Australia to continue to assess what measures can be taken to ensure our people can live in a safe and secure environment. The vision of the twin towers crumbling in New York has left an indelible scar on our memories. Today's war on terror is like no other war. We are not fighting any one country; rather, we are at war with a loose network of cells and organisations that seek to undermine the values of Western civilisation. Across the world, governments have taken action which aims to prevent or reduce the as level of terrorist activity. And while their vigilance has been successful in nullifying many potential threats, the bombings in places such as London and Bali serve to remind us of the reality. Recently, I was reading a column in the Australian newspaper by its editor-at-large, Paul Kelly, in which he made a number of points that I believe summarise the impact of 9/11 and the subsequent actions on the war on terror. He wrote: That assault from the sky did more than kill 3000 people. It violated the US, destroyed its immunity, provoked its religious, cultural and political passions and unleashed an American strategic response under the leadership of George W. Bush ... The civil war within Islam that inspired 9/11's aggressive martyrdom has escalated rapidly. It invades the globe like a noxious gas as fanatics and recruits to jihad launch murderous attacks on civilians from Bali to Madrid, Baghdad to London. The costs and consequences of the events on that day in New York and Washington are still with us. Not only are they shaping the way we live; they are still shaping the way we think. I am referring specifically to those organisations and individuals who are financing terrorist activities. Governments clearly have to take action not only against those individuals and groups who plan and carry out terrorist attacks but also against their sympathisers who finance these activities. We should also act against those who assist terrorists and who do so not out of sympathy with their aims and beliefs but out of a desire solely to make money. The Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Bill 2006 specifically targets those who financed these killers in New York, London, Bali and Madrid. These reforms will bring Australia into line with international standards set by the financial action task force, or FATF, with its 40 recommendations on money laundering and nine special recommendations on terrorism financing. The FATF recommendations provide an enhanced and comprehensive framework of measures for combating money laundering and terrorism financing. I would like to take a few moments to talk about the financial action task force, because its composition and actions bring credibility and discipline to this anti-terrorist legislamonitoring. tion. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is the development and promotion of policies at both national and international levels to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The task force is a policy-making body which works to generate the necessary political about national legislative and regulatory reforms in these areas. FATF monitors members' progress in implementing necessary measures, reviews money-laundering and terrorist-financing techniques and countermeasures, and promotes the adoption and implementation of appropriate measures globally. In performing these activities, FATF collaborates with other international bodies working in this area. Recognising the threat posed by these financial activities to the banking system and financial institutions, FATF was established by the G7 in 1989 from G7 member states, the European Commission and eight other countries, including Australia. The FATF was tasked with examining money-laundering techniques and trends, reviewing the actions taken at a national or international level and setting out the measures required. In April 1990, FATF issued a report containing a set of 40 recommendations which provided a comprehensive plan of action needed to combat money laundering. Since then, FATF has expanded its membership, has completed additional rounds of mutual evaluations of member countries and has continued to examine and report on the methods used to launder money. The bill imposes obligations on reporting entities when they provide designated services-that is, opening an account, making a loan or issuing a credit card. These obligations include customer due diligence such as identification, verification and ongoing There is also provision for reporting suspicious matters, threshold transactions, international funds transaction instructions and compliance reports. The banking sector will be obliged to conduct due diligence of its correspondent banking relationships and ensure that appropriate identifying information is included in international elecwill to bring tronic funds transfers. The bill implements a risk based approach to regulation. This means that reporting entities will determine the way in which they meet their obligations based on their assessment of the risk of whether providing a designated service to a customer might facilitate money laundering or terrorism financing. The approach has been endorsed by the banking industry. It recognises that reporting entities have the experience and knowledge needed to assess and mitigate risk and that the legislation will impose costs on industry. Importantly, it is worth noting that similar approaches have been taken in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Reporting entities will manage operational risks through anti money-laundering and counter-terrorism programs developed in accordance with the rules associated with anti money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, will monitor compliance with these programs and will assess the reasonableness of the entity's risk assessment. The Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 makes a number of consequential amendments to various acts. For example, obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 will be extended to all reporting entities with respect their compliance with the AMLCTF Bill. The transitional provisions bill will also amend the money-laundering offences in the Criminal Code 1995 to include proceeds of an offence against state and territory law. The legislative package will be supported by operational rules to be developed by AUSTRAC in consultation with industry. The use of the rules instead of subordinate legislation allows for flexibility in ensuring that the rules are appropriate to sectorspecific needs. It is important to note that the government has consulted widely on this bill. In 2003, federal cabinet agreed to Australia implementing the financial action task force's revised 40 recommendations on money laundering and nine special recommendations on terrorism financing. Importantly, the cabinet also agreed to consultation on the anti money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing reforms, including the release of an exposure draft of proposed legislation. Extensive consultation with industry took place between December 2003 and October 2005, during which agreement was reached on the broader need for AML-CTF reforms in the form of a risk based regulatory framework with head legislation supported by operational rules. In October 2005, cabinet agreed to progress the reforms in two tranches. The first part focused on covering the financial and gambling sectors and bullion dealers. Lawyers and accountants would also be covered to the extent that they provide services underpinning the financial sector. The second part covers real estate agents, jewellers, lawyers and accountants and will be progressed following implementation of the first tranche. Following the release of a draft in December last year, a consultation process of to four months ensued. The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and a report of their findings was published in April of this year. Feedback from the consultation through submissions and the report has prompted further changes. The revised drafts were then released for consultation in July this year. Over 70 submissions were received during the second consultation period. The lengthy consultation process has resulted in a legislative package that will ensure that Australia complies with its international obligations and maintains its status in the region with respect to prevention of money laundering and terror finance with minimal impact on legitimate business. I believe this legislation is an important further step in our nation's fight against terrorism. If we can prevent the perpetrators of terrorist activities from laundering money, then we are restricting their capacity to create fear and inflict terror on our society. This particular legislation has been carefully drafted to reflect international best practice and a comprehensive consultation process has been undertaken. As I said earlier in my contribution, this is not a traditional war, and a major part of winning this war is winning control of the finances of the terrorists. I commend the bills to the House.",121
174,Mr HAYES,NOES,"I rise with a sense of relief to contribute to this debate on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006, because I and many others in this place were wondering whether these bills would ever be presented to this parliament. In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General made efforts to categorise this bill as ‘the product of extensive consultation between government, business and the community'. If you examine the real situation more closely, you will find that the legislative package that we have before us today is more a product of actions stemming from considerable international embarrassment. I will address that matter a little later on. I would like to indicate at the outset that I am generally supportive of the provisions in these bills. I am certainly supportive of taking action to combat the threat of terrorism, and I agree that one of the most powerful actions that we have at our disposal is shutting down the means by which terrorist organisations finance their operations. Terrorist organisations-like any other business, quite frankly-rely on the smooth transfer of money to fund their operations. Shutting down that flow of funds severely curtails their ability to organise and get operations off the ground. Stopping the flow of funds therefore severely hinders the ability of terrorist or criminal organisations to take or disrupt the lives of ordinary citizens. I indicated that I was pleased to be able to contribute to this debate, as I did not think it was ever going to occur. I say that because in February 2004 the Attorney-General rose in this place and gave a ministerial statement extolling the virtues of the government's actions when it comes to tackling head-on the issue of terrorism. As part of the statement, he indicated: ... I have made it my business to ensure that the government is doing everything it possibly can to discharge its most important duty-that of protecting our country and our people-to ensure that our way of life, our values and our freedom to be safe in our own homes are protected and, in doing so, to defend the right of all peoples in peace. That is quite noble. From that statement, you would think that this government has been setting a cracking pace when it comes to putting in place all appropriate measures to deal with the threat of terrorist activity, whether it takes place in Australia or whether it is organised or funded by Australian based organisations. On genuine reflection upon what has occurred, I have to say that that is not the case at all. Despite the illusion that this government has tried to create of the pace of its response to terrorism, it would be described best as being disappointingly slow. It talks about action but certainly takes considerable time to deliver on its commitments. I raise this in the context of this bill because, given the importance of addressing terrorist financing, I feel it has taken far too long for this bill to come before the parliament. In December 2003 the government made a commitment to implementing the 40 revised recommendations of the OECD financial action task force. This commitment was confirmed in response to a question on notice asked by the member for Barton in May 2005. Interestingly, the Minister for Justice and Customs said in that response: Australia is already compliant with many of the FATF 40 Recommendations, while the rest will be implemented following the passage of new antimoney laundering legislation. It is interesting that the minister may have created the impression that we as a nation are subscribing to and implementing the majority of the 40 recommendations of the task force. But, in 2005, the financial action task force visited Australia to review Australia's operations and legislative framework to evaluate the level of our compliance. As the member for Brisbane has said in this place, the task force report was an embarrassing read, to say the least. The task force reported to live that the government had yet to deliver a comprehensive response to the threat of terrorism financing. That is after the commitments made in 2003 and after the response to the question on notice. The position from the audit undertaken by the task force was that we had yet to deliver a comprehensive response to the threat of terrorist financing. In fact, it was found that Australia was only compliant with nine of the 40 recommendations on anti money laundering-nine, which is even less than a quarter. Of course that was not the only finding the task force made in auditing the level of our compliance. The task force also reported that Australia was not compliant in any of the nine special recommendations dealing with antiterrorism financing. That is a pretty sad indictment of the Minister for Justice and Customs, as was his response to the member for Barton when the minister indicated that we were compliant with many of the 40 recommendations. Not to put too fine a point on it, the word ‘many' implies that it is the majority or close to the majority. The finding of the task force was that only nine recommendations had been adhered to-less than a quarter-and none of the special recommendations had been adhered to. It is a pretty poor reflection of this government's efforts to address the terrorism threat. I would have thought that in the international community it would reflect pretty poorly on Australia's ability to uphold its end of the bargain when it comes to shutting down the finances or having the capability to shut down the finances of terrorist organisations. Once again, it seems that, for all of those pieces of government rhetoric on national security, their actions just do not extend past the distribution of fridge magnets and Australia's involvement in the conflict in Iraq. Regrettably, it is big talk and little aclimit tion-and what action we have is slow in coming. We had a commitment given in December 2003. We are now on the cusp of December 2006. It is some three years later and we are finally debating the legislative framework that will be the guide for that commitment. Three years is a long time. Three years is a heck of a long time when we are talking about terrorism. I am sure that the members opposite will not like being reminded of the fact that it has taken so long for this legislation to come before the parliament. I am equally sure that members opposite will not like the fact that the myth of strong activity and taking a tough stand against terrorists that this mob have shrouded themselves in has been exposed as an illusion with this legislation taking three years to come before the parliament. I acknowledge that the government has taken some action in relation to combating terrorist activity, but these have been largely stopgap measures, hastily drafted and introduced without the proper examination that such legislation would ordinarily deserve. Do not forget: some of the legislation has been on the basis of ‘let us put it in now and revise it later'. There was even a situation where an amendment was introduced to change one word in a piece of legislation so that it could be operative. Despite the embarrassment that that has incurred, the task force's report on Australia's compliance stands as an indictment of this country and its level of meeting its commitments to and compliance with its earlier undertakings. It has sent a clear message to the heart of the government that it can no longer make small attempts to bring Australia in line with the rest of the world when it comes to putting in place all of the necessary conditions to the activity of terrorist organisations. It has prompted actions that the proper process for consultation has resulted in the legislation before us today. The task force has shown that temporary fixes are not enough. The process that has led to the introduction of this legislation has shown that it cannot get away with sloppy drafting when it comes to addressing these serious situations. As I have said, this bill is long overdue. It is long overdue and it is overly complex, but I must admit it will deliver significant improvements to Australia's historically poor record when it comes to dealing with anti money laundering and counterterrorism financing. To that extent, I support the objectives of this bill. There has been extensive consultation on this bill to make sure that it is workable, given the serious concerns previously expressed, particularly by the business community. Therefore, we on this side of politics are largely supportive of this approach. However, this support is not without some concerns. There is a particular concern about clause 6(7) of the bill and I am of the viewas are many on this side of the chamberthat this clause should be struck out. All too often with this government we are seeing legislation being drafted and passed that uses extensive reliance on regulation to bring the provisions of the legislation into effect. While it is acknowledged that this is sometimes the best way to achieve the desired outcome, it is also the best way, quite frankly, to avoid proper scrutiny. In some instances this method is appropriate, but it concerns me that this government has a tendency to defer to the use of regulation rather than legislation. It defers to the use of regula6(7). tion because it is the easiest to change and the changes can effectively be introduced by a ministerial media release where the biggest risk for the government is a bad story for a couple of days in the tabloids rather than having the changes being subject to proper questioning and debate of the parliament. Clause 6(7) of the bill affords the government the power to amend the tables of designated services in the act. Currently, the designated services include activities such as: provision of accounts or transactions to and from accounts; taking of deposits; loans and acting as guarantor of loans; factoring a receivable; forfeiting a bill of exchange or promissory notes; leasing, and the supply goods by way of lease; supplying goods by hire purchase; cheque accounts; bills of exchange, promissory notes or letters of credit; debit cards; stored credit cards; travellers cheques-and the list goes on. As I have indicated, while regulations like clause 6 are used to amend sections of legislation, they should only be used in limited circumstances and should only be used for compelling reasons. I do not believe that the case has been adequately made to provide us with enough comfort to allow the government to change designated tables by administrative fiat, as outlined in clause 6. The explanatory memorandum to this bill indicates that the reason for the inclusion of clause 6(7) has been to: ... allow the Bill to keep pace with business changes and changes in the techniques used by money launderers and terrorist financiers. It is a claim of flexibility. This is a claim that I tend to question. This legislative package contains a number of exemptions and discretions that prompt a number of serious questions about the necessity of allowing changes by regulation. I welcome the amendment by the opposition that would strike out clause Flexibility is important, but flexibility can also come to mean different things to different people as time marches on. To allow this degree of flexibility by administrative fiat is too significant, given the nature of the legislation that is being debated before us this evening. It would be short-sighted of us as legislators to simply include provisions in legislation that suit our purposes in the here and now and not be mindful of an alternative interpretation that could be applied in the future. While recognising the general acceptance by the business community of the regime to be introduced-and certainly I acknowledge that it was introduced after lengthy consultation and follow-up-this bill will impose a significant compliance burden on small business. I think that is a matter of fact. I guess that can be put down as a consequence of the subject matter of these bills. However, it should be realised that a compliance burden is inevitable for small businesses in this country. As was pointed out to the government in the original drafting of the bill, the poorly drafted provisions that it contained would have hurt businesses. Quite frankly, it would have hit them hard. There was a real and legitimate concern from the business community that it was being asked to pay too high a price through increased business closures. I concede that this is a matter of balance. certainly a matter of placing binding commitments on the business community, but quite frankly it has got to be recognised that there are going to be organisations which will struggle to comply and there will be compliance costs. This needs to be noted by government as it passes legislation of this type. For instance, I note that initial funding has been provided for a period of four years to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and that a number of small businesses will receive additional guidance and assistance with the implementation of measures related to this bill. The fact that the government did get such a stern warning about the impact of the legislation in its original form should stand as a constant reminder that shoddy drafting produces wide-ranging impacts that need to be avoided in producing legislation of this type. The heightened sense of insecurity pervading the population following a range of terrorist attacks has resulted in a heightened sense of the need for increased protection from terrorist attack. The provisions of this bill will help to make a range of criminal activities less profitable and accordingly less likely to be undertaken. They will also make sure that Australia's regulatory framework to shut down the financing of terrorist organisations is based on fact rather than on the myth and illusion that the government has previously tried to create around its actions to shut down terrorist operations. This will provide a disincentive for criminal activity and terrorist activity by making it more difficult and by making it less profitable for those organisations to go about their evil intent.

175,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"Can I first thank the members for Brisbane, Melbourne Ports and It is Werriwa as well as my colleagues the members for Kingston and Cowper for their contributions to this debate. In summary, the Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Bill 2006 and the AntiMoney Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 form part of a legislative package that reforms our anti money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulatory regime. The primary purpose of the package is to ensure that Australia has a financial sector that is protected from abuse by those seeking to engage in criminal activity and terrorism. The reforms respond to increased and more sophisticated criminal and terrorist activity. The legislative package will also implement the better international standards contained in the financial action task force's-that is, FATF's-40 recommendations and nine special recommendations on terrorist financing. Compliance with these standards is important to ensure that Australian businesses can continue to operate and compete effectively in other countries that have implemented these international standards. Consistent with the government's commitment to reducing regulatory burdens on business, the legislative package implements a risk based approach to regulation. The risk based regulatory approach recognises that businesses covered by the legislative package have the experience and knowledge needed to assess and mitigate the risk. It also help mitigate compliance costs by providing industry with tools to concentrate their resources on areas where the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing is higher. Industry has endorsed this risk based approach. The Australian risk based approach is similar to that taken in the United States and the United Kingdom. Work on this package commenced in December 2003, and industry and other groups have been extensively consulted at all stages in the development of this package over time. This consultation has been vital in mulating a package that accommodates industry's needs both operationally and on a cost basis. The government will continue to work closely with affected sectors in the implementation of this new strategy to minimise the impact on legitimate business activity while ensuring that Australia's financial system remains hostile to criminal activity. In formulating the legislative package, the government has considered and addressed recommendations made by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which conducted an inquiry into the exposure draft of the bill in February and March 2006, and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which has recently conducted a second inquiry into this package and has provided a report to the Senate today. I wish to place on record my appreciation for the work of the committee in producing its report in a short time frame along with other urgent matters that it has had to deal with. The committee has done a commendable job given the complex nature of the bills. The government will be responding to the committee's report in the Senate. I also wish to thank members who contributed to this debate today, and at this point I will pick up a couple of the issues that have been will raised during the speeches that we have heard. There seems to be some misunderstanding that Australia has been vulnerable to money laundering and terrorism financing because this bill has not been in place. This bill, in fact, builds upon the existing regulatory system that has been there since 1988. This was implemented in the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 and when we criminalised terrorism financing in 2002 as part of the Criminal Code, and we also criminalised money laundering in 1987 in the Proceeds of for- Crimes Act. So, when it is suggested that these are matters that we have not dealt with before, let me say this legislation deals with matters that have been dealt with but deals with them more comprehensively and more effectively. The member for Brisbane said that compliance with the FATF special recommendations had not been achieved. Let me say that the October 2004 FATF special recommendations found that Australia was largely compliant in five cases, partially compliant in two and non-compliant only on wire transfer rules-and that one is now, of course, fully addressed in the recent amendments which came into force on 14 December. The ninth special recommendation only came into operation in 2005 and is addressed in this bill. It has been said that our consultation process-and this has been picked up in the opposition amendment-has been somewhat long. We do not apologise for comprehensive consultation. In fact, as the member for Werriwa, who just spoke, observed-and I noted this: ‘There were real and legitimate concerns.' I would say he was right, and it is appropriate that consultation took place in 2002 on the FATF discussion paper, in 2003 on the FATF recommendations, in 2004 on the five discussion papers to set the framework for drafting this legislation and through 2005-06 on the details of the bill and, now, the rules. I think the member for Brisbane should read the transcripts of the three days of hearings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. Every organisation that appeared confirmed that they were consulted and were happy with the consultation and noted the extent to which the department had gone to consult on all relevant issues. The opposition had some concerns about what is known as a ‘Henry VIII clause'that is, clause 6(7). In the bill this clause permits regulations to be made to amend an item in the tables in clause 6. The tables in clause 6 identify who will be covered by the bill by setting out a series of designated vices. Any person who provides a designated service will become a reporting entity under the bill. Subclause (7) will allow amendments to the definitions of designated services where new products of a similar kind to the existing designated services are created or structured in such a way that they would not be covered by existing definitions or where an industry or sector identifies and attempts to exploit a loophole in this particuand lar table. For example, the financial sector could deliberately structure a product that is in some way outside the definition of a security or a derivative or a foreign exchange contract in item 33 of the table but which would still present the same moneylaundering risk as other products. We need to be able to deal with those issues effectively. There were some other matters raised in relation to some recommendations from the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. I think it is important in that context to note a number of matters. This report is prepared annually by the United States Department of State for presentation to congress and it describes the efforts of key countries to attack drugs trade and associated crime. The particular report that was referred to by the member for Brisbane was brought down in 2004. In this International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, categorisation is based upon the size of a country's economy and the sophistication of the financial institutions and transactions. Obviously, countries which have a larger and more complex flow of funds will become more vulnerable to money laundering. In the report it was made clear that categorisation was not based on antimoney-laundering measures taken by that particular country and that Australia, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, is identified as being of primary concern despite having comprehensive antimoney-laundering laws and conducting agsergressive anti-money-laundering efforts. The report noted that the current ability of money launderers to penetrate virtually any financial system makes every financial jurisdiction a potential money-laundering centre. As a major centre Australia, of course, will be vulnerable to money laundering. It is in response to this that the government and law enforcement agencies continue their efforts to combat that practice both domestically in the Asia-Pacific region. It is to ensure that we maintain a robust and effective system to combat money laundering that the government has initiated the anti-moneylaundering review in response to the revised recommendations of FATF. And, of course, I would say that this legislation is equally important in updating the existing arrangements, particularly those that I referred to earlier. I note that the opposition has proposed an amendment. The amendment picks up the criticisms that I have addressed. The opposition amendment, looking at the consultation that has taken place over a period of time, states that the House: ... condemns the Government for allowing criminals and terrorists to launder money for three full years while the Minister fumbled the drafting and consultation process ... As I said earlier, I think this minister, the Minister for Justice and Customs, has been extraordinarily competent, ensuring the government's objective in implementing these measures, with full consultation, cognisant of our obligations in implementing the FATF recommendations but doing so in a way which, in the words of the member for Werriwa, addressed the ‘real and legitimate' concerns of the private sector. I do not think he should be condemned in any way, shape or form whatsoever for ensuring that these issues are dealt with in the most effective way. Those businesses concerned about the implementation of those measures were fully consulted. Their views were heard and taken into account. We are moving to implement measures that ensure that our obligations are met and that we will be largely FATF compliant, in the same way that our major trading partners are in the United Kingdom and the United States, but cognisant of the special situations that people may face in meeting these arrangements. The government will be opposing the second reading amendment proposed by the opposition. I welcome the opposition's advice that they will not be opposing the bill itself.",127

183,Mr RUDD,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on the Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2006. The bill amends Australia's customs legislation to give effect to an agreement between Australia and New Zealand to amend the rules of origin under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, ANZCERTA. Specifically, the bill replaces the existing regional value content, or RVC, rules of origin with the change of tariff classification, or CTC, rules. Rules of origin are used to determine which products qualify as domestically produced such that they can receive preferential tariff treatment under the FTA. Under the current RVC rules, a New Zealand product exported to Australia can receive preferential tariff treatment if the last production process occurred in New Zealand and at least 50 per cent of the cost of production also occurred in New Zealand. Under the proposed CTC rules of origin, for a good to receive preferential tariff treatment it must have been substantially transformed. This is determined by whether the good changes its tariff classification under the harmonised system of tariff codes, a system defined by the World Customs Organisation. In a world of global supply chains, in which various processes of manufacture for one finished product may take place in several countries, the RVC system of rules is becoming increasingly irrelevant to modern production methods. Under the current RVC system, should the final process of manufacture occur in a third country, the product will not qualify for preferential treatment no matter how minor the final process. This is the case even if more than 50 per cent of the cost of manufacture has occurred in Australia or New Zealand. In a report on the ANZCERTA rules of origin in 2004, the Productivity Commission concluded that the current system of rules of origin was out of date and acting as a constraint on trade. The Productivity Commission outlined the following advantages of the CTC method in general: (1) it reduces compliance costs; (2) it avoids the impact of price changes or exchange rate movements on origin status; (3) it increases certainty; and (4) it requires minimal records for Customs audits. The CTC method was also adopted in the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement and the Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement. This consistency makes compliance simpler for companies exporting to two or three of these countries. On the whole, Labor supports the amendment to the rules of origin since it provides for an up-to-date and consistent method of prescribing preferential tariff treatment. However, our concern is that, through the government's inadequate consultation process, at least one company could needlessly be negatively affected by the change to the point where a significant number of jobs may be at risk. While we are considering a key piece of legislation that affects Australia's trade, we should take some time to consider Australia's recent trade performance. Australia is experiencing its worse trade performance on record. Tomorrow, the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release data on Australia's trade performance in October. Australia has already had 54 consecutive monthly trade deficits, the longest run of trade deficits on record. Australia's annual trade deficit for 2005-06 was $14.5 billion; that is, Australia imported $14.5 billion more in goods and services than it exported. Each trade deficit adds directly to our current account deficit. The trade deficit, together with Australia's interest and dividend payments on existing foreign debt, equals our current account deficit. In 2005-06, Australia's current account deficit was $54.4 billion, marginally lower than the record $57.4 billion current account deficit in 2004-05. Every month, every quarter and every year that Australia imports more than it exports, the money to pay for the shortfall must come from somewhere. To cover our current account deficit, Australia borrows from overseas. As a result of the current account deficit in 2005-06, Australia's foreign debt grew by a further $60 billion to $494 billion; that is, Australia now has a foreign debt of close to half a trillion dollars. To put that in some perspective, that equates to $24,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in this country. This has occurred at a time when Australia has experienced its strongest terms of trade in 30 years. Driven by a boom in demand for resource commodities, the prices of Australia's resource exports have increased significantly over the past three years. The real problem has not been the prices of our largest exports, but the failure of the volume of exports to pick up in response. Between 1983 and 1996, Australia averaged growth in export volumes of 8.4 per cent per annum. However, over the last 10 years this has slowed to just 3.8 per cent per annum; what is even more concerning is that it has declined further to average growth of just 0.9 per cent per annum over the past five years. Australia's exports of manufacturing and services have been affected in a similar way. The volume of Australia's exports of elaborate manufactures averaged growth of 12.9 per cent a year between 1983 and 1996. Over the past 10 years growth has more than halved, averaging 5.6 per cent a year, and over the past five years it has slowed further to just 2.7 per cent a year. The volume of services exports averaged yearly growth of 9.3 per cent between 1983 and 1996. This has slowed to an average of just 2.6 per cent per annum over the past 10 years. Worst of all, over the past five years the volume of services exports has recorded an average decline of 0.7 per cent per year. By taking a strategy that involves Australia becoming merely China's quarry and Japan's beach, the Howard government has chosen by and large to ignore our high-tech services and manufacturing industries-and particularly their capacity to contribute to the country's overall export performance. In 2005, of total world trade of $12.5 trillion, the largest share-$7.3 trillion, or 58 per cent-was accounted for by trade in manufactures. The second largest traded item was services at $2.4 trillion or 19 per cent. Natural resource commodities accounted for $1.75 trillion, or just 14 per cent, of world trade. By taking a narrow approach the government is not just putting all our eggs in one basket; it is putting all our eggs in the smallest basket of world trade. Australia's trading relationship with New Zealand is one of the bright spots of Australia's overall trade performance. In 2005-06, Australia exported $11.9 billion worth of goods and services to New Zealand, which comprised $8.7 billion in goods exports and $3.2 billion in services exports. This makes New Zealand Australia's fifth largest export destination after Japan, China, the United States and the Republic of Korea. New Zealand is one of the few major trading partners with which Australia has a trade surplus. In 2005-06 Australia's goods and services trade surplus with New Zealand was valued at $4.3 billion, though this is a seven per cent reduction on the $4.6 billion recorded in 2004-05. The decline in the trade surplus was due to a fall in Australia's exports to New Zealand of 1.8 per cent at the same time as Australia's imports from New Zealand rose by 1.6 per cent. Australia's goods exports to New Zealand declined by 4.5 per cent in 2005-06, while exports of services managed solid growth of 6.7 per cent. Looking at longer run trends, we see that the growth in Australia's exports to New Zealand follows a similar pattern to Australia's overall exports growth performancethat is, one of slowing growth under the rent government. Data on Australia's exports of goods by country is only available back to 1988-89. However, for seven years, between 1988-89 and 1995-96, under the previous Labor government, exports of goods from Australia to New Zealand averaged an annual growth of 13.9 per cent. This compares to average annual growth of just 4.5 per cent over the 10 years under the current government. The importance of New Zealand to the Australian economy is highlighted when the breakdown of Australia's exports to New Zealand is considered. New Zealand is rare among Australia's trading partners in that largest export to New Zealand is in the services sector. In 2005-06, Australia exported $2.1 billion of personal travel services to New Zealand, placing it third behind China and Japan. Despite being only Australia's fifth largest exports market overall, New Zealand is our largest destination for elaborately transformed manufactured exports. Australia's elaborately transformed manufactured exports to New Zealand were valued at $5.5 billion in 2005, which was 21 per cent of our total ETM exports globally. In fact, apart from refined petroleum, the top five Australian goods exports to New Zealand are all elaborate manufactures. Specifically, they are passenger motor vehicles, medicines, computers and paper products. In 2005, Australia exported $450 million worth of passenger motor vehicles to New Zealand, making it the second largest export destination for the Australian automotive industry. At a time when Australia's exports base is narrowing, this makes New Zealand a very important trading partner for Australia. Australia is also an important trading partner for New Zealand. In fact, Australia is New Zealand's largest trading partner, with cur- Australia accounting for 21.4 per cent of New Zealand's exports in 2005 and 20.9 per cent of its imports. New Zealanders also invest heavily in Australia. Total investment by New Zealand in Australia was valued at $24.3 billion in 2005, making it the country with the eighth largest investment in the Australian economy. The relationship is not just measured in dollar terms; it can also be measured by the influx of people. In 2005, 18,500 New Zealanders migrated permanently to Australia, making New Zealand the second largest source of migrants for Australia behind the United Kingdom. Some argue that the Australia-New Zeaour land Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement could be said to be our only successful bilateral free trade agreement to date. In general, preferential bilateral free trade agreements have a number of drawbacks. First, bilateral agreements can lead to trade distortion rather than trade creation. That is, Doha Round. when two countries sign a bilateral agreement, the lower preferential tariff may induce them to import from their new partner because the reduced tariff makes that country's imports cheaper. However, the most efficient and lowest cost producer may be a third country whose product becomes uncompetitive since they do not receive the lower tariff rate. Hence, trade is merely diverted from a low-cost country to a higher cost country. Second, bilateral agreements create a spaghetti bowl of rules of origin. Each bilateral agreement has its own rules of origin, sometimes using different methodologies. With the proliferation of bilateral agreements and attached rules of origin, it becomes time suming and costly for companies to adhere to them all. This can reach the point where it becomes cheaper for an exporter to pay the higher tariff rather than comply with the rules of origin and receive the lower preferential tariff under an FTA. Third, bilateral free trade agreements take scarce resources and diplomatic focus away from the main game in liberalising world trade, which is the multilateral agreements currently under negotiation through the World Trade Organisation. This is clearly the case for Australia's prosecution of the Doha Round of WTO negotiations-and these, of course, have run significantly into the mud in recent times. At the same time as we are negotiating the Doha Round, Australia has also been negotiating bilateral agreements with Singapore, the United States, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates-now expanded to the Gulf Cooperation Council-China and Malaysia. There have also been preliminary discussions and studies on bilateral agreements with Japan and Chile. This has clearly diverted scarce resources away from the negotiation of the What is more, Australia's lead in the rush to bilateral agreements has diverted the attention of other countries from the Doha Round. Bilateral agreements provide an easy fallback position for countries negotiating the Doha Round. It is easy to say, ‘If the Doha Round fails, we can always have the bilaterals.' This is particularly disappointing given that Australia, through its leadership of the Cairns Group, is pivotal in bringing the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion. Further, the empirical evidence to date for Australia on bilateral agreements is not good; in fact, the data is disappointing. The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement and the Thailand-Australia Free Trade con- Agreement came into effect on 1 January 2005. The Singapore free trade agreement came into effect in July 2003. Australia's export performance with each of these countries has in overall terms worsened since these agreements came into effect. Since the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement came into effect, Australia's annualised trade deficit with the US has increased by 13 per cent, to $14.7 billion. The government's commissioned study into the AUSFTA predicted that Australian exports to the United States would grow by $3 billion per annum. In 2005, Australia's exports to the United States actually fell by $132 million. While it is early days, it has to be recognised that there is a long way to go from the negative growth in exports experienced in 2005 to the projected growth of $3 billion a year anticipated by the government at the time we negotiated the AustraliaUnited States Free Trade Agreement. The government commissioned study on the AUSFTA also anticipated that the largest gains from the agreement would come through the increased investment flows between the two countries. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade fact sheet on the AUSFTA stated: Much of this growth will be generated by the dynamic gains expected from the deeper links the Agreement establishes between Australia and the US, with the CIE finding investment liberalisation the biggest contributor to the projected increase in Australia's GDP. However, US investment in Australia has in fact fallen significantly since the agreement came into effect. There are a number of key sectors in the economy that were left out of that agreement. Australian sugar farmers received no additional long-term access to US markets despite Central American countries receiving an additional 100,000 tonnes access per annum under the Central American free trade agreement. I am sure that the member for Dawson, who is currently sitting at the table, would as a fellow Queenslander be concerned about the fact that we have received no additional access to the US sugar market as a consequence of the AUSFTA despite the fact that we were assured at the time that if there were no sugar there would be no deal. It is a pity that promise was not honoured. As a result, Australia's sugar farmers will continue to be restricted to a quota of just 90,000 tonnes. Another outstanding concern is the lack of mutual recognition of Australian financial markets qualifications by the United States. Under the agreement, US qualified and licensed brokers are automatically recognised and able to trade in Australia. Australian brokers must go through an onerous process with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to be able to operate in the US. Australia's free trade agreement with Thailand has seen our trade deficit with Thailand worsen. In 2004, Australia's annual trade deficit with Thailand was $1.5 billion. By June 2006, Australia's annualised trade deficit with Thailand had grown to $1.6 billion. Australia's free trade agreement with Singapore has had more time to have an effect on the economy, since it became operational in mid-2003. In 2002-03, Australia had a trade surplus of $162 million with the Republic of Singapore. By 2005-06, this had not only been reversed into a trade deficit but had blown out to a most significant trade deficit indeed. Australia's exports to Singapore have flatlined over the past two years. In 2002-03, Australia's exports to Singapore were valued at $6.9 billion. In 2005-06, they were valued at $6.4 billion. Something is going radically wrong with our export performance in relation to the Republic of Singapore. Singapore's exports to Australia, however, have more than doubled from $6.9 billion to $14.5 billion. It would be interesting to know what is happening in this significant regional economic relationship to see such a radical turnaround in the bilateral trade figures, which has been significantly negative from Australia's perspective. In a period when Australia is experiencing its worse trade performance on record, the government's trade policies appear to be not significantly improving this position. The challenge overall, beyond these bilateral agreements and all the complications that are associated with them, is for this government to join every element of its diplomatic and political energies towards the successful conclusion of the Doha multilateral round. The Australian Labor Party in government-at a time, Mr Deputy Speaker Kerr, when you were a member of that previous Labor government-actively contributed to the resolution of the Uruguay Round through the sterling contributions of the likes of the late Senator Peter Cook. Through those agencies, we were able to bring to the negotiating table an influence which brought that round to a successful conclusion-which, for the first time, included agriculture. There you have it. It was a Labor government-those opposite would say the ALP does not have a natural connection with the agricultural constituency, but I beg to differ; I grew up on a farm myself-that delivered in terms of getting agriculture onto the WTO agenda. We are proud of that fact. But what we are concerned about is that there has been a sapping of the diplomatic and political energies behind the multilateral trade effort. What I know of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is that, at the end of the day, there is a limited number of qualified people who are charged with the negotiating brief. You cannot expect officials to pull off miracles when they are being asked to undertake multiple tasks at the same time. These bilateral deals are personnel intensive. The deal with China is exceptionally personnel intensive. When we are simultaneously seeking in the last period of the Doha negotiating round to try to bring that most critical round to a conclusion, I question and question again the extent to which our department is being asked to do too much, given the limits to its bureaucratic resources, with a Prime Minister who is not fully seized of the significance of the successful conclusion of Doha in terms of the political capital he is prepared to inject into this exercise. Recently, I reflected on and read again of the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. When I read the speeches by Minister Dawkins, Minister Cook, Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Keating, what struck me time and time again was that, each time these ministers and prime ministers travelled abroad, the successful conclusion of the multilateral round was at the top of the prime ministerial list of priorities; it was at the top of the negotiating list for whichever country they were visiting around the region and around the world. I do not see that evident in Prime Minister Howard's list of priorities when he travels the region and the world; it is not accorded the same level of priority. Instead, this government has placed a large number of its eggs in one basketthat is, a series of bilateral agreements-and the figures which begin to produce themselves off the back of these bilateral agreements are not, thus far, encouraging for Australia. Leaving aside the broader point-not just the philosophical point but the basic economic theory that global trade liberalisation enables all economies to advance and to grow-it provides the most efficient allocation of resources across the global economic system, as opposed to bilateral arrangements which can be trade distorting, although not necessarily. Certainly it delivers complexity to exporters-producers-the spaghetti bol I referred to before. The legislation which is the subject of debate in the House tonight is the Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2006. I have canvassed our approach to the legislation. I have indicated that we have concerns about the impact of this legislation and this agreement as it relates to a particular firm. My colleague the member for Gellibrand will move an amendment at the appropriate time. We would ask the government to give that amendment strong and appropriate consideration, given the impact that will be felt by one particular group of employees. Beyond that, could I simply conclude by saying that, for Australia, the economic relationship with New Zealand is of critical importance. The political relationship with New Zealand is of critical importance. We look to the South Pacific-and I notice my colleague the member for Maribyrnong, the shadow minister for the Pacific Islands, sitting at the table right now-and, were it not for New Zealand and many of the countries where we are currently engaged politically and militarproblems ily in the South Pacific, we would be in even greater difficulty than we are at the moment. New Zealanders have been strong and positive partners in our regional diplomacy in South Pacific. However, as I have indicated through my remarks this evening, it is not just as diplomatic partners; the numbers reflected in our bilateral economic relationship show the New Zealand trade relationship is one of the few bright spots in our overall trade horizon when the global data for Australia has been trending negative for almost five years.",132
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,I thank the honourable shadow minister for foreign affairs. My heart warms at his remembrance of times past. Memory sometimes treats us oddly.,138
185,Mr BAIRD,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Thanks very much, Mr Deputy Speaker Kerr. It is great to see you in that role after your very impressive stay at the UN. I wish tonight to rise in support of the Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2006. The CER we have with New Zealand is a very important document because a major part of our trade goes to New Zealand. New Zealand represents our largest source of tourists into this country and, likewise, we are the No. 1 source of tourists for land. In respect of investments in New Zealand, we are No. 1. New Zealand also ranks significantly in this country. Trade both ways is very significant. The CER was developed in 1983. We have been through the 20th anniversary, when the New Zealand parliament reviewed the CER agreement to consider the issues and the problems, where they still existed. At the invitation of the New Zealand government, I visited the parliament and spoke to people there, and they encouraged the Australian parliament to also look at the issues and from our perspective. It is true that the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade was probably a little tardy but we reviewed the the agreement some 23 years after the CER was inaugurated in 1983, and we are about to present the report to parliament. The Trade Subcommittee found that the CER had served both countries very well. It had significantly developed trade in both countries. It had removed many of the barriers, and it encouraged development. As a result, we moved very much to a free trade environment although we certainly still had the issues around common currency and common borders. In reviewing the CER, it was true to say that, from discussions with industry and departments on this side and on the New Zealand side of the equation, there were no major problems. They were more looking forward-for example, how we could improve the common border situation. There was no great enthusiasm for common currency on either side of the Tasman. We looked at how we could reform telecommunications such that there is a greater ease of relationship between the two countries and without the barriers to investment that exist on either side of the Tasman, as we have two major competitive organisations operating: New Zea- Telstra and New Zealand Telecom. Overall, it has been a great success. New Zealand is our major trading partner. We have a very long term relationship. As part of the ANZAC, these two countries are brought together not only commercially but also through a significant emotional attachment. We regard New Zealanders and Australians as being interchangeable on most daysexcept when we play rugby or cricket against one another and then things change a bit! With respect to the rest of the time, obviously the very significant level of migration from New Zealand into Australia means that we have many New Zealanders in very senior jobs across the whole economic spectrum. In our report, we are looking at the need for trade coordination so that it is for a plumber in Australia to get a job in New Zealand and vice versa. This is particularly important when we have very low unemployment levels and as we try to solve some of our skills shortages resulting from the resources boom. That is being addressed by individual trade associations. This legislation addresses the rules of gin. It was interesting, when the Trade Subcommittee visited New Zealand, that the only major issue raised with us by ministers was the question of New Zealand suits being brought into Australia. They said that some Australian suit manufacturers, based predominantly in the state of Victoria, the member for Maribyrnong's state, were complaining about the importation of New Zealand suits and that they were unable to supply suits because part of the product was produced offshore. We could really call this legislation the ‘Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin, Especially for Suits) Bill' because it is all about suits from New Zealand. It is somewhat ironic, when today lots of our footwear and textiles are imported from China and from South-East Asia in large quantities, that we should be arguing with New Zealand over the importation of suits. But that is the way is: part of it is produced in China and it was decided that we should address it. When the Trade Subcommittee came back from New Zealand we spoke to the Minister for Justice and Customs-you would know that role particularly well, Mr Deputy Speaker Kerr, having been a proud occupant of the role in past times-about the problems that the New Zealanders had raised with us. I am sure there are other very good reasons why this bill was produced relating to other commodities and products, but I am aware that this was one issue which concerned the New Zealanders. As we know, the Australia-New Zealand easier Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, or ANZCERTA, came into force in March 1983. It was revised and updated in February 2006 and continues to be strong and viable. There are a number of bilateral ministerial meetings on a regular basis designed to look at this issue. One of the issues we had, which will be coming forward in the ori- recommendations, was the need, because it cuts across so many different portfolios, to have one ministry responsible for driving the program. To a certain extent, the Treasury has been in that driving role, and we will see how that develops, but that was one area where it seemed people were not quite sure who was driving the program to ensure we had a common economic union with New Zealand. The amendments are set to come into force on 1 January 2007. Under the review a preferential entry of goods provides New Zealand goods and services with preferential access to the Australian market by eliminating barriers to trade between our nations in a gradual phase-out process. The first step in this process is to eliminate tariffs on goods which have been either wholly manufactured or substantially manufactured in New Zealand, as defined by the rules of origin. Under it these, at least 50 per cent of the cost of producing the goods must be incurred in Australia or New Zealand. Ever since 1990, all goods that have met these rules of origin have been able to be traded duty free between Australia and New Zealand. Due to the nature of changes within our economies-in other words globalisation, which you would have heard a lot about at the UN,",138
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"some business representatives have seen these rules of origin as a hindrance to growth and further trade. In accordance with one of the current rules, manufactured goods imported from New Zealand are originating and therefore eligible for a preferential rate of duty if the last ess of manufacture occurs in New Zealand and the goods satisfy a regional value content requirement. This is totally sensible and totally realistic. Why did we not think of that before? Congratulations to those involved in bringing forward this legislation. Sometimes, despite the majority of the stages in production occurring in Australia or New Zealand, the final stage is outsourced, thus creating a tariff to be imposed on the good when traded between Australia and New Zealand. This bill implements amendments to the CER that would also allow the change in the tariff classification method to be used, along with a regional value content requirement, to determine whether goods from New Zealand are New Zealand originating goods. The reality is that we have a free trade arrangement with New Zealand and a common economic market. We are bringing products in directly from China anyway with very little tariff, so if the last part of the good is produced in New Zealand then this makes sense. The CTC approach being adopted through this legislation examines the product's nonoriginating inputs and makes a determination as to whether substantial transformation has taken place in producing the final good. This will therefore enable such goods to be considered ‘New Zealand originating'. This approach is based on the World Customs Organisation's harmonised system of tariff codes and is widely used throughout the world. We see this as being useful. It will smooth out some of the bumps in our trade relationship more than have a dramatic impact. As stated by our Minister for Trade at the time, along with his New Zealand counterpart, the last process of manufacture method will continue to be available alongside the new change in tariff classification method. procThis provision will be in effect until December 2011, allowing traders and manufacturers time to come to terms with and adapt to the changes. It is an entirely sensible arrangement. One of the key ministers we saw had suit manufacturers in his electorate, which I think focused his mind particularly on this issue. I am glad we resolved it. I am glad the relationship with New Zealand remains strong and firm. May we long beat them in cricket and in rugby, but let us get our economic union in working order so that the arrangements of the past no longer bog us down in unnecessary bureaucratic requirements. This will facilitate the strength of our combined economies, which is to the mutual benefit of Australia and New Zealand. I commend the bill to the House.",139
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his kind remarks. I certainly enjoyed his company when we were in New York together at the United Nations, where I also learned of his appreciation of fine suits.",140
188,Ms ROXON,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Gellibrand) (8.21 pm)Amidst all of this self-congratulation about suits I hate to rain on everybody's parade, but there are actually some industries that, unfortunately, are not getting similar special treatment. Whilst I understand that there are historic reasons for some exceptions being in place and negotiated as part of this agreement, I am in the unfortunate position where a company in my electorate will be severely affected by the changes that will be brought about as part of the Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2006. Other members in the House have already spoken on the broader context of the agreement, and I do not want to detract from the general comments made about improving economic relations between our countries and removing the barriers that we can remove, but there is unfortunately sometimes a downside to these arrangements. The downside exists for a detergent producer in my electorate. The proposed change of arrangements from the regional value content method that exists now to the tariff classification method will mean that a substantial amount of trade between Australia and New Zealand will cease to exist and will be replaced by trade between China and New Zealand. The New Zealand company will still be able to provide their product into Australian market, courtesy of these proposed new arrangements, with the same tariff treatment it would have received when part of its manufacturing process was being undertaken in Australia, with the final manufacture being done in New Zealand and the product coming back into Australia. I will spend some time on the impact that the proposed arrangement will have on the business in my electorate and on the workers who will no doubt be affected by it. The arrangement will also have the bizarre result of reducing trade between Australia and New Zealand by the significant amount of $7 million, because the New Zealand company has already indicated that, as soon as these new rules are in place, it will obtain its product from China at a rate that the company in my electorate says indicates that it is being dumped. There is no way that an Australian company will be able to take any action, because it will not be dumped in Australia. It does mean that the New Zealand company will have a commercial advantage, but it will not really be a commercial advantage to either of our countries. It is not even a situation where, difficult as it may be for individare ual workers or members when it affects their electorates, the jobs are being moved from Australia to New Zealand. The jobs impact is all negative in Australia, and it is not positive in New Zealand. Certainly the New Zealand company will be able to increase its profit line, but it made quite clear in the evidence provided to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties that it was not making any undertakings about passing on any benefits to consumers as a result of this change, and it was not making any undertakings about extra employment in New Zealand. These things will be of little comfort to the workers in my electorate, but it may have been, in the overall picture of the relationship we are continuing to develop the between Australia and New Zealand, something that others could at least have seen the sense of. It is very hard to make that argument when the consequence is that a New Zealand company will be able to buy product from China at a rate at which other companies cannot. If another competitor in Australia bought product from China at that rate, the company in my electorate would take anti-dumping action, as I understand they have either done or contemplated doing in the past. So this unfortunate situation is made more unfortunate-and I know the discussion between the Deputy Speaker and the member for Cook, who was speaking just before, was good humoured-when you understand that exceptions are able to be made for particular industries. There are exceptions that exist for gentlemen's apparel; why can't there be an exception for this particular detergent product, when we know that both Australia and New Zealand participate in the production, where there are good relationships between the companies and where a very competitive market exists? There could not be any suggestion that laundry detergents and products not a competitive sector of the retailing industry. I am very concerned, so I have raised this issue. The affected company in my electorate is Albright and Wilson. They wrote to me when they first became aware of this proposed agreement. Disappointingly, they did not see the one advertisement that was in the Financial Review, I think, or the Australian. They were not contacted by the department or through their industry association. I understand that efforts are often made for that to happen and that the department cannot always get everybody, but I think this situation has shown an inadequacy in the process. The only reason the company became aware of it was that the New Zealand company that had the contractual arrangement with them to buy their product had a clause in their agreement that they should provide six months notice if they wanted to stop buying the product from the Australian company. So the New Zealand company, seeing that this agreement had been negotiated, and expecting that legislation would be moved within both parliaments, gave six months notice that they would cease purchasing the product from the company in my electorate. It was only at that time that Albright and Wilson became aware of this proposed change and the negative impact it will have on them. Immediately we entered into discussion with the then Minister for Trade and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. We are obviously now dealing with the current Minister for Trade. Unfortunately, the responses from the government have all been interested and polite but not that it is prepared to take any action. Evidence to the committee and elsewhere seems to show that the government and the department are hiding behind the fact that the company was not aware at the earliest stage of this proposed change and therefore, by not being part of the negotiations, had missed its chance. I do not accept that that is an adequate sponse when there is still plenty of time to add this proposed change to the agreement. It is a small change. I understand that the New Zealand government is implacably opposed to any change, as no doubt people always are when negotiations have been completed. But if our government had really shown any will or interest in picking this up on behalf of working Australians, I think the New Zealand government might well have considered the issue differently. I am disappointed that Minister Truss has written back basically saying: ‘We've taken it seriously, but we're not going to do anything else. New Zealand is not prepared to reopen negotiations, and we won't look at any sort of exception.' The government also refers to an absence of industry consensus on this issue. I would say that it is more than an absence of industry consensus. It would be more accurate to say that the industry organisations have entirely conflicting responsibilities in this area. They have interests that can run completely counter to the interests of individual companies. Unfortunately, in this situation companies like Unilever Australia, with its relationship with Unilever in New Zealand, is a bigger organisation in the industry group than Albright and Wilson. The industry group is not prepared to make representations on behalf of one member when it might affect another member, even though Unilever New Zealand is an entirely discrete company. It is very disappointing that the government was not prepared to take any action. There are 65 people in my electorate who are quite likely to lose their jobs as a result of the government's failure to take any action on this issue. It could have been averted. I do not believe that the New Zealand government would be as reticent if the Australian government were prepared to seriously engage on this issue. All members of the Joint Standing Comremittee on Treaties recommended-and the dissenting report made an even stronger recommendation-that this issue should have been dealt with, that it had slipped through the department's consultation process for whatever reason and that negotiations on it should be entered into immediately. But that has not happened. Given that the government has been determined not to take on this issue, we will give it one last opportunity. In the consideration in detail stage of this debate, we will be moving an amendment which would provide for an exception for this line item. We do not believe that there is any reason for the government not to support it. We will be calling on all members of the House who would be similarly concerned about working people in their electorates who were at risk of losing their jobs because of this has been taken to vote with us. If we do not get to the consideration in detail stage in the debate today, the government might reflect differently and be prepared to accept this change. Otherwise, should the loss of these jobs come to pass, it will be on their heads. will show that there is generally no preparedness on behalf of the government to take account of the interests of the community. I would like to indicate that we have taken as many steps as possible to support Australian industry, particularly the manufacturer Albright and Wilson and their staff who are situated in my electorate. We have pursued two different trade ministers on this issue. We have been in consultations with the industry minister. Labor members, through the treaties committee, tabled a dissenting report urging immediate negotiations on this issue. I would like to record my thanks to the member for Swan and a number of his colleagues on the treaties committee for pursuing this issue. But still the government has failed to take any action. We will be asking for an exemption. It is not new to have an exemption in these sorts of agreements. It is not adequate to say that will be dealt with later. The jobs at Albright and Wilson will be lost and people's livelihoods will be ruined. The business may well go under completely. All that the government will have delivered through this legislation is the ability for a New Zealand company to buy dumped Chinese product instead of Australian product. That is all that will be achieved if the government votes against our proposed amendment. That is not a good outcome for closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand. There is no possible excuse for the government to avoid an opportunity to support the maintenance of $7 million worth of trade between our two countries. I urge the government to action that reconsider what it is doing. We cannot afford to lose this Australian industry. We know that manufacturing contributes not only to our export performance but also to our research and development. Albright and Wilson employ chemists, adIt ministrators and chemical workers. They have industry partnerships with research institutions that encourage product development and innovation. All of this is being put at risk because of the government's stubborn determination not to take account of the interests of this company. The government has made exemptions in the past. It has made them for gentlemen's apparel. There are other industries with similar exemptions. There should be one in place for this product, which is made in my electorate. I will be urging the government when we consider the bill in detail to accept my proposed amendment so that this agreement will be able to go ahead with the support of members not just on the government's side of the House but on our side as well.",140
189,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"in reply-May I firstly thank the members who have contributed in it this debate tonight. I notice the list is somewhat shorter than I originally anticipated, but I thank the members for Griffith, Gellibrand and Cook for their contributions. I note that they have participated in the debate on the proposed amendments to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement which will allow for a change of tariff classification method to be used along with a regional value content requirement in determining whether goods meet the rules of origin for the CER. Together with the current last process of manufacture method, importers on both sides of the Tasman will have the option of using either method until 31 December 2011, when the current method will cease to operate. The amendments will simplify the process of determining whether a good from New Zealand is a New Zealand originating good. The current last process of manufacture method can be administratively burdensome for a manufacturer and can lead to uncertainty because of exchange rates, for example. The proposed amendments will bring greater certainty and be administratively simpler. They will improve efficiency by allowing greater use of imports not produced in Australia or New Zealand, without adverse impact on the ability to claim origin. They are consistent with the international trend to use the CTC approach. I commend the amendments in cementing even further the strong economic and trade relationship between Australia and New Zealand. It has grown significantly since the try into force of the CER in 1983. I notice that the member for Gellibrand is proposing an amendment to the regional value content provision, which will require goods classified to be subject to a 50 per cent regional value content in the rules of origin regulation. Goods classified in 3402.20 are subject to a rule already agreed to by Australia and New Zealand. This rule was discussed and agreed by the industry concerned. Our view is that an amendment along the lines that the member proposes would need negotiations to be reopened with New Zealand, which has indicated that it is not prepared to discuss amendments to annex C of the CER. The other matter raised was the dumping of goods classified under 3402.20 through New Zealand. The Australian legislation provides that a third-party anti-dumping application can be made. This legislation is consistent with the WTO requirements and, to date, we are not aware of any such action being commenced. I make those observations in relation to the proposed amendment. Obviously, when it is moved, we will be opposing it. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",143
190,Ms ROXON,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"I move: Schedule 1, item 1, page 9, after subclause (5), (after line 15) insert (5A) If the goods are goods of the kind specified in tariff item 3402.20. in Annex G to ANZCERTA Product Specific Rules of Origin published in March 2006 the regulations must specify that the goods are required to have a regional value content of at least 50%. enI think I have already covered the purpose of the amendment I am moving: it is to ensure that a business in my electorate is able to continue successfully manufacturing products and employing 65-odd constituents. The amendment I am moving is a very small and simple exemption that the government could make that would ensure that those jobs in my electorate are protected. They could agree to exempt tariff line 3402.20 from the changes that are proposed in this bill. As I flagged, the government has repeatedly ignored numerous representations by the company, me and my colleagues and the recommendations on this change of its own Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The government has indicated it will not pursue negotiations with New Zealand on this tariff line. They have given no indication that the necessary exemption will be included in regulations, a method that would also be possible. Labor is moving this amendment because the government has failed to negotiate in any way to save these 65 jobs in my electorate. I must remind the House that asking for such an exemption is not new. The regulations to this bill will include exemptions for the gentlemen's apparel and automotive industries, as has already been discussed. The government recognised that cheaper, dumped products from countries like China could hurt these Australian industries, but this amendment simply provides the same protection to Australian detergent manufacturing and the $7 million in exports generated by Albright and Wilson as is given to some other industries. The amendment ensures that the existing method for calculating regional content for the tariff line is retained. Without this amendment, Albright and Wilson estimate that they will lose at least 20 per cent of the factory turnover at Yarraville and that this will put all of their jobs in jeopardy. I urge the government to reconsider its position. It is a small amendment. It is an easy amendment; it does not have an impact on the rest of the negotiated agreement. We strongly support this amendment.",144
191,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS LEGISLATION,"Given the comments I made, it is a bit rough of the honourable member for Gellibrand to say that the government has ignored her constituents. I will simply make the point that the government became aware of the concerns raised by Albright and Wilson regarding the impact of these new rules of origin only after negotiations with New Zealand and the industry had been completed. We made every effort to see whether the company's requested existing tariff item, detergents, could be retained exclusively for up to five years. The Minister for Trade, Warren Truss, met with the company in early November 2006. The Minister for Trade personally raised this issue with New Zealand's trade minister, Mr Goff, at the recent APEC meetings in Hanoi on 14 November. As I said earlier, New Zealand is unwilling to reopen the finely balanced package which was agreed. Consultations with the Australian industry associations established that there was no consensus on Albright and Wilson's request. That is the case but we will remain in consultation with the company. We will keep it under review, but obviously an amendment as proposed, which has not been agreed with New Zealand, is not something that can be accepted by the government.

193,Ms MACKLIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga) (8.57 pm)Labor will oppose the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Legislation Amendment Bill 2006. This is the latest instalment in a series of three related extreme, arrogant and heavy-handed bills. Labor will continue to defend the right of the community, including Indigenous communities, to be properly and fully consulted before decisions are made about the location of radioactive waste dumps. This bill amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the principal act, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005, to make land nominations as distinct from decisions not reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, provides that failure to comply with the site nomination rules in the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 will not affect the validity of the minister's approval of a nomination and removes any entitlement to procedural fairness in relation to a nomination of a site. The bill also amends the principal 2005 act to provide for the return of nominated Aboriginal land used for a radioactive waste management facility when no longer required for the facility and indemnifies traditional owners following the land return against any damages claims arising from the use of the land for a facility. The bill continues the Howard government's history of removing the voice of local communities in this government's campaign to impose a waste dump on the Northern Territory. This campaign should be seen for exactly what it is-a taster for the methods the Howard government intends to use in imposing nuclear power stations and high-level waste dumps on unsuspecting communities right around Australia: tricky tactics like denying real intentions before an election then springing it on a community straight after, or misusing parliamentary numbers to override every legislative right, protection and safeguard normally available to everyday Australians when they want to have their say on government decisions which affect them. Accordingly, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “the House: (1) refuses the Bill a second reading, because of the Howard Government's: (a) continuing arrogant approach imposing a nuclear waste dump on the people of the Northern Territory without proper scientific assessment and consultation processes; (b) broken election commitments to not locate a waste dump in the Northern Territory; (c) overriding of many Federal, State and Territory legal protections, rights and safeguards; (d) destruction of any recourse to procedural fairness provisions for anyone wishing to challenge the Minister's decision to impose a waste dump on the people of the Northern Territory; (e) continuing and aggravated disregard of the International Atomic Energy Commission's recommendations on good social practices like consultation and transparency in relation to nuclear waste; (f) failure to deliver a national waste repository after ten long years in government, and, (2) in light of the Howard Government's imposition of a nuclear waste dump on the Northern Territory community, and the recent High Court decision in the Workchoices case, expresses deep concern that the Howard Government will override community objections and State and Territory laws to impose nuclear reactors and high level nuclear waste dumps on local communities across Australia”. To begin with I want to remind the House of the circumstances underlying the 2005 bill pushed through this parliament late last year.",146

Therefore, I think the Prime Minister was transparent; it was open. Even Commissioner had no capacity to find as to the stewardship Why did the government allow this to go pretty obvious. If there were such certainty amongst those of the front-bench, that they were these terms of reference in the manner that public does understand when it comes to ministers rowly as to make it all but impossible to find is why the terms of reference The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister think that they have pulled the wool over the ing sure that they could not be found to have public can see through those tricks.

It was an inquiry remarkable in its about this inquiry was the government's It was a one-sided set of terms of reference. is probably why the Prime Minister has indicated why was it that Commissioner Cole himself, there was no capacity for him to find as to the they had? That was at the outset of this is probably right to say it was transparent. It Terence Cole himself acknowledged that he of those ministers involved. through without any examination? I think that is in the ranks of the members opposite, particularly all innocent, why would they have restricted they did? There is one thing that the Australian who set the scope of an inquiry so narfault-that is, that there is fault to be found. That were so skewed from the outset. and the Minister for Foreign Affairs might eyes of the Australian public on this one by makbeen doing anything wrong. But the Australian members of the government are happy with the rather than criminally negligent, the Australian that the Australian public knows that the deand the Minister for Trade actually approved all which were being investigated by the Cole government received on no less than 35 occaof bribes and the involvement of these NA ministers. Quite frankly, it is appalling that for running their own departments. The allegations tries but also by UN personnel and other organisations-yet and said, ‘We didn't know.' That was the defence the Australian public know, that this was wrong. Saddam Hussein to fund a conflict that would tralian troops. The Prime Minister has tried to write down more satisfactory for his own purposes. He is has completely exonerated the government. If pear that there was no wrongdoing by him or claims that he has not broken promises on interest rates low, this characterisation of the of shape that the truth becomes almost impossible Prime Minister's assertion that none of his then, as a matter of course, we must start tence. As the Leader of the Opposition said today, are here saying with pride and boasting to us, incompetent and negligent.' I think that is report-and also, quite frankly, for the celebrations members on the opposite side. In public life incompetent and to be found to be responsible proud of. Just because you avoid the hangman's should not let you off scot-free. The Prime Minister should be asking some of his ministers. I can only hope that he is asking is dusting off that little used document that ity-and that he recognises that those ministers well and truly out of their depth and should be ity is all about. As if the finding of incompetence this is a time when the price for ministerial sion for ministerial incompetence was $300 ultimately an enemy of this country. That is try, to a dictator, we were about to go to war with. I know that many members opposite go to Liberal Party former great, Prime Minister in his heyday, would have kept delivering pig that at some stage he was going to invade them. point is that not even Pig Iron Bob would have the Australian public in this case. This government headlines of a number of newspapers today, not off the hook, and nor should it be.

Much like the Prime Minister's or given commitments to such things as keeping Cole findings, quite frankly, bends him so far out or at least unrecognisable.

Its members ‘We are not criminally culpable; we are merely a fair summary of what has come out of the Cole that took place last night by a number of and in public administration, to be found to be for gross maladministration is nothing to be noose by being found to be incompetent pretty serious questions about the competency those questions of his ministers and that he he once had that outlined ministerial responsibilinvestigated by Cole have been found to be dismissed.

One of the many things that Australia could it was always considered to be a responsible trading the less than savoury activities of other nations has ruined that notion for everybody and it has ruined our good reputation-one bad organisation on 35 occasions and did nothing about. It is difficult to see where the findings pages-of the Cole inquiry are likely to take that the findings are findings of innocence and this place.
