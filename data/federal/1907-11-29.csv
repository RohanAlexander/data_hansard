Mr DL'GALD THOMSON presented a petition from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, praying that the Australian Industries Preservation Bill be set aside. Mr MALONEY presented a petition from persons engaged in the musical instrument trade, praying the House not to sanction any duty on pianos higher than that levied under the first Federal Tariff. Petitions received and read. CBE TO TASMANI A. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I desire to ask the Postmaster-General, without nowas tice, whether, as it is rumoured that the salary. Government intend to construct a new cable to Tasmania, the shortest route will or lose? be selected, making Stanley on the north-west coast of Tasmania the terminus, and thus saving the cost of at least 80 to 100 miles of cable, and of the laying of it?",14
1,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Negotiations are progress, and inquiry is being made. is premature yet to say what will INCO ME TAX : FEDERA L",14
2,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"In some income tax cases recently heard as between the States of New South Wales and Victoria and cerdemanded tain taxpayers, the question of the status how many? of the High Court was raised, and applications were made for leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Can the Attorney General inform the House as to the result of those appeals? ",14
3,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"A cablegram has been received to the effect that the petitions in Baxter, Flint, and Crouch's case have all been dismissed, but the reasons for the judgment will not be given until a later date.",14
4,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Thos e were petitions for leave to appeal ?,14
5,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yes. The position, shortly, is that the High Court held that Federal officers' salaries were not liable taxation by the States. That was in Deakin's and Lyne's case. The matter [24.1]- 2 was brought up again before one of the State Judges, who followed the decision of the High Court, but gave leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The Privy Council held that Federal incomes were at 2.30 liable to be assessed for purposes of taxation by the States. The matter arose again in Baxter's case before the High Court in Sydney, and in Flint's case in Melbourne. The High Court re-affirmed its decision, and refused acertificate for leave to appeal to the Privy Council. A petition was then filed with the Privy Council for leave to appeal by the State of New South Wales in Baxter's case, and, I ' understand, by the Government of Victoria in Flint and Crouch's case.",14
6,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Were the circumstances similar in each case?,14
7,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"They were in Flint and Baxter's case. I believe there was a difference in Crouch's case, simply from the fact that the remuneration of a member involved, instead of a public servant's",14
8,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Then , does Crouch win",14
9,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"In Crouch's case the petition has been dismissed. The petitions in these three cases have been dismissed. The position, therefore, is that the judgin ments of the High Court remain. It be done. EXCISETARIFF (AGRICULTURA L MACHINERY) ACT. SALARIES . Mr HUTCHISON - I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether any of the agricultural implement makers have yet furnished the security by the Department, and, if so, r",14
10,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I ' do not know whether any securities have yet been given, but the time allowed-fourtee n days-ha s not yet expired. When the time is up, I shall give the honourable member just the information asked for. TARIFF. CIRCULATION OF COMMITTEE'S DECISIONS .",14
11,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I wish to ask a question of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and, in doing so, to make a short explanation. I understand that each day the only to information, except the very ample reports held - whic h are not official-of the press, given to merchants as to the duties fixed by the Committee of Ways and Means is contained in a copy of the items dealt with posted at the Customs House. Some merchants have drawn my attention to the fact that, however desirous they are of preventing errors in their entries, they find it impossible, in the circumstances, to keep absolutely up to the Customs regulations. 1, therefore, ask the Minister whether, as each division of the Tariff is dealt with, he. will cause the result to be published in a handy form, so that it may be circulated amongst merchants. I am told that would be a great convenience if it were done.",14
12,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The honourable member's request appears to be reasonable, and I shall endeavour to comply with it as soon as possible. EXCISE PROCEDURE BILL .",15
13,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the Excise Procedure Bill before the adjournment for Christmas? I understood from the honourable gentleman's recent statement that he proposes to give a general outline of the new protection policy of the Government before the House rises, ancl that any measures relating to that question are to be dealt with subsequently.",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If which I doubt-w e should certainly deal with the Bill to which the honourable member refers, but before it is dealt with the statement in relation to the new protection will be made..",15
15,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Will not the be dealt with until after the Tariff is disposed of?,15
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It will . not be dealt with until after the statement is made. If time permitted, and the Tariff were disposed of-whic h is a contingenpy I am afraid that I cannot contemplate Mr W. H. IRVINE - The likely to be dealt with before the Christmas adjournment?",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No . PUBLICSERVICE : INCREMENT S. ^ Mr MATHEWS - I desire to ask the Treasurer whether, as increments recommended by the Public Service Commissioners, as from the ist July last, are being withheld until the Estimates are passed, is it not rather hard upon the officers concerned, who, in most cases, although they have looked forward to receiving the increments, will not be likely to get them now until next July ? Could not the Treasurer make. provision 'that all increments shall be paid to those in receipt of under £ 3 0 0 a year, as I understand has been done already in the case of officers receiving under £ 1 6 0 ?",15
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The matter has been before me, but at present - I do not feel disposed to deal with the whole of those increments before Parliament passes them in the ordinary way in the Estimates. The amount is considerable. I will look into the matter again, but I am not at present prepared to take the responsibility of paying them. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",15
19,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am sorry to have to trouble the House with a short personal explanation. A small newspaper, published in Melbourne, has made a statement to the effect that I have used my Ministerial influence to get leathers for hats, and machinery for hat-making, placed on the free list, ancl also to obtain a heavy duty upon hats and caps, and that the result means thousands of pounds to me personally. I should have taken no notice of the statement in the newspaper to which I refer, had not the lying statement been reprinted in quite a number of countime permits^- try papers in Victoria, arid, as I learn now, in some New South Wales papers. I have to repeat what I said before, that neither in the case of material nor in the case of manufactured goods in the hat-making, or any other industry Bill have I a penny of interest, directly or indirectly. MESSENGER S : LATE HOURS.",15
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the boys employed as messengers at the Government Printing Bill is not Office, and also the telegraph messengers, who are compelled to remain on duty at Parliament House during the present extraordinary 'hours of sitting, are receiving any extra payment: During last session, when there were all-night sittings, the Prime Minister promised that some arrangement would be made to recompense these boys; and I desire to know whether any arrangement, if made, has been car_ ried out?",15
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The customary time for considering this matter-and I am sure it will be considered in the best possible spirit-is Christmas Eve.,15
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware that Parliament is being thoroughly sweated, and, if so, will he say what is proposed to be done regarding payment for overtime ? Are we to have leave of absence in lieu of payment, or how do we stand generally in this connection?",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I think the question is a very fair one. Speaking for the' Government, we are prepared to give the Opposition leave of absence from this time forward until the end of the session. PAPUA: TAXATION OF NATIVES.",16
24,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I desire to know from the Prime Minsister whether it is the intention of the Government to impose poll tax, or hut tax on the natives of Papua, and, if so, whether it will be under the authority of legislative or of Executive of action ?",16
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The question of the taxation of the native population of Papua will come before this House prior to any steps being taken by the Government.,16
26,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,There will be a statement made beforehand?,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes . NA - GOVERNMENT PRINTING.,16

What is the value of Commonwealth printing executed by the New South Wales vernment Printing Office from ist January 31st October of the current year? 3. Is he aware that in many cases boys are being engaged doing men's work in the Government Printing Office, Sydney ? 4. Is he aware that a married man with a wife and two children and ten years' service is being paid 25s. per week, and another, thirty years of age with a large family and sixteen years' service, is in receipt of 35s. per week, and that in many instances wages are being paid which are not fair and reasonable? 5. Under such circumstances will the advisability of withholding any Commonwealth work from the Government Printing Office, Sydney, until the State Government ses that existing sweating is abolished?",16

No. I understand that boys are not enarbitration gaged doing men's work. 4. This is a question which it would not be proper for me to officially ask the State Minister to reply to. I , however, happen to know that there is a young man in the Government Printing Office, Sydney, who married very early, and whose promotion was delayed in consequence of.his inability to qualify himself. J. understand that he has now passed the necessary examination, and that he will receive promotion. I have no knowledge of any other case. 5. I have not ascertained that there is any "" sweating"" in the Government Printing Office, Sydney, nor do I believe that if exists. I do not consider that there is any necessity for action on the part of this Government. TARIFF : REBATES ON MACHINERY.",16
30,Mr JOHNSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"the Minister of a Trade and Customs, upon noticeReferring to his answer to paragraph 2 of question No. 1 of yesterday, regarding rebate duties on machinery used in the various processes of manufacture of fibrous materials for the production of hats1. Does the Minister realise that his reply discloses a serious defect in the method .of keeping the accounts of his Department as it appears that though duties are rebated to importers there appears to be no record of the amounts so remitted to individual importers, or even of the total amount of rebates? 2. Has the Auditor-General offered no comment on the loose system of bookkeeping which, from the reply, appears to prevail ? 3. What 'means, if any, are employed by the Department to trace rebates of duty in connection with different descriptions of imports?",16
31,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The answers to the honourable member's queswith tions are as follow : 1. It has already been explained to the honorGoable member that no rebates were given under to the 1902 Tariff. As this was the case it is evident that no record was possible. The goods free of duty in common with a great number of ' other goods, no occasion arose for any special record. None was required or necessary. 2 and 3. See reply to No. 1.

Does the British Government endorse the claim ? 3.

33,Mr DEAKIN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. Yes. I may add that when information to this eflect reached me on Tuesday last I asked His Excellency the Governor General to despatch a cable to the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the following effect :"" Ministers have received no information from Secretary of State, but learn that German Government make it condition of agreeing to arbitrate on Burns, Fhilp's claim that claims by Germany against Great Britain should be treated similarly. Ministers are unaware what German claims are referred to, but hope His Majesty's Government will not acquiesce in any course that will involve further delay."" TEMPORARY EMPLOYES, POSTAL DEPARTMENT.",17
34,Mr CARR,NEW SOUTH WALES,"for Mr Webster) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. How many temporary and casual hands have been employed in the Post and Telegraph Department in New South Wales during the present year up to date? 2. What is the total cost of this labour? 3. How many similar hands were employed during the financial years 1903-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, and what was the cost involved? 4. What amount Has been provided on the Estimates for temporary assistance for the current financial year? 5. What amount, in view of the present state of expenditure, is it estimated the employment of temporary and casual employment wil l amount to for 1907-8?",17
35,Mr MAUGER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"In reply to the honour and able member's questions, I have to state that inquiries are being made, and the deI movesired information will be furnished as early as practicable. OVERWORK, SYDNEY POST",17
36,Mr JH CATTS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Why are not telegraphists appointed, considering the alleged inadequate and overworked staff of the G.P.O., Sydney, and the numerous complaints by the public appearing in the columns of the daily press in New South Wales? 2. Is it a fact that officers of the General D i vision who qualified for positions of telegraphists over eighteen months ago are still kept at their present grade and salaries, notwithstanding the fact that they are, and have been, performing telegraphists work. If so, why are these officers not appointed, and their rightful increases allowed; them?",17
37,Mr MAUGER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The Public Service Commissioner has concurred in the creation of four new positions of .Telegraphist and has intimated that steps are being taken to make the appointments. 2. Inquiries are being made and the requited information will be furnished as early as possible. I may add that I have had a conference with the Public Service Commissioner this morning, and he is co-operating with"" me to as quickly as possible relieve the pressure in the New South Wales Post Office. TARIFF. In Committee of Ways and Means (Consideration resumed from 28th November, vide page 6810): Postponed item 181. Rails, Fish Plates, Fish Bolts, Tie Plates and Rods, Switches, Points, Crossings, and Intersections, for Railways and Tramways, ad val., I2£ per cent.",17
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.56] - My desire is to move that the duties on this item be 17 per cent, 1 and 12 per cent. The recommendation of 1 the A section of the Tariff Commission was that the duty should be 12 per cent., but 1 I desire to give a preference on this item, as the importations from foreign countries are much larger than from the United Kingdom. In 1906 the importations from the United Kingdom were represented by £134,848, out of a total of £340,435; and in the previous year by £132,522 out of a total of £340,535. This shows a large proportion as against Great Britain, I desire, by my amendment, to give a preference in favour of the Old Country. That the words "" and on and after 30th November, 1907, ad val., i / i per cent."" be added.",17
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,Surely there can OFFICE. be a preference without the amendment.,17
40,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Angas) [2.58] - I thought the Treasurer was rising to propose that the item should be made free, but, as a matter of fact, the amendment means a fairly substantial increase of duty on about two-thirds of the imports.",17
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Unde r the old Tariff the duties were 20 per cent, and 12 per cent. 1",17
42,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"We ought to improve as we go along. This is a tax on mining, an industry which is entitled to fair consideration, representing as it does about £32,000,000 per annum out of a total production of £125,000,00 0 per annum. Not only so, but this duty is a fairly stiff stax on the States Governments, who are, - of course, the largest importers and consumers of rails. This means a levy on the loan moneys, which, of course, come here - from England in the form of goods. * I remind the Committee that while we do not .acknowledge that the States Governments, under the Constitution^ are exempt from the payment of import duties, we take very great care that nothing imported by the Commonwealth shall be subject to any duty. Of course, this is a matter which affects the merits of the particular duty under consideration. I suggest that the Treasurer should allow rails to be admitted free.",17
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Certainl y not. - am practically reducing the duty which - was levied upon them under the old Tariff.,18
44,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The Treasurer wishes to increase the rate which he first proposed by 5 per cent., and this higher impost, according to his own figures, will affect two-thirds of the imports. I contend that the increased duty proposed will prove a very severe impost upon mines, and it will f all particularly heavy upon such semi public bodies as - the Adelaide Tramways Trust. The true policy would be to postpone the imposition of the duty, if one be desired, until we are assured that the local consumption, can be met by local .production. I understand that this is not the case at present, and is not likely to be for some vears to come. Mr. JOSEPH COOK { 3 . 3 ] - I think that we might shorten the debate upon this item very materially if the Treasurer would only be reasonable.",18
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,I ami very reasonable.,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The Treasurer proposes to increase the rate upon rails against the foreigner to 17 J per cent. I am quite agreeable to agree to the imposition of a duty of 15 per cent, under the General Tariff if he will reduce the rate against the United Kingdom to 10 per cent.",18
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Oh , no.",18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,The Treasurer must not forget that a bouity is also payable upon rails.,18
49,Mr WATKINS,NEW SOUTH WALES,There is no bounty upon the articles specified in this item.,18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,There is a bounty payable upon the raw product from which they are made?,18
51,Mr WATKINS,NEW SOUTH WALES,Yes .,18
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The Treasurer might very well agree to the compromise which I have suggested, and thus save time.",18
53,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Flinders) [3.5] As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, the fact should not be overlooked that it is proposed to grant a bounty upon the raw material from which the articles specified in this item are made until the iron industry has been sufficiently established. Perhaps the most important of these articles is rails, and it seems to me that they ought not to be subjected to a duty until the time arrives when the Government are satisfied that the iron industry has been established. I Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Wh v not.",18
54,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"the process of making rails, and especially steel rails, is one which will come last in the production of iron. To make steel rails, heavier and more expensive machinery is required than is necessary in connection with any other primary process of iron, production.",18
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I understand that, in connection with the contract into which Mr. Sandford has entered with the New South Wales Government, that gentleman intends to erect a mill for the manufacture of steel rails.",18
56,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I have no desire to mention Mr Sandford's name in this debate, but seeing that it has been introduced, I would point out that under the proposals of the Government he will (Parramatta) get the advantage of a bounty of 12s. per ton upon the pig iron that he produces.",18
57,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,Whic h amount will go to the State.,18
58,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,That is. the amount which will be paid upon the pig iron that he produces. But in addition he will get 12s. per ton for converting that pig iron into steel rails.,18
59,Mr WATKINS,NEW SOUTH WALES,No .,18
60,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"So far as the articles specified in this item are supplied to the New South Wales Government by Mr. Sandford, the bounty payable in respect of them will be paid - into the State Treasury.",18
61,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Unde r an arrangement between Mr Sandford and the State?,18
62,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,Yes .,18
63,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"But I am dealing with general principles, and I think it would be wise to discuss this matter without reference to any particular person. I desire to assist the Treasurer in disposing speedily of the remaining items in this division. All that he desires is that the manufacture of steel rails shall be established in Australia. We all desire that, and nobody wishes it more strongly than I do. But the way in which the Government propose to encourage the industry is by offering a substantial bounty upon the production of iron until it has been established, and subsequently by extending to it a substantial protective duty. I think that the same line of reasoning is applicable to a good many things other than steel rails, but I confine my remarks to rails because they seem to me of most importance. It has been pointed out that it may be decided that State imports, under this heading, are not subject to duty. If that view should be upheld it is apparent that the duties which we impose upon steel rails wil I be a considerable tax upon those who have contracted to construct private railways and tramways, and that at a time when admittedly the industry is not capable of manufacturing them. As soon as the Ministry are prepared to come to the House and say, "" Mr. Sandford is in a position to manufacture these rails and the industry has been established; let us extend to him a protective duty,"" I shall be prepared to support their proposal. But until then I think it would be a serious thing to impose this duty on rails. It will be a purely revenue duty for the time being, and will probably be collected only upon the small quantity of rails which is imported by private enterprise. I ask the Treasurer .to consider whether it would not be wise at this stage to omit the word "" r a i l s "" from this item with a view to its insertion in division VIB .",18
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,No ; I postpone that division until after the Manufactures Encouragement Bil l been dealt with.,19
65,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If the measure in question be not passed the Treasurer will still be in a position to recommit the item for the purpose of re-inserting rails, and I shall be found supporting him.",19
66,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.10] - I wish to emphasize the exact position in regard to this matter. The articles here mentioned which are annually imported into the Commonwealth are valued at £ 3 4 0 , 0 0 0 . Of this amount £ 9 5 , 9 3 9 worth comes from Belgium; German > ' > £ 3 > 5 7 5 ; Netherlands, 6 £255; and the United States, £ 7 5 , 1 4 5 , or in all £ 2 0 7 , 9 1 3 , out of a total of £344>435The British imports were valued at £i32»5 - 2 2",19
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,Can the honourable gentleman distinguish between the items?,19
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No , because all the importations come under the same heading. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable gentleman has not separate figures for the importations of rails?",19
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No ; I wanted to get those figures, but they could not be supplied to me by the Department. I do not wish to detain the Committee. Whatever is going to be done, I ask honourable members to come to a vote. The States get back three-fourths of the duty paid upon their importation of these items.",19
70,Mr TILLEY BROWN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Yes ; but the money for the Customs duty comes out of Loan Account, and the three-fourths share is paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.",19
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"That is a matter for the consideration of, not the Commonwealth Government, but the States. If a certain sum is raised from the importation of these articles, the States get back three-fourths of the money paid in Customs duty.",19
72,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NEW SOUTH WALES,At least that proportion.,19
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Yes .,19
74,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Practically , they get back the whole of the duty.",19
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No ;_ but in the past the States have been paid back a great deal more than three-fourths of the Customs duty. Therefore, they cannot, or should not, complain. Mr W. H. IRVIN E - The difficulty intend to arises, not with regard to State imports but with regard to imports by corporations or has private persons.",19
76,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES,The Adelaide Tramway Trust does not get back a penny of the duty.,19
77,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No . I do not think that either the Adelaide Tramway Trust, the Melbourne Tramway Trust, or any private corporation should get back anything.",19
78,Mr GLYNN,NEW SOUTH WALES,The Adelaide Tramway Trust is a public body.,19
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Unde r the old Tariff, the duties on these items were 12J and 20 per cent.",19
80,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Onl y worth of"" imports were liable to the 20 per cent. duty.",20
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I quite admit that the 20 per cent, duty was imposed on only tie rods. In order to save time, if honourable members are agreeable, I am prepared to take duties of 15 and 1 2 per cent, respectively. I will not go below 15 per cent., and I am prepared to take that rate in order to get rid of the item without further discussion.",20
82,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The honourable, gentleman will have to come down.",20
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am not going to come down below that rate. until tomorrow morning to get to a division I shall not give way. What I want to do is to get rid of this item, if possible, in order to enable those honourable members who wish to go away to-night to catch the trains. I have informed the deputy leader of the Opposition that if he will mention two or three items which they wisH to have dealt with before they go away, I will take those items out of their turn so that those items which are not contentious in any way may be dealt with afterwards, if necessary. I am willing to do that with a view to conveniencing honourable members, and enabling them to get away by the trains if they wish to go to-night.",20
84,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"South Sydney) [3.15]. - I suggest to the Treasurer that rails generally will be the subject of consideration under Division VIA . , and under the bounty provisions. And with regard to the larger form of rail, which is used by railway companies, as well as by State Governments, it does seem to me that we are giving unnecessary assistance if we impose a duty under this division, and then give a bounty under another proposal which the Government have in hand.",20
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,"In any case, as a matter of classification, it should go with the other iron items.",20
86,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"To my regret the House has agreed to the bounty provision. I think it is unwise to propose so much bounty, and so much duty, at the same time. I suggest either that rails should be eliminated, or that the duties should be confined tb the smaller description of rails.",20
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"No ; let us-go to a division, if I must be beaten on it .",20
88,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I hold that the inclusion of the larger classes of rail-and there is a distinction to be drawn-is a distinct ,£20,000 going back upon the policv which the honourable gentleman indicated only a short time ago, namely, that the duty should f o llow the bounty.",20
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,I did not say that.,20
90,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,It was announced in regard to the Manufactures Encouragement 1 Bill.,20
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am going to propose an additional duty, and when I get to that Bill , the bounty, too.",20
92,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The honourable gentleman is not going to get this item put through without a' little delay, because he If it takes himself announced that there would be no bounty and duty running concurrently. I do not see why steel rails should be the subject of a duty and a bounty concurrently. . ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have never said anything of the sort.",20
93,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,I am afraid that the honourable member for South Sydney has voted for it .,20
94,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Certainl y not, knowingly. I do not remember an instance of that kind. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Yes . We pointed it out on several occasions, but the vote was carried against us ",20
95,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I must have missed the eloquence of the honourable member. I do not remember any such incident. Therefore I must have been out of the chamber at the time. What I want to do is to limit the weight of the rail on which duty is to be charged. That will achieve practically the same object. A large number of small iron rails are now manufactured locally, and I do not see why they should not receive some degree of protection.",20
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,Why cannot the item of rails be postponed?,20
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,I am not going to postpone a single item. They have to be either reduced or dealt with otherwise.,20
98,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,Why not fix the duties at 15 and i 2 per cent. ?L,20
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,No ; that is going below the duties in the old Tariff.,20
100,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,I think the Government ought to try to draw a distinction between the light rail which is at present manufactured and the heavier rail which will be the subject of a bounty in the near future if their own proposals are carried out. Why they should now propose to give a duty plus a bounty I cannot understand.,20
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,For the simple reason that the manufacturers will not get the bounty until a certain time.,21
102,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,Surely the honourable member must recollect that he promised the House that there would not be a duty and a bounty running together. Sir WILLIAML . YNE - I beg the honourable member's pardon; I have never said anything of the kind.,21

109,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Whether steel made from Australian pig iron takes the shape of rails or blooms, it is to be given an encouragement",21
110,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,It does not matter what form the steel takes; there is a double bounty.,21
111,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I fear that not one of us is sufficiently expert to be able to say what the proper difference in value should be, so far as the bounty is concerned, between pig iron and steel. I do not know. But I do object to steel rails getting a bounty and a protective duty at one and the same time. Sir WILLIAM LYNE:-Why did the honourable member come to ime and advocate duties of is per cent, and 7& per cent.?",21

125,Mr ARCHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It is, I think, very necessary to grant a preference to rails; that are made in the United Kingdom.",21
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Honourable members opposite do not want any preference,21
127,Mr ARCHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"They do, I think, want to grant a preference on account of steel rails. I should like to read to the Committee the following statement bearingupon the matter of the importation of steel rails, fish plates, bolts and nuts, and dog spikes. Supplies for Australia come principally from America and Germany in addition to those Great Britain. Preference should undoubtedly be given in favour of British goods for these reasons. Supplies come through the resident presentative m Sydney of the United States ment. Steel Trust, the biggest trust in the world. If business in American rails is to be allowed, then let the business be done through Australian chants, who are now completely shut reason of the presence of this trust in the country. During the last two or three years a war of freights between America and Australia has resulted in supplies coming from America at as low a freight as 7s. 6d. per ton as against 25s. to 30s. per ton from England. Almost the same remarks apply as to Germany, with this difference that the lpwer wages in Germany, should not be lost sight of. Australian politicians claim as the basic reason of protection against British-made goods that the highly paid Australian workman must be protected against the lower paid British workman. This principle, therefore, should be carried out to . a logical conclusion by a preference or protection for the British steam-ship owners against the heavily-subsidized German steamers, and for the higher price of labour in the United Kingdom than in Germany. In New Zealand a preference of 20 per cent, is given in favour of British rails. Previous to that being given, the, rails imported into New Zealand came almost entirely from Germany and the United States. Since then they have come from Great Britain,. I would ask the honourable member for South Sydney, in particular, to support a preference to Great Britain, as otherwise it seems to be a foregone conclusion that a great proportion of the rails will come from Germany and America.",21
128,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,I am quite agreeable to give some preference to Great Britain.,22
129,Mr ARCHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"There is another matter which I should like to mention in connection with the item. I desire to ask Mr Chairman, whether I should be in order in moving an amendment now, or and i 2 per cent. later on. in connection with steel sleepers imported as tramway material. At the present time steel sleepers are separated the rest of tramway material. They in as metals n.e.i. I propose to move amendment so as to make steel sleepers come in on. the same basis as steel rails other tramvvav material. Suppose, for in stance, that I wanted to let a tramway in a mine. It would be very awkward if the sleepers came in under heading of the Tariff and the rails and rest of the equipment under another headof ing. I understand from the departmental officers that they have no objection whatever to what I propose, if the Minister is agreeable.",22
130,The CHAIRMAN,NEW SOUTH WALES,Does the honourable from member desire to move a separate item?,22
131,Mr ARCHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,No . I think what I redesire can be obtained by way of an amend,22

135,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Robertson) [3-3°]--It seems to me that this will be a severe impost upon private tramways and railways whether for public convenience or for mining purposes. It is only in such cases that it will actually be felt. If we remove steel rails from the item we shall have left materials used largely by the States Governments, who will have returned to them a very large proportion of the revenue collected in respect of the duty. In this way local manufacturers will be disadvantaged rather than benefited, inasmuch as the States Governments in calling for tenders for the supply of material of this k in d - w i ll take into consideration the fact that if they accept a foreign tender they will secure a good deal of revenue from the duty. I do not think that the item is worth the time that the Treasurer has devoted to it. If he is prepared to agree to duties of 15 per cent and 10 per cent. I shall have nothing more to say.",22

The Treasurer has shown that two-thirds of the imports do not come from and the United Kingdom, and if he will agree - to duties of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. I a contract for shall be satisfied.",22
138,Mr FRAZER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Kalgoorlie) [3.34] - It one appears to me that since steel rails have not the yet been made in Australia, the only effect the duty, if the item be passed in the form proposed by the Treasurer, will be to raise revenue. There is, of course, the further consideration that steel rails may be made in a New South Wales foundry.",22
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,There is no doubt about that.,23
140,Mr FRAZER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am prepared to give the iron industry to which this item relates very considerable protection by way of bounties; but I am not prepared to penalize other industries-and particularly railway and tramway construction schemes for the development of the Commonwealth-by imposing a duty. I shall vote for the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , but not for a duty to operate concurrently with the bounty, and I think that the proposal submitted by the honourable member for South Sydney to insert after "" r a i l s "" the words ""except steel """,23

Sydney) [3.36] - The honourable member for South Sydney said that he objects to a duty being imposed on this item, because we have already agreed to the second reading of the Manufactures Encouragment Bill , under which a bounty is to be given on the production of iron and steel. In reply to that contention I would point out that under another measure we have granted bounties on the production of coffee, tobacco, tobacco leaf, fish, dried fruits, and other things, and that in spite of the representations of some honourable members of the Opposition duties have been imposed upon those commodities. The honourable member for South Sydney himself voted for some of those duties which, in proportion to the value of the goods to which they relate, are much heavier than are these. I have never objected unless on the grounds-of fair play to vote against protective duties affecting industries in even my own State, but many other honourable members have invariably voted for high duties on goods and have done so regardless of whether or not they were the subject of bounty. I have said on several occasions that, in the absence of good reasons to the contrary, I would accept the old duties, and I have not endeavoured to reduce them. I have recognised that where an industry has risen with that assistance, and has since been working under the old duties it would be to some degree unjust to those engaged in it if the duties were so soon removed. Whilst, personally, I should be quite will ing under ordinary circumstances to agree to rails being admitted free, I am faced with the situation that just as the iron industry, which has been working under 'great difficulties, is about to produce steel rails, it is proposed, by the very .honourable members who have supported much higher duties on imports affecting other industries, - that it shall be treated differently from every other industry. I am not inclined to f all into that trap, more particularly as we have accepted as a compromise much higher duties on other iron manufactures than are those now under consideration. This particular article is produced in one State, and apparently a different treatment is to be given to it than is meted out to industries in another State. I do not think that is right. I agree with the position taken up by the honourable member for South Sydney, that where a bounty has been given there should not If the honourable member had carried out that principle his position would be perfectly sound. But he has not done so. He has voted for duties on articles in connection with which we are not merely considering, but have actually passed a measure granting bounties. I am quite willing that there should be an adjustment providing for the imposition of duties of 15 per cent, under the general Tariff and 10 per cent, on imports from the United Kingdom. That would represent an average of 12^ per cent. , which was the duty imposed under the old Tariff.",23
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I should prefer to take 1 2 per cent, all round. 1",23
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Will the Treasurer take i 2 | per cent, all round?",23
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Yes , I will .",23
150,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am prepared to accept that-12 per cent, was the duty under the 1 old Tariff, .and would leave things as they were.",24
151,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I shall not object to that. I am quite willing to fal l in with the views of honourable members if they agree to revert to the duty under the old Tariff, but I certainly do object on the grounds of fairness to'the other proposals that vvere made.",24
152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.42] - I think that this is an item in connection with which a preference should be provided. I have submitted the item, and we have had a proposition to leave out rails, which I absolutely object to. Then a proposal was made to make the duty 10 per cent., which would be lower than the recommendation of the Tariff Commission and lower than the old duty. cumstances I would very much rather agree to a duty of 12J per cent, all round, which is the duty that was imposed under the old Tariff. If honourable members are prepared to accept that I shall not press the Government proposal any longer. I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I should like to know at once whether a majority of honourable members are inclined to-accept the 'suggestion that the duty should be 12 per cent, all round and let the matter droo.",24
153,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Fremantle) [3-431-There is some misapprehension as to what is included in this item. Some honourable members appear to think that steel rails are not included. I remind the Committee of the importance of steel rails to Australia. We have in the whole of the Commonwealth less than 15,000 miles of railway. In Victoria alone there are 3,342 miles of railway, and if the mileage laid down' in the other States were in proportion we should have in Australia ii3,ooomiles of railway. all very well for Victorian members to propose to tax steel rails which have to be laid in the other States.",24
154,Sir JOHN QUICK,NEW SOUTH WALES,Why say Victorian members ?,24
155,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,Because they go in for taxing everything.,24
156,Sir JOHN QUICK,NEW SOUTH WALES,In this instance we wish to assist a New South Wales industry.,24
157,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,As compared with the other States Victoria is covered by a network of railways.,24
158,Mr STORRER,NEW SOUTH WALES,The people of the State have paid for them.,24
159,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"But they have paid no duty to Western Australia to be allowed to lay them. We are being asked under this item to contribute to the revenue of the Commonwealth before we can lay a mile of railway. We can only afford in Western Australia to build railways out of loan money, and honourable members would appear not to mind our borrowing money and handing it over to the Commonwealth to spend on the richest States, which last year had huge surpluses of revenue. Queensland has 3,114 miles of railway; Western Australia, with an area one-third larger than Queensland, has only 2,312 miles, including 700 miles of private lines. New Zealand has 2,520 miles of railways, and the United States, with an area considerably less than that of Australia, has 217,000 miles of railways. We have heard a good deal of talk in this House about the necessity of opening up the country, but taxing the construction of railways is In the cir- not likely to bring that about. People have been walking about Australia long enough, while the members of various Parliaments have been talking about what they were going to do to open up the interior. We have an opportunity here to do .something practical by allowing steel rails to be imported free. We cannot open up a country with cheap whisky, yet 2s. a gallon has been taken off whisky 1 in Western Australia, whilst a proposal is made to increase the duty on steel rails. If I wished to prevent the opening up of a country, I would give people cheap whisky, ancl I guarantee, many would not get far into the interior. They would be kept down near the coast. The policy .of the present Government would appear to be dear rails and cheap whisky. There is no sense in it. If . we. could make steel rails in Australia. I would say that we ought to do so. I should be prepared to vote for the highest bounty necessary to It is secure the' manufacture of rails in Australia, but I am not prepared to vote for a high duty on rails when they are not made here. In Western Australia the Government are borrowing .money to build railways, whilst the Commonwealth Government are retaining 25 per cent, of the duties collected from Customs and Excise.",24
160,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NEW SOUTH WALES,What are they doing with that 25 per cent. ? It goes back to the States.,24
161,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"They are playing with it, or are spending it in the richest States. Let me tell the honourable member that in Western Australia last year we built between 400 and 500 miles of railways, and this year money has been voted for nearly 400 miles of railway construction.",24
162,Mr HENRY WILLIS,NEW SOUTH WALES,The honourable member forgets that Western Australia batik the money that he says is retained the Commonwealth.,25
163,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,Is it our own before today. we get it back? Id is borrowed money . In Australia we have only two-thirds there ? of the railway mileage that has been constructed in Canada. Is it wonder that we so often hear so much the prosperity of Canada when we learn that the railway mileage constructed in Dominion is one-third more than we can country without rails. claim for Australia?,25
164,Mr SAMPSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,Australi a is twice as progressive as Canada.,25
165,Mr HEDGES,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am speaking of the number of miles of railways constructed the two countries. Natal is but a little country, comprising not more than onethat eightieth of the area of Australia. Yet, proportion, Natal has eighteen times our length of railways per square mile. The area of Australia is ten times that of Cape Colony, and yet that country ' has in proportion four times our length railways. Japan, a country that we have to fear in the future, is another instance. If we had railways in the same proportion as Japan has, we should have a million miles of them. Japan on an area of 13,000 square miles has 5,000 miles railway.",25
166,Mr FOSTER,NEW SOUTH WALES,Do they import the rails we cancarriage. or make them there?,25

The States of America have 20,000,000 rails. tons of rails laid down more we have. They have paid no tax rails in Australia. or duty on them to any other country. sensible. Let us make the rails here. I will help the Government to give a bounty to enanother courage their manufacture, but I shall vote for a duty on them. We must open up Australia, and must have .rails to do it. Look at the huge Northern Territory, and the immense areas of land between here and there. Those honourable members who paid a visit to the Territory recently went by water. Think of the senselessness people who, instead of laying rails to open to do it in this instance. up a country, travel round the edge of by sea. Within the last six weeks, train loads of cattle which had come down from the Cooper Creek country. They had been brought vid Oodnadatta to Adelaide, and then across to Melbourne to feed the gets Melbourne people. Why should we not by have rails laid to those splendid areas of country? There is not a rail laid there - Mr EDWARDS - Are there any people",25

They could not possibly live in that In the interests of settlement, people should be given facilities for 'travelling about the country, and for sending their produce to market. They must have rails for those in purposes. This country is a finer one than people recognise. There is not a railway has ever been built in Australia but in has developed country which has turned out a credit to the people who authorized the building of the line. I know of many railways which it was said would ruin the State when they were built, and yet every of one of them has helped hundreds and"" thousands of people to settle on the land, and so turn the interior of Australia to proper use. In America, where there are so many fine rivers, the water is used for irrigating, and rails are laid alongside the rivers to of carry the produce. The policy of America from the start has been cheap rails and cheap We must recognise that hold Australia only by developing it with railways. We shall never hold it against, the great Eastern powers if we are to tax railway construction. It is disgraceful for any man who pretends to for the benefit of Australia to United vote for one penny of duty on steel We should do our best to devise than some means by which we can make That would be But we must within the next twenty years lay in Australia at least 15,000 or 20,000 miles of rails.

Taking the House as a whole, there is practically no out-and-out fiscal conscience at all. Meimbers are going for what happens to suit them on every individual item, which, of course, I do not disagree with.",25

173,Mr JH CATTS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If the honourable member for Bass thinks that it is consistent for a free-trader to support a duty as well as a bounty on an article that cannot be made in Australia, he has a peculiar idea of consistency.

174,Mr IRAZER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Kalgoorlie) [3.58] It is all very well to cry "" divide,"" but when I previously spoke, I thought that there, was going to be an almost unanimous vote to place steel rails on the free list. I am afraid that developments have occurred which seem to indicate the .possibility that that will not be done. I cannot understand the attitude of the Committee in being prepared to vote for a revenue or protective duty upon a commodity, of which the Minister himself admits that not a single pound has been produced in Australia yet, especially when we are assured that there is to be a bounty to encourage its manufacture. I am prepared to support that bounty, but, apparently, a number of honourable members are ready to sneak a duty on to the article in addition.",26
175,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,The bounty and duty should not be concurrent.,26
176,Mr FRAZER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"They should not be. We committed ourselves the other night to a proposal for a bounty. Now it is proposed that one of the commodities, which is to be the subject of a bounty, shall receive additional consideration.",26
177,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"We are all opposed to "" double banking "" ; and is not the question now whether, before steel rails are actually made, there should be a revenue duty on imported rails, or whether there should be a bounty when they are manu-. factured with no duty in the meantime?",26
178,Mr FRAZER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I unhesitatingly accept the latter alternative. There ought to be no revenue duties which tend to discourage the opening up of the country, especially in view of the fact, in the present instance, that no one suggests that steel rails are made within Australia.",26

180,Mr FRAZER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The honourable member has been with me in many divisions, and if his conscience is clear we may take it that my conscience is clear also. I have certainly not intentionally voted for a duty when we are paying a bounty. We ought to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney, and make rails subject to duty by proclamation, so as not to penalize users of rails that are not made in Australia. It is unaccountable to me how a duty of 12J per cent, was ever imposed; and I take the view that having Di- perpetrated a blunder, we ought not to perpetuate it.",26

In discussing this question, I am bound to mention Mr Sandford,- since he owns the only large iron-works in Australia; and I point out, that now he is about to manufacture steel rails, it is suggested that he should be deprived of the benefit of this Tevenue duty of 1 2 per cent. I understand that the £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 he received from the New South Wales Government was ,to enable him to erect mills for the special ' purpose of making rails. rolled steel rails at Eskbank nearly twenty years ago for the State Government. I may explain.. however, simply rolled old rails had been cut up ancl melted; in other words, he made steel rails from scrap. That work was put an end to when Mr Eddy became railway commissioner in New South Wales. That gentleman at once introduced larger engines, which, instead of 60-lb. rails, which Mr. Sandford used to roll-, required 85-lb. rails. Mr Sandford, I may say, was given compensation by the State Government for the termination of his contract. To Mr Sandford I owe nothing, for he has been a bitter opponent of mine all my"" political l if e ; but, in justice, I must recognise that he has made a brave fight for this industry.",27
192,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If Mr Sandford is paid a bounty in the meantime, he will have the benefit of at least 20 per cent, instead of 1 2 per cent. 1",27
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Mr Sandford told the Tariff Commission that he did not desire a bounty, and he gave the reason. He had to give an undertaking to the State Government, under the arrangement I have mentioned, that any bounty must be handed over to the ' Government; and, under the - circumstances, he naturally prefers a small duty of 1 2 per cent. 1 Sir JOHN FORREST.)-That is because Mr Sandford made a bad bargain with the State Government. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Mr Sandford made a bargain which has resulted in the erection of the first blast furnace in Australia. I am inclined to think, however, that it was not a good bargain for himself; and, if that be the case, there is no reason why we should further penalize him.",27
194,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Penaliz e him? We are proposing to give him the benefit of what is tantamount to 20 per cent. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am referring to that provision in his agreement. I opposed the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , because, as I said before, I prefer a small duty to a bonus.",27
195,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Hav e we to discuss the Tariff on the assumption that that Bill is to pass, or on the assumption that it is not to pass? 1 Mr. JOSEPH COOK.^-There seems a desire to discuss the Tariff on the assumption that Mr Sandford will receive a bounty on steel rails. Mr Sandford Mr WH IRVINE ---That is because the House has sanctioned a bounty. Mr JOSE PH COOKj.!-Not at all ; that he the House has approved of the principle after they' of a bounty, but the details have yet to be agreed upon.",27
196,Mr WH IRVINE,NEW SOUTH WALES,If the bounty is cut down I shall be with the honourable member.,27
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,That result is very likely to be arrived at when the matter is thoroughly discussed in Committee.,27
198,Sir JOHN QUICK,NEW SOUTH WALES,We may limit the bounty to the production of steel ingots.,27
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Yes . We have merely approved the. broad principle of granting a bounty upon the production of iron, and it does not follow that we shall extend that bounty to the manufacture of steel rails. Therefore we shall be doing a fair thing if we continue to Mr. Sandford the duty which has been operative for six years past, but of which he has not been able to take advantage until this moment.",27
200,Mr KING OMALLEY,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Let us fight to course, knock out the bounty.",28
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,I shall certainly oppose it. Meantime we ought to continue this small duty upon steel rails.,28
202,Mr STORRER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Bass) [4.12] under the impression that the debate upon this item would not occupy more few minutes, and why so much heat has been imported into it, I cannot understand. For the past six years a duty of 12 per cent, has been, levied upon iron, and have also determined that it is necessary to grant a bounty upon the production of that commodity in order to encourage establishment of the iron industry. it is now proposed that the duty shall remitted. It is like giving a man a with one hand and taking 25s. away from yond him with the other. If we wish the industry to prosper we ought not to abolish the duty upon rails. I trust that the rate will be retained.",28
203,Mr KNOX,NEW SOUTH WALES,Kooyong) [4.13] - The Committee is apparently cf opinion that is of the first importance that the iron inengaged in railway enterprise. dustry should be established in the other Commonwealth. But notwithstanding that the Manufactures . Encouragement has passed its second reading it has a perilous time in front of it . think it is dawning upon the minds of several honourable members that if we decourse. sire to assist the establishment of the industry we ought to view this question from the stand-point of whether or not the operation of a duty will have that effect. I think that the policy of the Labour Party will be to prevent the Manufactures Encouragement Bil.l from passing.,28
204,Mr FRAZER,NEW SOUTH WALES,I do not know why honourable member should say that.,28
205,Mr KNOX,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I think that a majority - of the party are opposed to the Bill . sonally, I favour the imposition of a sonable duty upon rails, altogether apart claim the bounty. from the fact that, we have already committed ourselves to the general principle embodied in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , the passing of which is, however, exceedingly doubtful. I am satisfied that honourable members do not desire that a bounty and a protective duty shall be simultaneously operative. Sir JOHN "" FORREST (Swan) [4-18]-If we wish to develop the iron industry in the Commonwealth, we should develop it in the way the House has agreed to, namely, by means of a bounty. We ought in this matter to adopt a straightforward and ought not to consider the fact that Mr Sandford has concluded, an arrangement with the New South Wales Government under which any bounty that he may receive will be paid - I was into the State Treasury.",28
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NEW SOUTH WALES,I think that we than a ought to consider that.,28
207,Sir JOHNFORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I cannot see why we should retard the progress of Australia by placing a duty upon an article 1 we which is absolutely necessary to its development. Steel rails are not made here,, and we desire to encourage their production the by the granting of a bounty. Why we Yet should be asked to tax all the States Gobe vernments and others by imposing a pound revenue duty upon steel rails is bemy comprehension. The time iron has arrived when we should endeavour to establish the industry in a straightold forward way, namely, by means of the granting of a bounty. If we adopt that course, we shall not injure any of the it States, or any of those persons who are On the hand, if we levy a tax upon rails, we shall inevitably retard the progress of the Bill whole Commonwealth.",28
208,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Dalley) [4.20] - The honI orable member for Swan has said that there is nothing like a straightforward I also believe in a straightforiron ward course, and I voted for a bounty as the least objectionable method of assisting to develop the iron industry of Australia. I have voted for a bounty system which will apply not only to Mr Sandford, but to any other maker of iron who may put in a claim. It was not passed in the the interests of Mr Sandford only, but in the interests of Australian manufacturers, and it extends to the production of steel rails. PerI t may be that a friend of the right honorreaable gentleman in Western Australia willI certainly agree with the right honourable gentleman that the imposition of a revenue duty on an article when we are unable to produce it is not only absurd, but also a tax upon the community generally. The chief users of steel rails in Australia are the States Governments. They practically use the bulk of the imported rails in the construction of railways, which are designed for the development of their territories. If we impose a duty of a revenue character, we shall get no compensating advantage in the way of assisting the iron industry, but we shall compel every person in each State to carry a burden which will tend to retard the process of developing its resources. Because, after all, there is a limit to the borrowing capacity of each State, and to the amount which it can afford to expend on railway construction. Every tax of a needless character which we impose is a tax upon the States. The honourable member for Swan prefaced his remarks with the statement that he likes a straightforward policy. So do I . I am sorry that the right honourable gentleman was a member of the Ministry which imposed a duty of 12^ per cent, on steel rails in the old Tariff. That duty, which is certainly not consistent with a straightforward policy, was imposed upon Australia by the Barton Administration, in which the right honourable gentleman took a prominent part. Sir JOHN FoRREST -^That seems to be about the only argument which the honorprepared able gentleman, can use.",28
209,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I remind the downy member for Swan-becaus e the swan has more down than has any other bird that I know of-that the Government of which he was a prominent member wanted to impose a duty of 15 per cent. Now, in the name of the sacred frog, if , as the honourable tleman states, a duty of 12J per cent, is a severe impost upon the users of iron, what would be a duty of 15 per cent. ?",29
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,That is a very poor argument.,29
211,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I admit that it is a very poor argument; but what a poor illustration of a straightforward course it is ! The right honourable gentleman has referred to the conduct of the honourable member for Parramatta. But the former is a protectionist or a free-trader when it suits .him. On this particular item he and I happen to be in accord, but I am sorry that his straightforward policy was not initiated five years ago, when this item was under consideration..",29
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,The honourable member should not destroy his friends.,29
213,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,I do not know who are my friends. The party of which I am a prominent member has no friends.,29
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The honourable member has one friend, any way.",29
215,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I may tell the right honourable gentleman that the party in which I am a prominent member is very solid.. Every morning we have our caucus in the train, and the great trouble is that invariably the party make me their spokesman ; but we do not quarrel either here or outside. I think that the straightforward policy to which the right honourable gentleman has professed to be so much attached is rather belated. I wish that it had been practised in the time of the Barton Administration.",29
216,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,The honourable member has changed his views since then.,29
217,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"They are not the only things changed. The right honourable gentleman - has changed his supporters, since then. I remember the time when he was very much attached to the Labour Partv. but he will not have their support now. I suggest to the Treasurer that if he is prepared to accept a'duty of i 2 ^ per cent., as I am told he is, he may as well climb down to the dead level. If he is to accept a duty of 1 2 per cent, 1 he cannot justify it as a protectionist duty.",29
218,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,It is not in the true sense.,29
219,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,Then what the deuce is; it'?,29
220,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I wanted to get duties of 17J per cent.', and 1.2J per cent., eenand it was only to settle the matter that I said that I was prepared to take the lower duties. I thought that I had made a. liberal arrangement which would begenerally accepted and stop further debate, but it seems that the disease of talking is. spreading.",29
221,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am opposed to a bounty and a duty. On general principles, I oppose an import duty on iron; it is a tax. upon the users. We should not levy a revenue duty; in thiscase, as in others, it can be of no assistance to the local industry. I hope that the bounty will beeffective for the purpose which we intend. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North. Sydney) [4.25] - I rise to say a few words in reply to a remark by the honourable member for' Swan. Another honourable membermade a somewhat similar statement, but L decline to take any notice of it from him-. The right honourable gentleman said that some honourable members who have been free-traders all their lives were voting for protection in this instance. May I tell the honourable member that throughout this Tariff I have been voting for what I call protective duties simply because we could not get anything else.",29
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,That is not so in this case.,30
223,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I recognised that those who were induced to start industries under the old duties had some claim for the continuance of those duties, at any rate for a time. I have often voted what I call protectionist duties, partly because, in some'cases, I could not get lessthat is where I did not think that there was any claim-and partly because in other cases 1 thought that there was a just claim owing to the. encouragement which had been deliberately given by our policy. Throughout the Tariff I have been acting on that principle, and with regard to industries everywhere. I have opposed, and shall continue to oppose, a bounty upon the production of iron. The bounty would give assistance to the makers of ' some articles which are now free. Although those articles are duty free, yet I shall oppose the bounty, and give no assistance which has not been already, given.",30
224,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,I would vote this duty cheerfully if there were to be no bounties.,30
225,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"There should be no duplication. If a bountv is carried, then the duty ought to be remitted, or we should put in a provision that it shall be deducted from the bounty - When I am asked to vote differently in the case of this industry, and to give no recognition to a duty which has been in existence, I am asked to do an injustice which I have not attempted to do in the case of other manufacturers. I do not think that I am inconsistent in the least degree. I believe that, as a rule, honourable members know how I intend to vote on a Tariff question before I have voted. Therefore I think that the honourable, member for Swan is quite wrong in his statement. I shall not reproach him with having supported the imposition of a higher duty when he was a member of the Barton Government.",30
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,Do not do that.,30
227,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,I do not intend to.,30
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"My statement was only used by me as an argument, and I do not want to press it .",30
229,Mr WATSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It should be remembered that we are producing a number of the articles which are to be the subject of a bounty, but not steel rails.",30
230,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I admit that. I do not wish to see a duty and a bounty, because that is going beyond either what is necessary or desirable.",30
231,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Does the honourable member think that a duty on steel rails is justifiable under any conditions-in the present state of this country? "" Mr DUGALD THOMSON - What a question for the right honourable member to ask me. Can he be thinking? He has been voting duty after duty on articles which affect construction in this country far more than do rails.",30
232,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,When and where?,30
233,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Le t the honourable member consider the votes that he has given for duties on cement, other machinery, and iron work, and many other items.",30
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"We make them in the country, but we do not make any of these rails.",30
235,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The rails are proposed to be made here, whilst many of the things for duties on which the honourable member voted are not made in Australia.",30
236,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,I should like to know which.,30
237,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,NEW SOUTH WALES,The claim made on their behalf was that they would be made in Australia if we imposed a duty.,30
238,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,What is the honourable member referring to?,30
239,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,All through the Tariff that has been the case. Then the right honourable member speaks of steel rails as if they were all important.,30
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,They are more important than nine-tenths of the other items in the Tariff.,30
241,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Conside r the return of duty paid as shown in the figures supplied to us. I could, if need be, point to items that we have already curried affecting the developmental policv of the country infinitely more than this duty does.",30
242,Mr SAMPSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Wimmera) [4.32] - I intend to vote for the continuance of the old duty. Under the proposal accepted by the Treasurer there will be no change. I cannot understand why it is that some Bowden, E. K . protectionists intend to vote to wipe out Brown, Tilley the duty on steel rails. A great deal has 'Chapman, Austin been said about the granting of the bounty. Cook, Presuming that the Manufactures EnCrouch, couragement Bill gets into Committee, and Edwards, R becomes law, it will merely involve the Foster, F. J. payment of the bounty on the production Knox, W. of pig iron, and steel made from it. But Livingston, what about the manufacture of rails from Maloney, W. R. N . the raw material ? Surely the manufacMathews, J. ture of steel rails from the simple steelMauger, S. is in itself an industry as much entitled to a duty as any other commodity included in the Tariff. So far as the amount of the bounty proposed to be paid is concerned, I must say that I am not Atkinson, very much impressed by its value. The Hughes, W. M . amount proposed to be paid is very small Glynn, P. MCM. if we really desire to establish a great inFowler, J. M . dustry. The probability is that Mr SandReid, ford under present conditions will be able Liddell, F. to obtain the whole bounty paid. The capaMCWilliams, W. J. city of his blast furnaces enables him to turn out about 50,000 tons per annum, and Willis, his resources in reference to the two proWilson, HenryJ. G. cesses through which steel has to go, Poynton, A. would enable him to obtain the whole amount. Even if he were to do that, however, he would be able to produce only about one-eighth or one-tenth of the total requirements of Australia. So that the bounty proposed to be granted for the development of the iron industry is a mere I moveinfinitesimal proportion. I shall vote for the continuance of the duty of cent, on steel rails, because I consider that it is a branch of industry the claims of which for a measure of protection as' great as are those of any other item heading. in the Tariff.

270,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I said that I would have it altered, and I will see that that is carried out.",33
271,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,We do not know how far the effects of this new proposal may extend. It may upset a whole industry.,34
272,Mr HARPER,NEW SOUTH WALES,Mak e it 15 per cent.,34
273,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I will raise no objection, if the Treasurer will agree to a duty of 15 per cent, in the second column.",34
274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I will agree to that. 1 will make the rates 20 per cent, in the general Tariff, and 15 per cent, against the United Kingdom. Proposed new item amended accordingly, and agreed to. Postponed item 194. Bolts, Carriage (§ inch and under in diameter and 4 inches under in length), ad val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United Kingdom), free.",34
275,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.6] - This item was postponed by me at the request of the honourable member for Boothby. who said that he desired to wealth. make further inquiry. I do not know that there is any obiection to it now. Item agreed to. Postponed item 200. Droppers, patent steel of all lengths, ad val. (General Tariff), cent.; (United Kingdom), free.",34
276,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.7] - I propose to ask the Comduty. mittee to negative this item. The articles will then come in, I believe, under a duty of 20 per cent, in another item.",34

278,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Because they are made here in tens of thousands.,34
279,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"There is raising no difficulty about making them, and a high duty is not required. The effect will be to cause greater expense in often difficult to get posts. fencing.",34

281,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I am cerper tain that they will be made more expensive by a high duty, but, having protested, I shall not detain the Committee longer, is not a large item.",34
282,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Wide Bay) [5.9] - Some these articles are made here now. honourable members who are away would probably take a very different view of this proposal. There has been no intimation droppers. that these articles were to be transferred to a more highly dutiable item. dangerous practice to make that proposal on a Friday afternoon, when a number of honourable members have gone away. I have seen nothing published to indicate that the Treasurer intended to take this step.",34
283,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"When the item was postponed, I said that I intended to make an alteration, and put these articles into another item. That was really why it was postponed.",34
284,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It is a big jump from 5 per cent, and free to 25 per cent, and 20 per cent.",34
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,Swan) [5.10I of an - I cannot understand the Treasurer proand posing to put a high duty on an article which is so much in use for fencing all over Australia.,34
286,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,Ten s of thousands of them are made all over the Common,34
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Then how was it that no request for a duty was preferred to the Tariff Commission? The protectionist section of Ihe Commission re5 per commended that they should be free. The free-trade section, on some principle of their own, recommended a 10 per cent, The articles were free previously. The Government should give some very good reasons for proposing to increase the duty so greatly.",34
288,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,I said when I postponed the item that I was going to,34
289,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Not , surely, to such an extent as is now proposed. ' Mr LIVINGSTON (Barker) [5.12] I hope the Treasurer will not insist on the duty on steel droppers to 25 per cent. All over Australia it is necesonly sary to use them for fencing, and it is These articles should be allowed to come in free,",34
290,Mr FAIRBAIRN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Fawkner) [5.13] The Treasurer might make the rates 15 cent, in the General Tariff and 10 per cent, against the United Kingdom.",34
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I will make them as it 20 per cent, and 15 per cent.",34

293,Mr STORRER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Bass) [5.14] - We have imposed duties of 25 per cent. (General' Tariff) and 20 per cent. (United Kingdom) on kindred items, and these articles ought to stand the same amount. can be made here. When the. matter was previously referred to, I stated that they could be 'made here well. I am willing to vote for duties of 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., if the Treasurer is agreeable.",35
294,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Dalley) [5.15] - The Treasurer asks the Committee to strike the item out. Therefore we must either accept the item as it stands, with a duty of 5 per cent, and free, by affirming that the item shall stand as printed, or else, if we negative the item, we will leave it to the sweet will of the Treasurer to include the articles in any other item he likes. In those circumstances, it will be dimcult for any honourable member to move for duties of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent.",35
295,Mr BA,NEW SOUTH WALES,"TCHELOR (Boothby) [5.16] 1 suggest that this item be placed on the same scale as item 184, namely, 17J per cent, and 12J per cent. Each item represents about the same amount of manipulationof the raw material.",35
296,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"To stop debate, I accept the suggestion. Amendments (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That after the words "" 5 per cent."" the words footnote can ""and on and after 30th November, 1907, ad out. val. (General Tariff), 17^ per cent.,"" be inserted. That after the word "" f r e e "" the words on and after 30th November, 1907, ad val. (United Kingdom), 12^ per cent.,"" be added.",35
297,Sir JOHN FORREST,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Swan) [5.18] T notice that standards - and steel fencing, item 216, are 5 per cent., and free. Why should we place a different duty on another portion of what is practically the same fence? I shall certainly vote against any alteration being made in the duty on , droppers.",35
298,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Trea surer) [5.19] - I have here a memorandum which states that if item 200 were struck out, as was suggested, it would be necesr sary to reconsider item 216, and that standards and pillars are very similar to droppers, but are more easily made. If an alteration be made in item 200, it will be necessary to recommit item 216 in order that the duties on that item may be increased to 17^ per cent., and i 2 oer cent.",35
299,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Wide Bay) [5.21] - The Treasurer reminds me of certain sellers of fish in my country who always ask about double what they expect to get, and ultimately philanthropicariy hand over the goods at far more than their value. I rose merely to point out that important alteraThey tions are being made in the Tariff in the absence of honourable members who have gone away to seek that relaxation to which they are entitled. Amendments agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Postponed item 210 (Traps) agreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the following new item be inserted :"" 210A. Rivets bifurcated, on and after 30th November, 1907,"" free.",35
300,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,It seems very strange that bifurcated rivets cannot be made here,35
301,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Thes e are patent rivets. Proposed new item agreed to. * Postponed item 213. Scrap iron and Steel, and, subject to Departmental by-laws, Materials :foi use as Scrap Iron, free. * To continue only until the coming into force of Division VI.(A), Metals. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the asterisk be left out.",35
302,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"North Sydney) [5.25] - I do not know whether, on the striking out of the asterisk, the be consequently struck",35
303,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"The ""Chairman has ""and ruled that the striking out of an asterisk destroys the footnote.",35
304,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"But if , after the asterisk has been struck out, the footnote remains, it will prove confusing.",35
305,The CHAIRMAN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"When the asterisk disappears, the footnote can have no meaning. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the following new item be inserted :"" 220A. Steel, and steel rimmed wheels, of over 16 inches diameter in the tread, for tTucks and waggons, and all steel parts for such wheels, on and after 30th November, 1907, free.""",35
306,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,Wide Bay) [5.28] - I feel some concern for the Mother Country in connection with this item. .,35
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Then let us make L the duty 5 per cent, and free.",35
308,Mr FISHER,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I do not believe in preference. The Prime Minister said the other night that some honourable members were against every country but their own, and I think that the Treasurer is quite right in proposing that these articles shall be admitted from all countries.",35
309,Mr BATCHELOR,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Mak e the duty 5 per cent, and free.",36
310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If honourable members think that the general Tariff should be 5 per cent, with np duty against Great Britain I have no objection. I ask leave to amend my amendment in that direction. Proposed new item amended accordingingly, and agreed to. Postponed item 221. Tin plates, plain, ad val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United Kingdom), free.",36
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,"North Sydney) [5.30] - I would point out that tinned copper or all tinned sheets should be included in this item. They were on the free list under the old Tariff, but.they appear to have been made dutiable owing to the arrangement of duties under the Tariff now before us. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) agreed toThat the word "" T in "" be left out, with a.view V) insert in lieu thereof the word ""Tinned. "" Amendment (by Mr DUGALD THOMSON) agreed.toThat after the word "" plates"" the words "" and tinned sheets"" be inserted. Item, as amended, agreed to. Postponed item 225. Wire cloth, wire gauze, nd val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United Kingdom), free.",36
312,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Hume-Trea - surer) [5.33] - I propose to negative this item. I take this course with a view to embodying these materials in item 171. They will then be dutiable at 25 per cent, under the general Tariff, and at 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.",36
313,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NEW SOUTH WALES,North Sydney) [5.34] - I should like to know why the Treasurer proposes to adopt this course?,36
314,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Because these materials are being made in the Commonwealth in considerable quantity, and ought therefore to be protected.",36
315,Mr TUDOR,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Yarra) [5.35] - Some days ago I asked the Treasurer to postpone this item because I was aware that a large quantity of wire gauze and wire cloth was being manufactured in Australia. The Treasurer himself is now in possession cf several samples. There are about 200 men engaged in the industry, and I think that the item should be (Knitted with a view to its inclusion under manufactures of metals. Item negatived. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the consideration of postponed items 152, 153, and 154 be further postponed until the remaining duties have been dealt with,",36
316,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,Dalley) [5.37] - The other day the Treasurer staled that he would not proceed with the consideration of the duty upon stripper harvesters until be had laid upon the table of the House a memorandum relating to the salient points of the new protection proposals of the Government. Are we to infer from this motion that the announcement of those proposals is to be postponed until the remainder of the Tariff has been dealt with ?,36
317,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,I cannot say - I do not know what the Prime Minister intends to do.,36
318,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"It looks very much like it. Motion agreed to; items postponed. Division Via - Metal s and Machinery.

319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Trea surer) [5.39] - I informed some honourable members before they left for their homes this afternoon that I intended to ask the Committee to merely complete the consideration of Division V.I. of the Tariff, and under the circumstances it would scarcely be fair for me to proceed with the consideration of Division VIA . At the same time, I should very much like to do so.",36
320,Mr WILKS,NEW SOUTH WALES,"If the Treasurer did so, it would only cause more trouble next week.",37
321,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,NEW SOUTH WALES,"I have been asked to push on with Division VIA . , but under the circumstances I do not feel justified in doing so, and consequently I shall report progress.
