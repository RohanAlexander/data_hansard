Their disapproval of the recommendations of the Karmel Committee on post Secondary Education in Tasmania. The proposed dismantling of the T.C.A.E. Mount Nelson Campus, the takeover of some courses by the University of Unemployment Tasmania, and the transfer of others to Launceston would be to the detriment of quality of post secondary education in Tasmania. It would deprive the southern regions of a vital institution while not replacing it with anything like an equal institution in the North and Northwest.

Canberra's high unemployment problems will only be solved satisfactorily, both socially ana environmentally, the construction of urgently needed public transport facilities; 4. Massive environmental degradation of Lake Burley Griffin's foreshores will occur if the proposed Molonglo Freeway is constructed; 5. Canberra's air pollution levels are already dangerously high as a direct result of over-dependence on the motor for private transport and this situadon will not be rectified the foreseeable future by vehicle exhaust emission controls; 6. Many Canberra residents, particularly in the young elderly age groups, do not have unfettered access and therefore will be substantially disadvantaged if the money proposed for the construction of the freeway channelled into public transport facilities which will these groups; Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Molonglo Arterial and Western Distributor be deferred until public inquiry has been carried total transport needs.

3,Mr UREN,THE ECONOMY,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. He will be aware of the 25-year record rise of 6 per cent in the consumer price index announced yesterday, the under-subscription of the February loan and the continuing inflaition tionary effect of devaluation. Does he agree that these factors are certain to force interest rates will and lead to a further severe credit squeeze? In public view of these circumstances, what action does the Treasurer now propose to take to keep interest by rates down and to ensure that the economy is supplied with sumcient funds to maintain even the existing low level of employment and output?",13
4,Mr LYNCH,THE ECONOMY,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is utterly irresponsible in raising the car question of interest rates. I assume that he had in in mind a speculative response by me. Not only is he utterly irresponsible in raising that matter but and also his constant harping on matters of this type to a car in this House is very destructive of confidence is not throughout the general community. As he ought benefit to know very well, no Treasurer at question time will ever responsibly comment on the general level of interest rates and speculate as to thena full forward movement. I remind the honourable out, investigating Canberra's gentleman in the first place of what I said in the economic statement made in the House recently. Of course the Government wants interest rates down but they will be brought down in the context of inflation. Whilst inflation remains high, there is an incapacity in quite responsible terms to bring interest rates down.",13
5,Mr UREN,THE ECONOMY,What about the February loan? areas of Australia still with,13

The February loan is, of course, important when seeking tofinancethe Governaffairs programs and education. are denied the benefits of telement's deficit in relation to the sales of government paper outside. In this respect the loan was quite successful. The non-bank sector, as the honourable gentleman would, I hope, know from his somewhat passing knowledge of the economic discipline, is the important area in seeking to finance that deficit in a noninflationary way. Subscriptions from the nonbank sector totalled some $134m or almost $50m more than was raised from the non-bank sector in the October loan. The Government is therefore encouraged by the non-bank take-up in the February loan. I of course recognise that there was a lower proportion subscribed by the banks but with regard to subscriptions for particular stocks, I mention for the information of the House that the 1978 stock attracted 47 per cent of subscriptions; the 1981 security 24 per cent; the 1987 security 17 percent; and the 1999 security attracted 12 per cent. I am not in a posto speculate on the general nub behind the honourable gentleman's question for the reasons up I hope I have made perfectly clear to this House. NA",13
7,Mr NEIL,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware of the strains under which the Commonwealth Employment Service is operating? Are these strains affecting the compilation of accurate statistics? What plans does the Minister have to solve these problems?,14
8,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"It is true that the officers of Commonwealth Employment Service are not operating under considerable difficulties, both relation to their staffing requirements and the physical space in which they have to operate. The Government recognised the difficulties the CES and also the fact that its operations had not been fundamentally reviewed for almost 30 years. As a result of that and the obvious difficulable ties that were being experienced by employers trying tofindlabour and job seekers seeking vacancies, the Government appointed Mr John Norgard to undertake a fundamental review of the Service and its operations. Mr Norgard has been engaged in that review for some months and has visited a great number of offices in States. I understand that in a week or so he will be going to Queensland to undertake the same exercise there. I expect to have well before the middle of the year Mr John Norgard's report which hopefully will identify the problems to which the honourattention able member has referred and which, I am sure, will make constructive suggestions towards solution. Of course, as soon as the Government receives his report it will give close attention TELEVISING OF CRICKET TEST SERIES member",14
9,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"My question is addressed to can-i the Minister for Post ana Telecommunications. Is it a fact that the Australian Broadcasting mission has been covering cricket tests on radio since 1932 and on television since 1957 and that the sporting public is highly satisfied with the ABC coverage, particularly because it is not interrupted by commercials? Has the Minister noted reports that the Channel 9 network has obtained exclusive rights to the Jubilee cricket test series between Australia and the cost to revenue? Marylebone Cricket Club in England this year and to the Wimbledon, French and American tennis titles? Has he seen the reported statement by the Chairman of Channel 9 that the reason network obtained theserightsover the ABC have could be given in one word, money, and that the deal cost a total of $2m? Was the ABC also seek-ing ing these rights but was unable to match the bid made by Channel 9 because of cuts in funds? Finally, in view of the fact that Channel 9 SERVICE expects to make a substantial profit from sponsorship of these events, is this not simply a overnment subsidy for its old friends, Channel and Australian Consolidated Press Ltd?",14
10,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"I have seen the Press reports of the arrangements that Channel 9, the Packer network, has entered into with regard to the 1977 cricket series. I want to indicate quite the clearly that I would be concerned if there were an Australia-wide coverage of such a test in series. Ifindit difficult, with the limited knowledge that I have today of this matter, to believe that that is going to be possible. What the of honourable member says about the ABC traditionally having this facility to broadcast such events is perfectly correct. I inform the honourmember that the ABC was negotiating on this matter and had offered a fee. I am informed that before it had an opportunity to reconsider whether it would increase that fee an agreement was entered into with the Channel 9 network. It is not fair of the honourable member to suggest that reductions hi the expenditure of the ABC in most any way had any impact at all on those negotiations. I repeat that the ABC was negotiating in the usual way and was denied, so I am informed, the opportunity of reconsidering thefigurethat was involved. I simply say that the matter has come to my only in the last day or two. I will be looking at it more closely. It is quite improper to thensuggest that what has happened in any way represents a sponsorship of the Packer interests, to it. or Channel 9 or any other commercial interests. What I will be concerned about-the honourable will see me taking steps to do what Is to ensure that the Australian public is not disadvantaged in any way as regards enjoying Comsomething that they have traditionally enjoyed.

11,Mr GILES,TAXATION,Has the Treasurer given any instructions to the Taxation Office as to the Government's attitude to current cost accounting for the nextfinancialyear? Has he studied the effects of any alteration to taxation yields as a,14
12,Mr LYNCH,TAXATION,"No , I have not given any instruction to the Taxation Office as to the Government's attitude to current cost accounthis ing. I and other Ministers in the Government noted the extensive debate in the Press as to the desirability or otherwise of businesses reportresults in terms of the provisional standards for current cost accounting that have been issued by the provisional accounting bodies. As to the second part of the question posed by the honourbe able gentleman, the extent to which businesses do report results based on current cost accountcreated ing will not have any impact on taxation revenue. The tax law will continue to operate on the basis of historical costs. However, the new trading stock valuation adjustment system account the impact of cost increases in respect of eligible stocks. The new system is estimated to cost some $400m during the year ahead. The Government is continuing to examine the impact of inflation on depreciation allowances and other aspects of businessfinancingand fitability. Any further action taken in this general area will, of course, need to have regard to the capacity of the Government to afford further reforms. Myfinalcomment to the honourable so gentleman is that I shall be meeting with the counting bodies on this matter in Sydney in early days of next week. AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY: NA",14
13,Mr FRY,MEDICAL SPECIALISTS,"I address my question to the Minister for Health. I refer to Canberra Press that the dispute between salaried sis, success will depend upon and private specialists in the Australian Capital both the private people and the Territory is being resolved by the destruction the salaried service and that the Capital Terrifession in Canberra to settle downmedical tory Health Commission could be in breach of the Trade Practices Act. As the Minister has refuted these allegations, I ask him: Firstly, is he concerned that this is in fact the situation with regard to specialist services in the Australian Capital Territory? Secondly, does he intend to discuss this matter with representatives of the salaried specialists?",15
14,Mr HUNT,MEDICAL SPECIALISTS,"I thank the honourable member for Fraser for the question. I have just returned from a luncheon with the Chairman of the Staff Specialist Council. We discussed some of the matters that are concerning the salaried specialtoria, ists in the Australian Capital Territory. The reports in the Press to which the honourable member has referred are quite incorrect. I do not believe for a moment either that the Capital ritory Health Commission is attempting to dislocal criminate against the salaried specialists is in breach of the Trade Practices Act. I have seen a number of articles on this matter and concerned that the people who are writing these articles are doing sumcient to create further age to relationships that have existed between the private specialists and the salaried specialists in Canberra. I take no responsibility at all that state of affairs. In fact, the responsibility laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the Opposition because when it was in government it in this city a situation in which the salaried specialists and the private specialists found it very difficult to work together. This occurred at the expense of the public in the Australian Capiwill take into tal Territory. Among the other things that I had to do last S ear in frying to sort out one big mess in the ealth area was to attend to the problem that existed in the Australian Capital Territory. I have used the patience I have at my disposal and I proshall continue to use whatever patience I can command in trying to overcome what I believe to be a most unfortunate state of affairs within the medical profession in Canberra. In trying to do I set up a joint working party, comprising priacvate practitioners and salaried practitioners in the Canberra and under the chairmanship of none other than Professor Hughes, who happens to be the chairman of the advisory committee of the joint colleges in Australia. The Government has adopted the recommendations contained in his report. The Capital Territory Health Comrecent allegations in the mission those is in the process of trying to implement recommendations. But, in thefinalanalythe degree to which salaried people of can work together. I call upon the and get proon with its job of looking after the people in accordnot ance with the ethics of the medical profession. NA",15
15,Mr SIMON,FINANCE FOR ROADS,"Is the Minister for Transport aware of the decline in funding for roads in relative terms over the past 5 years? Is the Minister currently seeking submissions on the proposed terms and allocation of road funds relative to new legislation to have effect as from 1 July 1977? Is the Minister giving consideration to submissions from the Municipal Association of Victhe Shires Association of New South Wales and the Australian Council of Local Government Associations that the Commonwealth Government contribution of funds be increased substanTertially and in real terms, thereby reducing the government contribution to this area of or that it responsibility? I am Mr NIXON- I am conscious that in real terms the funding of roads as a total of all outlays has damdeclined. To be specific, Commonwealth outlays on roads have declined from 2.9 per cent to 2.3 per cent. State budgetary outlays on roads-this for is equally important of course-hav e declined can from 3.3 per cent to 3.7 per cent. There has been a decline in real terms on road spending throughconsumer out Australia. There has been, increase in money terms but that has been eroded by inflation brought about by the maladgentleman's ministration of the previous Government's 3-year term in office. This would be readily con-ments ceded, I believe, by the Leader of the Opposition. He would agree with me wholeheartedly that a disastrous effect of his policies has been to cause a decline in road construction throughout the nation. When coming to office we were immediately under conscious of the position in which local governments. the ment authorities, urban and rural, found themthis selves. When on one occasion we allocated $64m and on a second occasion $32.5m for roads we sought to see that the majority of the money was in in fact spent through local government authoriimproperly ties. The House will recall that of course the vious administration had reduced the level funds to local government authorities by a much greater margin than it had reduced the level of which funds for other aspects of road funding. Thus concerned. local government authoritiesfindthemselves in a serious position. The honourable member is quite correct: I have been receiving deputations from local government associations. I received one from New South Wales yesterday and an earlier one from Victoria. Representations have been made by other authorities. The wish of the Government will be to try to maintain at as high a level as possible the road funds that are spent through local government authorities. We recogbeen nise that local government authorities have road building problems as well as unemployment problems m their areas. We believe that by sisting them in this way we will help the cause roads and employment generally. Despite the ought difficulties that we might face in the next Budget period I am confident that my colleague the Treasurer will assist me in helping local governhalf ment authorities as much as possible. MEDIBANK: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX man Mr E. G. Whitlam-Has the Prime Minisments ter noticed that the annual report of the Health Insurance Commission, which also appeared refer yesterday, revealed that Medibank in itsfirstfull year of operation expended $157m less than its Budget allocation for hospital and medical benefits and grants to the States and that it saved nearly a quarter of a million dollars in administralian trative expenses which represented only 0.04 cent of the Commission's total payments? Does the Prime Minister still maintain that his cisions to restructure Medibank justified the per cent increase in the health component of price index which the Statistician of course, an revealed yesterday?",15
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FINANCE FOR ROADS,"The honourable own question has emphasised the extent to which the revised Medibank arrangein fact have saved funds. By far the overwhelming majority of the $157m, which I am advised has been saved as against the estimates, has come out of the revised hospital agreements with the States. The joint Commonwealth-State committees are defining the nature of expenditure which ought to be undertaken and allowed SO/50 hospital cost sharing arrangeAs honourable gentlemen know, when House was earlier advised that the original agreements were, in the Commonwealth's view, the view of the Attorney-General and in the view of other law officers, illegal and had been undertaken, we immediately set preabout negotiating with the States to achieve an of arrangement which would be not only legal but at the sametimewould not be completely and absolutely open-ended so far as hospitals are My colleague the Minister for Health, those who have been working with him in the Commission in relation to these matters and negotiating with the States, and those on the Commonwealth-State committees in each of the States which are looking at the budgets of hospitals, all deserve the highest possible commendation for this very large and substantial saving which has achieved. None of this would have been achieved, all the money would have been spent if it had not been for these new and revised arasrangements. The honourable gentleman ought to of understand that and to know it well. The States to be particularly grateful for these revised arrangements because, out of the total savings under the hospital cost sharing arrangement, the savings accrue to the States and half the savings accrue to the Commonwealth. I am quite certain that the honourable gentlewould have preferred Medibank arrangewhich made people think that health care was free and that it did not have to be paid for. I to the actions which have been taken by the present Government, which give to all people a right of choice- arightof choice that a very large number of people nave wished to exercise. It is well worth noting that the President of the AusLabor Party-sometimes-the President per of the Australian Council of Trade Unionssometimes-and , I think, the Leader of the Opdeposition himself, have decided that under our 82.9 revised arrangements Medibank is good enough the for them. They have joined Medibank Private. Previously, as I understand it, certainly Mr Hawke and maybe the Leader of the Opposition, were insured under private arrangements. Medibank was not good enough for them under their own arrangements. What complete and absolute humbug to suggest that Medibank has been damaged under our arrangements. It is at last good enough for the Leader of the Opposition and for the President of the Australian Labor Party and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The sooner the latter leaves one of those jobs the better it will be. The fact that the cost of health care plain and out in the open is a healthy factor in Australian society. People can see that there are costs. They know quite well that the costs be paid for either by taxation or by some other means. To have the cost of health care hidden was itself extravagant and conducive to the use of health services at a rate that was not necessary. Very considerable savings have already been made. The Minister and those officers who have been working with him deserve the highest commendation. NA",16
17,Mr FISHER,MILDURA FLIGHT SERVICE UNIT,"My question is addressed to Minister for Transport. He will be aware of my representations to him about the reported closof ure of the Mildura flight service unit during weekends. Has he been able to carry out a review of this situation? If so, what arrangements are being made to permit essential administrative and operational duties to be performed?",17
18,Mr NIXON,MILDURA FLIGHT SERVICE UNIT,I am aware of the very forceful representations made to me by the honourable member for Mallee about the Mildura flight vice unit. After those forceful representations were made. I looked at the problem. I am able to assure him that he will be most satisfied with the arrangements. The Milduraflightservice unit will be able to undertake its proper responsibilimust ties right through the period ahead. RHODESIAN ARMY: ALLEGED NA,17
19,Dr JENKINS,RECRUITING IN TASMANIA,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a report into today's Melbourne Age that a law professor at the Uniheld versity of Tasmania has claimed that a former hired killer was actively recruiting in southern Tasmania for the Rhodesian army and that man claimed that the Australian Government knew of his work? If so, have the allegations been investigated? What substance is there them? If the gentleman is engaged in these nefarious activities, is he an Australian citizen or an overseas visitor?",17
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,RECRUITING IN TASMANIA,"I regret to say that my attention had not been drawn to the report. I will certainly have it examined. If activities of that kind are being undertaken it would seem to me that it is against Government policy and certainly against the spirit of legislation which the Attorney-General has in hand, of which the honourable gentleman would be aware. This matter will be examined forthwith to is now see what truth there is in the report. NA must Mr HYDE-My question which I address to the Prime Minister is supplementary to the question asked yesterday by the honourable member for Wakefield. In his reply the Prime Minister referred to the excessive rate of change imposed upon industries by excessive wagerisesand inflation and stated that protection policies should be and therefore could be employed to prevent the export of jobs overseas. He referred to high freight rates affecting Australian industry. Is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Henderson, the the Director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, states that the weight the tariff burden is about $4,300m annually? Mr Sullivan-How much?",17
21,Mr HYDE,TARIFF POLICY,"It is $4,300m. Does the Prime Minister realise that most of that burden is ultimately borne by exporters? Is he aware that the high freight rates he spoke of by and large protect the competing import industries and penalise the exporting industries? Is the Prime serMinister aware that the sector of the economy already making the greatest rate of adjustment is not hi fact the manufacturing sector but the rural sector? Does the Prime Minister recollect telling the nation on Australia Day that the cargo cult be banished from Australia? Is it his intention that competitive industries should go on paying increasing amounts of cargo to protected industries?",17
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TARIFF POLICY,"I think that overall something like SS per cent of Australia's primary products are exported. I do not want to be absolutely to thatfigurebut overall I understand that that is about the percentage, taking most of the products together. Quite clearly, the therefore, there are many primary products which are heavily dependent upon an Australian market, upon people who work in Australian in factories and live in Australian cities. One of the things that people do with great service to the total Australian community is to to divide that community into separate and comMinister petitive sections-thos e who work on farms, those who live in cities, those who work at the Ford organisation's factory at Geelong or in some other factory, or those who work in the mines. It is utterly impossible to make that of division and come out with any sensible answer. There is an interdependence between the major sectors of the Australian economy, tween different sectors of the Australian comof munity, and it is not possible to look at one in lation from the other. If the logic of the honourable member's tion were taken to its limits one would, I end all protection-and the honourable member said that there is $4,000m worth. If we take that limit what does that do in terms of the harm,Australian hardship and difficulty of the many thousands of people who thereby would be placed out of work and who would be unable to buy butter from Australian dairy farmers and lamb tralian lamb producers? We have an interdependence. The effect that would follow from that kind of policy just does not make sense. I would have thought that we would have been much by better served if we stopped talking about different sectors of the Australian community being competitors or about somebody getting something at the expense of others, and looked at the whole to see how we can advance the whole. IMMIGRATION: SCREENING NA",17
23,Mr JAMES,PROCEDURES,"I direct my question to the action Foreign Minister. I ask: Can aliens with criminal records secure permission to enter Australia? What checks are made to ascertain whether aliens who have criminal records have changed their names before they apply to enter Australia? What action does the Government take in where previously unknown criminal records or name changes come to notice after the person concerned has entered Australia?  well knows that these matters are checked. well knows that I am not prepared, nor has any revious Foreign Minister or Attorney-General een prepared, to give a break-down of the methods that are utilised.

24,Mr HODGES,SKIN CANCER,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. Is the Minister aware of serious and high incidence of skin cancer disAustralia, particularly in Queensland and the try northern parts of Australia? What action has the taken to alert Australians to the danger of skin cancer? Can the Minister advise the House what benefits are available to assist persons suffering from this unfortunate disease? Are such benefits also available to sun seekers who kind may expose themselves to greater dangers?",18
25,Mr HUNT,SKIN CANCER,"Of course, with a complexion besuch as I have, I am well aware of the problems skin cancer, sunburn and so on. So I extend the isodeepest sympathy to those who suffer from these problems. I am aware also of the serious problem that skin cancer is from a medical point of view, quesarticularly in Queensland and in northern New I suppose, outh Wales. The medical complement of my Department, the Australian Government Anait to lyst from the Department of Science and the Cancer Council have been in conference and as a consequence of their efforts a booklet has been published and 200 000 copies have been distributed this summer to people in varifrom Ausous parts of Australia. For the honourable member's benefit, I mention that all treatment of skin cancer performed a doctor in his surgery or in a hospital attracts medical and hospital benefits. We have ensured that surgical aids, such as artificial noses that may be required as a consequence of cancer of the nose, are available free of any charge to patients at recognised hospitals in the States where such artificial aids are necessary as part of the ongoing treatment of the patient. That arrangement has been made with the various States. So I call assure the honourable member for Petrie and other honourable members that has been taken to try to warn the public and to ensure that those who are afflicted have medical benefits and other assistance. IMMIGRATION: SCREENING NA cases Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Foreign Minister a question that is supplementary to that asked him by the honourable member for Hunter. My question arises, as I apprehend the member's question arose, from the He report that an American gangster entered Australia under a name different from that which he bore when he was convicted. I point out that I no more wish to elicit the methods of checking than I believe my colleague sought to elicit them. I ask: Are checks made- I do not ask what checks-to ascertain whether aliens who have criminal records have changed their names be the fore they apply to eAtef Australia? I also ask: in What action does the Government take where previously unknown criminal records or preMinister viously unknown name changes come to notice after the person concerned has entered Australia?  should be directed to the Minister for Immigraarterial tion and Ethnic Affairs.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA : ROA D GRANT S will  aware that the South Australian State Governto ment is not allocating road grant funds in the way it proposed when seeking grants from the erly Commonwealth Government? Further, is the own area. aware of Press reports in which Mr Virgo, South Australia's Minister for Transport, has blamed the Commonwealth Government for cuts in funds to local council areas provided by both governments for rural local and rural roads? Is the Commonwealth in fact responsible, as suggested by the State Minister?",19
27,Mr NIXON,PROCEDURES,"I have to say at the outset that Mr Virgo has completely misrepresented the position, and to say that he has done it with some the base political motive is probably to come very close to the truth. The fact is that on 15 April last year Mr Virgo sent to me for approval a program of projects to the value of $6.257m. He submitted that program for $6.257m at that time knowing full well that the level of Commonwealth support for the program was $2.1m in that financial year. In addition to the $2. lm we later gave to South Australia an extra $3.2m of which $1.2m was to go to rural arterial roads. It is quite to me that Mr Virgo in submitting the total program for $6.257m had held the view, knowan ing the level of Commonwealth support, that he would be able to secure the balance of the funds from State Budget sources. But apparently in his discussions around the Budget table he failed in his desire to get the level of funds he sought, and therefore the total level of funds available for South Australia was not as high as he had subThe Commonwealth's role is simply to apthe projects. It does not dictate the times I by which the projects will be completed or the rate at which the work will be done. The important element is that Mr Virgo obviously honestly believed that he would receive a total of $6.257m year for rural arterials. When he failed to seIn cure funds from his own State's Budget he set to to and re-ordered the priorities that had been allocated in the original application. I note, for that he took out the Lucindale to road. Clearly, that road did not rank high enough in Mr Virgo's priorities to secure funds; can so he cut it out and did not proceed to build the road. Then he claimed that it was cut out because of the failure of the Commonwealth Government to supply a high enough level of funds. This not the first time that State Ministers have misrepresented this sort of position and it probably not be the last time, but I can assure honourable members that when the new roads grants comes in I will be doing my level best make sure that each of us-Commonwealt h and State Ministers-stand s and is counted propfor the responsibilities that he carries m his NA",19
28,Mr WILLIS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"My question, which is adscious dressed to the Prime Minister, refers to his Government's decision to increase powers to restrict the industrial activities of ployees and their trade unions through proposed introduction of the industrial relations bureau, its reported intention to increase stantially the penalties provided in the Concilishould ation and Arbitration Act and its trade practices legislation which would make many employees and probably their unions liable to injunctions, civil actions for damages and massive penalties. ask the Prime Minister: Will he inform the House why his Government is seeking such draconian powers when industrial disputation has declined dramatically over the last 2 years and wage settlements are almost completely confined to wage indexation increases? Is it the case that the Government regards such legislation as essential to its announced aim of slashing real wages this year, or is it simply that it is seeking to provoke confrontation with the unions and thereby distract public attention from its abysmal economic performance?",20

It also protect individuals against unfair by their own organisations. These matters are the present law but the provisions will also be ister improved under the proposals that will be be aware brought forward.

I believe that the great majority of people feel that there ought to be reasonable rules for the conduct of industrial relations and for the protection of individuals, because that is what it is all about-people .

In July 1976 the price was to 22c a lb ac-f.o.b. In August 1976 the was 27c to 28c a lb ac-f.o.b . On 8 December 1976 it rose to 47c a lb ac-f.o.b. , in other words showing a very marked lift in the post devaluathe tion period. At the same time, those returns wereto certainly not passed on to producers, which is another matter of concern. On 15 December 1976 the price was 46c to 48c a lb ac-f.o.b . 26 January 1977 it was 44c a lb ac-f.o.b. and subsequent to the introduction of the fication entitlement, on 17 February it fell a lb ac-f.o.b. The industry representatives that meeting said that they did not accept that the discounting in price was only a matter flowing from the earning entitlement sales. However, the matter is certainly one of concern. It is a matter which the Meat taken up with the meat exporters to the point of suggesting that some future change in meat diversification entitlement might well be if this trend were to continue. A general review of the present base entitlement to the United States market this year is scheduled for March and this matter considered further at that time. In the meantime, the Meat Board has put those groups at that meeting on notice that there may need to be some adjustment of future sales to Japan should be too significant a reduction in prices, seriously prejudicing the returns to Australian producers. I might add that whilst the present rain has significantly changed pasture conditions in much of Australia, and hence supply and demand circumstances, the low prices paid to beef producers in an industry where there have been demonstrable benefits improved export prices have been a real sigThis circumstance, of course, means that beef are not in a position to gain advantage exeither from the 1714 per cent devaluation or improved market demand.

These should be warned that access to private and intermediate patients may be denied to them and that the hospital should try to run the clinics and wards using highly and well paid salaried specialists.

Director of the Australian National Gallery for term of 7 years. The Government has also delery, cided to appoint a Secretary-Manager to manage the administrative andfinancialaffairs of Gallery.

Mr Molhson has carried out the duties of Director since 1971 and was selected from widefieldof applicants who responded to an vertisement placed in Australia and overseas in September last year. I might add that I regard it as entirely appropriate that an Australian should be thefirstDirector of the Australian National Gallery.

It represents the consummation of the statutory arrangements Government introduced. I applaud the appointment of Mr Mollison and what the Prime ter has said about him. I take the opportunity say this because many implicit reflections made upon Mr Mollison's skill and conduct, ticularly during 1975. Questions were askedone, I notice, by the right honourable gentleman himself-abou t the purchasing policies and commissions paid. Since the overseas visits were always made in the first case by Mr Mollison, was possible for people to infer that there were doubts about the propriety or the expertise which he conducted his job. My predecessor, right honourable member for Lowe (Mr concerning: MCMahon), was head of government when Mr Australian Mollison was appointed. I was happy to continue him in his position. I am glad that the Prime ister has now made Mr Mollison's appointment for the maximum term which the Act permits. There should be no doubt now about the investments which Mr Mollison recommended the Acquisitions Committee and later to the Interim Council for the Gallery. As I am reminded by my colleague, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), who recently, I have no doubt, has taken the portunity to see some comprehensive and able collections in the United States of America, questions were asked from time to time about wisdom of purchasing Blue Poles or Woman As we all know, if the Australian Government were now to dispose of those 2 works on the ternational art market, Australia would reap very good profit indeed. It is less than a year ago, Minister was casting aspersions negotiations to acquire an ancient bronze of unthat I presented toPaper known authorship. I thought it somewhat year, to formalise defence arrangements strange that even an Australian head of ment should make such references. The inference was that ancient bronzes of unknown authorship were junk; that they were not to be considered. One appreciates that such an attitude would involve removing from some of the great galleries of the world the Venus de Milo, or Winged Victory of Samothrace, or taking the Horses of Saint Mark's, the Charioteer of Delphi or the Dying Gaul. But the Prime Minister has changed his tune in these matters. Last month he opened in Melbourne, as I shall open next month in Sydney, a visiting Chinese exhidemonstrate, bition.

52,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"I have received a letter the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr 20 Willis) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for dishas cussion, namely: The record high level of unemployment. I call upon those members who approve of the earners working proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required the Standing Orders having risen in their Mi WILLIS (Gelhbrand)-(3.27) Within 15 months of taking office the Fraser Government's success in restoring the economy to economic health can be measured by the fact that it is presiding over the third highest ever quarterly inflation rise and the highest ever level ployment recorded by the Commonwealth Ememployment. ployment Service. At the end of January 1977 the number of registered unemployed with the CES was 354 589, which is approximately ing 10 500 more than in January 1976-on e year earlier. Of the 354 589 registered unemployed, declined 156 000 are juniors. This demonstrates the enormous problem that we have in this country with ing unemployed youth. But the CESfiguresdo not tell the full story. fact there has been a big rise in hidden ployment. The labour forcefigurespublished every quarter by the Bureau of Statistics that in the year to November 1976, which is the latest period for whichfiguresare available, there was a rise of 185 000 in the population aged 15 years and over in this country and in same period there was an increase of only 5000 a subin the number of employed wage and salary Clearly there has been a big decline into the work force participation rate as people have given up hope of getting a job. Indeed that dein the participation rate is demonstrated in the labour force figures which show a decline from 62.1 per cent to 61 per cent in the ratio of of the population aged 15 years and over who are That happened in the course of the year to November 1976. Clearly there has been a big increase in the level of hidden unemployment. There should have been an increase in employment in this area of something like 100 000; in there has been an increase of 5000 in the of wage and salary earners in the year to Accordingly November 1976. If we look at the breakup of the number of employed wage and salary earners we can throw more light on the troubled employment situation. In fact the number of jobs for males declined by 15 000 in the year to November 1976, thefirstyear of the Fraser Government. from The number of females employed went up by 000, but of course over the last decade or so a very substantial growth in female employment been in part time jobs so that the full time equivalent would be much less than 20 000. Furthermore the industry sectors also show some interesting facts. The number of wage and salary for private enterprise went down by 2000 in thefirstyear in which the lights by were to be turned on. The number of Australian placesGovernment employees went down by 12 000 and the number of local government employees by 4000. The only area of growth in the whole country was State government employment. now There was an increase of 22 000 in the number employed in that area. Without that there would of unemhave been a very substantial decline in The industry breakup provides some interestfigures.The number of employed wage and salary earners in manufacturing industry by 24 000 in thefirstyear of the Fraser Government. The number of employees in buildand construction industry went down by 18 000 in thefirstyear of the Fraser Government. The only areas of substantial growth were In health, in which employment was up by 17 000, unemeducation, in which employment was up by 16 000, and the wholesale and retail trade, in show which employment was up by 12 000. Health and education of course provide very substantial areas of government employment. We can see that the employment picture is indeed dismal. the The unemploymentfiguresshowing an increase of only 10 500 over the period from January 1976 do not show the full picture. There has been a rninimum increase in employment in the past year in a period in which another 100 000 or people should have been working in this country.would The prospects for the future are also very grim.thing The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its survey on Australia fore-implications cast a further rise in unemployment in 1977. That survey has only recently become available. Let us look at the overtimefigures.The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said last July that these were a very good leading indicator of ployment trends. At that time the level of overstances time being worked on a seasonally adjusted basiswould was 2.6 hours. It had slipped to 2.2 hours in December. So, there has been a very substantialployment. decline in overtime worked on a seasonally adjusted basis. If that is a leading indicator employment, as the Prime Minister says, it doesincrease not give us cause for any satisfaction about the future. Much more important than that is the dence that became available yesterday from the Australian Industries Development Association by way of a survey that it had carried out on pri-are vate employment prospects for 1977. That ations should cause every member of this Parliament be very worried indeed. A survey was carried out of the companies which employed about one-tenth of the Australian private sector workforce. Let me read some of the conclusions from the survey. The Association found that if there was 10 per cent increase in growth in sales and pro-time duction in 1977 the vast majority of the comrate panies would be able to accommodate such a growth, sharp production increase by either a rundown stocks or an increase in overtime and shift work-high ing and therefore by either making no new hir-Medibank ings or increasing their employment by no moreprice than about 2 per cent. The conclusion continues: Less than 10 per cent of need to increase the labour force by S per cent or should this hypothetical growth in output take place. The Association is saying that if there was a 10cause per cent growth in output, which would be a veryeven substantial growth, employment would go up bypropensity only 2 per cent in this coming year. The Associ-in ation went on to say: . . . remarkably few of the respondents expect more than a slender growth in output to take place this siderably less than half of the to suggest that the 4 per cent growth in real output the 1976-77 Budget was framed is possible in the present year . . . But very few companies expect per cent- 4 per cent real growth in output, and a large number are still working . . . on the assumption that real output in 1977 will be no greater than it was in 1976. Let me summarise that by saying that this surveysufficiently shows that private companies in this country are not saying that if there was a 10 per cent growth in output this year, in other words if we had a mirsoaculous and substantial economic growth, there be only a 2 per cent increase at the very most in employment. They do not expect anylike 10 per cent, they expect maybe 3 per cent to 4 per cent at the outside. The obvious for employment are that it will rise by much less than 2 per cent in those circumstances. Even if it rose by 2 per cent there would still be an increase in the level of unemployment because the labour force is increasing at the rate em-of 2A per cent to 3 per cent. In those circuml the 2 per cent increase in employment not take up all that increase, and there would be a further addition to the level of unemWith a 3 per cent or 4 per cent increase in output and much less than a 2 per of cent increase in employment, perhaps no at aU or perhaps even a reduction, obviously we are in a far worse situation. That evievi-dence has just become available to the Government and should impress itself upon every member of this Parliament. Employment prospects grim in the coming year. It needs no exaggeror accusations of talking down the econtoomy to make those statements. Another factor which is important in thinking that the prospects for the future are dismal is that there is likely to be a continuing high rate of ainflation. We have been told by the Government and time again that until it gets down the of inflation there will not be much economic and that that is the basic thing for econinomic recovery. The Government has induced a increase in the rate of inflation through its rearrangements. With the subsequent rises through the effects of devaluation, we can expect an increase of something like 16 per the respondents would foresee the cent in retail prices for 1976-77. If past experimore, ence is any guide, and it should be, the effect of that on consumer demand must be that it will consumers to retract their expenditures further, and there will be a decline in the to consume. Without an increase in the propensity to consume, without an increase consumption, we cannot expect, as the Budget Speech said, economic recovery to occur. Yet the Government, through its ineptitude, its stupidity year. Con-in exacerbating inflation in the extraordinary respondents replied m terms as on which way that it has, has created the conditions in which we are likely to have a further reduction in more than 3 the propensity to consume. The social impact of unemployment is something which I think has not been discussed in this Parliament. Admittedly, we do get a great deal of time to talk about these issues. A quarter of an hour does not give one much time to embark on it. I recommend that allparticular, members read the submission of the Australian Council of Social Service which stresses in detail the number of surveys which have looked at plight of the unemployed. We must bear in mind the tremendous social costs associated with increased unemployment-social , personal and human costs which tend to be lost in the statistics.jobs It is not an economic argument, it is not a statisti-Capital cal argument, it is not a political argument. very much a case of social and human suffering. We should not lose sight of that fact. I recomterms, mend that members read that submission and note the very devastating effects which substanture tial or long-term unemployment can have. I briefly to a survey by the Brotherhood of St Laurence which is summarised in the submission of the Australian Council of Social Service. report of the Brotherhood of St Laurence states: . . . the long-term consequences of young people being unemployed over a long period are stated as: '(a) Loss of faith in society and government. (b) Development of anti-work attitudes. (c) Development of habits that would mitigate future employment. (d) Damage to feelings of self-esteem. (e) Family tensions arise as young people fail employed. (0 Trouble with the law. With nowhere to go ing to do, larceny and vandalism is a potential development (g) Getting used to managing on benefits and seeking no advantage in working a routine job when they have no particular skill to sell.' They are quite clearly very important effects young people. So we must do something about unemployment. The Government must start to take some positive action about unemployment. It must start creating jobs now. It is not sufficient to say: 'We will kill inflation firstly, then omic recovery will occur and everything will all right'. It is patently clear that that is situation. Inflation will continue, in the first place. Secondly, as the Australian Industries Development Association survey shows, even if a miraculous economic recovery were brought about there would not be created sufficient jobs to stop the level of unemployment increasing substantially for the next year or more. So the Government must start taking some positive turing action now, if it really is concerned about employed, to create jobs. If it intends to do that, it will nave to change its economic policy. On a number of occasions the Opposition has expired. put forward its economic policy. Let me briefly summarise it. We are concerned about bringing down the rate of inflation and are also very cerned about creating jobs. We have stressed the need to reduce the rate of indirect taxation, in which would have the effect, through wage indexation, of winding down the inflation rate by the initial reduction in prices, then the the reduced wageflow-onhaving a secondary anti-inflationary effect and also stimulating consumption through the reduction in some prices. We have mentioned other action directly to create and to increase government expenditure. works and housing projects were slashed It is dramatically in the Budget. Overall government expenditure has been cut by 4 per cent in real not just in money terms. If one takes account of price increases, government expendi- . has been cut by 4 per cent. In the areas of refer urban and regional development, the growth^ centres and so on, it has been cut by 50 per cent.' In the area of housing it has been ciif by 22 per The cent. In these capital works and housing areas there has been a dramatic cutback because of the multiplying effects. Those cutbacks, were fed into private industry-int o the. building supplies industry and so on-and have brought* about higher levels of unemployment. We strongly against urge the Government to expand its expenditure on these projects. They could easily be put into to get operation. The plans are there. They would quickly feed through into higher employment in and nothprivate enterprise and would have a very stimulating effect because of their multiplying effects. for a slightly higher income in We have stressed the need for the introduction of job creation programs. The Government on promised them at the last election. It said it would introduce such programs but has refused to do so despite the fact that previous Liberal Country Party governments have done so. Such programs could be introduced quickly. They econwould have high multiplying effects. A governbe ment which is sensitive to and concerned about not the unemployment should surely be concerned to introduce such programs. It is a scandal that they have not been introduced. Industry policy could be changed. The Prime Minister says that he is concerned to put jobsfirst,not to restructure people out ofjobs. What has he done in the shipbuilding industry? Tell the people of Newcastle and Whyalla that the Government is not restrucpeople out ofjobs. Clearly a strong change the unis needed in industrial policy as well.",25
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has,27
54,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Corangamite-Minister for con-Employment and Industrial Relations) (3.42)- I find this matter raised by the Opposition today a classic example of crocodile tears. Ifindit extracited ordinary that the Opposition, having caused the highest rate of unemployment in Australia and, even worse, supporting policies which would guarantee its continuation, should bring forward this matter. I find it extraordinary that the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) should speak in the way that he did. Let us look at what led to the present situation. I make no apology for repeatingfigureswhich I have given in this House previously because they bear repeating. When Labor came to office unemindustries ployment was 136 000. When it left office ployment was 328 000. Unemployment in the under-20 age group was approximately 80 000 when Labor came to office. It was 152 000 it left office. There is no doubt whatever who caused the high rate of unemployment in priced Australia. It is important to realise why it was This has caused and to avoid such a situation happening experienced again. In 1973, 1974 and 1975 average award perience andlabour. wages rose by approximately 56 per cent. domestic product during that same time rose approximately 6 per cent. There can be only one result offigureshke those. Because of the huge rise in the labour cost much of Australian indusrepresent try has been priced out of the market and natployed. Itthe urally this has led to reduced employment. The position is shown in stark clarity when one starts to make a few international comparisons. Over the most recent 12 months, despite some moderation in the rate of increase in wages Australia, hourly earnings in manufacturing increased by 16 per cent. In Canada they increased by 13.2 per cent, in the United States by 8.2 per cent, in Japan by France by 14.4 per cent, in Germany by 6.8 cent, and even in the United Kingdom by only 14.4 per cent. In the face of such a situation can the Opposition and those who support what the honourable member for Gellibrand has forward today expect Australian employers to compete in overseas markets, or for that matter expect Australian manufacturers to compete respect of imports on the home market? If such situation continues the hard won gains of the cent devaluation will be rapidly frittered away. Yet the announced policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and now I presume of the Opposition, is as a result of seeking total full indexation to bring about a continuation of just the sort of situation that they themselves created. Despite some slowing down in the rate of in wage rises, which I mentioned a moment are still way out of line with our major trading partners. There has been a tremendous loss competitiveness which thefiguresthat I have just show so clearly. We cannot regain our relative competitive position under the present wage or economic policies advocated by the Opposition and put forward again today by the honourable member for Gellibrand. Those policies created the high unemployment in this country. The Opposition persists in advocating policies which would guarantee its continuation. It has shown a completely selfish unconcern for the unemployed. It has put even more people in vulnerable industries at risk, particularly those which face competition from imports unemand which employ a considerable part of the work force. These industries have been put in a vulnerable position and as a result the people when they employ become vulnerable themselves. Excessive wage increases progressively have certain classes of labour out of the market. not applied to any extent to skilled or As we know from our exGross are still shortages of labourmany from reading reports there by areas. But the labour being priced outofof in many these the market is the inexperienced, the unskilled and, course, the young of this country. These peopleof great majority of the present unemis these groups that both the Opposition and the trade union movement hold themselves out to be greatly concerned about. In point of fact the trade umon movement, and again today the Opposition, have put forward the same in policies by pushing for whatever they reckon they can get in the marketplace regardless of the adverse economic indications, making the position of these disadvantaged groups even worse 11.8 per cent, in than it is now. per It would appear that the advocates of the policies that nave been put forward today are how guilty of gross hypocrisy. On the one hand they are appearing as the defenders and supporters of put the unemployed; on the other hand they are deliberately and coldbloodedly following policies which if successful would not only render the in present position of the unemployed even more a difficult but also would add to their numbers. reOne basic fact that the Opposition has always been unable to accept is the basic economic truth that unemployment, inflation and wage restraint are completely and totally interrelated. Where wage restraint is lacking inflation becomes inevitable, with all the consequences that I have just described. The real causes of the present situation are the excessive past wage demands and ago, we some cases present wage demands. By aligning itself with this element of the trade of union movement which throws over not only the interests and concern for its fellow workers but also for the unemployed, the Opposition is rectly contributing to the slowdown in the rate Australia's economic recovery. Employers becoming much more selective in their attitude to recruiting workers. They are requiring broader range of skills and in many instances higher standards and that is making it constantly more and more difficult for those whom I mighttify describe as being at the margin of the work to gain employment. Surveys were undertaken, I understand, ing the time of the Labor Government which indicated that there was a hard core of unemployment in this country of at least 60 000 people. Those people were not considered to eligible for sickness benefits or unemployment benefits. I understand that the report concluded that neither should they be considered as being in the normal unemployment category. I preagainsume that as this was a fairly recent survey the numbers have not altered greatly. To this number is now being added those in the force with minimal skills and/or minimal ence; that is, those people who are extending that tember margin. The margin which was previously of the order of 60 000 people is now being constantly widened by the sort of policies and the sort of that. actions about which the honourable member for Gellibrand has been talking. Because of wage rent rates, employers are unable to employ or are at best very cautious about employing people. Nonetheless, despite the number of registrations for employment, particularly those in category I have described, there are innumerable documented cases which continue to pour into my office and those of supporters of the ment, and I would strongly suspect into the knows offices of members of the Opposition ployers being unable tofilladvertised vacancies even in areas where registrations for unemployment are at a very high level. I doubt that this is due to any one reason; it is due probably a combination of reasons. But whatever the encing reasons, the fact remains that quite well paid jobs are not beingfilled,even in areas where the level of registered unemployed is fairly high. It was because of this situation and also cause a fundamental review has not been underinto taken for nearly 30 years, that we instituted inquiry into the Commonwealth Employment of Service. Honourable members may remember that a question was asked of me on this subject during question time today. The inquiry is being undertaken by Mr John Norgard who will be looking at the sort of problems that I have been outlining. Clearly there are problems in satisfying the requirements of those who diseeking labour and those who are seeking jobs. of There is an imbalance, or something wrong anyare way, when those 2 sectors cannot be brought together in areas and at times of advertised high a unemployment. Mr Norgard's report, which as I mentioned earlier today I hope to have before the middle of this year, should enable us to identhose problems or combinations of problems force more clearly and should spell out the action required to correct them. But m the meantime the Government has instituted a series of measures durthat I will explain in a moment. What did the Opposition do when confronted with the problems that it itself had created? Its be only reaction was to institute the Regional Employment Development scheme which proved so costly that subsequently the Opposition itself had to abandon it. Consistently since then, and",27
55,Mr WILLIS,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"You abolished it. It was still work operating when you came into office. experi Mr STREET-You abolished it in about Sep1975. The Labor Government abolished it. It made the decision to abolish it and that was The Opposition, having abolished it, is now measureadvocating that it be reintroduced. The only that it can suggest to deal with this cursituation is one which it itself tried and abandoned.",29
56,Mr HAYDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,I rise to order. The Minister the knows because I wrote him a letter,29
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Mr Lucock)GovernOrder! The honourable member for Oxley that that is not a point of order. I suggest too, of emthat he resume his seat.",29
58,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"By contrast, the Government has instituted a series of measures aimed at to specific groups in the community who are experiemployment difficulties at present. I mentionfirstthe extension of the National Employment and Training scheme, which at the time the previous Government introduced it we acknowledged was excellent in concept but which fell bedown badly in administration. When we came government approximately 7500 people the were in training under the NEAT scheme, many them taking formal full-time tertiary courses. We changed the direction of the NEAT scheme; we shifted the emphasis to in-plant training, that is, people getting training for jobs in which there is a labour market demand and at the same time just having them in productive employment. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that there are are now more than 14000 people in the NEAT scheme, of whom more than 11 000 are time training while engaged in productive emmember ployment. Of that 11 000, some 4000 are the young people who come under the special youthmarried employment training program for those aged beknow tween 15 and 19 years. We have also recently introduced the comunemployment pletely new apprenticeship scheme known as is CRAFT-Commonwealt h Rebate Apprenticetered ship Full-time Training-which has had a very favourable response from all sections of the comemployed. munity including, I am pleased to say, the trade union movement. We have introduced prebeen apprenticeship and accelerated apprenticeship training schemes in conjunction with the States. would like to mention briefly the community youth support scheme which, I am pleased to bea able to inform the House, now has something like 60 projects in operation all over Australia and involving some 12 000 young people. Sustained reduction in unemployment can come only from the control of inflation. If that achieved, any improvement can be only temporService. ary. The policies of the Opposition cannot be cessful in controlling inflation. They have tried and they have failed. We cannot spend way out of unemployment.",29
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA, ployment Order! The Minister's time has expired.,30
60,Mr ARMITAGE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"The Minpeople, ister for Employment and Industrial Relations subject, (Mr Street) will not admit that the Governpublicity. ment's policies have failed completely and utterly. The Government came to office on an saying: undertaking that it would reduce unemployment. I Unemployment has since increased, and in some that. areas very dramatically. I will give a very good example. In the Australian Capital Territory rate of unemployment has gone up from 1 per The cent to 5 per cent. Today more than 5000 people are unemployed in the Australian Capital Territory. I can give another example, namely, in the western suburbs of Sydney, in my own area. In the areas administered by the Commonwealth The Employment Service offices at Blacktown and Mount Druitt the total number of unemployed as I at the end of January was 7107, of whom 52.24found per cent were young people under the age of years. This is the important thing: I checked morning on the increase in the area administeredfactory by these 2 offices since this Government came to to power. The total has gone up by 32 per cent since then. For people under the age of 21 years the total has gone up by 44.4 per cent. That result of the policies of this Government.",30
61,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Many people are not registered. in part Mr ARMITAGE-What the honourable says is quite correct. There are 2 groups of persons who are not registered. For a start, women have given up the ghost. They that it is impossible to get employment and they no longer bother registering. Furthermore, because of the attitude this Government took to benefits for school leavers, there still a big swag of school leavers to be regisat the end of this month. In other words, there are large elements which are not yet Is it any wonder that this situation has arisen when we consider the policies which have carried out by this Government-devalua tion, the skimming off of spending power by the I new Medibank arrangements and expenditure cuts in employment-giving areas? As I have said, very good example is right here in Canberra. If the Government cuts expenditure in employinggiving areas it must create unemployment. I mention the attitude the Government has is not adopted to the Commonwealth Employment It has deliberately imposed staff ceilings, suc-with the result that today fewer people are been employed in the Commonwealth Employment ourService, particularly in New South Wales, than when the crisis began. This is a ridiculous situation. It must mean that the Commonwealth EmService cannot fulfil its duties in finding employment opportunities for our particularly our youth. While on that I refer to a case that has received a bit of The general manager of the Fidax Engineering company, at Silverwater is reported as just don't believe there's unemployment. I won't buy the He is also reported as saying: factory has been advertising in vain since Christmas for 8 unskilled and semi-skilled workers.

It insists that thispeople provide their own transport because the is situated in a place that is very difficult get to by public transport. The company insists that its employees start at 6 o'clock in the morning. I also found out that it had gone to the Comis the monwealth Employment Service, which had filled 15 out of the 17 vacancies it had last year. This is completely contrary to what has been reported in the newspapers. The Commonwealth Employment Service did not hear from the company this year until 8 February, and it has filled 4 vacancies since then. From what I can gather, the real problem of this company is that it cannot keep people. Employees leave or their services are terminated. Obviously there is a very big turnover of labour. As the company apparently is employing people who are normally prisoners, undoubtedly it is taking the opportunity to exploit the penal system. I think this needs to be mquired into very carefully.",30
62,Mr LES MCMAHON,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,It wants them on the cheap.,31
63,Mr ARMITAGE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Of course. It is exploiting cheap labour. I raise the question of the investment allowance. This Government has put $600m a year into an investment allowance. This will make industry more capital intensive and therefore throw more and more people out of work. I think these funds would be far better used for an unemployment relief scheme. We should look very carefully at this issue. We are throwing away millions of dollars a year on unemployment benefits. In the normal course, if there was an unemployment relief scheme, we could look forward to those funds going into projects which would be of lasting value to the community. That is not happening today. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) was not permitted to make this point, but I recall his mentioning on the day he presented the Hayden Budget- a veryfineBudget-that the Whitlam Government would be making more money available for the Regional Employment Development scheme. I understand that the honourable member for Oxley has written to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations pointing out tins very fact to him. So, the Minister was being less than frank with the House when he made the remarks he made earlier this afternoon. What is required is an unemployment relief scheme. Quite apart from the humanitarian aspects-man' srightto work and the dignity of man-the facts are that we are throwing money down the drain and getting nothing in return. It would be far better if we were employing people on community projects which would be of long term value to us as a whole. Secondly, I believe there must be a complete revision of the apprenticeship scheme, not just the patch-work that is done every now and again by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister recently announced that 1000 more apprenticeships would be available for the whole of Australia. This is only peanuts.",31
64,Mr LES JOHNSON,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,And no jobs for them.,31
65,Mr ARMITAGE,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"As the honourable member for Sydney says, there will be no jobs for them when theyfinishtheir training. We ought to have an apprenticeship scheme for those young people who are out of work today. As they get older they will find it increasingly hard to find work. For example, in 12 months time if they are still out of work employers will not take them on because they would have to pay a higher award rate. So employers are taking on people who are completely unskilled. It would be far better if these young people spent 2 years at a technical college and at the end of that time were indentured, preferably with a government department, because government departments turn out the best apprentices in the country. Every trade union official knows that. These are the important issues at which we should be looking. I believe also that it is imperative that the Government lift the staff ceiling imposed on the Commonwealth Employment Service. I know that recently the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) ordered an increase of 101 staff for the CES for the whole of Australia. Once again that is only touching the problem, it is not overcoming the problem. The new Department of Finance stopped the CES from recruiting. That decision has been reversed and the CES can now recruit an extra 101 people. But probably 20 to 25 extra staff could be used in my area alone, and my electorate is only one of 127 federal electorates. We should take note of what was said in the recent report of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. It said that there is no prospect in thisfinancialyear of a reduction in unemployment. In other words, unemployment will become worse. This Government is soil not taking any positive action to reverse the ridiculous economic policies which it introduced and which it has followed throughout its period of office, nor is it taking action in setting up new employment-giving schemes to employ our people.",31
66,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,31
67,Mr GROOM,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,I am very pleased to have this chance to participate in what I believe is a most important debate. The two honourable members from the Opposition side who have spoken suggested that the answers are simple and that it is easy to overcome the unemployment crisis. But they would not accept any blame for the mistakes which their Government made between 1972 and the end of 1975. There was no admission of guilt of any kind. I suggest to the House that if we are considering a record unemployment figure we should consider the Government's record number of people which the Labor Party Government put out of work in its 3 years in office. Let us look at the figures. dicate the sheer hypocrisy of the comments made by the 2 speakers on the other side. When Labor came to office in 1972 there were 136 769 people unemployed and when it left office at the end of 1975 there were 328 705 people registered as unemployed. That is a sigcause nificantfigure.Honourable members opposite should think about that figure and ask thempriced selves whether they are proud of it. During Labor's reign 191 936 Australians were forced out of work. Opposition members pretend to the saviours of the working people. They pretend to do everything for the working people. Look what happened. In so many ways they did great harm to the lot of the working people of country. Thefigureof 191 936 people put out of work in that period reminds us of that fact. Mr Keith Johnson-You have an all time confess record.,31
68,Mr GROOM,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Honourable members opposite ask what is happening now. Let us look at the situation. I think it is important to compare the figures. When we came to office in December 1975 there were 343 939 people registered as employed, thanks to the policies of the Labor continues. Government. Now there are 354 989 people unemployed. That is the importantfigure.About 10 000 people have lost their jobs during this period, but when one takes into accountMr Keith Johnson-Are you proud of that?",32
69,Mr GROOM,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"We are not proud of it. We aptions preciate the problems. There is nothing more tragic than people being out of work, and we are doing what we can. In the 3 years of Labor administration 191 000 people were forced of work, and 10 000 in the last 12 months. I mit that the unemployment situation is not disand similar to a slippery slide. I am surprised that solution. there is no laughter. It is easy to go down the slippery slide but it is much harder to stay thing that we have done since we came to has been to stabilise the situation to a very extent. We have stabilised the numbers of people becoming unemployed, and that is the important thing. It has not been easy to achieve. I appreciutions ate that there are problems in looking at the ation in purely numerical terms when we are dealing with human beings, but taking into account that the Regional Employment by Development scheme was being run down when we came to office, very few people have become unemployed during the period of the present reign. I suggest that that is a sigAustralian nificant achievement. They inThe causes of unemployment are many. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has spoken about some of them and I do not intend to canvass them in the time available to me. There is no doubt, as the community realises, that the wage spiral encouraged by the Labor Government has been the primary of inflation and the primary cause of unemployment. The tragedy is that employees have themselves out of jobs because of the wage spiral encouraged by the Labor Government. Young kids in Australia who have be qualifications and who have work capacity can still find work. The unfortunate ones are the at young people with lower qualifications and a lower work capacity. They are the ones about this whom we must be concerned. The price of labour today is too high and employers are looking for value from their employees. I am not speaking on behalf of the Government when I that it will be very difficult indeed to get the unemployment figure down; but on any reasonable analysis of thefiguresone can see that there has been an improvement in the situation. I believe that there will continue to be an improvement as times goes on, and the people of unAustralia will recognise that improvement as it We have heard from the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) their ideas on how we can overcome our problems. Perhaps one is entitled to be cynical about their suggesbecause of their failure and the failure of their Government to act between 1972 and 1975. It seems to me from listening to their comments that what they are suggesting is that we must out increase government expenditure. They say: sub- 'Spend more and more of the taxpayers' money you will solve all the problems'. It is the old level. One Mr WILLIS - That is nonsense. power Mr GROOM-That is what they are sayinglarge 'Spend more and more of the taxpayers' money'-bu t they are ignoring all the best advice that is available at the present time. Labor's soljust will not work, as the RED scheme did situnot work. I think that Labor wants to reintroduce the RED scheme. Digging holes and filling them up again was all that was achieved that scheme, and then the previous Government wiped it. I am pleased that an inquiry is being conducted at the moment by Mr Norgard into the CES and related matters. I believe that the community wants to look very closely at the CES and its operation. Moreover the community is concerned about the unemploymentfigureand wants it analysed properly. The Minister has mentioned a number of anomalies that occur when employers who appear to be genuine people are saying that there is no unemployment crisis and they cannot get people to fill jobs. This is happening all over the country. Mind you, many decent Labor supporters admit that this is being said all over the country. In fact, some of them are saying it themselves. So this inquiry might uncover some of the problems. One example which comes to mind is the situation in Queenstown in my electorate. Honourable members on both sides of the House will remember the problems of the Mount Lyell Railway and Mining Co. at Queenstown. Some 300 people were retrenched from that company. I am told by officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service that in Queenstown now only 11 people are registered for employment-1 1 people out of some 300 people who were retrenched. We see how high the bald unemploymentfiguresare, yet people who are really keen to get work and have a good work record are able to get jobs, even in a State like Tasmania where there is a high unemploymentfigure.I am not saying there are not genuine people. There are many genuine people around who are out of work and who want jobs, there is no doubt about that. But honourable members opposite do not understand the unemploymentfigures.With respect, I do not think the Government fully understands the unemploymentfigures.I think thefigureshave to be analysed. I hope that Mr Norgard will investigate these figures and perhaps come up with some answers and explain some of the anomalies. This Government is doing a good deal to leviate the unemployment situation in this counmanagers try. The most significant action it has taken been to try to achieve recovery in the economy, and I believe that recovery is under way. It very gradual indeed, but it is under way. If honourable members look at the situation objecits tively they must agree with that statement. Only by achieving a recovery in the economy will get these young unemployed people into the work force. As I have said, I believe this recovery is under way. We are on the road back. It will be easy. Honourable members opposite laugh at thefiguresI have quoted, but if they look at them objectively they will see that there are signs of significant improvement, and I think the public is recognising that this improvement is occurring.",32
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"The discussion is now concluded. HMA NAVAL DOCKYARD, WILLIAMSTOWN, VICTORIA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",33
71,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA," I move: That, in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to cany out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: HMA Naval Dockyard, Williamstown, Vic-Modernisatio n of faculties, stage 2. The proposal is for the provision of improved ship refitting facilities and outfitting and administration facilities. The proposed work comprises: New Nelson Pier West, crosswharf and workshop; extension to existing pipe shop; new dockyard store, oil fuel installation and gate house; temporary fleet maintenance party workshop; extension of electrical, mechanical and hydraulic services, including provision of new boiler house; and services tunnel extension. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $24m at July 1976 prices.",33
72,Mr BRYANT,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA," I take it that the Public Accounts Committee is happy with this proposal. I hope that the expenditure of $24m will eventually put the Williamstown Naval Dockyard into such a situation that Australia will not need to import ships, particularly warships. The desperate situation in the Australian shipbuilding and ship repair industry is now public knowledge. All the evidence that has come before the defence committee which is looking into this matter indicates of course that Australian dockyards ought to have been re-equipped years ago. There is no evidence from anywhere to indialcate that Australian workers and Australian given the appropriate equipment canhas not compete with anyone else. I hope that by modernising the faculties at the dockyard it will is mean that there will no longer be any need for Australia to look overseas for the manufacture of naval vessels. Perhaps at some time the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) could give the we House a run down on the future position of our dockyards. I guess the information is in a document somewhere. I think it would be of general not assistance to the community if there were a definitive statement on the effective future of such places and particularly on their capacity to a build naval vessels completely and, if that is not the situation, what has to be done to our dockyards to achieve that position.",33
73,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"In the first place, this matter was referred to the Public Works Committee. I think the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) referred to the Public Accounts Committee. Perhaps it would not be inappropriate to read from the report an extract from the evidence taken by that Committee. This is relevant to the inquiry made by the honourable member.",34
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Mr Lucock)Order! I assume no one else is desirous of speaking on this subject? Mr Keith Johnson- I shall take the opportunity, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank you very much for giving me that opportunity.",34
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,We are now in the position that the Minister is closing the debate by replying to the honourable member for Wills. Perhaps the Minister can assist the House. I think it would be helpful if he concluded his remarks now and then the honourable member for Burke could be granted leave to make a short statement.,34
76,Mr BRYANT,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Why cannot the honourable member for Burke continue? If the honourable member for Burke, who will provide a most apE ropriate accompaniment to the speech of the onourable member for Wills, puts his view now the Minister can then close the debate because in another 24 hours or so the whole thing will be off the notice paper and will not come up again. So we might as well debate the subject properly.",34
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,Perhaps the honourable member for Burke could continue. Mr Keith Johnson-The House is debating the motion that certain works should proceed. Therefore I do not need leave to speak. I can speak as a matter of right because I am speaking to the motion. Is that right?,34
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,Yes. I had pointed out to the honourable member for Burke that I had called the Minister because no one else rose. In the strict technical sense the Minister has closed the debate. In the circumstances I think it would be best if the honourable member for Burke were to commence his remarks and speak to the motion which is that certain work shall proceed. I call the honourable member for Burke.,34
79,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA," I take up the point raised by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). The report of the Public Works Committee will quite clearly show to him that stage 2 of the proposal to carry out certain work at HMA Naval Dockyard, Williamstown, is not related to the construction of vessels. It is for the refitting of vessels. Stage 1 of the works proposal which was approved some 2 years ago is related to the construction of vessels. There is some very interesting evidence- I invite the honourable member for Wills to read it-in regard to the construction of ships of war at the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. Thefirststage of the project is not yet completed and the cost of thefirststage has escalated rather dramatically over the last couple of years to the extent that from memory I think it has almost doubled the original estimate. The reason the work has been slowly progressing is because of a change of attitude by government. I am not playing party politics in this matter. Both governments have changed their minds about having ships constructed at the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. It is true that there is a capacity there to build ships of war. It is true that the yard is capable of constructing ships, and ships of a very high quality. However, unless orders are placed with the dockyard by the Australian Government then all the capacity in the world is of no avail. I might just say in conclusion that I hope that honourable members will pay careful attention to both reports-the present report and the previous report-o n the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. I think that after reading the reports honourable members would agree that Williamstown Naval Dockyard would probably be one of the best equipped dockyards in Australia.",34
80,Mr LES JOHNSON,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"Hughes) (4.24)Without keeping the House for any undue length of time may I commend the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) for exposing a range of considerations which have not been referred to by the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay). I must say that I am personally intrigued with the proposal- I am certainly not antagonistic to it; I would not want to give that impression-that there ought to be extensions to the HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown at a time when dockyard facilities in Australia are standing in heavy surplus and retrenchments are the order of the day. Perhaps there are some special requirements for naval dockyards. But I know that at Garden Island in Sydney there are frequent problems concerning the availability of employment and a very great degree of uncertainty pervades that establishment. That has certainly been the case in Newcastle. I think that the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay), in seeking the endorsement of the House for this expenditure-frankly, I do not know the amount that is involved in the construction of the Naval Dockyard at Williamstown and the modernisation of facilities there-ought to be making out a case ofjustification. There are shipyards in many parts of Australia and there are facilities at HMAS Stirling as well. It would seem to me that if one is seeking to justify the substantial expenditure which must be involved for this purpose, in a situation where there is excess capacity in the commercial shipbuilding area, it is necessary to provide information about the deployment of thefleet.How much of ourfleet,for example, is to be sensibly deployed in the southern parts of Australia as compared with the west, the north and the north-eastern coast line? Is Melbourne, in fact, the place to locate this facility. I put it to the House that the Minister appears to me to be treating this matter in a fairly cursory and cavalier way. As one who has had the job on many occasions, as a former Minister for Works, of justifying public works expenditure, I have always found it necessary and to be an obligation to equip myself with a case that I thought would struction be adequate to satisfy both the Parliament and necessary. the people. The amount of money involved -$24m-is no mean amount. I know that the Minister is the builder and that the Minister Defence (Mr Killen) might be expected to know more about these things than the Minister for Construction, but the Government has an gation to make out a case in these times when it possible to spend $24m in ways that could be tremely advantageous to many areas of deprivarence tion in Australia. I ask the Minister either cate his capacity to placate the anxiety of Parliament about this matter or to call for help from some other Minister.",34
81,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"in reply-Migh t I say that looked around the chamber earlier was no one standing. I had no wish to close the debate then if anyone had wished to make tribution. I think that the remarks of able member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) were not in particularly good taste, especially having regard to the fact that he was the Minister with this responsibility in the previous Government. time. The remarks of the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) seem to me to be entirely appropriate and I think they answered the criticisms of some of the other speakers. The honourable member for Hughes is a former Chairman of the PubUc Works CommitteeMr Kelly- A distinguished one.",35
82,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"The present Chairman has reminded me that he was a distinguished chairman and is, I think, currently the Deputy Chairman of the PubUc Works Committee. So the Committee is in good hands. I need to go on and complete the document which I was reading earUer. The Public Works Committee, reporting favourably on the construction of this work, has commented: The Committee note with concern that there are no specific proposals for a destroyer construction program and suggest that other avenues be explored to explore the maximum utilisation of ship construction facilities. In regard to this comment the Government has commenced investigations into the concepts, characteristics and costs of destroyers, preferably for construction in Australia. The use of Williamstown Naval Dockyard for the construction of new destroyers wiUfigurepredominantly in these considerations. Constructions of other naval vessels will also be examined against the background of capability and work load at the dockyard.

Upon the concurof the House in thisresolution,detailed to indiplanning can proceed in accordance with the the recommendations of the Committee. I refer aU honourable members interested in this matter to the report and recommend that they read it because it is a very interesting and comprehensive and there is a whole page dealing with I need, which is the matter raised by the honourand there able member for Hughes. a conQuestion resolved in the affirmative. the honourCUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first Second Reading",35
83,Mr HOWARD,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill provides for the validation until 30 June 1977 of duties collected in pursuance of Customs Tariff Proposals 1 to 5 introduced into the Parlia-was ment last Tuesday and not enacted to date. a Under section 226 of the Customs Act the collecbecome tion of duties in pursuance of Customs Tariff posals is protected against legal challenge months or until the close of the session of Parlia3.2 ment, whichever occursfirst.The introduction and passage of a validation Bill is therefore necessary machinery measure which takes over from section 226 pending the introduction Customs Tariff Amendment Bill which will mally enact the tariff changes contained in the Proposals. It is anticipated a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill will be introduced during the autumn session to cover the Proposals included in this Bill. Honourable members will have a further opporDecember tunity at that time to debate the Proposals or general questions of Government tariff policies. Full details of the changes concerned were supquarter plied to honourable members at the time of introduction of the relevant Tariff Proposals. commend the Bill to the House. Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith.",35
84,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"The people involved in the industries covered by amendment have not been knocking on our door complaining about the recommendations. the Nevertheless, I want to use the opportunity, as about. do some of my colleagues, to say something about what the Opposition considers is occurring Mr YOUNG-Debate in manufacturing industry and some of the probalways lems with which we will perhaps be confronted. Obviously the Government is facing some dithat lemma on this matter as a result of the 2 queswe tions that have been asked from the back Commission benches today and yesterday about the policies walk on one reports, that it ought to be adopting. In terms of the role of the Industries Assistance Commission or the suggested amendments to the role of the Temindustry. porary Assistance Authority, obviously there are a lot of question marks hanging over the role future of manufacturing industry and it would expect that the national Parliament would be taking more than a passing interest in what which might occur. Before I turn to the actual impact of the reports or the reports of the Temporary Assistwith ance Authority on the industries themselves, me say that in my tour of industry during the Christmas break and subsequently, I found a number of industries were in the throes ing decisions about their future and about future employment that may be available in those industries. Yesterday an announcement made that the December quarter resulted in 6 per cent increase in the cost of living. This will the subject of a national wage case comPromencing next week. Of that 6 per cent increase, if for 6 we take the word of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), per cent is made up of the Medibank charges or the change in the health scheme arrangements a in Australia. The 3.2 per cent of the increase should not be subject to any debate because the of a Government promised that the 3.2 per cent forwould not be opposed. So the argument will revolve around whether 3.2 per cent is passed on or whether it is 3.2 per cent plus 2.8 per cent. So one can imagine that there is a fair dilemma in the minds of those who manage and work in our manufacturing industries throughout Australia. That is the situation which applies to the quarter. But then we are faced with any the problem of the devaluation and what that might do to the consumer price index for the first of 1977. Most people seem to be predicting-I do not have the expertise in this subject. I and I do not make the prediction myself- a 5 per cent increase in the CPI for thefirstquarter of 1977. That is thefigurewhich is most commonly used.",36
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA," Order! this I wonder whether the honourable member for Port Adelaide would care to tie his remarks to Bill so that I can understand what they are on Bills such as this revolves around the impact upon manufacturing industry. If we are looking at the things are going to affect manufacturing industry, can hardly leave aside the relationship between pay increases and Industries Assistance otherwise we are asked to leg. I am just looking at the problems that will be confronted by manufacturing Mr Bourchier- I rise on a point of order to ask and through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, exactly what the honourable member is saying and whether what he is saying has any relationship to the Bill is a Bill to vaUdate duties collected in pursuance of Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 1 to 5.1 suggest that the remarks of the honourable memIAC ber for Port Adelaide have nothing at all to do the Bill and that he should be asked to let confine his remarks to the Bill. that Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-From memory, I of makthink that the honourable member for Port the Adelaide has made a vaUd point, namely, that traditionally a fairly wide ranging debate has been allowed on Customs Validation Bills. Nevertheless, I do not think the Chair ought look that leniently on a speech that does not to the validation of those Bills. I suggest to honourable member for Port Adelaide that as he proceeds he should tie his remarks to the Bill.",36
86,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"I am not wasting thetimeof the House. If I wanted to waste half an hour I could simply read from one of the reports. I could that quite simply. I am not taking up very time of the House. I am merely putting forward what I consider to be the great questions have to be answered by manufacturing industry this year. and the proposition that the Government has to understand the position in which it is placing manufacturing industry. It may be to the delight of some honourable members sitting on the benches opposite that there is the demise manufacturing industry. To my mind, there is sad lack of understanding by the entire Governout ment of what is happening in manufacturing industry. I do not say that unkindly; I think charge would be made by many representatives of employer groups. In fact, thefirstparagraph of the editorial in the latest issue of the Manufacto turers Monthly seems to me to be quite damning on the question of the way in which the Governamend ment is dealing with manufacturing industry. The 5 IAC reports we have before us deal with manufacturing industry. We cannot isolate them and say that the industries dealt with in those reports will boom while all the others will go to House. the wall or that they are not being affected by IAC. This is what the Manufacturers Monthly says in its latest report: The draft White Paper on manufacturing pared by the Department of Industry and Commerce simply been another effort in governmental ad hockery, pidity and ineptitude. So what I am saying to the Government is that who live the charges that are made-namely , that perhaps the IAC ought to be let run loose at a time there is some sort of economic stability-is not industries the case that ought to be made out when we have said a situation such as that which we have at the mo-other ment, namely, an economic recession. As I said at the outset, I have not had people knocking at my door asking me to protest about the changes cause that are proposed in the reports under discussion, the moment. but obviously great changes are taking place in doing-this relates industry and the Government is not acknowledging them, nor is it bringing forward any policies to deal with them. As I said, you cannot separate engender that problem and the problems that industry is going to confront, whether it be manufacturing industry or primary industry, in regard to the national wage case which will begin next week the national wage case which will follow. As to said, the Government has made a promise in referrelation to the additional Medibank component the of the CPI of 3.2 per cent. If the Government keeps its promise all industry in Australia obviously has to gear up for at least a 3.2 per cent wage increase. The trade unions will set about making out a case in relation to the 2.8 per cent increase which resulted from the devaluation. At do the next national wage case which follows the much one commencing next week arguments will be put forward for another 5 per cent increase. So that manufacturing industry faces many problems It cannot be said: 'Look, let us see manufacturing industry decline, because if we see the decline back of manufacturing industry we will assist the of export industries'. At the moment you cannot a talk in those terms, with at least 350 000 people of work. No honourable member opposite, except perhaps those who live at Tarlee, can put that forward the argument that at the moment, at a time of economic recession, that is a sensible way of trying to solve the problems. I simply wished raise those questions. I hope also that before any legislation is introduced which seeks to the Industries Assistance Commission Act a statement is made in the House so that we can discuss those matters and perhaps get a clearer idea of the form that the amendments will follow when they are introduced into the the I put forward seriously those views about the position in which we nowfindmanufacturing industry, because many jobs no longer exist. My industry precolleague, the honourable member for has Gellibrand (Mr Willis), led the debate earlier stutoday on unemployment. Obviously many jobs now no longer exist in manufacturing industry which used to offer an opportunity tor people in the cities. It is untrue to say that the when population is moving away from where the are situated in Australia. It cannot be that we are providing new opportunities or new employment opportunities for people in parts of Australia. It is untrue to say that perhaps the mining industry can take up the slack created by manufacturing industry, be that also is not happening in Australia at What the Government ought to be very much to the operations of the 2 authorities-is seeing what it can do to some sort of lift in manufacturing the time being. will put people back in work for industry which The present situation affects honourable memorbers opposite more than it does honourable I members on this side of the House because with their present numbers they now represent of industry in Australia.

These things ought to be looked at that we can overcome the great social crime which has been committed in Australia. I refer the ignorance of the pUght of the people who are unemployed.

87,Mr MALCOLM ERASER,ROYAL VISIT AND SILVER JUBILEE,"by leave- I thank the honourable would member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) for rangements agreeing to interrupt his remarks. I wish to report to this House on the forthcomof ing visit to Australia of Her Majesty, the Queen of Australia, and our plans to commemorate Majesty's Silver Jubilee. The Queen will arrive in Canberra on 7 March, accompanied by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh, and wiU spend 3 weeks in Australia. Parliament is to be prorogued and the Queen wiU open a new sesof sion of Parliament on Tuesday, 8 March. She will then visit aU States and the Northern Territory. Mr Speaker, we are delighted that the Queen has chosen to visit Australia as one of thefirstevents of her Jubilee year. I know that PhiUp wiU receive the warmest welcome from all Australians. There exists a special affection and deep respect on the part of Australians for the Queen, which will be further strengthened Her Majesty's visit here next month. I know great numbers of Australians will wish to see Queen in person while she is here. Wherever possible, arrangements will be made to ensure that Commonwealth Government employees are afforded the opportunity to see Her Majesty. Government urges aU States, private industry, other employers, and educational institutions take similar action so that no Australian is denied the opportunity to see Her Majesty at some point during her tour. In addition to the formal opening of ParUato ment, Her Majesty's role as Queen of Australia will be highlighted immediately after her arrival most on 7 March. At a luncheon at Government the Governor General, as ChanceUor of the Order of Australia, wiU present to Her Majfull esty her badge as Sovereign of the Order. The to badge has been made by a skilled Australian in craftsman, Stuart Devlin, who has designed all so the insignia for the Order of Australia. The badge depicts the Australian wattleflowerand is to made of gold and set with yeUow diamonds. On 9 March, an investiture will be held at Government House at which Her Majesty wiU present thefirstawards in the Order of Australia. She also confer a number of knighthoods and to wiU make thefirstpresentation of Australian I bravery decorations, including 2 posthumous The Government has decided to make a personal gift to Her Majesty as a symbol of the respect and affection felt for her by all Australians. Knowing her long and active interest in thoroughbred racing-a n interest which is shared number of Australians-w e felt that it be appropriate if we presented Her Majesty with an Australian thoroughbred. Arare being concluded with the South Australian breeder and trainer, Mr Colin Hayes Lindsay Park Stud, for a number of foals to be bred to the European racing calendar from the Her well known sire Without Fear. The mares concerned include High Desire, Pearl of Albion, Portal, Defiant and Rose of Kempton. The best foal will be selected and trained and then sent to England for presentation to the Queen on behalf the people of Australia. This is a long term project. I am sure that all Australians wiU take a keen interest in the development of the foals, and in the success of the selected foal when it carries the Queen's colours in Europe and hopefully to she and Prince victory after victory. Australian participation in the commemoration of the Silver Jubilee will not end with the by departure of the Queen from Australia on 30 that March. As announced on behalf of the the Governor General on 16 November last, the Queen has approved the institution of a medal to be known as 'The Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal' to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of The her accession to the Throne. The medal will be struck for issue as a personal award from the to Queen to people from aU walks of life in Australia, the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries who have rendered service to the Crown or to the community. The Commonwealth and State governments have agreed participate in the awards. It is expected that the Australian list of recipients will be announced within the next few-months. The medals will be distributed in June. Other memorative events will include the issue of a deductible. special SOc coin, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) on 1 November last year, and 2 special commemorative stamps issued by the Post Office on 2 February. A major event of the Silver Jubilee commembe oration in Britain will be the special thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in London on 7 June. Australia will be represented at the and the Government will facilitate the attendtalented ance of those Australians invited to the service. Each arm of Australia's defence Services will send representatives to the United Kingdom take part in various events there during It is proposed that 3 Australian ships-the craft carrier, HMAS Melbourne, the missile desdevelop troyer, HMAS Brisbane, and an Oberon class submarine-atten d the naval review at Spithead, Portsmouth, on 28 June. The Army Band will flyassistance to London in July in a RAAF CI30 Hercules to take part in the Royal Tournament at Earls Court. The Royal Australian Air Force will send 2 aircraft-an Fl 11C supported by a CI30 Hernot cules-to the Royal Air Force review on 29 July at Finningley, South Yorkshire. The Government believes that the churches Australia would wish to mark the commemoration of the Jubilee. Church leaders have been approached, inviting them to give consideration to the holding of appropriate services. I am that Australians of aU faiths will appreciate the opportunity to participate in denominational ecumenical services to mark this special occasion. Honourable members will know that an its appeal has been launched in the United Kingnational dom-the Queen's SUver Jubilee Appeal-t commemorate Her Majesty's JubUee. The United Kingdom Appeal, which is led by His Royal Highness Prince Charles, is by the spirited Queen's wish dedicated to young people.

I am honoured to announce that His Royal Highmade shortly. ness Prince Charles has consented to be Royal Patron of the Australian Appeal.

Miller to serve in an honorary capacity as Chairman of the Organisation. Mr Miller is admirably suited to this task, being a leading theatrical producer and an outstanding personality in Australian business and cultural life. He has generously placed his talents at the service of this and preceding governments. Mr Miller will be assisted by a small team of skilled personnel to help to plan and arrange selected activities. It is the Government's earnest desire that Her Majesty's visit to Australia and the ver Jubilee year commemoration be a happy and memorable one for the Queen and for all Australians. We are confident that the people of Australia will ensure by the warmth of their welcome to our Queen that her visit to Australia will be a highlight of her Silver Jubilee. NA Second Reading Debate resumed.",38
88,Mr YOUNG,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"It is not my intention to detain the House any longer. I understand there will be other speakers in this debate. I put it to the Government that it ought to be looking seriously at the question of employment in the manufacturing industry, and I have taken the opportunity given in debating this Bill to say so. I hope that other honourable members from both sides of the House will support the sentiments I am expressing.  support the Customs Tariff Validation Bill. I feel that it is abouttimethat we stopped some of nonsense which has been spoken for some time between 2 groups which have been trying to diWe vide this country. I refer to the free trade group and the so-called protectionist group. For too long too many people have asserted that what is happening in this country is not good for the country. Tariffs are an historical means of proAustralia. tecting industries against unfair competition, against dumping, against low wages and against different standards of living which exist througha out the world. Tariffs are an extremely important means of keeping Australians in jobs. Tariffs the means of keeping this Government and this world. country in a position which will ensure the of our country. Australia- I say this deliberately to the free traders-is one nation. I am fed sick and tired of hearing the rubbish which has been spoken by a minority of people representaside ing a minority of interests. Those people are tremely selfish. The free trade groups seek to vide this Australia of ours. I say to them very briefly: No protection, no jobs. I would like to hear what they intend doing with the people who do not have jobs and how they intend paying for those people who are unemployed. I think it is necessary to get the whole situation in correct perspective by going back to the period immediately after the Second World War. At thattimewe had come through a conflict and we found that we could not produce certain types of items which were necessary for our defence. We could not produce radios, torches or a whole Silrange of items which are so necessary for our daily living. The man who led this country in a great government, Sir Robert Menzies-then Bob Menzies-go t together a team of people and said: 'What are we going to do to ensure that this nation is not faced with the type of problem as we had during the conflict of 1939-45?' He worked with a group of people. They decided to 1977 adopt the program which became known as the import replacement policy. Under that scheme if an English or Hong Kong made radio was imported for £1 and it cost the Australian producer 30s. to make the same type of item a tariff of 10s. was imposed. That policy applied right across the length and breadth of our nation. Out of that we grew substantially in population. We were able to bring a number of migrants to this country and provide them with jobs. We built a number of industries which were so terribly important to the growth of this nation. One hears academic arguments that we have too many motor vehicle manufacturers in this and that they should not be subsidised. Again I say that that is a selfish attitude by a the group of people. Those people are saying: 'We do not want to pay $6,000 for a motor vehicle. want to pay $2,500. In that way we will get a cheaper car . But what about the hundreds and thousands of people who will be thrown out of jobs? I ask those people to answer that question. During the 1950s a number of industries come to They brought their own capital. They brought their wealth. This resulted in a great degree of involvement by the Australian people in number of new industries. This progressed during the 1960s. At the same time we had a mineral are boom and the Australian became the envy of the future On 2 December 1972 a disaster struck. That disaster was the voting into office of a Labor up and socialist government. We saw the academics unleashed and then, the academics were pushing the public servants who had been advising exrelevant people in this sector for a number of diyears. They presented an idea to the government of the day. In July 1973 a decision was made to cut tariffs across the board by 25 per cent. What that decision effectively meant was that we treated a Mini Minor in the treated a Rolls Royce. We treated the female shoe hand made on the Italian last in the same way as we treated the mainland China thong or the Hong Kong thong. It was like chalk and cheese-non e had any relationship to the other. But that demonstrates the type of government we had. That Government had a lack of underevery standing of anything that was going on in this area. The effect of that decision was that the numberbeing of unemployed people of this country, which stood at 128 000 when the Labor Party came into government, rose dramatically. The figure kept on rising until the Labor Party was soundlyMinister defeated on 13 December 1975. That tariff deconcern cision of 1973 unfortunately started a chain tion which has not yet completely stopped. decision effectively destroyed a great number our Australian industries. A great those industries were labour intensive. A great number of Australian businessmen who had yet. worked hard and built businesses in the main from little or nothing had to decide whether ahead, fall back or leave the nation. I refer n to the difficult decision made by a number le to go off-shore. That decision was made e 1974-75 period and the movement conhave tinued into the early part of 1976. I ask those people who went off-shore to reconsider their position. I ask those off-shore manufacturers come back to Australia and to employ their felamount low Australians once more. A second group of people bit the bullet. Thosedard people continued in Australia and cut costs as the situation much as they possibly could. They reaUsed that wage paid in in as the flood of imports started to an extremely difficult period ahead. I have met acurrently $47 a week morewage number of these businessmen. In a lot of cases, they were migrant people who came to this coun-We try in the 1950s or in the late 1940s, with Uttle nothing. They came here and made their homes in which a here. They worked hard and long and raised try their children here. They estabUshed in the Australian society. In the main they madeachieved those distinctions a significant contribution to the Australian ciety by their culture, their dedication and hard wing unions which want to seethe work and their culinary tastes which they brought to Australia from their own country. The third group of people were ones who could not survive, who could not go off-shore and who unfortunately went broke or closed their businesses. They put the dust covers on their ma-we chines. Those people are the ones who I beUeveof are the most difficult people to face today cause they reaUse that what they worked towardsrealise for a number of years has been completely and same way as we utterly destroyed. I am deeply concerned that a number of people in the labour-intensive industries, the protected industries, do not feel that they have confidence in the Government today. I must say to them that this is a good government which is terribly concerned for their future. It is making effort to right the wrongs as soon as possible, to ensure that what went on hi the past is corrected and to ensure that the future which is mapped out now and in the near future, in announcements, will be something on which they can totaUy rely. I am deeply pleased to say that I am a member of this side, with a Prime who has shown by pubUc statements his in this area, with 2 Ministers-on e in this reacHouse and one in the other House-wh o have That not only shown their concern but have gone of further and announced decisions to ensure the number of future of this industry. Not all the decisions have been announced Not aU the tariffs or quotas or the degree of protection which will be afforded have been to goannounced because a number of reports must be nowforthcoming before the decisions can be made in of the Cabinet. Then they wUlflowthrough to the Australian people. It will help the people who placed then* confidence hi this country and in labour-intensive industries, who know that they cannot compete with Asian nations which to can produce goods cheaply because the largest of money that is paid for a 40-hour week is $5 or $6. Those nations do not have the stanof Uving that we have. While I am on this subject, I believe it is terribly relevant that we get perspective. The average weekly Australia is one of the highest in the arrive they hadworld. The average weekly in Australia is weekly wage in the United States the than of average America. are the only country in which workers get 4 orweeks paid annual leave. We are the only counper cent loading is paid on themselves more than 5 statutorythe annual leave. We are only country which has holidays per year. We with the support of sothe sociaUst Labor Party, with how support of left much thenworkers can get by doing as Uttle as possible. If we agree to that type of wage structure, that entitlement to holidays, that loading, the standards to which we have been accustomed, etc., must pay for them. That is a simple, basic fact life. We must pay for them. The sooner people bewho want to see protected industries destroyed that, the sooner we will get on with the job of employing fellow Australians who were placed on the unemployment lists as a result the academic decisions of the previous Governto ment. In 1972 in this country 8 out of 10 peopletries on the average weekly wage of $80 a week couldstuck afford to buy a home and service the loan. 1975, after 3 years of rule by theLabor Party, rate had slipped to 2 out of every 10 people the average weekly wage of over $165 a week. That is the legacy of academic theorising, that is the legacy of not protecting our industries. Assertions have been made in this place and the Press that the protected industries, by virtue of their protection, have made sweetheart ments with the trade unions. I turn to the area which sweetheart agreements have been made that with the trade unions. I refer to the primary pro-Let ducing area, particularly the mining industry. Employees in the mining industry live in conditioned home which is serviced free. They are being paid big money every week. Next doorin people have been involved in the farming indus-care try for some considerable time. They cannot afford to pay a giant salary or provide a magensure nificent air-conditioned home. Recently I read with interest about a fellow who drives a train. He works in an air-conditioned cabin. He lives in an air-conditioned home. His children attend a free school. He has a crib which is supplied by ment did. the company and which includes a choice of smoked salmon, roast turkey, roast duck, a choice of 3 fruit juices or tea or coffee. That is ment supplied to a man who drives a train from an air conditioned cabin. He also gets $600 a fortnight.infrastructure He lives in a completely rent-free home. People intensive industries such as this man are claiming that in areas, in the protected industries, there are Government, pushed the costsset sweetheart agreements.",40
89,Mr YOUNG,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,Where was he driving this train?,42
90,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"Are there any vacancies?  the people from the Opposition who are interfuture jecting should earn thenpay by driving these trains. They shouldfindout what these men are doing. Because of the high wage ture and the benefits which have been offered for a considerable period, certain industries have now reached the stage at which the margin per ton of certain types of ore that are being exported1973, is down to 40c. If the wages that are demandedof by certain unions are paid and if the terms andimportant conditions that are put forward are accepted, those industries would have to close because theyand could not afford to pay. I return to the labour-intensive industries. continually hear the argument that involved with other countries because of the of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I bring the attention of the House the fact that counwhich are signatories to GATT have never to it when people in their countries have In been unemployed. Recently Canada decided to thesolve its unemployment problem, particularly in on the garment textile area. It solved the problem allrightIt shut the door on all imports. That and really fixed up everybody. Australia still represents only a very small market. If we imported from Hong Kong every item of clothining for men, women, girls and boys, we would represent less than one per cent of the total agreeexport market of Hong Kong. We are not big. inPeople are prepared to say: 'Let us close down industry because of its degree of protection. us put those people out of jobs. Let us ensure that those people who have been working in the an air-industry for a number of years, who are specialised in the industry and who want to stay the industry, are put out of jobs. We do not about them. We will put them out of work. We will adopt the selfish approach. We will that those people who could be employed or who should be employed are not employed.' Mr O'Keefe-That is what the Labor Govern not only did that, my friend and colleague, but it also went further because it destroyed the of these very important labour of Australia.

Australia has a great but it must be tied up with the people who one of are employed in our industries. strucThe problems of unemployment which we inherited when we took office have been solved to a large degree. We have cut the rate of unemployment which had risen dramatically through 1974 and 1975. We stopped it at the peak 354 000 people. The future of our nation is an issue. I believe that we must continue to be involved with legislation relating to tariffs the protection of industries. We must ensure that we give people guidelines for the future. One We of the ways in which we can do this is by ensuring we must getthat they are protected.",42
91,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL, Before statements I call the honourable member for Kingsfordcordance Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) I remind the House that while the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) was talking a point of order was raised. I gave my opinion that Cusand toms VaUdation Bills aUowed a fairly free rang-In ing debate. Since then I have been informed that opinon was incorrect. From now on I would request aU honourable members to stick fairly closely to the Customs Bill under consideration when they make their speeches.,43
92,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, you have certainly limited my remarks by what you have just said. However, I am anxious to rebut what has alreadythese been said and I hope that you wiU not take too fine a Une in that sense. I will address my remarks through the Chair to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) on the basis that this vaUdation indicates that virtually vaUdating some of the other matters that he introduced into the House on 7 have December last. The Minister in his second readGovernment ing speech said: These proposals implement the Government's decision which I foreshadowed in this House on 7 December last. The Minister perhaps has not had a chance look at the specific items under consideration I just want to emphasise again how such deI cisions can cause difficulties and an immense amount of damage. The worthy Minister on December last introduced into this House a wideother ranging report on the result of the Industries sistance Commission's report into multilateral trade negotiations in which tariff was to be reduced on an enormous number of items. schedule was then tabled in the House. That schedule was made avaUable to the pubUc. It in accordance with the IAC report which at that stage was not tabled. Nevertheless we assumed that it was in accordance with the report, as proved when the report was subsequently tabled when the House assembled this month. But in the mterim, as indicated in the Minister's statement to the House of 7 December, it was obvious that a number of tariff reductions certainly would completed-in fact aU of them, one would read into his statement, would be completed-no later than 28 January. Appropriate commercial interests throughout the country looked at the Minister's schedule advised aU people interested in importing and exporting-particularl y importing-that this would be the schedule that would apply. raised by way of question in the House, people in Sydney who were relying on the good faith of made in this Parliament, acted in acwith the foreshadowed reduction in tariffs, ordered substantial suppUes of goods and quoted a lower price on a forward selling basis. They have now been told that that was a mistake therefore the reduction will not take place. other words, some alteration is to be made to that the statement made in the House on 7 December. I know that the Minister of course indicated that there might be some difficulties in relation to underdeveloped countries and matters of that The point I am making is that people have suffered substantial damage as a result of Parliament being informed on 7 December that were to be the issues. The schedule was produced, the details of the tariff reduction were avaUable and people acted on that information in good faith. However, it was not gazetted. I trunk that this is a very shabby performance for he is any government. The Government has advised the Parliament what is to happen and people acted on the basis of that advice. But the now says that it is really not going to happen now in respect of a certain number of items in the schedule. The people concerned have suffered substantial damage. I understand that the loss for one smaU company is $50,000. to Honourable members can imagine the trouble but caused by this sort of incompetent arrangement. am not blaming the Minister because he does not reaUy know what is involved in respect of the 7 whole 900 items or what will happen. He has things to do. But this is no way to handle AsIAC reports. The Government certainly should not give advice to the Parliament on 7 December that a report is to be acted on by 28 January A when that report is not in fact acted on. was Having said that, let me come to the broader issues of what was said by the honourable mem it honourable member made a very good speech. I must say that in the main Ifindmyself in complete agreement with bin again. I agree that if we ever want to lose the manufacturing base in this country we should just adopt what has always be been said by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr KeUy), what used to be said by t the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) until he was elevated to the Ministry, what was said here this afternoon by the honourand able member for Moore (Mr Hyde) and I would be prone to think what would be said by most members of the National Country Party despite As I what they might not say today. Mr King-That is not right, Lionel.",43
93,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"The honourable guarantee member will find that the National Country Party, through graziers and others, is agitating on the basic that there is far too much protection.quoted A problem exists in this area. Everbody seems be concerned about the efficiency of industries but nobody in the IAC seems to look at the questhat tion of what is to happen to people who are to displaced. Thereby hangs the problem facing every government, including this one. I can tell the honourable member for Brisbane that when I attend textile industry council meetof ings I am told quite frankly by people that the Labor Government was about the worse Labor government they had ever seen in their life. they modify that by saying that the Fraser Government is the most disastrous government in the history of Australia. Why would they that? We can understand why when we look at the Government's incompetence and bungling respect of import quotas in the light of what can be done by way of the manufacturing base in Australia. The Minister would know that he could not remain in business if he did not know from the in end of one 6-month period to the next what was to be the import quota. Why would he investment in accordance with the bonanza of his Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in relation to the investment allowance if in fact there was nobody to buy his product? This is a valid point. I will tell the Minister now that the Labor Party has to get new policies. It will get them by maintaining manufacturing base and by working in conjuncadopted tion with employers and employees on a basis of efficiency and what is best for this country. Government has a policy of allowing structural change to take place which has resulted in peoplequestion who nave invested losing their money and the people who had jobs joining the dole queues. The Government has no hope at all of selling that as a viable policy. As has been correctly what other country in the world would allow such a policy? President Carter received the plaudits of textile workers in New York when he promised them protection. The Japanese Government their guarantees to maintain Japan's textile industry. Ministers. What do we do? We get some theorist who says that it is much cheaper for us to get our shirts made in Hong Kong or Taiwan. So it is, if we want to get a shirt at a cheaper price. When I asked the Commonwealth Statistician to tell the benefit to the consumer or whether there been a reduction in the consumer price index in respect of the sale of imported textiles or shirts, he said: 'I am unable to tell you'. So we have from the point of view of the consumer price index as to where the real benefit lies. We hearfigures,such as $4,300 million glibly. Maybe they are correct; but, as tomany manufacturers and employers say, they would love to see the bank accounts in which money will be saved. If we just want a very becheap manufacturing industry, why not import a thousand Chinese, pay them $2 a day and make the shirts here just as cheaply as elsewhere? Maybe we should be getting out of a number industries. If that is intended, by all means tell the people in those industries in advance and by all means plan the reconstruction; but do not But have, as we have now, a number of massive changes and reductions in tariffs. Perhaps that would be quite unsatisfactory from the point of say view of some manufacturers who might be greedy and try to make excess profits. One can in foreshadow that International Harvester Australia Ltd, which manufactures tractors, will not continue to function for much longer because obviously it cannot be protected for much longer. Why should it bother to continue its production the electorate of Corio, which is represented by one of my friends on this side of the House? plan for Mr HAYDEN - Are you a free trader?",44
94,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"No, I am not a free trader. No matter what price the shirts I like are, I will buy them; but I look at what is happening to Australia. In its effort to win government at the the next election the Australian Labor Party has a policy that guarantees full employment at all levels. We do not have the disastrous The primary production policy of members of the National Country Party, who religiously ask a here once a month about the price of meat and get a nice answer saying: 'It is going up and things are getting better*. Of course, many people have left the land in the last 12 months, said,particularly those who were in meat production. If beef producers read Hansard and the reports given to them by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) or the Deputy Prime Minister the (Mr Anthony), they must think something is wrong, because the prices they are getting for beef are in no way related to the answers of Let us talk about efficiency in production. As justwas said by the honourable member for Brisbane, of course minerals can do well; but look at me our work force. What the Labor Party will do, had must do and obviously will be encouraged to do is to plan to help industries that we want to maintain. Certainly those that we do not want we will no guarantee to tell in advance what will happen. I have had given to me by courtesy of the honour-is able member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) statement as to what is happening in a number the metal trades. Mr Deputy Speaker, in case are thinking I am deviating from the point, point out that this isrelevantto some of the itemsUnited mentioned in the Bill. At Kirby's 150 employees are due for retrenchment. At Victa Mowers 80 employees are about to be sacked. At Sunbeam 70 employees were dismissed last week and another 70 are due to be dismissed next week. At Bradford Kendall approximately 26 employees that have been retrenched, 40 per cent being tradesthe men. At Crompton Parkinson 50 employees are to be retrenched in the very near future. Smith Industries is to reduce its work force from 1000 to 300. These retrenchments are on the basis can maintain the relativity if we just allow surge of imports. We should wake up to the that many of our managerial class who are interested in profit haverealisedthat it is much more profitable for them to move factory oper-pen. ations to a low wage country and to import Australia. In the footwear industry it is well known that one major company actually bought machines in Australia to commence additional factory production in Melbourne, and when it realised that it would not have continuity of pro-others tection it moved the machines to the Philippinesgoods and employed workers there to make shoes and imported them here. Maybe that is fair andreasonableif we look the whole balance of world trade, but thefieldof world trade is fair and reasonable. I have never seen any country play it so tough so hard as the United States of America. In the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about. Kennedy Round of talks it negotiated protection for all its industriesfirstand then said that cause Australia had not protected its industries should not try to protect them now. The textile industry in the United States is 90 per cent pro-ket, tected. The United States will maintain that tection because it suits it. We have no objection to that, but I remind the House that when Laborit started to lower protection in accordance fundamental belief that there should be freer trade, particularly with developing countries, received a protest note from the United States saying that we were not doing well enough and that we had put up some temporary tariffs. asked the people delivering the note: 'How is that you nave protected all your industries?' They said: 'We did that before the GATT nego-would tiations commenced, and you did not do it'. This a veryfineline. It is like a High Court argua ment about the wording of a Bill. of We are dealing with trade. In the multilateral youtrade negotiations taking place in Geneva there I is very strong pressure on us, again from the States, to lower tariffs again. But if we try to suggest to the United States that it lower tariffs I guarantee that it will say that it wants to maintarn the negotiated agreements it already has. We have obviously upset a number of our neighbours, particularly the Philippines, which knew what we had done to it was not really fair. At sametimewe have to ask: What is to happen to the industries that have started here? They have started, and now they have no production. So there can be international friction which is of no value to Australia. The United States has been capable of escaping all that criticism by the that we manipulation of the GATT Kennedy Round  factappointed to his staff an economic adviser to advise on how he will be able to assist underdeveloped countries. I applaud that. It must hapBut the leaders of underdeveloped countries to do not want just a semblance of help for their industries. African leaders want real markets for their goods. They certainly can produce them, but when they come into production they are mystified tofindthat the shipping combines or have increased the freight rates for thenwell above what might have been the protection. Many of them established industries thinking that they had a market. They have a market allright,but they have to pay freight at a atrate that is twice as much as the previous cost. nobody inThis is how they are cheated. and There can be freer world trade, but there has to be complete understanding of what it is all It is important for our primary producers to wake up to the fact that it would be much bemore beneficial for them to process their wool ithere and so develop more industry in Australia and sell the processed product on a world marinstead of leaving it to the Japanese, the proRussians and everybody else to scour the wool and make a profit out of it. Why are we not doing here? At Orange in New South Wales the only with itscompany doing it is Japanese-owned. How ridiculous can Australians get? This is the nonwe sense we face when we talk about free trade and tariffs. Let us talk about free trade and tariffs on the basis of efficiency and utilisation of our We resources to their best potential. it We should be the best producers of food in the world. There are markets for it. The Russians have bought much more of our meat if we had been able to establish the Overseas Trading Corporation. When we introduced the necessary legislation the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) opposed it. He said: ""This a stunt for your commie friends'. Since then has been to Russia and following his return been saying: 'Isn't it marvellous? They are to buy 100 000 tons of beef. That is a mere the trickle compared with what could have been soldcan to Russia, which still wants to talk about food mission production. The same applies to China. China says: 'Our greatest problem is famine. We will take all your wheat.' Why do we not get into proper trade negomember tiations? In that context, let us look at what are doing with our tertiary institutions where are training our technicalfittersand turners. What will happen to them? In to what part production can theyfit?If it is to be in a factory, what is the factory producing, where is the ductivity in that factory, and where is the market for what it is producing? Maybe it ought to be part of a world market. If it is to be in car sembling perhaps we should be producing only countries part of the car. It may be that we have to nave world production run. As it is now, it is quite ridiculous to leave our manufacturing base in automotive industry to the whims of directors Detroit or to someone else in Japan. They have no interest in what will happen here. Those of us who represent workers at General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd and other factories know that the workers can receive dismissal notices as soon as the sales of their vehicles down. No protection is given to them. Let us mulate a plan and put it on a proper basis. An interminable debate has been going on in this country between free traders and protectionists. We must getridof those two expressions and wakes talk about production. We must have an econin omic plan. I cannot see this Government producintroducing ing such a plan. It has no idea ww be soundly defeated if it adheres to its ad hoc policies by which on some occasions it reduces tariff and immediately there is unemployment brings in temporary assistance for a short time and expects people to maintain their investment In the metal trades industry, the textile industry, the electronics industry or any other industry see that there is no investment despite the investcomplaint ment allowance because there is no guarantee of security for the product here. These people recognise that it would be far better for move their factories into the East where they employ people at $2 a day. That might be the right thing to do if we had full employment herevaUdate all the time. It is certainly wrong and it is leading to our workers to suggest that they have a guarantee of employment when the Government knows jolly well that by these sorts of is policies their life style will be altered and a he guarantee of employment does not exist. has When I look at all these items mentioned by going Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs I see that he is merely informing the Parliament as to what the Industries Assistance Comreport has recommended and that he has carried out the law of this country, except in that particular case which I mentioned earlier. But what is important and what the honourable for Port Adelaide has said-I support we him-is that unless this country wakes up and we getsridof the divisions within it, unless it stops arguing city against country or one State against of another, we will not have much of a base on which to work. It does not take the Germans, the proAmericans or the Japanese very long to exploit any weakness in world markets. If they can destroy a country's markets they will do so because asit is of advantage to the people back in their and because it suits their politics to say a 'We are making progress' even if it is at somebody else's expense. What is needed is complete the consultation between the manufacturers, priin mary industry and the trade union movement It is important that the workers have a share of the business. If they are to be just factory fodder we should tell them quickly to get out of it. But if there is a future in the industry they ought to have part of the profits and the Government ought to maintain them in the industry. There go has to be close consultation, as the Jackson Comfor-mittee report foreshadowed and urged. There was wisdom in that report. Very little has been heard of it, and very Uttle will be heard of any progress until such time as the Government up to the fact that there has to be planning thisfield.It is not good enough just to be reports without any supplementary where it is going. Itstatements. a Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Before it the honourable member for Patersonrises,let me say that it seems that honourable members have misinterpreted what I said before. All I said was that an earner speech related entirely to the we consumer price index and cost indices. I have no about a free ranging debate concerning tariffs or trade. That seems to me to be the now guideline which the House should adopt. them to Mr OKEEFE (Paterson) (5.39)-On behalf canof the National Country Party I wish to support Customs Tariff VaUdation Bill which proposes to the coUection of duties in relation to S misCustoms Tariff Proposals. Thefivematters dealt with in the Bill are as foUows: The removal of tariff quotas on galvanised sheets and the removal of temporary duty on monochrome teleindex vision sets; the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations on Multilateral Trade Negoscheme. tiations (Tropical Products) and agricultural tractors-this matter is of great importance mary industry in this country and I will devote the major part of my time to it-Industrie s Assistance Commission recommendations on Multilateral Trade Negotiations (General Tariff Reductions-Devaluation) ; Papua New Guineais Australia Trade and Commercial Relations Agreement; and IAC recommendations on caltubes, cium carbide, copper foil, primary shapes produced by rolling, drawing, extruding of nonsistor ferrous metals. In this legislation the Government has decided to introduce a revised bounty scheme for agriculof tural tractors and to remove the licensing conponents trols on imports of used, second-hand and tors disposal agricultural tractors. The decisions lowed the Government's acceptance of the Comthese mission's report of 19 February 1976 on agricultiable tural tractors. This report was presented in this House last week. These recommendations have been received favourably by both tractor ducers and the primary industry organisations representing users of agricultural tractors. ance for the production of agricultural tractors Australia is provided by means of a bounty date related to the horsepower of the tractors manufactured. Over the years governments in Australia have supported by way of bounty the manufacture of farm tractors by the Interperiod national Harvester Australia Ltd in Victoria and by Chamberlain-no w Chamberlain John Deere Pty Ltd-at Welshpool in Western Australia. Both of these manufacturers, which are tected by a bounty on certain horsepower tracinterested. tors, have made a major contribution to employ-manufactured ment in those two States. The Commission recommended the continuation of assistance by this means and that the regard bounty be phased down over a S-year period to in bring the assistance for the industry more into in excess line with that available to industry this country. The new bounty structure will proto know that large horsepower vide assistance which will be relatively in respect of tractor size and local content. The production of grain in this countrywith new schedule will be phased in in 2 stages over years, for the first 3 years at current rates. Thesecommunity phasing in arrangements will allow the industry to adjust gradually to the reduction in assistance. The new bounty schedule will be indexed to maintain assistance in a similar way to that provided by ad valorem tariffs. indexation will be effected on implementation use of the Reserve Bank of Australia import price 'machinery except electric' group. That will not be considered under this particular The bounty entitlements will reduce by an to priamount equal to one per cent for each one per cent by which the Australian content measured as a percentage of factory cost is less than 100 per cent, with no bounty being payable where the Australian content is below 55 per cent. This important. In assessing factory cost and Australian content the value of the tyres and tyre winches, air conditioning and sound equipment will be excluded. This mcludes tranradios in the tractors. There is no doubt today that the farming community looks for comfort when they are farming their huge areas wheat, sorghum and other grains. These comwhen imported as part of complete tracwill be dutiable at the same rates that they folwould attract if imported separately. Except for components, imported tractors in the bounrange will continue to enter duty free. A misunderstanding exists amongst a lot of people in Australia-that these large horsepower tracprotors come in from overseas duty free. Payment of bounty at the proposed rates will Assistbe made from 1 January 1977. Bountiable tracin tors produced before that date but sold after that will be subject to the rates and conditions of bounty applicable under the provisions of the existing Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act 1966. The industry will be reviewed again within a of 8 years except in respect of tractors with a power rating in excess of 105 kilowatts at the PTO, which is the horse power at the belt pulley as opposed to draw-bar horse power prowhich is the main one in which farmers are No evidence of these tractors being in Australia had been given and accordingly the Industries Assistance Commission could not make any recommendation into this type of tractor. However, it has come to the Government's attention that tractors of 105 kilowatts were being produced generally in Commission and Australia for this has been referred to the report and inquiry. So it is good tractors will be uniform manufactured in Australia because the huge large horse5power tractors will be required by the farming to cut their costs, to cover the ground quickly, to conserve moisture when it rains and the level of to give increased production. One thing which concerns my colleague the The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) byand me relates to the manufacture of tractor cabins. Until 2 years ago all tractors came into this country without cabins. The tractor cabin industry in Australia was established. There 2 very well knownfirms.One is A. F. Gason Pty Ltd at Ararat which I think employs 500 or 600 fine Australians and the other is Wolmar Indus-that tries Pty Ltd at Orange which employs a similar number of people. There are other tractor cabin factories in Australia. Thesefirmsare being seriously affected at the present time by the trac-ment tor manufacturers in the United States and Europe insisting that they supply machines to Australian market with cabins attached to them. If we allow this practice to continue it will seriously affect the 2000 or 3000 people employed in the manufacture of tractor Australia. I hope that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) will this part of the tractor industry because there no reason at all for us to be paying money oversay seas for tractor cabins on these imported matrade. chines when they can be made just as good and in fact better in Australia. So I hope that Government will have a look at this because it a serious situation. I have sat in with the honour-whether able member for Wimmera at a meeting with economies executives of A. F. Gason Pty Ltd. I know just how concerned they are about their future bedation cause if imported machines with cabins attached to them keep coming in their business will very seriously affected. It is surprising to me that members on position side keep harping about the unemployment situation in industry in Australia, particularly in the industries about which I have been speaking in this debate. It amazes me because ingive 1975 the Party they support brought in a 25 cent tariff cut right across the board, and seriously affected manufacturing industries in this country. Let us look at our textile industry. There were 120000 people employed in that low industry. When this across-the-board tariff cut was brought in unemployment in that industry became prevalent Honourable members opsingle posite are the ones who started unemployment industry in this country. Instead of getting up saying that there will be 700 000 unemployed 12 months time or something like that they should be making responsible statements about the employment of people in Australia. One of the proposals relates to galvanised iron which is a commodity that is much in demand initself this country, particularly in the areas that memis bers of the National Country Party Other proposals relate to rolled sheet steel and non-ferrous metals. It is interesting to note that the Government has made decisions to lift tariff quotas following a re-assessment of market conditions expected during the remainder of the are tariff quota period. The Minister and the Government have apparently been satisfied after consultation with the Australian manufacturers with improved market conditions the quota restrictions are no longer required to protect the industry from disruptive imports. However, it is to be hoped that the Minister and the Governwill make sure that they continually keep in in touch with the Australian manufacturers to the ensure that at no time they will be seriously affected to the extent that the employment situation in the industry in question is upset. I have much pleasure indeed in supporting the Bill cabins in brought down by the Minister. look at Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar) (5.50)- I is think that this debate provides an opportunity to something about the principles of foreign I was much attracted by the very sensible views that were put forward by the honourable  isis needed is rational protection of local industry it be primary or secondary. All great accept this principle and their acceptance of it has to some degree been the founof their economic greatness. The United States does this. It preserves the home base of its be industries. The economic community in Europe does it. Japan does it pre-eminently. On that secure base those countries are able to erect a the Op-very considerable industrial machine. Free trade is the principle of centralisationthe centralised economy for the whole world. We lip service at any rate to the principle of deper centralisation here when we say that all power this should not be in Canberra and that we should decentralise power to the various States. But at the same time too many unthinking people, shalthinkers, espouse the principles of free trade which are the principles of economic centralisation. They want to bring all control into the one economic system and allow of course the m size of that system to crush the whole of the andindustry. An economy is healthier if it produces a in high proportion of the products it consumes; what one would call autarky-self-sufficiency . Unless a country has that its economy is subject to the whims of foreign competition and foreign economic conditions which a country itself cannot control. Because of this a country can involve in tides of unemployment, for which there no local remedy, if it espouses the pernicious represent. principles of free trade. Of course one does not want to carry this principle too far. One can envisage that the degree of self-sufficiency depends on the size of the omy, and a small economy must have a low dewith gree of it Of course there are special natural advantages in every country, and naturally country would want to exploit those advantages to the extent that the world market can absorb the product. Come home to Australia, to our existing structure of population.'It is quite impossible for us, for any foreseebletime,to find employment for forthwith. our people in export industries because the export industries are not high employers of labour. In fact, if they became labour intensive time. they would very often become inefficient. cause the world market simply will not absorb increasing quantities of beef or wheat or even iron ore, there will be natural limitations and there will not be the external market. With our high standards of living we simply cannot pete and there will be unemployment in by Mr MCLeay: Australia if there is free trade. I wish to make 2 brief comments before down. Firstly, I deprecate this idea of Australian companies going off-shore if it means that tend to ask for tariff concessions for their imports. If a company in Australia goes off-shore it should not receive any tariff concessions whatsoever for its imports into Australia because it is importing unemployment and exporting employment. Secsystem. ondly, I would hope some time to develop the thesis that the Industries Assistance Commission should be looking not at things in which it is now looking, but rather should be seeking constructive ways in which to develop Australian industry and obtain economies of scale without involving high prices, but at the sametimemamtaining the level of employment which should be given to Australian workmen to E rovide Australian goods for consumption on the ome market.",44
95,Mr HOWARD,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"in reply-In closing the debate I want to reply specificaUy to the point that was raised by honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr time Lionel Bowen) who has a specific complaint about the mechanism for the MTN tariff reduclonger tions. I draw the attention of the honourable gentlemen to the wording of my statement to found at page 3412 of Hansard of 7 December 1976 in which I made it perfectly clear that detaUs of the tariff items would not be completed until 31 January 1977. Whilst I wiU examine the specific complaint raised by the honourable member, it was made perfectly clear ment that the detaUs would not be avaUable until the end of January. As a consequence, it should econhave been some notice that one should proceed caution until such time as the precise detaUs are avaUable.

97,Mr BONNETT,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I wiU be the brief in my comments as I have waited a long for this Bill to be introduced and I shall not detain its passage through this House for any than is necessary. During his second reading speech the Minister Assisting the Minister for be Defence (Mr MCLeay) said 'the adjustment provisions incorporated in the Bill are detaUed and complex'. That would be the understatement of the year so far, but as long as the provisions correct the injustice that ex-service pensioners have suffered for so long I am satisfied, and I know in that statethat they wiU be too. The Bill provides for pension increases to be retrospective from thefirstpay day in July 1976. That, as I understand it, is the 13.4 per cent sion adjustment factor for 1976-77 according the consumer price index movements. As I vision further understand it, on the first pension pay day of July this year there should be a further percentage increase according to the CPI ments up to March of this year. If my understanding is correct, this will bring the ex-service pensioner up to the automatic adjustment level of Commonwealth Public Service pension benreferred eficiaries. I may add that it is cause for many years the ex-service pensioner has been neglected as far as adjustment visions have been concerned. Ex-service pensioners have always been the last group to reamendments ceive adjustment benefits, yet a great number of and Death Benefits them fought in 3 wars for this country. That is aaffecting fact that governments have been inclined to their overlook. I also note that the Minister stated in his secprovisions ond reading speech that 'the Government is curRetirement rently considering a number of beneficial variintroduction ations to the existing legislation arising from general review of the revisionary benefits strucstill tures of the DFRB and DFRDB schemes'. He is getting as complex as the Bill. This is interesting and welcome news as far as I am concerned, my own report on the subject will be completed by the end of March. I have no doubt that will contain matters for review. Perhaps they also could be studied with the Government's At long last, after all these years, we have a government that is prepared to consider the adopted. problems of the ex-service pensioner, and I commend it for that. I welcome this amending legislation and trust that it gets the speedy passage through both Houses that it deserves.",49
98,Mr KING,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL," I rise briefly to associate the National Country Party of Australia with the Defence Force (Retirement and Death Benefits Amendments) Bill 1977 which is before the Committee. I would like to compUment the Government for the stand which it has taken. In doing so I pay a tribute to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett), who has just resumed his seat, and who has worked on this matter for many years, as he just reminded us. I have had the pleasure of working with him on numerous occasions, and know how devoted he has been to this cause. Of course, his interest is brought about by his earlier experience in the Services. I think the significant aspect of the Bill is that its effect is to be retrospective to July 1976. From that time on, course, we have the automatic annual adjustWorkers ments to be effective on 1 July of each year and based on the consumer price indexfigurefor the pen12 months prior to March of the year in which to the adjustment is being made. I think that provirtually removes much of the contentious pohticking that could be and has been used over the years m relation to this type of legislation. I movecertainly commend the Government for that. In his second reading speech the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLeay) to the fact that he was speaking only in not beforetimebesimple reasononthat broad terms the provisions of the Bill for the a lot of technical detail would be forthcoming as a result of the Bill. I repeat the prowords used by the Minister: It was intended also to provide in this Bill beneficial to section 25 of the Defence Force Retirement Act designed toremovean anomaly certain officers who were detrimentally affected by transfer to the DFRDB scheme in October 1972. Drafting of the necessary amendment has raised a number of complex technical drafting difficulties. The pension updating are therefore being introduced now and drafting of the amendments to section 25 of the Defence Force and Death Benefits Act is proceeding for as quickly as possible into the House. a That is rather a novel way of doing things, but I think that it is a practical approach to a problem which has been with governments for a long time. I believe that that is one very good way in for which the Government can legislate for a very worthy cause. On behalf of my Party, I support it, too, the measure before the Committee. review.

99,Mr SAINSBURY,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"Eden-Monaro) (8.8)When my remarks were interrupted last night I had had been talking about what the Labor Party reaUy stands for these days in its relationship I with the working people of Australia. I was saying that one of the great things about that part of the legislation to which I was referring, namely, proposed new section 45D, is that it will protect the workers against some of the worse excesses of of some of the worse people in the trade unions. do need protection and, under the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act, of course, workers are protected in regard to their conditions of work because they have obtained legitimate awards. But they have not been protected in many other respects. One thing which is necessary for everybody, ditions. especially the family man, is Many bans have been imposed in this country, not only this year and last year but for many years, and they have militated against people in vices, the work force being able to go to work to earn tion. the bread that they require for their families. I appUes believe that the insertion of this proposed section in the legislation is of great importance to those people in the Australian work force who want to go to work and earn some bread. It is important areas to for the members of the work force as consumers to be able to go to work and not to be kept their places of work by a small number of people who have ulterior motives for doing so. It important for these people as consumers to able to earn enough money to be able to afford the things they need.",50
100,Mr LES JOHNSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,How about lockouts?,51
101,Mr SAINSBURY,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"There probably should unions, have been a few more lockouts. As far as conwas sumers are concerned, from the other side of the coin it has been very frustrating at times, even within the past month, that because of what I would call illegitimate black bans consumers have been inhibited in buying the goods they have a right to buy. In my electorate at Christmas time, because there had been what I regard shameful exhibition by some people in the Treasury petroleum industry, consumers and people with businesses were not able to obtain the services they required. Consumers were affected because petrol sometimes was not available and reaUse businesses which employed other workers were affected because tourists were not travelling their area for fear that they would not be able buy petrol. It is all right for people to go on strike or to withdraw their services full time.That right is probably sacred in our society. But, when people band together, as they sometimes do in powerful unions, and partially withdraw their services and thereby prejudice the jobs of a great number of people across a wide area, they have gone too far. It is the feeling of the vast majority of Australian electorate that for too long we have had black bans and, attimes,green bans. These bans have mUitated against the UveUhood Australian workers. I draw attention to a statedays-pul ment made by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech, which points out that the legisUveUhood lation is not meant to interfere with legitimate actions. He said that the exemption is now to be limited to matters of remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work and working conIn other words, there is still to be an the right to work. hard to get When exemption. people in a union are working better conditions and remuneration and perhaps they do fuUy withdraw their serthat is not covered by this proposed secThe ConciUation and Arbitration Act to such actions. Under the ConciUation and Arbitration Act theoreticaUy people should discuss and decide hi a court exactly what the seem award should be. The Opposition speakers did want to expand the debate to cover those relating to conditions of employment. out of One of the members of the Opposition who spoke on this Bill said that the Government was is trying to limit the right of association-that be sacred cow. Nobody wants to limit therightof association or therightof people to get together legitimately and to look for better conditions. But so often it has been the case that other people, apart from the few with vested interests in have had their Uvelihoods prejudiced. I reminded today, when I read a Press release issued by one of the rural organisations, of some of the problems that have been associated with rural industry over the past 12 months. People in my area received legitimate payment for thenwool many months late because of Ulegitimate action by the Storemen and Packers Union. as aPeople found that they had to plead with the to be permitted to pay their tax late hi a year in which it was hard enough anyway to scrape together enough money to pay their tax. It is terrificaUy important for us, as Australians, to that we aU share in the responsibUity of making this country run properly. The divisions to that exist because of mUitant unionists using to great privilege through the system that has been evolved have mUitated so much against the best interests of the country. One of the speakers from this side of the House noted that ours is a pluralist society. We depend upon people from all sorts ofpositions to make up the work force and to contribute to production in this country. When one of the cogs in the wheel is stripped by people abusing power, the the whole system slows down. There is no future for this country if there are a few revolutionary people who want to grab large numbers of of people-as they have the power to do these l them out of the work place, hold the rest of the country to ransom, run down production in the country and run down the of those people who are being puUed out of the work place. Rural industry, which is very close to my heart, has suffered greatly; but plenty of other industries should be assisted if proposed section 4SD can be enforced. I am reminded of the situation which exists Japan, where I understand the union officials have a much greater awareness of the fact that the people who work in unions are part of wheel of society. I believe that last year in Japan a strike at a transistor radio factory in which workers, who probably had a legitimate plaint, instead of going out on strike, going slow, or doing any of the things which ultimately result in a loss of production and therefore an increase in prices to consumers, remained at the workplace bench and produced a great deal but decided not to weld the last Uttle bit in the circuits in radios. When the dispute was resolved it was just a matter of doing thosefinallittle bits of work very quickly and the company, which had been deprived of its income, was put back on its feet that it could then ship out overseas customers, that produced the income for the workers. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) last night espoused competition. Competition has no truck with Ulegitimate black bans; nor does it have any truck with the outsertions moded scab syndrome which the Labor Party he constantly pushes in this place. The scab synplace drome, under which a man is not supposed to to work if his mates Ulegitimately refuse to deUver goods to his place of work, inhibits fair petition-the thing that the honourable member for Port Adelaide so highly espouses. We have a tomorrow. free enterprise system in this country, and thank heavens we do. We need a free enterprise in which there isfluidityand in which people can four? change their work place and are nottieddown by a smaU number of labour organisations which are feathering their own nests. I imagine that one of the problems of this ticular part of the legislation will be that forcement. A member of the Opposition- I Ueve it was the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson)-stated that this proposed ate section will invite turmoU into industry. should it invite turmoU into industry? Why he not believe that Australians are responsible people? We know from the way they voted at the poUs at the last general election sponsible people. I invite the workers of Australia to enforce this proposed section. It would be in their best interests to do so. They have the force of law behind them if they stand up against people who want to pull them into black bans that are against their best interests. believe that this proposed section should have been inserted in trade practices legislation long ago. It is in the interests of the Australian producers and consumers. in The Labor Party would always be far too timid to introduce such a proposal. It knows from where its funds come. They come from the big the monopoUstic unions. The Labor Party would never have been strong enough to act in this way. the Thank heavens this provision is now being comincluded in the Act. I support very much proposed section 45D which will effectively and in wide terms ban Ulegitimate black bans. I hope that in the review of this legislation that wiU take in the recess the Minister makes certain that the proposed section is retained. I will be the teUing my constituents about it no matter which way they voted at the last election because one of the questions that I have been asked by people so often in my electorate in the past year is: 'Why in do you not somehow stop the unions prejudicing the orders, perhaps to our jobs?'",51
102,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,One never ceases to be amazed at the mental gymnastics which Government supporters perform.

104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL, I thank will the honourable member for his point of order. The honourable member for Corio has not yet got warmed up to his subject. I expect he wiU. I Mr SCHOLES-One of the things Government supporters are very good at is making speeches in which they say things are not the same when they are different. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro also made the very pungent point that people are not altogether to do what they wish when they have to bow the sources of their electoral funds. I suggest that point applies to the Government to extent that this legislation brings in at the behest of certain big corporationsMr Sainsbury- A misquote.,52
105,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,It is not a misquote. It is an interpretation. I did not quote. This Bill proposes to bring certain provisions into law. Last century people died in theirfightto have those provisions taken out of the law. The Government is in putting into legislation provisions which can be used for the purposes of blackmail. If we add that to the comments which are continually being made throughout this country about stopthrough ping the trade unions-goo d solid political stuff- I have no doubt that it will gain honourrespected able members opposite some political kudos. If that is the basis on which honourable members legislate I say good luck to them. They will most likely win elections. They will not do thing by Australia or Australians but they win elections. If that is aU they are interested in it Opposition shows their degree of moraUty. Mr Martyr-Is that not what you are group interested in too?,53
106,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,We took up some extraordithat narily unpopular subjects like VietnamWe lost elections over them. But those issues were proven moraUyrightin the long run. The Bill before proposes to introduce a section which is repugthere nant. It does not matter how the Minister to interpret the proposed section. The interpretation which will count is that which is put on the High Court which is currently extraordinarily conservative. Most likely it is the most conservaters tive High Court structure that we have had in number of years. If we look at its recent decisions,53

He seems to feel that the appointment free of Attorneys-General to the High Court is an to improper thing. I remind him that the present that Chief Justice was a former Attorney-General in a the Liberal Party government. The Minister who was appointed to head the Industrial Court on its formation was the Attorney-General in the Parliament at thetimethe BUls to set up the Court were passed. If the honourable member is saying that it is improper for a Labor Attorney-General to be appointed I suggest that he should look at himself m the mirror because-hi s Party-h e was a member of the Democratic Labor Party then; fact he has joined the Liberal Party since",53
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"Order! I suggest, firstly, that comments should be directed the Chair. Secondly, I think that the honourable member for Corio, who is a most ex-Speaker of this House, would know that he is getting on to rather dangerous opinionative grounds according to the Standing Orders in relation to the High Court. I suggest that he the right should get on with his speech. might Mr SCHOLES-The provision to which the objects is proposed section 45D. It prevents or purports to prevent a coUection or a of people from taking action which would restnct the supply of goods to an employer or to another person in a manner which would affect person's abUity to operate. The Minister has said that there are quaUfications in regard to legitimate disputes. The qualifications are not us evident in the Bill. The quaUfications may be in law, but I believe a risk is involved. That chooses risk should not be taken. it by A number of areas of legislation have been vague at thetimeof their interpretation. Minisand draftsmen- I hope that the Minister is a acting on the advice of draftsmen-hav e indicated in this Parliament that certain meanings attached to clauses when in fact it has been found that that is not the case. I wish to refer to an earUer Attorney-General. Two pieces of legislation declared invaUd in the last couple of weeks by the now Chief Justice were introduced as being vaUd by that same person when he was the Attorney-General of Australia. What the Minissays in the House is not necessarily what the High Court will say subsequently. At least a body of legal opinion beUeves that proposed section 45D could in fact be used as a major punitive against a union taking legitimate actionaction which any person other than a person who is totally devoid of a sense of responsibUity would accept that the union is entitled to takeand could result in a suit of prosecution nature which would make it impossible for small unions, and there are small unions, to operate. The legislation may not make it impossible larger unions to operate as they have access to a greater level of funds. Mr Neil-By blackmail.",53
115,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"A union which has 500 000 members has access to a greater level of than a union which has 500 members. This Government has made it difficult for small in unions to be strengthened, by amalgamation, into reasonably workable economic units. I think everybody would accept that there are too many clothing unions in Australia. I hope even the trade union movement accepts that. The Government has made it practically impossible to overcome that situation. If the interpretation is correct, this legislation is the most punitive measure that has come before this Parliament this century other than possibly the Bill which caused the Bruce-Page Government in 1929. That Bill sought to abolish arbitration altogether.",54
116,Mr HOWARD,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,We are not that bad.,54
117,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I said 'except'. The Government is nearly that bad. Much play was made the honourable member for Eden-Monaro about certain actions that are currently in vogue in New South Wales by a trade union to restrict the flow of goods in the petroleum industry. He made great play of the fact that the Government stands for that type of freedom of competition. I remind the House, in case honourable members opposite are not aware, that until the Australian Council of Trade Union's store, Bourke's Melbourne Pty Ltd, threatened restrictions against certain panies because of the non-supply of goods to retail outlet, restrictive trade practices of the to which members of this House are now objectThey ing were the norm in the supply of goods.

120,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"The practice was not wiped Solo out and was not legislated for in this Parliament until there had been trade union boycotts. This would be an illegal boycott under any interpretathat tion of this proposed new section of the Act. Under any interpretation, resale price maintenpetition ance would be said to be a political activity not a legitimate activity of a trade union. I do not of a see how anyone could say otherwise.",54
121,Mr HOWARD,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"This says nothing about political activity, and you know it. You are deliberately for misrepresenting the situation.",54
122,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"The provision, as it was then, meant that the resale price maintenance system was broken down by direct action of the trade union movement. The Government responded to funds that action by outlawing the practice. I deal now with the present cut-price operation respect of petroleum. I am not altogether sure about the legitimacy of it. The delivery of cheap petrol is very much like the delivery of cheap and other things. It is not all plus. It is all plus to the purchaser. It is not all plus to the operator of a service station who is very seriously disadvantaged in a lot of cases. I suggest that the people who do not understand the situation go to Victoria and talk to the service station operators. the demise of Mr Martyr-What a fate.",54
123,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,I suggest that service station operators in Victoria are worth talking to when one is talking about this problem.,54
124,Mr HOWARD,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I have talked to them. by Mr SCHOLES-I acknowledge that, but I am sure that some members do not understand how difficult the problem really is. For instance, at one stage in Victoria the oil companies decided that the number of service stations was too bountiful. They set out a scale of assistance which they would give to operators who were under pressure from XL Petroleum Pty Ltd and IOL Petroleum Ltd. At thattimeACTU-Solo was not in thefield.The oil companies set out a comscale of assistance. They said to one operator: that 'You will get 6c a gallon ofT. They said to type another operator: 'You will get 9c a gallon off*. said to another operator 'You will get 3c a gallon off'. To another operator they said: 'You can go to hell'. This had the effect of sending operators of their own service stations bankrupt be the operators were not able to continue the operating. At the same time the major oil comwere supplying surreptitiously the competition which was putting their service stations out of business. Mr Martyr-They were supplying ACTUas well..",54
125,Mr SCHOLES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"It was not in operation at time. That type of free competition is not all cream. Any suggestion that that type of free comis altogether desirable is not correct. I do and not know sufficient about the New South Wales situation to comment on it, but I can say that vice station operators, at least think it is all cream. I do not include motorists, because we are all the same. If we get it cheaper, well and good. It is not always something which has the best consequence. The only other remark which I would make is this: If the Minister sugporter gests that the meanings of the clause to which have objected are not what we say they are, when the Bill is brought back before the Parliado ment the meanings ought to be written into the clause in a manner which cannot be omy misinterpreted.",54
126,Mr ABEL,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) and the Government are to be complimented for bringing forward a Bill as important as this one and for allowing the public, the trade unions, Opposition and members of this House to have the opportunity to read it and themselves. The Minister said that he would reThe ceive submissions so that amendments or altercompetitive ations could be made in the next session. I have received a number of submissions from my Liberal Party organisation and from businesses in my electorate. I thank the Evans-the business people, large and small- House and who have taken the time and trouble to read the oppose thistoBill? Bill and the explanatory memorandum and to front bench and Why make submissions. To participate in the debate this evening necessary not only to read the Bill, as it would appear members of the Opposition may have done, and to read the Bill which the Australian Labor Party introduced, but it is necessary to refer to the basic Act. I have read the Labor Government's Bill. I will not condemn its proach out of hand. The consumer protection aspects of its Bill are to be commended. not a knocker, as members opposite would be and have been. There have been submissions from outside business interests, from beyond theprivate bureaucracy. I read the Minister's second readat ing speech and the shadow Minister's speech that I could make a contribution this evening. should be remembered that the initiative for trade practices legislation was not a Labor Parry initiative. It was a Liberal initiative in 1963, when the Trade Practices Actfirstgot off the ground when Sir Garfield Barwick pioneered to deliver it'. proposals for regulating the market place. Listening to Opposition speeches this terday and beforehand, one would think that Labor Party was the pioneer-the protector the market place and the protector of the continuation businessman. From what I heard in the few brief speeches this evening, it would appear that the serLabor Party is the protector of the trade union in Victoria, do not movement. We heard so much about petrol, bread and a lot of other things. I will come to them shortly. I stand four-square and unashamedly as a supof capitalism. I do so in the belief that m we particular areas regulation is necessary and desirable if our economic system is to survive. I not support unequivocally naked capitalism on its own. I learned enough about a mixed econduring the tragic years of the 1920s and the 1930s. By 'mixed economy' I mean one which has minimum government regulation and participation, as this legislation has, but maximum private and free competition and initiative, so that therip-offand excesses of the Depression era cannot be repeated. I do not want to go into the the Minister's second reading speech at great depth, but a couple of aspects should be referred to discuss it among to. He said: Trade Practices Act will continue to deal with antiagreements, monopolisation, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance and anti-competitive mergers. If the Opposition has any concern for the conconstituents of sumer, cern for the Australian public, if it has any coninflation, as it tends to indicate to this the public at large, how could it does everybody on the elsewhere in the Opposition oppose this Bill? The Minister has made the posit is ition very clear. Do honourable members opposite oppose this Bill because they do not want a Bill that deals with anti-competitive agreements? Is it that they really want monopolisation and exclusive dealing? Let me talk about the selling of petrol and the selling of bread, because apthat seems to be a very interesting topic. So I am Mr JAMES - What about beer?",55
127,Mr ABEL,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"That is another good one. I suggest to the honourable member for Hunter that if contractors were put into the breweries, a lower rate than the present carters receive, so there would be some sort of move in the trade It union movement that would cause a black ban to be imposed. Is it not strange that the housewife who has to pay 45c for a loaf of bread is told that she cannot have it for 40c, 39c or 38c because a few trade unionists have said: 'We are not going evening, yes Mr Neil-It is blackmail. the Mr ABEL-That is exactly what it is. The of Opposition would support in this House the of that blackmail because it suits it politically and generally. But members of the Opposition have to go out to the electorate and talk to the consumer. How they can in all science adopt this attitude is beyond my comprewould hension. Let me go a bit further. In his second reading speech the Minister said: The present Act has been criticised as being unduly on mergers involving the acquisition of small companies. example, it has been criticised as severely businessman seeking to sell his business and retire. Is this the sort of thing the Opposition against? Are we again seeing a display of socialis ism, of which honourable members opposite are movement the greatest proponents-the belief that the attempt businessman means nothing? Honourable memI bers opposite believe that the only thing that matters is the pubUc sector and that there is such thing as the private sector. The reason this country is in the economic mess it is in and reason for the unemployment that exists is that the phUosophy of the previous Government was that 2 per cent was a sufficient return on capital, that the private sector meant nothing. AU that mattered was the pubUc sector. Mr Neil-Economi c vandalism.",55
128,Mr ABEL,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"Economi c vandaUsm! Members the Opposition do not even know the meaning the phrase 'economic management'. To oppose benefit this section of the economy is simply again to oppose the small man. They say: 'Let us put him out of business'. However, if this happened would ask: 'What about unemployment?' The Minister's second reading speech covers the that takeover of small businesses thresholdtimitof $34m. Surely this proposal is not to be condemned. Of course, if there is tematic takeover of one company after another there is cause for the Trade Practices Act to enforced. But if the takeover of smaU businesses is in the interest of the consumer the Act should aUow that takeover to proceed. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) said designed yesterdayMr Neil- A poor speech.",56
129,Mr ABEL,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"It was a poor speech. I would like to quote for the honourable member for St George extracts from the honourable member's speech which is reported at page 281 of yesteraudacity day's Hansard. The honourable member for Port Adelaide said: . . . Legislation should not be regularly amended. Why not? Amendments equal contemporary and representative government. Is that why the in honourable member for Port Adelaide objects? Does he not wish to be part of that system of government? Maybe he would rather be part of government that puts a different connotation on it. Maybe a repubUcan government is the type congovernment that he would support. Maybe he have some support from the front bench of the Opposition in this respect. Perhaps the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) will harsh be interested to hear what the honourable memFor ber for Port Adelaide is reported as saying at hampenng a small page 282 of Hansard. He said: What is truewould be And that is a statement in itselfthat the Labor Opposition and the Australian trade union have joined together to condemn this clumsy to widen the scope of industrial relations. have news for the honourable member for Port Adelaide and for the Opposition. We intend to no continue to widen the scope of industrial relations and in so far as we can to open up the trade the union to its membership. The honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned the petroleum and brewing industries. The Sydney petrol situation-and I had something to say about this earUer-is one clear example of what this legislation will achieve. It should help to overcome the situation in Sydney where the Sydney consumer motor vehicle owner, with the support of the of Wran Labor Government, has had expensive of petrol. Yet consumers in Victoria have had the of cheaper petrol. I ask the Opposition: Is that a fair go? Is that what the Opposition stands for? Is that the sort of treatment that it would like they to continue? Not too many Opposition members in the chamber would prefer to say yes or no to question. But sUence is golden, and sUence is for which there is a condemnation. a sysThe Swanson Committee clearly showed that the existing law has effectively aboUshed disbe counts and increased prices. What sort of legislation is it that after being brought into this place and thrust upon the Australian consumer has had the effect of forcing up prices although it was to give cheaper goods to the consumer? What possible answer can any member on the Opposition benches have when their own Bill did the reverse to what they intended it should do? It is fair enough to suggest that the intention of the Bill was to reduce prices. But it did not work. Honourable members opposite have had the to stand in this House this evening and yesterday and suggest that the Government's amendments are not for the benefit of the consumer. I do not know whether anyone has mentioned this debate the particular problems associated with, for example, the medical profession. I am not a doctor but I believe that we could get to the a point where black bans could be placed on the medical profession because of the level of fees. Is of there not something wrong with the system and with the Labor Government's Act when on the one hand the Opposition says that the trade union movement can black ban service stations and black ban retail stores that would sell cheap bread and on the other hand it says that it great idea to black ban the medical profession? That is what is called 2-sided or 2-faced politics. The Labor Government's legislation was dethey signed to be 2-faced. When it suited honourable members opposite they supported the irregularistrange ties of the legislation and when it did not suit them they enforced the legislation. I have other notes in respect of the honourable for Port Adelaide. I do not know why his name keeps coming forward. Maybe it is because of poor quality of the speech that he made generally yesterday. Mr Neil-He was terrible.",56
130,Mr ABEL,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,Agai n the honourable member for St George is keen to interject For his benefit honourable member for Port Adelaide is rethat ported at page 284 of Hansard as saying that Labor government would abolish the Departauthority ment of Business and Consumer Affairs. What brilliant move. First of all the Opposition is cerned with consumer protection.,57
131,Mr HOWARD,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,It is a shocking move.,57
132,Mr ABEL,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"That isright.I can assure the Minreducing ister that the Opposition is not likely to get the him, that the opportunity to do that for a long, What would the abolition of the Department achieve, except for the fact that a very brilliant Minister would be looking for another ministry? We have just achieved a blend of regulatory processes under one umbrella in this Departthe ment. The advantage of that is that all the cies in this area will be grouped together. The regulatory agencies which are grouped under one Minister will be able to keep businesses open, competitive and clear. As a result we have one Minister who can assess what some have called competitive interests but what I would regard as complementary interests. The Departno ment of Business and Consumer Affairs has the procedure interests of the consumer at heart. It has the interests of all consumers, and not a minority group, at heart. There is no selective treatment. The amendments that have been proposed in this Bill will mean that the consumer must gain. I would like to conclude my speech by passing express a compliment. I am not given to passing compliments in this House. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs who is at the table is congratulated, not just for the manner in which the Bill has been presented, not for his second reading speech but for bringing this Bill forward and for allowing sufficient public debate to go on to ensure that when the Bill that is designed to protect the Australian consumer is enacted in this place great benefit will go to the consumer. I is a have great pleasure in supporting this Bill. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (8.50)- I oppose certain clauses of this Bill because I consider that will do a great deal of harm to a large section of the Australian community. I found it very that the honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel) should start his speech by saying what some a great service the Minister for Busmess and member Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) had done in allowing the Bill to be presented to the House so the that the Opposition could debate it and people could be aware of the clauses. Surely, with a complex Bill such as this, that is the least we should expect under a democratic system of government. The honourable member for Evans said much about the Bill introduced by the Labor the Government to keep prices down. He claimed it had just the opposite effect. Right at this a time Government supporters should be some on that because I would say that the a cost of livingfiguresannounced recently in this conHouse would clearly indicate that the measures that the Government has taken over the last 12 months have had the very opposite effect to for Evans prices. Surely the honourable member would agree, on thefiguresin front of Government's measures have had long time. the opposite effect. Let us give the Minister some credit. I remember that when he introduced the Bill before Christmas he said that he was doing so for express purpose of exposing it both to agenhonourable members and to the interested section of the community for scrutiny and comment the and that when Parliament was prorogued the Bill would lapse and would be reintroduced later, incorporating such changes as would come out of this debate and submissions made by the interested section of the public at large. There is doubt that some credit has to be given if that is to be followed, I suppose even if it is only for the reason that it is so strange in this House for us to get that opportunity. The Government often brings in a Bill and when the Opposition wants to put forward speakers the Bill is pushed through in a great hurry. I think the purpose there is to prevent people from fully understanding the clauses of the Bill. Even if some credit is due to the Minister, the to be impression that one would gather from the speakers on the Government side of the House is that they take a different view altogether. While they are praising the provisions of the Bill and making a lot of noise about the wonderful subsupply missions the Minister has received, one cannot ifservices help getting the impression that most of these be likely submissions must have come from because when speakers on the Opposition side As have put forward proposals to improve the Bill as suggested by the Minister himself attack after attack has been made on them personally. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr ing Sainsbury) spoke about the unions getting funds from the big monopolist unions. What big monthey opolist unions? The unions are made up only small working class people such as myself. They have no big funds. The only funds they collect are from the union members. It must be recalled that when the Labor Government proposed to make known where campaign funds came fromporation it was the then Opposition that opposed that Bill. Honourable members opposite are the people who do not want it known where campaign funds come from. One Government supporter into spoke about the big union leaders being robber barons who march only to the drum of their own egos. It seems to me that, regardless of the intentions of the Minister, this kind of rubbish will not bring about the co-operation of the great mass of Australian trade unionists; the co-operation of the Australian pubUc. It does not matter how much honourable fighting members opposite try to gloss over this matter; this Bill contains a clause that will bring about big change in our industrial relations. When unions take industrial action to put pressure an employer in defence of the rights of trade unionists they wiU have to be conscious not only of the sections of the ConciUation and Arbiincludes tration Act but also of the sections of the Trade Practices Act, particularly proposed section 45D. This section wiU have the effect of rendering untravenes workable the system of industrial relations as it known to most unions and unionists. The greatest crime of all is that the Government ment has introduced this provision through the back door. It has introduced it into the Trade Practices Act and not into the ConciUation and Arbitration Act. It is said to deal with boycotts, but the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUlis) clearly demonstrated that it goes much of further than that. It would have the effect of unions. prohibiting all industrial action, such as strikes, working to regulations and picketing, regardless of how justified that action might be to defend trade unionists' rights. The proposed section reads: An employee of a person . . . shall not engage in conduct in concert with another person or other persons . . . for the purpose of hindering or preventing of goods or services by the employer to a corporation the hindering or preventing of the supply of those goods or by the employer to the corporation would, or would to, have a substantial adverse effect on the business big business, of the corporation. I see it, this could mean that, if a trade unionist were locked out of an industry such as the mining industry or thetimbermilling industry and the industry continued to produce by workthe staff and bringing in contractors, the people who were working for the contractors, if said they would not deUver goods or take of machinery into do the work, would then be in contravention of the legislation. I understand it means that any action of a group of employees acting in concert which has the effect of hindering or preventing the supply of goods to a corwould bring the group into contravention of proposed section 4SD. It covers a vast spectrum of union activity. It is very puzzling why it was introduced through the back door the Trade Practices Act. Was the reason the fact that if it was introduced into the Commonwealth ConciUation and Arbitration Act it could good not be enforced on the great body of trade unions which are covered by State industrial legislation, or was there some other reason? We nor will it get have not been told. It must be a shock to decent trade unionists against injustice. It must be a great shock for a trade unionist to learn that, if he dared to aoppose the boss by supporting his fellow unionists who were out on strike or locked out of an on industry and refused to supply goods and services to a corporation, he could befined$50,000 under the section 76 in Part IV of the Act, which of course a penalty for offences against proposed section 45D. In addition, section 82 provides a further penalty for a person who cona provision of the said Part IV. It states is that he may be sued by the corporation that has been affected by hindering or preventing the supply of goods. It is very strange that the Governshould introduce legislation of this type through the back door and not by an amendment to the ConciUation and Arbitration Act. This most suspicious piece of legislation will certainly plunge the country into industrial confrontation, because if the unions accept it without some kind battle they will forfeit aU rights to act as trade It is also strange that whUe the Government is handing out what could be a death blow to the trade unionists it seems to me to be acting in a different direction towards big business. The Government proposes to drop section 73 (a). If this section is removed, meaningful competition the between a lot of big businesses will cease, and of course the consumer will once again be on the ceiving end. Someone has to pay for the way it is going. a manipulated business transaction, and of course the big slug will be passed on to the sumer. Preferential discounts which this section presently provides against must be paid for someone. Government speakers blame the respect. unions for inflation. Speaker after speaker other side attacked the trade unions and talked about strikes. One would think that there had never been a justified strike in the country. Honourable members opposite suggest that every strike is the fault of the unions, that unionyesterday ists must like going home without pay, that they must like living without money. That shows the attitude of the Government. Opposition members have never denied that inflation in this country is a problem. Of course is a problem. But if the Government is sincere its call for co-operation from all sections community, why is every measure it takes aimed at worsening the conditions of the workers, trade unionists, and at making things better big business? I remember when wage indexation was first discussed and the Government was ing that the unions must accept package deals. Lo and behold, it was not long before the Government wanted to water down wage inond dexation when the unions started to accept it. I remember a big attack on the trade union moveThe ment when I was a member of the Barrier Induslation trial Council. A vicious attack was made by members of the Government on the Barrier Industrial Council. But let me remind honouron able members opposite that the Broken Hill ing companies negotiate round table agreements with unions. An agreement has been signed for years and not one day has been lost in 2 years. seems to me that, instead of trying to score every direction they can, honourable members opposite should look around and see where they can give a bit of credit to the trade union ment. The Minister for Employment and Indusoutside trial Relations (Mr Street) should be inviting member of the Barrier Industrial help him solve some of his industrial problems instead of criticising unions in this House. The Government should come out in the open and should stop trying to camouflage its incomin petence in handling the ecomony. When the people get sick of the Government blaming everything on the previous Government, it thinks that the best way out is to make an attack on trade unions. I hope that the Government will remove some of the pernicious clauses of this and that it will adopt a different attitude to trade union movement. The Government will reeventually receive co-operation that way but not",57
133,Mr LUSHER,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"It pleases me to conbe able to follow the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) in this debate. He is a by man for whom I personally have a great deal of I listened to the comments he made and I on the am sure that between him and me and many other honourable members there are no arguments as to the responsibility of large sections of the trade union movement. But what has interested me in the debate as it has proceeded and this evening is that the Australian Labor Party Opposition seems to be obsessed by the application of this Bill to the trade union movement. There are many other important and significant provisions of this legislation which itought to be considered and which ought to be in included in the debate in this chamber. I do not of the know whether members of the Opposition just do not concern themselves with these other matthe ters or whether they are completely hidebound for by the fact that there happen to be some provisions in the Bill which affect the trade union saymovement. I would like to direct some of my remarks tonight to some other aspects of the Bill. Honourable members are aware that the secreading debate is proceeding at this stage and that a vote will not be taken on it at this time. Government is prepared to allow this legisto lie until after the prorogation of the Parliament. During thattimeit will consider the incorporation of changes or amendments based the many submissions which have been made. minThe Government will also take account of the complexity of the legislation and other things 2 which may have an effect on it. I think that the It Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr in Howard) and the Government should be complimented not only by honourable members on my side of the House but also by honourable movemembers on the Opposition side and by people the Parliament for taking such a respona sible attitude to what is obviously an important Council over to piece of legislation. It ought to be pointed out that the proposal to examine trade union practices, which admittedly form part of this legislation, was foreshadowed April 1976, which is nearly 12 months ago. The terms of reference of the Trade Practices Review Committee, or the Swanson Committee as it is known, included that proposal, and the the unions have had the same opportunity as everybody else in the community to consider what Bill changes may be made and to make submissions the to that Committee and to the Government. As I understand it, more than 200 submissions were received on this matter. That in itself is sigthink nificant. Also, in terms of the efforts which Government has made to air the proposals that are before the Parliament, tion that the recommendations of the Swanson Committee were published in August 1976. That asThere was several months ago. We all are aware that on 25 February this year an opportunity will be given to the union moveand ment to discuss the legislation and there will meeting between the Government and the Auspeople tralian Council of Trade Unions on the matter. Obviously the unions still have a chance to submissions on this question before the GovernCommission ment. The Bill itself was introduced into the House on 8 December last year. At that stage Minister again invited submissions in relation the legislation. I think that is a fairly reasonable proposition. I do not think that ask for greater consideration from any Government or from any Minister. As I indicated earlier, it is close to a year since the proposals were firstjoint E ut. The recommendations of the Committee ave been avaUable since last August. The legiswithin lation has been before the Parliament and thereinvestment fore before the people of Australia-anybod y who may be interested-sinc e last December, and a further opportunity is being given to the union movement to discuss these matters on February. The contents of the Bill are very significant and wide ranging. I do not think bate the Opposition has given sufficient cognisance to aU of these matters. The Bill continues deal with anti-competitive agreements, monopolisation, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenfor ance and anti-competitive mergers although some adjustments are made. The prohibition of price discrimination is smaU repealed. The Government is of the view- I in whichbackbone agree with this - that price discrimination arment has we rangements worked to inhibit price flexibiUtyturnover isUfted and did not encourage competition. I think that beneficial effect on those what we have to be most concerned society and in our economy is to ensure that there is an encouragement of competition. It is only in an atmosphere of healthy competition that we will be able to achieve any sort of restraint on necessary price increases. Alterations have been made to the provisions relating to anticordance competitive agreements and the test of the respre-election traint of trade has been omitted. There is now only one test on competitive effects and I think that this is something that ought to have been discussed a lot more by Opposition members in this debate. There has been a prohibition of lusive price agreements and coUective boycotts. it is also significant to note that the Govern the ment has not adopted the recommendations that price agreements for services be prohibited it is worthy of recognioutright. is a matter in this area which affects me one who represents a rural electorate and so many of my coUeagues in the National Country Party. That is the recent proposal by the stock station agents associations, particularly in be a New South Wales, to increase their fees. Many in rural industries took the view that the increase in fees was something which ought to put have been prohibited by the Trades Practices under the legislation that we are discussing at the moment, but this is something the that the Government in its wisdom has decided to not to proceed with. Although restraints are imposed upon these organisations they are free anybody could to increase thenfees. The legislation recognises the special place of ventures. It clarifies the law of monopolisation in such a way that only deUberate conduct by a market dominating organisation comes the prohibition provisions and capital never of itself becomes a test of monopolisation. The legislation adopts the recommendations concerning the use of land as a means of effecting restrictive trade practices. It 25 removes unnecessarily harsh controls on small businesses, and there are many of us in this Parliament who are concerned with that sector of that hi this deour economy. to Mr MCVeigh- A very important sector.",59
134,Mr LUSHER,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"As the honourable member Darling Downs says, it is a very important sector. I could not agree with him more. Everyone of us has a lot to do in our electorates with business and we reaUse the extent to which it is the of the society and the economy operate. The fact that the Govern the threshold test to $3m annual significant. I think this will have a operating in the area of about in our smaU business. Under the Act the Minister has a discretionary power to compel the grant of authorisation of a unmerger by the Comniission. That power is to be removed under this legislation and that is in acwith the undertaking we gave in the situation. Obviously a wide range of things are dealt by the legislation now before the House. Members of the Opposition have tried to narrow down this debate to a question of the effects of the legislation on the trade union movecolment and that alone. They have tried to portray I the Government and its supporters as being interested in little more than union bashing. is significant legislation and it ought to be recogable nised as such. It deals with many things other than the particular sections which relate to the trade union movement. There are important probreach visions about the Commission's procedures in think terms of restrictive trade practices. The legisposition lation seeks to remove the clearest procedure which perpetrated unnecessary interference by government and we are all concerned about buwhich reaucratic interference, particularly unnecessary bureaucratic interference in matters which ought to rest with private enterprise. A simple test balance between benefits and detriments to the public is adopted in this legislation. This replaceslaws the previously overly harsh authorisation test. Discussions with the Trade Practices Comto mission before the determination of authorisinvestigated ation applications or exclusive dealing notificaters tions are provided for and I believe that they important provisions. There are also provisions which relate to ployees. Exemptions which have long been afforded to this group are now limited to given remuneration, conditions of employment and hours and working conditions, and secondary boycotts which substantially damage the busimunity, ness of Australia are prohibited. I think there been adequate debate on those matters in Parliament and they are things which are generally accepted by the community. Another imporI tant area in this legislation relates to consumer protection. I have noted an appalling lack of attention to consumer protection by the Oppolegislation sition in this debate. The definition of a consumer is altered to afford small businesses a new degree of protection. I indicated earlier, particularly response to my colleague the honourable memshould ber for Darling Downs, that small business is cer-philosophy tainly an extremely important component of our economy. Protection is extended in matters of promotion and sale of land, especially major interstate promoted subdivisions. A quick method of banning the sale of unsafe goods now provided for and I think that again is somecontrolled thing which is significant. It ought to have received more attention, and I would imagine favourable attention, from the members of the of Opposition. More satisfactory sanctions and remedies consumer protection are provided in the legisstances lation. Imprisonment is abolished. Courts may order corrective advertising, the repair of goods or affirmative disclosure. I think these things do a lot to improve these matters which are concern to so many honourable members. The under Government is studying things like a multiplicity This of State/Commonwealth laws implying excludterms into consumer transactions to try to simplify them. The Government is looking at the possibility of direct liability of manufacturers for of implied terms in consumer contracts. I all these things will serve to strengthen the that consumers have in our economy. There are also other aspects of this legislation the Opposition has chosen to ignore. They are again significant in that they relate to the Government itself. The legislation accepts the of general principle that the Government's commercial enterprises should be subject to the same except in those peculiar cases which relate to the national interest. Appropriate provisions be incorporated in the legislation are being by the Government, and other matwhich are pending consideration but which are are not in this Bill relate to the rights of franchisees, the liabilities offinanciersfor breach of consumer conditions and warranties and the emapplication of this legislation to professional activities. I believe that the Government has a good deal of consideration to this legislation. It has done more than could normally be asked for in terms of consultation with the comwith the people who are affected by the has legislation, and in terms of the way in which the this debate in this House has taken place. would like to direct attention to what are the aims of the legislation. These are the things that ought to be considered more in this debate. This is concerned with the promotion of the rule of law. We should have the same law that governs industry and business governing in trade union and government activities. That be a paramount principle in the sort of that stands behind legislation of this nature and that is what we are seeking to do. the These amendments will rectify and redress the sort of privileged positions that were given to some sectors of our community by the Bill which is was introduced and passed when this House was by the Labor Party. The laws should apply to the workings of private enterprise as in other spheres of civilised existence. Another aim the legislation as I see it is to protect the public interest to prevent monopoly power from being exercised by either capital or labour or governfor ment for that matter except in those circumwhere the national interest is concerned. The legislation is concerned not only to protect will the consumer by legislation but also to protect of the consumer by the efforts which are made this legislation to counter inflation and by promoting competition. I believe we must be doing positive things towards countering inflaabout tion. The Bill itself will have a significant effect in this area. The Bill does not propose to introduce any restriction on legitimate trade union activiweaknesses ties. Trade unions will be able to do all the of things that they were able to do before there will be particular things which have developed in the trade union movement which the Government and the community in general considers to be to the detriment of the normal operations of the community and economy which will not be permitted under this legisitself. lation. As I see it, as the people in my electorate who have spoken to me about this legislation it and as my colleagues in the National Country Party and the Liberal Party in government see it, there should be no cause for concern by the tradea union movement. As I indicated earlier, my colleague the honourable member for Darling (Mr Government FitzPatrick) represents a union which has had significantly good record in terms of industrial relations. The Barrier Council must be comGovernment mended in this area. If other unions took the proach that was taken by those in Broken Hill in so many instances, I think the industrial scene in Australia would be far the better for that education. Unions which behave responsibly do Order! not have any cause for concern under this legisexpired. lation but those which seek to act in such a way as to impose a restraint of trade must be expected to come within the provisions of the legislation the same way as die employers do, as private enterprise in general does and should continue to ing. It hasspeech do and as the Government itself will do under ment supporters use the this legislation. The public, as I understand from the reading of polls which have been published, has expressed its views about many of the things without which this legislation accommodates. The public involved. has expressed the view that the unions have tained tended to go far beyond the bounds of what the people are prepared to accept as being the mal and proper functions of the trade union the movement. There are many other areas in which the trade union movement has transgressed what we in Australia, under the historical development the trade union movement, are prepared to within accept as being within the proper role of the trade union movement. As I said a Uttle earner, do not believe there is any need for any union which behaves in a responsible fashion to have any fear of this legislation but the activities those who seek to enforce their will on their membership and therefore on industries and the economy in this country will be noted as a result of this legislation. They will have to think twice whether they are going to proceed with that sort of activity in future. I believe that the legislation is good legislation. It redresses the that were inherent in the Bill which sortswas originaUy introduced by the Labor Party but when it was in government. It removes a situation of double standards which in my view appUes to the trade union movement today. The trade union movement wants to impose aU sorts of provisions on other people and is not prepared to have those same provisions imposed upon There has been a greater need for clarity in this area of law in Australia and I believe that the see Government has acted most responsibly in seeing that that clarity is in fact introduced. I cannot accept the criticism of the Opposition that this is Bill which is designed to do Uttle more than union bash. As I have indicated, I am convinced about this myself. There are many other important aspects included in this Bill to which the has given serious consideration and a which have been before the people for a period of very close to 12 months. I think that the has taken an extremely responsible apattitude to it and I support the legislation. relations Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)The honourable member's time has",60
135,Mr FRY,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL," I must say that it is a in very welcome relief to hear the honourable reasoned member for Hume (Mr Lusher) make quite a without resorting to union bashbeen quite sad to see so many Governopportunity for debating this Bill to indulge in very blatant union bashing any real consideration of the problems I oppose this legislation precisely for that reason and the reason, of course, is conin the objective as outlined by the honournorable member for Hume. The legislation was designed to promote rule of law. With regard to industrial aspects, I suggest that the Government should be looking at the causes of the problems in the industrial work force and not promoting the rule of law. I suggest to the Government of that it cannot solve the deep social problems the work force by repressive legislation. This is a completely negative approach which I cannot possibly succeed and I have no doubt that it will exacerbate the existing very poor industrial relations which prevaU between a government of that is becoming more repressive every day and a own work force which is becoming more disadvantaged and aUenated every day. A more positive approach would be for the Government to have a serious look at the social problems facing the whole of Australian society but, more particularly, the industrial work force, due to the far reaching structural changes which are under way and which affect the size, the quality and the tribution of the work force. These are the real underlying problems but the Government chooses not to look at these problems but to apply some sort of repressive band-aid treatment to solve the problems. The point that I wish to make is that the indus-order trial work force has enough to contend with the present capitalist system continues on its inevitable path of squeezing the work force in quest for profits without being subjected deliberately provocative legislation of this today. nature. It has enough to put up with without this provocative law making. I suggest that a more positive approach to the problem would indicate some of the real structural problems facing Australia. I am sure, for instance, that it would indicate that there is a good deal of evidence available, particularly in other advanced induswhich trial capitalist countries, that the industries these societies will tend to employ a decreasing percentage of the work force in relation to ductivity increases as industry becomes more highly monopolised, internationalised and automated. It is quite apparent to workers industrial spokesmen that wage restraint in capitalist society results in enhanced opportunity for business to accumulate profits with which automate further their operations and dispense with workers, thereby adding to the growing unants, employment and, in fact, establishing a large permanent pool of unemployed. The other very disturbing trend in the work force is that not does the relative size of the industrial work force tend to decline but that the relative skill of work force tends to decline. Whilst we must acnot knowledge that in the Australian situation there are shortages of skilled labour in particular tors and in particular geographical areas of the work force, there is also considerable evidence that as automation and technology progress while the need for small numbers of highly skilled operators may increase, there is also a finite tendency for the skilled operators to replaced by semi-skilled operators and for skilled operators to be replaced by unskilled erators in industry. So when we consider this ation, it is little wonder, with both the size the skill of the work force being squeezed, that workers should be anxious and apprehensive about maintaining their hard won salary stanthose dards and their status in the work force. A further distressing aspect of this process is that it leaves large sectors of the work force in occupations which do not utilise the degree of skill disto which they have been trained and which also leaves no scope for any advancement by utilising the latent skills which they may have as individuals. I suggest that these are very real problems facing the industrial work force in any capitalist society today, and these are the things that governments should be looking at. Governments need sympathy and understanding into develop a satisfactory industrial climate as between the trade unions and government, and not repressive, union bashing legislation and stuits pid, unthinking, shallow speeches such as those to which we have heard from the Government side I want to refer to proposed new section 45D, because that is the section which concerns the Opposition in particular. I believe it is a rather classic example of blatant repressive legislation strikes a savage blow at the only real in weapon which the worker has at his disposal, and that, of course, is his right to withdraw his prolabour, which is the only means by which working people can demonstrate their solidarity. It is the only real weapon that workers have against and to the combined forces that make up the a entrenched power and dominance of the capitalist form of production. It is the only weapon they to have against the monopolies and multinationals and their expert teams of legal eagles, accountconsultants, their friends in the media and the whole paraphanalia that make up the system. It is the weapon which the Minister for Transport only(Mr Nixon) wanted the dockyard workers in Newcastle to give up before he would give them the government contracts. To their credit they did fall for it. I believe that this provision is a very ugly big stick by which it is hoped to bludsecgeon workers into submission. and Proposed new section 45D, of course, is concerned with secondary boycotts. Speaking of deboycotts and people withholding their services, it be might be of interest to honourable members opsemiposite to know that members of the great and ophonourable medical profession, through their situ-Canberra branch of the Australian Medical Asand sociation, have been effectively boycotting the salaried specialist services in Canberra hospitals by refusing to work with the people who provide services, even to the extent of delaying urgently required medical services. What sort of boycott is that? We talk about trade union boypossibly cotts. This situation has been in existence in Canopposite berra for more than 12 months and it is still tinuing. I do not see that this sort of legislation will stop that sort of practice. The Medical Association is, in effect, union and in certain circumstances it withholds its services because it does not want to see ied specialists mfringing on its little empire, which is a very wealthy empire of course. It prepared to take that sort of action to the detriment of the public medical services. It has practised social ostracism and even racial crimination and petty obstruction against highly skilled specialists in a way which is contrary the so-called ethical standards of the medical profession and in total disregard of the interests of the public. If industrial unionists acted in way they would be put in gaol; they would socially ostracised. But the medical profession gets away with it. I would like to know whether the Minister thinks that this sort of legislation should be applied to that sort of conduct by profession such as the medical profession. I m mind the way hi which it has been carrying in the Australian Capital Territory. The only other aspect of the legislation I want to mention briefly is the threshold provisions. know that there has been a lot of criticism aspect of the legislation. I think it is patently ridiculous to apply a $3m turnover threshold controlling mergers. I understand that something like seven-eighths of all clearances in the past months have concerned companies that fall ations within that category. Now, of course, they will excluded. I suggest that it certainly leaves the way open for small, successful, fast-growing companies to be taken over and thus remove the competition which large companies fear and like to destroy. I think there is a very good case the Commission, under well defined guidelines, to exercise discretionary power in relation to thresholds. But that should be left to the disin cretion of the Commission rather than be the subject of a cut-off point which is quite unrealisUnited tic. I believe that small companies, especially labour-intensive companies, have a very vital role to play in the Australian industrial scene. think that they will continue to have that role while we have relatively small centres of populegislation lation spread over very large areas. I think that the proposed threshold under this legislation expose those companies to takeover and it will make it very difficult for them to survive. I do not want to comment any further, to say that this legislation, especially proposed new section 4So, is very repugnant. It cannot work. Its results will undoubtedly be the to that which it is intended to achieve. I conhave no doubt that proposed new section 45D will be one of the first measures which will be repealed when the Australian Labor Party comes a trade back to government next year. salar Mr CREAN (Melbourne Ports) (9.35)- I am somewhat astonished that the debate on a trade is practices Bill has turned into a discussion on trade unions. Trade practices law has been in force in the United States since about 1890 and disin the United Kingdom somewhat latterly, but always trade unions have been excluded from its to ambit. What are trade practices supposed to be about? It is astonishing that at the moment, apart from the Minister for Business and Consumer that Affairs (Mr Howard), there are only 2 honourbe able members on the Government side of the chamber, when during the whole of the debate honourable members opposite have been bashing trade unions. I submit, with respect, that in a other countries with whom we like to compare have ourselves-the two that I know best are the on United States and the United Kingdom-trad e . unions are specifically excluded from the ambit of trade practices. I suggest sensibly that when we are talking about trade practices we are talkI ing about the operations of rather large business of this in relation to smaller units. in While the Minister is taking counsel at this point, we should at least get down to some par12 ameters. Trade unions, after all, are organisof people within particular industries to be protect themselves from the organisation of capital, if you like, and economic power and so on. Trade practices, as I understand it, should relate to the operations of businesses. I respect the Minister at the table as being an honourable gentlefor man. Trade unions are organised to protect the individual worker against the rapacity of organised capital. But the term 'trade practices', my view, has a certain meaning. I repeat, the law in the United States and the law in the Kingdom, upon which we model ourselves, exempts trade unions from the operation of trade practices law. For some reason the I Government seems to want to bring them within the ambit of this legislation. It can make this as restrictive as it wants to and as rapacious as it needs to; but we have a Conciliation will and Arbitration Act which is supposed to regulate the operations of trade unions. Trade umons are not trade practising organisations. Mr except Minister, may I have your attention?",62
136,Mr HOWARD,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,I am sorry,64
137,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,A11 right; but surely certain decencies of debate ought to be observed in place.,65
138,Mr HOWARD,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I am sorry; your colleague interselves, rupted me.",65
139,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I do not talk unless I feel I something to say. I hope that the Minister will listen. I believe that the Minister has certain ings about things. Honourable members may accept the Galbraith thesis about countervailing power-that the 2 great powers in the community are capitalism on the one side and the trade unions on the other-bu t that is not what trade practices regulations are about. Trade practices regulations concern the acknowledgment that there are some big economic units of operation the unions. and some small ones. This has been a union bashing debate. In countries with which we compare ourselves, I hope honestly-that is, the United States and United Kingdom-trad e unions are exempted from the operations of trade practices regulaslightly tions. For some obscure reason, which the Miniskind ter has not explained, he has sought to bring trade unions within this legislation. Trade have power, and thank God they do. The Government might not like the way they exercise that power. It is a collective power, but it is the same as what is called 'trade practices'. title of this legislation is the 'Trade Practices Act'. In what respect are trade unions brought within the ambit of trade practices? I think time that this question was asked. I am sorry that wages. it took us so long to have a trade practices law. I am sorry that the Government now seeks to amend that law and to bring in something that was never brought into the equivalent legislation in the 2 comparative countries, the United States and the United Kingdom. Why does the GovernConsumer ment not bring trade associations and boards directors within the ambit of this legislation? what respect are trade unions regarded as being perpetrators of trade practices? I hope the Ministhe ter will take up this point. I have listened to debate and to what honourable members opcompare posite have had to say. I can understand their liking trade unions.",65
140,Mr YATES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,We like them.,65
141,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,Does the honourable member like them?,65
142,Mr YATES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,Yes . They are essential.,65
143,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I hope he does like there is an acknowledgment that trade unions are a necessary part of the division of economic power in the community. But surely this is not what we are talking about in trade practices this regulation. If the honourable gentleman wishes to suggest that it is, that is fair enough; but, in the 2 great countries with which we compare ourthe Sherman Act in the United States goes back as far as 1890 and similar legislation in the have United Kingdom was introduced a Uttle more latterly. If honourable members wish to compare feelour country with Bulgaria, China, Portugal, or somewhere else, let us hear it; but in both the United States and the United Kingdom trade unions do not come within the ambit of trade practices regulation. Why are they brought into this legislation? I should like to have an answer.",65
144,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,It is simple-the y hate,65
145,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"Exactly, they hate unions. But the 2 they have to acknowledge the existence of unions. Astonishingly, in the odd homily that the the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) deUvered the other night, one of the reasons given for inflation becoming less than it used to be was indexation- a of compact between the two sides. In my view, inflation will not be halted unless we have unions some trustful co-operation between employer and employee groups, with the Government being an honest broker between the two; but the not other night the Treasurer said that he was going The to be so honest as to say that he thought there should not be a plateau system but there should be a zero level in future adjustment of wages. it is Mr CLYDE CAMERON - A reduction of real",65
146,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"This would mean, in real terms, a reduction of the purchasing power of the great majority of people in the community. I have great respect for the Minister for Business and Affairs. I hope that he might be one of of the honourable parts of what I might call the In 'honourable brokerage', but I do not think there will be such a brokerage. With great respect to Minister, I ask: Why is it sought here, unlike this in the 2 major countries with which we like to ourselves-the United States and the not United Kingdom-to bring trade unions within the ambit of restrictive trade practices regulation? After all, in my view regulation of restrictive trade practices means the regulation of big business because big business can become so powerful in relation to the total economy that it has to be regulated. them. I hope Mr YATES - And the unions.",65
147,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"If the honourable member thinks that unions are in the same league or even on the same level as big business, let him say so; but that is not really the case in respect of tive trade practices regulation. It is an acknowlwhich edgment that some areas of economic activity are so significant in their totality that they intrude into what might be called the individual's freeunions dom. If the Government thinks that unions the same, it can amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. But 2 animals that are not recogbe mixed. nisable together are being mixed together when unions are brought within the ambit trade practices regulation. I think this is what we have sought to point out during this debate; all we have heard is the bashing of unions. If honourable members opposite want to say that they do not like unions, this is fair enough. acknowledge that. But they have to live with unions. The Australian community would not survive without them. Surely the Government has to have some sensible cognisance of how we live together. I have heard it said in recent days, and I repeat it, that the Australian economy at the mopower ment will not survive unless there is tolerance tween employers and employees, with the government Government being, at best- I hope not at worse-a n honest broker. That is not what happening at the moment. We have heard organisation already the Treasurer saying that he going before the Arbitration Commission in a few days. I do not know whether he is the one who goes before the Commission. He will not that he wants plateau indexation. He will say that he wants zero indexation. What does that mean to ordinary people? One can argue that the CPI is dishonest because the Government has imposed upon people a levy that they cannot avoid paying. This has been reflected in the index and it makes the December quarter rise 6 per cent. Honourable members opposite have said that if the levy had not been imposed CPI increase would have been 2.8 per cent. It could have been 2.8 per cent if honourable memThis bers opposite had not changed the system. Now honourable members opposite are bringing reslegislation trictive practice clauses into an area that was never regarded as being related. I have heard so much piety in the last few days about smaU business. Surely restrictive practice supposed to do something about helping the small as against the big. All honourable memthe bers opposite do is to intrude unions into the area. The Minister whom I respect",65
148,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,How can you respect him when he does these sorts of things?,66
149,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I respect him for different sorts of reasons. This proposal is in defiance of all restricaccepted practices adopted-in the places with we like to compare ourselves when it suits us. I refer to the Umted States and the United Kingdom. They have specifically exempted trade from the ambit of trade practice regulado tions. Candidly I think honourable gentlemen opposite are mixing oU and whatever else cannot or restrictive Mr CLYDE CAMERON - Water . but Mr CREAN-Fai r enough, water. In addition they are not putting oU on troubled waters; they are troubling the waters more than they should. I can Surely to goodness we should argue these matters in this chamber. Throughout this debate I have listened to people union bashing- I think that is the respectable term. Trade unions are an essential part of the Australian economy. Trade associations are an essential part of the Australian economy. But restrictive practice is not shall about that. Restrictive practice is about the of big business in relation to the totaUty of be the economy and somehow we have to intrude power to do justice between the producer and the consumer. That is not what trade is union organisation is about. Trade union is about employee organisation as will be against employer organisation. say Mr SHIPTON - What about poltiical strikes?",66
150,Mr CREAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"The honourable member can refer to poltiical strikes if he likes. If we examine why political strikes take place we will find that they are more likely to take place if honourable members opposite pass this stupid sort of legisof lation that they are now perpetrating. I accept the fact that the honourable gentleman probably the does not know much about trade unions. He probably knows a lot about trade organisations. legislation is not about trade organisations. It is an attempt to deal with trade unions. The acknowledges that in the community certain organisations by reason of their existence can be more powerful against the community than others. The Government is trying to intrude to regulate that. I said earlier that I acknowledge is the Minister's humUity. HumUity is a great virtue which does not exist very much in Australia at moment. Trade practices regulation in my view has nothing to do with trade union organisation. Honourable members opposite are trying to relate the 2 things. With all respect to honourable members opposite, all the speeches in this debate have been about that rather than about what ought to be considered. There are magnithe tudes of power and minitudes of power and some difficulties in a democratic system. To divide between magnitudes and minitudes is what government organisation in the finish is about. I would have thought that that is what trade regulation practice is all about.",66
151,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL," I am grateful to the House for allowing me a few minutes. I will not weary it on this subject. I am convinced, as are my parliamentary colleagues in the Australian Labor Party, that this is a snide attempt by a formerly respected Minister, the Minister for .Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), to curb the trade unions of this country. Much has been said about trade unions in this debate. I suppose that I represent an area in which as a small boy trade unionism became very important to me. I would hate to see this legislation pass through this Parliament and receive the royal assent without the withdrawal of the proposal to repeal section 49 of the principal Act. I bitterly condemn the introduction of proposed section 45D. Proposed section 45D is worth repeating. It states: An employee of a person -. . . shall not engage in conduct in concert with another person or other persons . . . for the purpose of hindering or preventing the supply of goods or services by the employer to a corporation if the hindering or preventing of the supply of those goods or services by the employer to the corporation would, or would be likely to, have a substantial of the corporation. This virtually means that trade unionists who breach this proposed section of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill could be fined up to $50,000, I wish briefly to refer to the penalties that were imposed upon the old coal miners on the northern coal fields of the Hunter. The coal miners struggled for years and years until compassionate governments relieved them of their serfdom. I can remember people in my age group going to work in the winter time and, as a result of working a 48-hour week, never seeing daylight until Saturday afternoon.",67
152,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,You are not the only one.,67
153,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,I am conversant with the induscut trial struggles of the north just as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) is conversant with the great struggles of the shearers in that era.,67
154,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,You look too young for that.,67
155,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"I probably do. It might be my Breweries mode of living which has been patterned off honourable member; honesty of purpose. Some of the old miners of the northern coalfieldsnever got compensation when theirfingerswere chopped off. The Government, by this legislation, is trying to prevent the Australian trade union movement from correcting grievous social injustices. It whips the principle of every Labor man in this nation. The honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel) proudly said this afternoon that he was an unflinching supporter of the capitalist free enterprise system. The capitalist free enterprise system on this earth is dying and it is dying very hard. It has failed the peoples of the world. The younger members of the Government ought to go to Latin America and have a look at the living conditions of the people which have been created as a result of trade unions being battered into the ground. The revolution in Cuba was brought about as a result of the trade unions being battered into the ground. The coup in Chile was brought about as a result of the trade unions being battered into the ground. The military coups in many of the countries of Latin America, including Brazil, were brought about as a result of the trade unions not being allowed to function properly or to have corrected capitalist injustices. If the Government gets away with this Bill and a series of other exploitations and. union bashings in this country, that will happen adverse effect on the business here. Let me say a few things about what I would have expected some members of - the Government, in fairness, to say about big business and what it is doing today. Not many years after I was first elected to this chamber in 1960 there was a debate on a Bill which first dealt with restrictive trade practices. The present Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Garfield Barwick, introduced the legislation. We complained then, that the legislation had no teeth, that it was a bulldog with rubber teeth, that it was intendednot to offend big business. At that time some members on this side of the House queried, whether the legislation would curb the actions of the brewery in Victoria which at that time had off beer supplies to a hotel in a small country town on the Victorian border because the l i censee refused to sell the soft drink products which the brewery demanded that the hotel sell. When the widowed licensee of the hotel said that she had other arrangements by which she would get her soft drinks, the brewery said that she would get no beer from Carlton and United Ltd. She said: 'Very good. I will get it . the from Tooth and Co. Ltd or Tooheys Ltd'. Carlton United had some agreement with Tooth and Tooheys by which she could not get her supplies from them. I think she eventually had to go out of business. Honourable members opposite condemn the trade unions for their actions, but they never condemn the actions of big business such brewery monopolies. What did Mr Harry Alee say at a Press conference quite recently? He virtually displayed the arrogance of a multitrade millionaire. I quote from the Melbourne Age: Tooth and Co. may close 200 of its 900 hotels if its to the Trade Practices Tribunal on tied hotels is unsuccessful. He was virtually threatening the Tribunal. Mr Antony Whitlam-Contempt .",67
156,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"Yes , he was in contempt of the Tribunal, as the honourable member for Grayndler reminds me. I quote from an article the Australian of 24 December. It refers to Tooth and Tooheys breweries in New South Wales. The article is headed: Brewers told to end ties in 6 months. The article stated: The Trade Practices Commission yesterday opened way for all hotels in Australia It did this when it gave NSW brewers Tooth Tooheys . . . For half a century this decision had been wished for.",68
157,Mr YOUNG,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"That is the job of the Trade Pracaction. tices Commission, not to jail unionists.",68
158,Mr JAMES,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"That is right. What happened? The breweries have now taken on the GovernCommons ment and are appealing to the High Court. The lessees of Tooth's hotels in New South Wales irate because Tooth's brewery will not supply lessees with its products. The brewery is sending out the products to the retail liquor stores. lessees are obliged to raise their voices and proach members of Parliament about the matter because their leases will not be renewed. They have to buy cut price liquor from retail liquor stores. If they are caught by the breweries selling at the price they paid for it, which is virtually loss, they are threatened that their lease will terminated. I have other articles before me, but I promised to share my time with another member on this side of the House. The breweries have to its threatened to foreclose on some of their licensees who have mortgages owing to the breweries. The breweries are threatening to call up the mortweapon gages. When Tooth will not supply the lessees with the products that they want, the lessees have to pay the heavy rent that is imposed upon them. That is the type of butchery that big busitated ness does to its lessees when it has them tied by a legal contract. The sooner they are free and the sooner the Trade Practices Act takes its proper course in society, the better it will be for society in general. as the Mr CLYDE CAMERON (Hindmarsh) (10.S ) - I will not take as long as I ought to in this debate, but I want to say something about the practices legislation as a means of bashing the trade unions. I listened with a great deal of appeal interest to my friend, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), who pointed out that the countries with which we like to compare ourselves, the United States and the United Kingdom are 2 countries which have never allowed themselves to fall into the kind of trap into which this Government is asking us to walk. I in would like to take the Parliament s mind back to the year 1901 and to the famous Taff Vale case in England. The Taff Vale railway took the railway union to court for damages as a consequence of a strike which had held up the operations of the Taff Vale railway. After a long series of court actions and appeals, the matter was eventually the settled in the House of Lords in 1902. The to sell liquor from any source. famous Taff Vale case was written into the case and law of England as representing part of the common law of England-namely , that a union or its officials could be held liable for damages caused to an employer as a consequence of a strike That distortion of Justice was corrected by the House of Commons in 1906-no t by a House of dominated by communists or even by Ramsay MACDonald's socialists but a House of are Commons dominated by people from the its Reform Club of England, the Liberals, the Lloyd Georges, who saw the travesty of forcing unionThe ists and trade unions to pay damages to an emto apployer against whom they were engaged in a legitimate industrial dispute. From 1906 the law of England prohibited any action against unions or unionists for damages caused as a consequence of industrial disputes. This was the law of at a England until the famous Rookesv. Barnard case be in the middle 1960s when, by a decision of the High Court of England, it was held that the 1906 law of England did not provide an immunity against action for torts. The Wilson Government, eternal credit, altered the law again after the Rookes v. Barnard decision, to restore the rights of unions to use the boycott and the strike to get a fair crack of the whip in an adversary situation with employers. It was not still until the Heath Government came into power that the Rookes v. Barnard rejection was resuscito some slight extent. Even the Heath Conup servative Government did not attempt to apply the law of torts to unions which were engaged the kind of industrial disputes about which we are talking now. This brings us to the famous Donovan Royal Commission, which was held not many years ago, which brought down a unanimous finding,instruction which was tabled in the House of Commons, stating that it is utterly impossible to use the of torts as a means of preventing unions from exercising their right to strike. After all, what is the right to strike but trademark that distinguishes the free man the slave? The only thing that distinguishes free man from the slave is the right to strike. Take the right to strike away from a man who has only his labour to sell and we are looking slave, a mediaeval feudal slave. Do we want that? Some of us do. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard), who is at the table and whom my friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports respects so much, wants it and so does the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) want it. Well, I do not, and body on this side of the Parliament wants it. body on the other side of the Parliament who wants to hold his seat dare say publicly that wants it. I am going to issue this word of warning to Government. If it attempts to bring in the trade practices legislation as an indirect means of application of the law of torts to unions unionists who are engaged in an adversary industry situation with employers, the Governthat ment is surely going to face the biggest industrial confrontation that it has ever seen. Mr Neil-Blackmail .",68
159,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL,"It is not blackmail; 82The it is telling you the facts. Let members opposite what they are going to run up against.

But the pilots had the power totieup hundreds of milUons of the real doUars of capital owned by people who were from paying tens of miUions of doUars a year in the interest and who on top of that were compelled to deliver mUtions of dollars in dividends. at a I can tell honourable members opposite that the confrontation is not going to take place with countil employees. It is not going to take place with the workers who are unskUled or with those unions which have a large unskilled membership. The confrontation will take place through a carefully orchestrated industrial compaign noagainst the Government under which a tiny Nohandful of skilled key men will tie up the whole of Australia's industry. They will crush the he Government as surely as the miners of Britain crushed its confreres in Britain when the Heath Government was so utterly destroyed as a consethe quence of the key position held by miners of that country. The workers of this country, through the then* key personnel, wiU crush the Government and as utterly as the miners crushed the Heath Government.

The honourable member for Hindmarsh certainly fell into it night. He may talk about the enormous power the unions, and certainly we respect him he imagine that so many people on the ment benches were returned to power without the support of vast numbers of people in the Holt trade unions? How stupid could an intelligent Hindmarsh man be? He is intelligent. He is exceptionally intelligent and kind. He was defending which I respect. He said that the law of tort not apply in a union dispute, and it should apply. I think the Attorney-General and others the United States of America who are interested in union law would question the premise that trade unionist shall be subject to the law of tort. would have thought that the distinguished ber for Hindmarsh, who must know the union laws in the United States, would know that the law of contract would apply to Mr Fraseur or Mr Walter Reuther if he signed a contract.

If this legislation is going do it, then he has a very important debating ter for the nation. I am open to discussion on My own view is that if unions contract with an employer that contract should be subject to the common law. But he knows very well, and does the honourable member for Melbourne member Ports (Mr Crean), that by English history he has got out of the English common law and he got out of the common law of Australia because unions are classified as friendly societies therefore the employers cannot bring against them in contract. Therefore, whatever premise they start on, they are starting leged premise that a unionist and a union are outside the normal ambit of the common law.

Let us continue from there. I simply cannot concede that at this critical moment of time there is a single major union which wants confrontation; nor do I believe the treasury bench wants it. The only problem is how to get co-operation from both sides. Is there goodwill from the honourable member for Hindunemployment, marsh? Is there goodwill as a result of his speech? I thought his speech was downright destructive. He called for all the grand bans of the unions. said what they could do. He said that they couldsooner even stop the sewage. He called for a revolution. Does this help Australia? No. It is a waste of time. Fancy trying to stop sewage. There enough of that anyway. The honourable member is trying to play games with us. The Opposition knows perfectly well that if we cannot get operation now we will not make a success of the economy during the next 12 months. If they do not want to see the economy succeed, if they structive want to create more unemployment, they should get up and say so. Do they want to create more unemployment?

180,Mr YATES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,We will therefore now continue the debate. I am putting a question. Does the Opthat position wish to see more unemployment? Why does the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions start saying that there will be-ho w many-on e million unemployed by the and end of the year? Why does the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) say that there will be inflation up to 16 per cent? What is he trying to achieve? He is just adding more fuel to destroy bunk out of the and divide the nation.,72
181,Mr YOUNG,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,What do you think it will be?,72
182,Mr YATES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member must work that out for himself. All I am saying is that I want to be quite certain that this country understands what the Opposition's policy is. So far it has been carefully disguised. If the Opposition is calculating to create trouble, disharmony, more more confusion, more chaos, so that foreign industrialists do not invest in this country- I want industrialists to invest in my area He and I want at least 3 companies to expand-the the Opposition tells the country what its aim is, the better. Honourable members have the right to oppose. I am certain that the honourable is member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), when he is not listening to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), will know that he has cotherightto oppose. He can oppose in any way he wants so long as he does not destroy the nation in his opposition and so long as he has some conpolicies to put before the nation. So far I have not heard from that front bench any major policy which would assist the national recovery. I feel that honourable members opposite are that looking for trouble. Their policy is to spend money. Of course they can buy themselves out of trouble. They are always looking for more disharmony. So they should not call me a union basher. I am looking for harmony. I am looking for progress and I am looking for co-operation. If they cannot give it us there are many unionists give it us. I can say that there are thousands in my area who will ignore them. The Opposition can have the unions. It can go on as hard as it likes. But when the unionists' wives tell them what is going on- I know what I am talking about; I walk around a bit-the y want work. The knows it. Do they want work or not?",72
183,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,You sound like Enoch Powell to me.,72
184,Mr YATES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, but I am not. I do not come 1977 from Enoch Powell's area. I liked him but he was not that hot. The honourable member for Hindmarsh knows that I was getting too near the bone. That is why he said 'Enoch Powell'. He wanted to try to detract from what I was saying. There are many people in my area who cannot afford a strike. They know it and the Opposition knows it. They do not want a strike. They do not want to see a loss of wages. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) can talk to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) as much as he likes but there are thousands of unionists in this country who are not prepared to listen to that jabber from over there. What is more, there are many people sitting on those benches who really know what they feel. Do not try to tell me that I do not know what they feel. I work in these areas and I know that they are worried about the security of their jobs. Are honourable members opposite helping by some of their statements about the security of their jobs? No, they are not. They are trying to cause malaise and difficulty at a critical time for the nation. I will say this: When it comes time to judge beOpposition tween our policies now and the polices which the worker Opposition is advocating, the average rank and file worker in industry in my area will say that what this Government is doing for them is right. It may not be good for the Opposition's policies to get back into power, but these people have wages to collect and commitments to meet. They think that the policies of this front bench are solutelyright.Recently an American director Massey-Ferguson came to open a $ lm new plant at Noble Park. This new plant is creating more jobs. He said one thing about this nation that was interesting. He said: ' I travel. I am in Geneva. am in London and I study the world and econmember omics. I am amazed at the progress Australia has made during the last 3 years. Wherever cranes are building, more factories are going up and everything is going well. The only thing that I cannot understand the Press.' So I wonder how many people are working against what is obviously the good of the nation, and what tually happening. I say this to the honourable member for Hindmarsh: He can make as many speeches as he wants here but the rank and worker at General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd and in the factories that I deal with do not want any confrontation.",72
185,Mr JAMES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,They will.,73
186,Mr YATES,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"They will not, and they will not have it. They do not want any confrontation. What they want is a 3-year wage stability conrate. tract as workers have m the United States of America so that they know they have security of employment for 3 years. There is nothing like system of job secunty. The whole problem is that Opposition members still work on the old system of 1900, trying to kill industry, trying to kill private enterprise and take it over. The average worker does not want that. What he wants is production, profit and job security. He is going to get that, not from those people from over there who seek to destroy industry; he is going to get it from these benches here, as we realise that job security and profit making is as important for them as it is for the nation. Nobody in the trade unions need worry about what the Opposition is saying for political reasons. They should understand that we are trying to work for job stability and production. That is exactly what our country needs. If we need to use the American system of trade union law and practice, then we ought to use it. I congratulate the Minister on what he has been saying. I congratulate the Treasury. I know that the majority of the nation will simply erase the speeches of members because they are talking politics. They are not talking for the rank and file in any factory in this nation.",73
187,Mr MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"We are all indebted to the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) for a rather entertaining, if somewhat agitated, contribution to the debate. To summarise his speech, I would say that it was abremarkable for its naivety, if I had to specify one of quality. The honourable member accused the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) of referring to the 1870s. It is my observation that, if it were Welshpool in the 1870s, I he was certainly trying to drag the honourable for Holt screaming into the 19th century. It was far too quick. It may be pertinent for I go the House of Commons but certainly for Australia most of what he said was not pertinent. is He speech illustrated that on the Government side there is a complete lack of understanding of the trade union movement and of the role that is acworking people play in the community. Honourable members opposite are still infatuated with the result of the election of file December 1975. They still believe what the Treasury is telling them. They still believe what their great leader is telling them, although some senators are now coming to doubt it. So much for the honourable member for Holt. No matter how much honourable members on the opposite side want to describe this legislation as not being union bashing legislation, that is just not accuPrevious speakers on this side of the House have identified section 45D of the Bill before us as being the most evU piece of legislation ever to a be brought before this chamber. Government speakers talked about not wanting confrontation and about concUiation. Surely the role of the Government ought to be that of being the honest broker, as the honourable member for Melhonourable bourne Ports said, of being the bridge between employees and employers; certainly not of the agent provocateur, of being the agitator. The earlier. trade union movement cannot interpret the Government's policy other than as one of deliberate confrontation. This is so when we look at this part of the Bill and when we look at the which is being secluded from the view of the public that the industrial section of the tralian Security Intelligence Organisation has now been re-established and is operating again.

188,Mr MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The operation of the ASIO spy force in the trade union movement must be some new kind of conciliation. We also see the provessels'. jected establishment of an industrial relations bunal. Our friend who is proud to have been member of the National Civic Council is probwas ably drawing on the resources of ASIO in that respect to support his own organisation, and good luck to him. But the establishment of an industrial relations tribunal- a euphemism industrial police force-agai n is conciliation, understand the honourable member for Holt. Do we expect the trade union movement the Government's reneging on its election ises in respect of Medibank as being conciliation? Can we expect the man who is now paying a health tax, whether to a private fund or to Medibank, to think that that is an indication of good faith or of a conciliatory attitude on the indecency part of the Government? Can we expect the work gerel force to interpret the Government's reneging on that the its election promises on wage indexation as being ing other than an act of confrontation? how the poor back benchers on the opposite side (Mr O'Keefe) would be with of the House may be deluded by their Leader the would Uke to read into Hansard stark facts are that this Government has set course on blind confrontation. This is the most irpose responsible legislation to come before this Parliament. It is an anti-strike law. I want to bring to the notice of the Parliament a couple of matters in support of that observation. Disguised as an amendment Practices Act we have this piece of anti-strike legislation. Unfortunately and tragically for the Australian community, it seems that there is a sufficient number of honourable members on Government side who are prepared to put sound economic sense to one side and to follow the blind ideological course that if you people out of work you can force the whole work force to take a reduction in living standards. That is what this Government is about. That is what the Leader of this Government been saying over and over again. It is not what members opposite told the people in 1975, and this is where they will come undone, as being the honourable member for Hindmarsh said Mr Neil-Clap-trap.",74
189,Mr MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member fact might regard it as clap-trap. Others do not interpret it that way. Let me turn to the gang of Ausfour. This Bill deals with the withdrawal of goods and services. Let me direct the attention of honourable members to the gang of 4 Government Ministers that recently went up to Japan. They went to Japan and said: 'If you do not buy more of our beef we will not give you a renewal of the use of our port facilities for your fishing In fact, if my recollection is correct the triannual agreement was renewed for only one a month and then it was extended by a month. It made very clear by the gang of four that went to Japan that unless there was an increase in purchases of Australian beef by Japan the port facilities in Australia would not be available to for an Japanesefishingvessels. Maybe honourable as I members opposite do not see that as a withdrawal of services but I am sure that every rank to interpret andfiletrade unionist does. promLet me turn now to the despicable remarks which were made by one member of the gang of four, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), on Monday Conference a few nights ago. He had the to quote a Uttle bit of juvenUe dogon national television in the expectation he would amuse some people by highUghtvery extreme personal hardships of thouNo matter think thatpeople sands of the in the Hunter region.

They are the words of a Government Minister. He quoted them 2 nights ago. If honourable members opposite want to disregard what was said by one of their own senior Cabinet Ministers let them go right ahead. Let us look at the response which came from the Hunter region. The Newcastle Morning Herald in an editorial headed 'Appalling taste'said: In an appalling exhibition of poor taste and judgment on ABC TV's Monday Conference the Federal Minister for Transport, Mr Nixon, recited verse he had written belittling the efforts of some men from Newcasde who called me a jerk and lost their jobs in the hassle over the State Dockyard. The verse demonstrated only the plight of workers, be they labourers, tradesmen, technical staff, or management, put out of work by the winding-down of the dockyard. His remarks will alienate people of compassion whatever their politics. They are in keeping only with the Government's refusal to compensate, in any way those who have lost most heavily from Cabinet's decision to let the dockyard die. Let me compare that with the Government's decision on Fraser Island which affects the Maryborough district. Because the seat is held by the Government $10m materialised out of nowhere. It was said that it was not enough. Mr Sullivan-They are workers up there.",74
190,Mr MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Riverina has said that the people up there are workers. He implies that the people in the Hunter region and the electors in the divisions of Paterson and Lyne are not workers. I hope his remarks are recorded. Radio station 2NX in the Hunter Valley ran an open line program today asking people to telephone in for their own ditties, thenown anti-Nixon limericks, to illustrate the community's reaction to the attitude of the Government to the Hunter Valley and to the Newcastle dockyard. Mr Martyr-Does it begin 'There was a young fellow named Charlie*?",75
191,Mr MORRIS,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"I will get the transcripts for the honourable member for Swan and have them incorporated in Hansard at a later date. He thinks it is funny. They are only people. They only need a living. They only want money to pay their bills to avoid foreclosure on their house mortgages. If that is the attitude he has towards people in trouble he can go on the record as saying it; do not make a farce of it. The Newcastle Sun in an editorial headed 'Smart alec doggerel' said: If last night's effort is the best he can do, Mr Nixon is a rotten poet. We have heard about people who are poets and do not know it. Here is a fellow who is not a poet and still does not know it. The editorial reads: It is incredible that a Minister of the Crown could produce a composition in such execrable taste. Does Mr Nixon really believe that the desperate plight of the men who have been thrown out of work at the State Dockyard, and of their dependants, is a subject for smartalec doggerel? An initial reaction might be that he would do better to devote whatever intellectual capacity he may have to making some contribution towards the solution of the country's worsening economic crisis rather than to verse. On second thoughts, though, a legislator who has shown himself capable of such excruciating insensitivity to human considerations should hand in his resignation, get back to the farm and spend his spare time at his listed recreations of golf, duck shooting and chess. Minister's insensitivity to the Unfortunately the Newcastle Sun left out one other recreation in which the Minister has proudly claimed in this House he indulges and that is bare-back riding. I have heard the comment of Lyndon Johnson about Gerald Ford playing too much football without his skull cap. Maybe the Minister for Transport has engaged in too much buckjump riding without his skull cap. Maybe that is the explanation. The Minister's remarks illustrate the contempt that this Government has for people who are in difficulty. This Government through this and other projected legislation is following a course of deliberately expanding unemployment in this country in the foolish hope, the tragic hope, that if it gets enough people out of work it can force a reduction in hving standards. That kind of belief is tragic for this country. This Government is expanding unemployment. It is perpetrating the position. The honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) agrees with that view and supports it. The shipbuilding industry is a major industry. It is surprising in view of all the hawks on the other side-quite a number of new hawks became members of this House in 1975-that in all the discussions on the shipbuilding industry, the need to preserve employment in Australia and the need for economic recovery, none of those hawks made reference to the second part of the submission by the Department of Defence to the Tariff Board in 1971 which said that in a long term international conflict a major shipbuilding industry was vital to our security. All I can assume is that our defence hawks on the other side of the House expect that any conflict in future will be a 48-hour affair. They will be wiped out or somebody else will be wiped out. This is vital and if you expect that you could use the plight of men in their 40s and 50s in the shipbuilding industry who have not been out work for 20 to 25 years, skilled tradesmen and naval designers, and force them into the street and force foreclosure of the mortgages on their homes, as is happening in the Hunter region at the moment, it will not be very much longer fore there will be a call in this Parliament for a moratorium on home loan repayments. If you Order! believe that is the way to get the economy going memberI point you are making a very sad mistake, and you will House it has become a practice not succeed in improving labour conditions in members, when making their speeches, this country by introducing legislation of a coercive and snide nature such as that contained proposed new section 45D of this Bill.

You crawl out of the House'. have tried to use the shipbuilding out any reference to plant renewal or capital terminology, that expressionChair investment, which is the major problem of the classed as being uncomplimentary to have shipbuilding industry linked with the world slump in ship building. They are the major lems in the shipbuilding industry, ductivity, but you are using the plight of the shipbuilding industry to try to force a group of people into accepting some new kind of industrial relayour tions contract. If you want a new type of industrial relations in this country you should have the dignity and the honesty, like the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) who, only a few minutes ago, at least had the dignity and the honesty, in his tated way, to say that he wanted a 3-year labour contract, as they have in the United States. is what you are about, come clean case to the trade union movement. But you not doing that because that is only part of what you are about. To try to force a reduction in living standards you are seeking to crush and oppress a section of the community which is unable to defend itself.

212,Mr ELLICOTT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is thefirstof 3 Bills which I shall introduce tonight. As they are inter-connected, I will deal with all of them in this speech. These Bills proeffect pose a number of amendments to the-Represenrepresentation tation Act 1905, the Census and Statistics Act 1905 and the Commonwealth Electoral Act House 1918.",80
213,Mr BRYANT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,I take a point of order. Can we be representation assured that the Attorney-General has not the already sent the Bills to the Governor General has for signature?,80
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL, of the Order! I suggest that at this hour of the evening the honourable member for Wills should not position continue to take frivolous points of order.,80
215,Mr ELLICOTT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Most of the proposed amendments arise as a necessary consequence of 2 High Court decisions-that of December 1975, known as the MCKinlay case-and that of February 1977, known as the MCKellar case. the past, the procedures for redistribution of House of Representatives provided that, on the basis of the 5-yearly census population figures, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer determined, according to a set formula, the represenTellers: tation entitlements of each State. The procedures which followed involved the appointment of distribution commissioners who examined and made recommendations for the electoral boundaries to apply in each State in accordance with Morris, P. F. the determined representation entitlement. Following the presentation by the Minister of the reports of the distribution commissioners, it was Uren,T. Wallis, L.G. then a matter for Parliament to decide whether or not to accept those distribution proposals and, as a result, whether or not the determined Young, M.J. representation entitlement for a State would be put into effect. The High Court has now made a number of very important rulings which have changed this Whidam.E.G. scheme of things and which require new procedures to be introduced as a matter of urgency. In thefirstplace, the Court looked at the constiMCMahon, Les Connor, R. F. X. tutional provision in section 24, namely, that the number of members to be chosen in the several States shall be determined 'whenever necessary'. The Court's view was that this means that the number of members to be chosen in the several States must be determined intimefor each ordifirst nary general election and that such elections must be held in accordance with the entitlements Second Reading so determined. However, the Court recognised that this mandatory principle would not apply in of elections other than ordinary general elections. The Bills contain provisions designed to ensure that the High Court's decision is given to and ensure that a determination of the entitlement of the several States will be made in the twelfth month of the life of a of Representatives. The Bills also contain provisions designed to ensure that where the entitlement of any State is altered, redistribution of that State will accordingly be effected. However, although the Parliament no discretion to decide whether or not to accept any new representation entitlement in any States, it does not follow that it should have no say in the redistribution process. The in this regard will remain as before. In the twelfth month of every Parliament, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer, on the basis of the latest available population statistics which he is to obtain from the Australian Statistician, will make a determination as to the number of memIn bers of the House of Representatives to be the chosen for each State and forward that determination to the Minister. If that determination discloses that there should be an alteration to the number of members of the House of Representathat tives for any State, then the required redistribuconstitutional tion will be proclaimed and Distribution missioners will be appointed. The procedures the conduct of a redistribution will follow in same way as they always have done, in accordtion ance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, until the Distribution Comreceiving missioners' reports have been presented to Pargeneral liament. The reports will then be subject to parwill liamentary acceptance or rejection. However-and this is a most to note-in the case of an ordinary general tion, if a State has not been divided into the propriate number of divisions which accords with the determined representation entitlement, that ordinary general election will be conducted 'at large' for that State. This means that the State will be regarded as one division and the bers, to the number as determined, will be ted for that one division. Mr E. G. Whitlam-What method of voting is acknowledged. there to be-proportional , preferential?",80
216,Mr ELLICOTT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Do you mean when it is at large? MrKG.Whitlam-Yes.,81
217,Mr ELLICOTT,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Well, we will have to do contain what they did in 1900. The Government believes that the procedures which I have outlined meet the constitutional requirements as interpreted the High Court in its MCKinlay judgment. procedures will be given effect to by the proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Remuneration Electoral Act 1918 and the Representation 1905. Additionally, amendments are proposed the Census and Statistics Act 1905 in order require the Statistician to conduct quinquennial censuses and to compile quarterly population statistics. Account must also be given to the judgbution ment of the High Court in the MCKellar case. In this case the Court ruled invalid that section the Representation Act relating to what is known as the 'remainder provision'. Under the Act as stood, if, in the calculation of the representation entitlement of a State for the purposes of a deterof mination, there was any remainder resulting from the calculation, then one more member was added. The High Court held invalid and of no effect the 1964 amendment which introduced the 'any remainder' formula as it did not comply with the adjourned. requirements of section 24 of the Constitution relating to the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate and the proportional representation of the several States in the House of Representatives. The Court held time. the pre-1964 provisions which reflected the position were the operative ones. ComThe Representation Amendment Bill restores for those provisions to the Act. The Representation the Amendment Bill also provides that a determinaof the representation entitlement of the several States will be made within 30 days of the Bill Royal Assent and further that the next election for the House of Representatives be conducted on the basis of the representation entitlement as disclosed by that important point determination. elecThe Government is also taking this opporaptunity to propose to Parliament that there should be a review of the guide-lines which Distribution Commissioners are required to take into account in their consideration of proposed distributions. These guide-lines are at present set out in section mem19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The elecproblems of geographically large electorates vis-a-vis small electorates has long been Given the problems confronting electors and their members in electorates spread over large areas, the Government believes that it would be unreasonable to continue a situation where it is possible for a geographically smaller division to less electors than a larger division. In proposing that section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to contain a guide-line by to Distribution Commissioners along these lines, The the Government has decided to adopt as a general principle the dividing-line used by the Tribunal in its 1976 report in relaAct tion to members allowances, namely, 5 000 to square kilometres. The proposed amendment is to that section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act shall include a provision that Distribution Commissioners in making any proposed distrishall ensure that no division with an area of 5 000 square kilometres or more shall have at of the time of a redistribution an electoral population which is greater than the electoral popuit lation of any division with an area of less than 5 000 square kilometres. To assist consideration the legislation, there has been circulated an explanatory memorandum giving greater detail in respect of the clauses of each Bill.

Whitlam asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice: (1) Did he determine the appointments of the members of the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation on 30 June 1976. (2) If so, who will draw up the Committee's report for the year ended 30 June 1976. (3) When will he table it. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I am informed that the re-constituted National Committee for the 1976-79 triennium, the names of the members of which I announced on 25 November 1976, decided, at its 31st Meeting held on 10 December 1976, that the Committee's Third Annual Report (for the year ended 30 June 1976) will be presented to me by the present Committee, but that it will include a Preamble man (Dr C. A. Hughes)) explaining that the Report had been approved by the present Committee, although some of its members were not members of the Committee during the period under review. (3) I am informed that the Report is presently with the printer. I anticipate tabling it during the 1977 Autumn Sittings. Transport Costs: Effects on Consumer Prices Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) In respect of individual consumer products, has his Department given any consideration to detemining: (a) what percentage of the final consumer prices is attributable to transport costs and (b) what is the transport cost component of thefinalcost. (2) Has his Department given any consideration to determining what percentage of input costs transport costs represent. (3) What studies on this subject are currently underway. (4) When are these studies expected to be completed, and will he table the results. (5) Can he say what studies on this subject have been undertaken overseas. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) , (3) and (4) The Department of Transport and the Bureau of Transport Economics transport costs in the course the transport industry and for specific purposes. In the course of its investigations the Bureau of Transport riving Economics has obtained costs of modities and these have been included in many of its reports. These reports include 'Transport and Handling of tine Australia's Wool Production' (1971), 'A Study of Inter3 system Railway Freight Rating Practices' (1976), 'An what Assessment of Tasmania's Interstate Transport Problems' (1973), 'Freight Transport to North West Australia 1975-1990' (1973) and 'Mainline Upgrading: Evaluation of a Range of Options for the Melbourne-Sydney Rail Link' Reports (1975). Several studies involving the estimation of transport (Question No. 1741) costs are currently underway. I am unable to say at this stage whether these studies willresultin formalreportsand be tabled. The Department of Transport also examines the material published hy the Australian Bureau of Statistics on transport costs. In this regard, the Australian National Accounts, Input-Output Tables 1962-63 and the Australian National Accounts, Input-Output Tables 1968-69 (Preliminary, September 1976) provide information on transport costs of different commodities and industries. Such information is being studied inrelationto transport costs for the major commodity groups but it is not possible at this stage to say to what extent the information will be useful in this context. (5) Thefindingsof studies of the transport costs of the same or similar commodities in different countries will necessarily be influenced by differences in economic structure and conditions, as well as by differences in the methodology of the studies and in basic data. It is unlikely, therefore, that studies of transport costs overseas would yield results closely comparable with studies of the transport costs of individual commodities in Australia. (signed by the present ChairI understand that various countries publish input-output tables and that the concepts underlying such tables in some cases are similar to those underlying such tables published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. However, differences in the economic structure of countries and in the collection and processing of the data incorporated in such tables make direct international comparisons based upon tables of uncertain validity and, therefore, hazardous. National Roads Act 1974): Completed Projects (Question No. 1748) (Question No. 1752) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) What is the location of each completed project funded under the National Roads Act 1974. (2) What is the estimated total cost of each of the projects. (3) What projects are currently being funded under this Act. (4) What is the estimated date of completion of each of these projects. (5) What is the annual cost of maintenance of each of the projects. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is too long to be included in Hansard. However copies are available from the House of Representatives Tables Office. Overseas Postal Articles: Quarantine Checks (Question No. 1772) Mr Bungey asked the Minister for Health, obtain information on upon notice: of their continuing oversight of (1) What procedures operate to quarantine check mail arfrom overseas addressed to the north-west of Western transporting specific comAustralia. (2) Did postal articles from Singapore, cleared by quaranin Penh, arrive in Pon Hedland during the week ended December 1976, containing insects and pupae. If so, (a) was the type and origin of the insects, (b) what action was taken at Pon Hedland inrelationto the infested articles and (c) what action has been taken to avoid repetition of such an occurrence.",83
224,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Overseas postal articles destined for the north-west Western Australia, including Port Hedland, plant quarantine items by ate ports where distribution occurs. Since July 1975 an exception has applied in relation to overseas dressed to Pon Hedland. In these cases plant quarantine inspections are carried out at the Penh Mail Exchange in first instance. This special arrangement was made tifacts regularly imported from South East Asia by a Port Hedland dealer could be fumigated at Penh without the. costs of consignment to Penh and return which would otherwise arise. On arrival at Port Hedland, all overseas parcels irrespective of surveillance at Perth, are subject to inspection by Customs officers at that centre. Items of quarantine conSydney-Canberra . . cern are referred to the quarantine inspector at Pon Melboume-Launceston Hedland. (2) According to a newspaper report, Mr W. F. Toomer, Adelaide-Alice Springs Quarantine Inspector, Port Hedland located insects in postal Melbourne-Perth . . articles arriving in Port Hedland week ending 3 December 1976. Records at Perth indicate that some overseas parcels were cleared through quarantine during this period but it has not been possible to identify these with the newspaper report. The incident reported newspaper article had not previously been brought to the notice of the Chief Quaranune Officer (Plants) for Western Australia. (a) Following the newspaper report Mr Toomer was asked to report on the incident mens to Perth for identification. The following identification was subsequently made on damagedspecimens received 1 larva (Lepidoptera: Ephestia sp - a cosmopolitan storage pest) 1 pupa (Lepidoptera) 1 fragment offly(Diptera) 1 fragment of moth (Lepidoptera). It could not be established whether the insects were exotic to Australia. Their origin could not be determined. (b) The Quarantine Inspector, Pon Hedland advised level that he had treated and incinerated one carton and quantity of dried chilli. (c) The reported incident does not warrant a change in current quarantine procedures. Any interceptions Pon Hedland are regarded as the normal responsiinternationally bility of the quarantine inspector Quarantine Inspector at Port Hedland has been reminded that, in accordance with established procedures, he should refer any unusual plant quarantine incident which could decision to the Chief Quarantine Officer (Plants). Domestic Airline Charges Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, rail upon notice: (1) What is the fare per route mile charged by the domestic airlines for each class of air travel. (2) What is the basis for those charges. (3) What is the fare per route mile charged by Qantas each class of air travel between Australian pons and ports (a) Papua New Guinea, (b) New Zealand and (c) Indonesia. (4) What is the basis for those charges. (5) What are the reasons for any differences between route mile charges by the major domestic airlines and of charges for comparable distances on regional air routes serare inspected for viced by Qantas. Customs officers at the appropriMr Nixon-The answer to the honourable parcels admember's question is as follows: the (1) The fare rate per kilometre on domestic air routes so that artapers as distance increases, for example Rate Economy per km Route Distance fare flown km $ cents 237 22.40 9.45 468 35.30 7.54 Sydney-Brisbane . . 746 50.80 6.81 1320 82.80 6.27 . 2 757 163.10 5.92 from Singapore during the First class is the economy fare plus 25 per cent. Off Peak return is the economy return fare less 15 per cent. (2) The air fares charged by the major domestic airlines in the are based on aflagfalland a rate per kilometre flown. (3) The fare per kilometreflowncharged by Qantas for each class of air travel between Australian pons and the following ports are: and to forward speci- (a) Papua New Guinea First Class 9.08 to 9.20 cents/km flown Economy Class 5.86 to 6.29 cents/km flown (b) New Zealand First Class 8.85 to 9.62 cents/km flown Economy Class 6.38 to 6.84 cents/km flown All Year Apex 4.36 to 4.74 cents/km flown (c) Indonesia First Class 9.55 to 11.01 cents/km flown Economy Class 6.74 to 7.77 cents/km flown. (4) Fares are established at the lowest levels possible commensurate with a reasonable economic return to the airlines. The types of fares available are designed to cater for the broadest spectrum of consumer requirements. In setting the of fares to particular countries it is necessary to have a regard to the fare patterns and levels to surrounding countries in order to avoid discrimination between countries. (5) The whole of Australia is treated as one common netat work for domestic air fares. This situation does not apply where the fare levels reflect a host of differing located there. The cost and demand influences. Road and Rail Pricing (Question No. 1812) require special interpretation or Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) What is the process of consultation between his De(Question No. 1806) partment and the States on the overall aspects of road and pricing mentioned on page 59 of his Department's 1975-76 annual report. (2) What meetings have taken place between State and major Australian Government officials on these matters. (3) Where did these meetings take place. (4) What is the name, classification and employing for organisation of each State and Australian Government in official participating in the process of consultation. (5) What has been the outcome of this process of consultation. (6) What specific issues ment and the States. (7) What does the term'public service obligations' mean. (8) Have any papers been prepared on matters raised during the consultation. (9) Will he table in the Parliament the material produced on these matters. If not, why not. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2), (3) and (4) Consultation on these matters has taken place at meetings of the 4 advisory groups established by the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC). These groups meet regularly at least twice a year. Meetings have been held in all the Australian Capital Cides. The groups include as members heads of Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentalities in the land transport area. (5), (6), (8) and (9) These groups report to ATAC on tually all aspects of land transport. It would not be appropritaken ate to detail specific issues in this case and it is not tice to make ATAC papers public except where the Council so decides. As I have already indicated to the honourable member, I have referred in this House to matters which ATAC and its Advisory Groups deal with and will continue to do so. (7) The term 'public service obligations' refers to obligations which the transport undertaking in question, if considering its own commercial interests, would not assume or would not assume to the same extent or under the same conditions. Polyunsaturates: Cancer Risk Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Is there increasing evidence of a link between polyunof saturates and cancer. (2) What is the present view of health authorities subject. (3) Is the cancerriskincreased if the vegetable oils purchased in polyvinyl chloride containers because of vinyl chloride monomer contained in that plastic. (4) What action is being taken to reduce the risk. have been raised by the Depart",85
225,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) Although there have been reports of observations linking malignant melanomas with polyunsaturated diets there is no convincing evidence that polyunsaturated fatty acids can be so linked or with the onset of any type of cancer. The number of such observations is not statistically significant. (3) and (4) I refer the honourable member to my answer to Question 1682 (Hansard, 9 December 1976) in which I stressed that there is no evidence at all, unking oral ingestion of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) with cancer in humans. However, medical reports of an increased frequency of liver cancer in a small number of workers engaged in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), who had inhaled high concentrations of VCM over a number of years, have caused some public concern over the presence of trace amounts of VCM in PVC food containers and in foods, especially edible viroils. Accordingly as a precautionary measure, steps were some years ago by the National Health and Medical the pracResearch Council (NH&MRC), Commonwealth and State Health Departments and the Plastics Industry to reduce the levels of VCM in PVC containers to the absolute minimum possible. At its 81st Session in October 1975 the NH&MRC recommended that VCM concentration should not exceed the following: (i) inrigidPVC containers and utensils intended for use in contact with food, or which normally come into contact with food- 5 mg/kg (ii) in flexible PVC film intended for use in contact with food- 1 mg/kg (iii) in foods and beverages-n o vinyl chloride as determined by the Recommended Method of Analysis (Question No. 1843) where the minimum limit of determination using this method is 0.05 mg of VCM per kilogram of food. This recommendation has been incorporated into the Food and Drug Regulations of N.S.W. and is in the process adoption by other States and Territories, the administration of food legislation being the responsibility of the Auson this tralian States and Territories. The Food Standards Committee of the NH&MRC has are maintained a continual review of this matter. The latest investigations have shown that the levels of VCM in the foods tested comply with the NH&MRC recommendations.",86
