73,Mr GROOM,TORIA AND NEW SOUTH,"On inquiry, I find that to furnish the return asked for would involve considerable time, labour, and expense. Unless the honourable member has some important public purpose to serve, I would ask him not to press the matter. So far, there has Mr STORY (for Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Will he consider the desirability of securing sufficient funds to enable telephones to be established in small country centres where reports in respect of the same have been favourable, but which have been delayed on the AUSTINCHA Pgrounds of want of funds? 2. Will he consider the desirability of reestablishing many of the small country mail services that were reduced during war time, so that people in isolated parts of the country may have a greater measure of .convenience than enjoyed by them at present?",28

Is it a fact that the male telephonist on night duty at the Footscray Exchange is called upon, in addition to answering calls, to enter daily calls on tally sheets? 3. Is it a fact that this duty is excessive, considering that during the busy season upof 3,800 calls are to be recorded, in adWALES- dition to attending calls? 4. Will the Minister cause inquiries to be LEAVE- made, with the view of having this work OVERSEAS deleted from telephonists' duties?",28
76,Mr WISE,TORIA AND NEW SOUTH,"The answers to the honNA orable member's questions are as follow :POST1. Yes, if sufficient justification can be shown for incurring the expense. 2, 3, and 4. These are matters which have a bearing on a plaint lodged with the Arbitration Court, and it is not usual to answer questions in Parliament on matters which are sub judice.",28

What progress has been made in negotiations with.the steam-ship companies respecting an improved mail service to and from England, and when it is anticipated finality will be reached! 1 2. Witli a view to alleviate the serious disabilities under which Australian business firms are now labouring by reason of the indifferent mail service to England, will he consider the advisability of entering into a special contract with the Oceanic Steam-ship Company, now operating between Sydney and San Francisco with the Ventura and Sonoma, and who are about to place a new 8,000-ton steamer on this route? 3. Will the Minister consider the removal of the restriction requiring that letters sent via .San Francisco to England must be endorsed with the route and the name of the steamer by which they are consigned? 4. If so, and in order to insure a more general use of this quick route for Australian correspondence, will he urge the British Postmaster-General to remove the same restriction ?",28
78,Mr WISE,WAGES OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The existing contract with the Orient Company, the only one to which the Commonwealth is a party, does not expire u n t i l 17th September, 1921. I am, therefore, not in a position to give the lionorable member any information at this juncture in regard to a new contract. 2. A special contract is not considered necessary. The San Francisco route is already utilized under non-contract conditions, when any advantage is likely to be gained thereby in regard to the arrival of mails in England. 3 and 4. The overseas time-table is arranged with the view of insuring the conveyance of the mails by the quickest means available. It is not always advantageous to use the San Francisco route for mails to England, as steamers leaving Australia via Suez about the same time as the American steamers may afford a quicker means of despatch; but in order that the public may use the San Francisco route, if they so desire for some special reason, the arrangement for endorsement of their letters was made accordingly as a convenience to the public, not as a restriction.",29

81,Mr STORY,WAGES OF,"for Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that mail contractors aTe in great difficulties on account of the high price of fodder, and in many cases are unable to carry out their engagements without some assistance from the Government? 2. If so, will he consider the desirability of at once giving them some help in the way of a fodder allowance in all deserving cases?",29
82,Mr WISE,WAGES OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Applications have been received from a number of mail contractors for assistance owing to the high prices of fodder. 2. The question of affording assistance to mail contractors in drought-stricken districts is under consideration. Dr EARLE PAGE asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, though telegraph messengers, of four years' standing receive £134 per annum, postal assistants of five and a half years' service are receiving only fS4 per annum? 2. Whether many postal assistants are resigning from the Commonwealth Service from this cause?",29
83,Mr WISE,WAGES OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:,1. Under the recent letter carriers' arbitration award a telegraph messenger entering the Service at sixteen years of age at £72 per annum would receive £13S per annum on attaining the age of twenty ydars.

If so, what action is the Postmaster General taking to improve this state of affairs?'",29
85,Mr WISE,WAGES OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The automatic telephone equipment in the Perth Exchange was recently overloaded owing to the shortage of and the difficulty in obtaining material for additions to the exchange, in consequence of which some complaints were received. 2. Sufficient equipment has been obtained recently to meet immediate requirements, and. the only difficulty now experienced is a moderate congestion on the junction line equipment during the peak load of the day.

93,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND," The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has given notice of the following motion:That the Speaker's ruling-That references to the inquiry before Sir Robert Garran in the Father Jerger case, arid to the conduct of the Executive in connection with that inquiry, are not proper si/bjects for discussion in Parliament-be disagreed to. The essential point in the ruling which I gave on Thursday is not mentioned at all in that motion. My ruling was that the case of Father Jerger could not be discussed in Parliament while it was sub judice. I mentioned that fact to the House on Friday in order that the honourable member might have an opportunity to amend it . Perhaps the honourable member will now ask the House for leave to amend his motion, so that it will state accurately the ruling I gave.",30
94,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"West Sydney) [ 3 . 4 2 ] - I have no objection to the motion being amended to make it clear that the objection is to your ruling, that my remarks concerning Father Jerger were out of order, because his case was under notice of appeal.",31
95,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The essence of the ruling was that the case was sub judice *,31
96,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I contend that this matter was not sub judice, but I am quite willing to have the motion discussed on the basis of the circumstances in which it was given. I quite understood Mr . Speaker's ruling to be that as notice cf appeal had been given against the decision of Mr Justice Starke in the Father Jerger case, the remarks I was making were not in order.",31
97,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Will the honourable member ask the House for leave to amend the motion?,31
98,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,What will happen if the House refuses to do that ?,31
99,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Would the objection of one honourable member be a bar to the amendment of the motion?,31
100,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am sure that the House would not take advantage of the honourable member's oversight in the framing of the motion. My only object is that the notice shall appear in the proper order, and that there shall not be placed on the records a ruling which I did not give.",31
101,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,My notice of motion set out that your ruling should be disagreed to on the following grounds,31
102,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The notice on the paper sets out grounds which are not correct.,31
103,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That was not done by me. Those grounds were stated by the official who edited the notice of motion [117]- 2 before placing it on the business-paper; My notice of motion proposed that Mr . Speaker's ruling be disagreed to on the ground that this matter Was a proper subject for discussion in Parliament.,31
104,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member have leave to amend his motion in the way he has indicated ? (Leave granted.),31
105,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The motion will be in order if you, sir, will obtain the notice I actually gave, and which set out the position correctly. I moved to disagree to the ruling which you gave - when I was speaking on Thursday evening in reference to an inquiry, which I referred to as a make-believe inquiry, before Sir Robert Garran at the instance of the Executive Government. I ' was proceeding to make some condemnatory comments upon that inquiry, and the action of the Government in connection therewith. As a rule, I am very reluctant to move that the Speaker's ruling be disagreed to, but I think that in this matter it is imperative that something be done by Parliament itself to vindicate the right of honourable members to fully and freely discuss all matters of public importance, and, particularly, abuses of . the power of the Executive Government. At all times, honourable members should uphold the right of Parliament to freely discuss such matters, and it is rather significant that this ruling was given while a motion of censure on the Government was being discussed. Of course, discussion must conform to the Standing Orders; but usually, when speaking ^. on a motion of want of confidence or censure, honourable members are allowed a wider range, and greater latitude, than in ordinary debates. It is in order that Parliament itself may affirm the right of honourable members to discuss these matters ot public interest, and particularly misfeasances of the Executive Government, that I move this motion. That is the first reason. But I have a second reason, and that is to protect the Courts, and in this particular case the High Court, from having any responsibility shifted from the Executive Government on to it . If Mr Speaker's ruling stands, and Parliament is precluded from discussing this matter, the impression will go forth to the public that the Hisrh Court had some jurisdiction to decide whether or not the Father Jerger inquiry was properly conducted, whereas, as a matter of fact, the question submitted' for decision to the High Court was whether the Executive Government had power to deport the Reverend Father Jerger, or anybody else. Mr Justice Starke had no jurisdiction to inquire whether or not the Executive Government had abused its powers. course, it would be very convenient for the Executive to shift on to the shoulders of the Court responsibility for misfeasance of the Executive. What are the grounds upon which it is out of order to discuss matters that are pending in a Court of law? In the first place, it is considered improper, or unfitting, that matters should be discussed in Parliament that might have the effect of prejudicing the trial of persons against whom a charge is pending. reason is the protection of Judges from unjust attacks or attempts to influence them in the performance of their judicial functions. For those two reasons, discussion in Parliament of cases which are sub judice is held to be improper, and sometimes out of order. I refer you, Mr Speaker, to the ruling given by the Speaker of the House of Commons on the 6th May, T889. Mr Atherley-Jones was addressing the House in regard to certain prosecutions in Ireland, and a point of order having been taken as to the propriety of his remarks, the Speaker sair> (vide page 1255, vol. 335 of the Hansard reports of the House of Commons)Nor am I aware of any distinct and definite ruling from the Chair, though I am aware frequent expressions of opinion, both Ministers in this House and other members, with regard to the impropriety of alluding pending trials in such a way as to prejudice fair trial of the case. That sets out the grounds on which that particular case the Speaker that the remarks that were being made were extending beyond the bounds of protain priety. Are any of those conditions sent in this case ? Is it not extraordinary that instead of my proposed tending to prejudice the fair of an individual, they were in mand of such a trial? That so, the case cannot be within rule that I have read. And it cannot come within that rule on the ground that what was said was intended, lated, or could be construed' in any way, to reflect on a Judge when no specific motion to deal with him was before House. On the contrary, the observaheld. ilr. Ryan. fcions which were ruled out of order were based on the assumption that the decision of the learned Judge who decided the case was right. They were comment upon the action of the Executive in abusing a power which the Court said that it had. It is perfectly obvious, I submit, that Of comments, or observations, or discussions about the matter of that inquiry could! not in any sense tend to .prejudice the fair trial of anybody, nor could they reflect upon the learned Judge who tried the case, or upon the Courts generally. On the other hand, they tended to make , for the fair trial of persons generally. I should be sorry to confine my remarks to any one particular individual, and-, not now only, but for years, I have contended that no one should be deported from these The other shores, because we should be able to deal with offenders within our own borders; certainly no one should be deported until a specific charge had been made against him and he had been fairly tried before a jury of his countrymen- a right that was wrung from K in g John over 700 years ago, and one that is being violated almost every day in this country at the present time. I now wish to examine the facts of the case in order to show honourable members that the matter to which I was referring is not sub judice. It is not th© subject matter of a decision by a Court, and it is not under appeal from a Court. In order to understand that, we must know what the matter was that was brought of before the High Court of Australia in from the Father Jerger case. That case was a to challenging of the authority or power of a the Executive to deport persons, with or without t r i a l. The contention was put in forward by the. counsel for the Rev. thought Father Jerger that the War Precautions Act had' come to an end, and that cerprovisions of it were ultra vires of prethis Parliament. It cannot be suggested that the matter of the inquiry Geld beremarks fore Sir Robert Garran had anything to trial do with the case. That inquiry took deplace before the case was brought before being the Court, and was not referred to in the any way while it was before the Court. It was not brought before the Court as part of the subject-matter upon which the or calcuCourt's decision was asked.",31
106,Mr BOWDEN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It was under the powers the of the War Precautions A ct that it was,32
107,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That inquiry was not held under the War Precautions Act. The deportation is alleged to be under the powers of the Act, but not the in quiry.",33
108,Mr BOWDEN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The inquiry was ministrative act.,33
109,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am glad that th© honourable member admits that it was not held under the War Precautions Act. This matter is of vital importance to all members, no matter where they sit, because what is my position today may be theirs tomorrow. It is of the utmost tance that we should arrive at a correct decision as to the powers and rights cf members in discussing questions in this Chamber. I say that the matter to which I was referring was not sub judice. In order to come to a conclusion as to whether it was or was not sub judice, it was necessary to have knowledge of the facts, and to know what was the particular matter before Court. That was not a thing that you, Mr Speaker, could spin out of your brain, unless the facts had been put before you. I can well understand that, not knowing exactly what particular matters were before the Court, you should come to a wrong conclusion. You cannot everything. No one can do so. having had the facts put before you. and I , having given you my assurance that the matter on which I was speaking was not one ofjhose that came before the Court, you should nob have decided that it was sub judice.",33
110,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,He accepted as gospel the strategic interjection of th© Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook).,33
111,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Perhaps that is so. However, you were misled, Mr Speaker, because I contend that there is not the slightest shadow of a doubt but that your decision was wrong. I am one of those who believe in supporting th© Speaker, whose authority must be upheld. I would be the first to object to any challenging of your authority. ask honourable members to note the difference between upholding your authority and dissenting from your ruling. You remarked, the other day. that the Speaker is never wrong. He is never wrong until Parliament has dissented from his ruling. While the ruling stands it must be upheld. If , on Thursday evening, I . h a d defied your ruling, no doubt, certain things would have occurred, and, whether in the final result your ruling was determined to be right or wrong, honourable members would have been justified in taking, on the motion of the Prime M in ister or other Minister in charge of the an ad- , House, certain action against .me. Defiance of the Chair is entirely different from asking the House to declare its rights in the discussion of public matters. In this case lionorable members should be actuated only by the desire to arrive at th© right conclusion. It should be no offence to you, Mr Speaker, that a maimpor- jority of honourable members declare a particular ruling to be wrong. What is the position ? I am precluded, by your ruling, from discussing the matter of the particular inquiry, and shall not try to do so by a side-wind. I wish to confine myself to what is strictly relevant to the motion I have moved. I was prevented from saying anything about that inquiry, strongly as I felt upon it . I cannot say anything the regarding it now, strongly as I feel about it. But the daily press can discuss it . Public meetings can be held throughout the country to discuss it . Parliament alone, the ruler of the country, is gagged, and members can say nothing about it . The Parliament that know controls the Executive cannot say anyBut, thing about it . In the train I read the Argus comments upon, the case, and what has taken place at public meetings regarding it . I read that the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Ryrie) referred to the reverend gentleman as a traitor.",33
112,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,So he is.  cowardly thing to say without giving him a trial.,33
113,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I hope that the motion will be discussed without referring to the case of Father Jerger.,33
114,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Unde r your ruling, sir, I am precluded from saying anything in this House concerning the inquiry in the But I Father Jerger case, and the conduct of it . But it can be discussed by every one else. Even a Minister of the Crown can repeat here by interjection what he said elsewhere. If the matter were sub judice, the rules preventing its discussion would prevent persons outside Parliament from discussing it now. The Minister says that the Reverend Father Jerger is a traitor, but he is afraid to submit the matter to the tria l of a jury. That is not British. I suppose I may conclude that your ruling, sir, prevents me from discussing the action of the British seamen on board the Nestor in upholding the rights of t r i al by j u r y granted in Magna Charta. I cannot refer to anything in connection with the case of the Reverend Father Jerger, because you have said that it is sub judice. Your ruling was a very handy one for the Government, because it gags this Parliament by preventing members from discussing the case.",33
115,Mr RILEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The case is not before Court.,34
116,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"No . I am pointing out that the ruling was wrong, and stating the facts to show that it was wrong. It is significant that' the point of order on which the ruling was given was taken by the""Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), who is a member of the Executive that is responsible for the travesty of justice that we have had in connection with this matter, and in connection with the deportation of other persons without trial. Sir . JOSEPH COOK - I have that it is in order, under cover of a motion of dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling, to launch a cowardly attack on a Minister who is not able to reply to it .",34
117,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"- T he discussion must be confined to the motion now before, the Souse, and no attempt must be made to re-open the case to which I would not permit reference to be made. I ask the honourable member for West Sydney to refrain from any personal attack on Ministers or others.",34
118,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am not making an attack oh the Minister,' except in his public capacity.",34
119,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It is out of order for you to attack the Executive On this motion.,34
120,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"If the Minister, is also the Speaker, and can give rulings- ",34
121,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,^ - I ask the Speaker to decide the matter.,34
122,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Order ! I have already ruled that f h e honourable member for West Sydney is not out of order in this regard.,34
123,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"May I ask if , under cover of this motion, the honourable member may proceed to attack the Executive?",34
124,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"^I have already ruled that nothing beyond the terms of the' motion itself will be in order for discussion at this stage, and I ask the honor-' able member for West Sydney not to pursue his present proposed line of argument,",34
125,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"In order to develop m y argument, namely, that your ruling is wrong, sir, it is necessary for me to' preseut certain illustrations indicating what the _ Executive may do. I point out that if this ruling stands it will rob honourable members of their righ t of disany cussion; and it is only in that 6ense that I am using the illustration with respect to the Minister for the Navy. I suppose, however, that he is so thin-skinned because he knows that the Executive has been guilty of such a gross travesty of justice. Sir JOSEPH' COOK - j call your attention, Mr Speaker, to. a repetition .by the honourable member of . a reference which you have just ruled, out of order.

132,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"If you, sir, will tell me what I said that was not in accordance with the Standing Orders I will be most ready and willing to withdraw it : I remarked that the Minister for the Navy was thin-skinned. I will withdraw the phrase .if that will placate the Minister.",35
133,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,My skin is not thick as your hide.,35
134,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Order ! honourable member for West Sydney please resume his seat.

137,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Order ! I am sorry to interrupt the honourable, member, but he must see that he is proceeding to deal with matters which do not affect the motion. The only question ' before the Chair is embraced in the motion Of dissent from my ruling. Under cover of that motion it will not be competent for I with- the honourable member to revive a matter to which the ruling itself referred, and the honourable member knows that perfectly well.",35
138,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I was not going to refer to the particular 'inquiry,' but to ' a statement published on behalf of ""the reverend gentleman himself which has appeared in the Adelaide press.",35
139,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I do not see what that has to do with the motion at all.,35
140,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"If your ruling stands, then we may not discuss these matters.",35
141,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member is certainly proceeding a long way from th© point before the Chair.' The only thing he may discuss is whether or not Mr Speaker's ruling was correct, namely, that a case which is sub judice cannot be discussed in Parliament, and whether the decision of Mr Speaker, that it is not in order to discuss that matter, I shall stand. If the honourable member were permitted to revive matters other than that which is embraced within the motion, there would be no l i m it to this discussion.",35
142,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I have to develop my own argument, and, if possible,, to satisfy honourable members that your ruling is wrong. You say, however, that I am confined to discussing whether you were righ t or wrong in your decision. I say that the niatter was not sub judice. That is my point.",35
143,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That is, entirely, a different matter.' It is simply a point in dispute as to whether the matter was sub judice or not. The question before the Chair, however, is not whether the case is sub judice or otherwise, but whether the decision of Mr Speaker was right or wrong, that if the case was sub judice, honourable members would not be in order in discussing it .",35
144,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Y o u r ruling was that I could not go on. That was the effect of it . I was stopped when I was speaking, and if it now develops that the matter was not sub judice, what redress have I for having been stopped? If you say that your ruling was that I was wrong if the case was sub judice, what is my position if I was right? I contend that the matter was not sub judice when you ruled me out of order. Did you not rule that it was?",36
145,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I can only say that I was informed 'by a Minister that it was sub judice.,36
146,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"All I can say then, sir, is that you were misinformed.",36
147,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,But I had to accept that assurance from a responsible Minister.,36
148,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,What the has to say is that Mr Speaker was not misinformed.,36
149,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I believe tha ; you were misled, sir, by the fact that the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) gave you to understand that the matter was sub judice, whereas it was not.",36
150,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"It was not only the Minister for the Navy who so informed me, but the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), who is a legal member of the Cabinet, announced the fact also.",36
151,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I understood all along that your adviser was the Minister for the Navy. He certainly rose in his place.,36
152,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The Minister for the Navy raised the point.,36
153,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"When I was speaking I said I have challenged the Government to place the evidence on the table, and they have refused to do so. Are honourable members going to allow that sort of thing to continue? Then followed the Minister for the Navy, as reported in Hansard, as follows: For the last few minutes the honourable member has been discussing the Father Jerger case, which is not within the province of this Parliament to discuss at present, as you, Mr. Speaker, well ruled this afternoon. Is it in order to set aside your ruling and to discuss the case again while it is pending in the Law Courts? That was the Minister's point of order. I do not remember the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) intervening at all; but, at all events, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) raised the point on which your ruling was given.",36
154,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"And the Law Officers of the Crown intimated to the House, and to Mr 'Speaker, that the matter was sub judice in the Courts.",36
155,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Then the Law Officers of the Crown have misinformed the House, and I am surprised that they should have done so upon the point that the matter of the inquiry held by Sir Robert Garran was sub judice. Does the Minister for Works and Railways say that .it is ?",36
156,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The inquiry is not sub judice itself, but the challenging of the Government's action in deporting this man is sub judice. The honourable member must remember that there was not only an application to be made which was under appeal, but, also, that a w r it was issued challenging the Government's action, and asking for an injunction to restrain the Commonwealth authorities Minister from deporting the party in question. And, according to the honourable member's case, presumably, the whole of the 1 facts in connection with the deportation are to be raised.",36
157,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"No ; only one point was raised, and that was whether the Executive had power to take this action or not.",36
158,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"On the application Which the honourable member made, he raised several points.",36
159,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Does the Minister suggest that it was within the jurisdiction of the High Court to say whether or not the Eederal Executive had abused their powers ?,36
160,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"You have issued a w r it, which has raised the whole question of the circumstances of the deportation.",36
161,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"There is only one point raised, and that is whether the Commonwealth Executive has power to deport persons, or not. This matter regarding the inquiry held before Sir Robert Garran was not sub judice, and is not now sub judice. Responsibility rests upon honourable members to.say whether or not they will prevent a discussion on this matter; and it is an individual responsibility. Are honourable members going to stand for this, namely, that they will not allow the matter to be discussed upon the floor of the House, seeing that a notice of appeal has 'been given regarding the power of the Executive to deport people from this country? If they-are going to do so, discussion can be held up in this Chamber, not only pending the final decision of the High Court, but until a decision has been sought from and given by the ultimate tribunal of appeal of the British Empire; that is, the Privy Council.' It would be absolutely ridiculous, but that would be the effect of Mr Speaker's ruling, and of honourable members supporting it . Now, I desire to give an illustration of a matter which may be referred to in debate in this Chamber, which is not the issue in a trial. I am referring to volume 335 of British Hansard, Parliamentary Debates, third series (page 1251). The member of the House of Commons whom I shall quote is. Mr Atherley-Jones, whose knowledge of the Standing Orders of the Imperial Parliament no honourable member will He was speaking in reference to the prosecution of a Mr Conybeare and a Mr Harrison, and was called to order for referring to matters that were in issue at the t r i a l . He desisted, but went on to make other statements, which I shall read in order to illustrate what was held to be in order as not being part of the subject-matter of the t r i a l Now, what I want to ask the House is what offence Mr Harrison committed in handing in these loaves of bread, and, secondly, what is of more importance, assuming that he had committed an offence, which might be the subject of some civil remedy, what justified the police in arresting him ? In amplification of this question, I wish to ask the right honourable gentleman what are the functions of the Royal Irish Constabulary in respect of evictions? I have followed with great care and interest the information we have at various times received in regard to the conduct of the Irish Constabulary at evictions, but, as an English lawyer, and speaking, as I know I do, the confirmed opinion of every member of my own profession, I say without hesitation that the duties of the police at evictions are confined within these limits. And so on. Those statements were not held to be out of order. Later on, as reported at page 1258, Mr Atherleygument, Jones, dealing with the conduct of police with regard to Mir. Conybeare, by said It is reported that Mr Conybeare, during his visit to Falcarragh, was subjected odious system of police espionage. of the constabulary followed my honourable friend about with note-books in their hands and wrote down every word he uttered in vate conversation. Although these gentlemen were under a charge that had yet to be dealt with, Mr . Atherley-Jones discussed in this way the manner in which the police had dealt with them. That being so, surely I should have been allowed to refer to the manner in which the Commonwealth Executive dealt with this internee. Here was an actual trial, and the matter was discussed in the House of Commons by Mr Atherley-Jones, whose knowledge in such matters no one will doubt. He referred in the way I have set out to the conduct of the police connected with the case. Could I not, then, refer similarly, even if the matter were sub judicewhich it is not-to the manner in which the Commonwealth Executive had abused their powers ? Was it not open for me to refer to the way in which they had hounded down this internee and persecuted him at every turn? Are we not to be allowed to discuss these things? doubt. Are Ministers to be able to go out without telling the public what has been done",36
162,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I rise to order. Is the honourable member in order in charging the Executive Government of the day with persecuting and otherwise abusing this so-called internee while the case is still before the Court?,37
163,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND," I am afraid it would be somewhat difficult to restrain some honourable members from indulging in adverse criticism of the Government of the day. I would point out, however, that the specific motion before the Chair is merely one to diss.ent from my ruling, and advantage should not be taken of such a motion to make charges against Ministers or any one else. The honourable member should simply deal with what, in his opinion, are the merits or demerits of the ruling itself. I ask him to confine himself to that aspect of the. matter.",37
164,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,In building up my ar- it is necessary that I should make the my case clear to honourable members,37
165,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am afraid that the honourable member is going considerably to an beyond what, is necessary. Members Mr Ryan - It is necessary to. show what would be the consequence of giving prieffect to the ruling from which we ask the House to dissent. I have quoted from a speechmade in the House of Commons in which Mr Atherley-Jones was allowed to use some very strong language. asked, when dealing with the case of Mr. Conybeare, why the police were allowed to go about taking notes of private conversations of a person who was to be tried ?' That surely was a reflection, and a very justifiable reflection, upon the action of the Executive Government of the day. I am not going to detain the House any longer. I have set out what, in my opinion, are the considerations upon which honourable members ought to act in coming to a conclusion on this question. It is not, so far as you are concerned, Mr Speaker, a personal matter. It is a matter not of upholding your rights or authority as Speaker, but of upholding the rights and authority of this House. Every member has to shoulder . a personal responsibility for the vote he casts. The responsibility for the ruling given by you when you called .me to order was yours, Mr Speaker; but every honourable member who, when we divide on this question, votes to say that you were right in not permitting me to make a comment upon this Executive action on the part of the Government must accept the responsibility for your ruling. That responsibility, I am sure, honourable members are prepared to take. I am prepared to take my responsibility, and I have no doubt that every honourable member is prepared to shoulder his own. But I Would remind honourable members who contend that they come here to stand for the upholding of the authority of Parliament, and for the restoration of con* stitutional government, that one of the first things they must do is to see that there shall 'be no curbing of the rights Of lionorable members in this House to speak in public upon all matters, and to take the consequences of what they say. If I said something that was not in con'formity with public opinion I shotild suffer accordingly. After all the final arbiter, the final judge of us all, is .public opinion. We all know that during the years Of the war the Executive Government were given extraordinary powers. It was said that because of the war it 'was necessary that they should have them. Those powers were used 'tyrannically. But in addition to v'estMr Ryan. ing them in the Government and to setting up a class of tin-pot tyrants in He this country, are honourable members opposite going to allow us to be prevented from expressing in this House our views upon every action of the Executive? I repeat, sir, that the responsibility passes from you - No doubt you came to your conclusion as the result of being misinformed by some responsible Minister. The responsibility passes from you to the shoulders of honourable members generally, and I hope that they will do their duty.",37
166,Mr MATHEWS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I second the motion.,38
167,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [4.30] - I ask : honourable members to cast back their minds to the circumstances under which - this ruling was given. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) was attempting to discuss the whole question of the deportation of Father Jerger - a n Executive act carried out, - as we believe, under the authority of the law. The - deportation of Father Jerger was being argued in the Courts, arad it was raised here. The honourable .member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) in his capacity as counsel, had made application to the High Court for an order nisi for a writ of habeas corpus. That case had been argued before the Court one afternoon, and on the following morning a decision was given by the learned Judge. The honourable member announced in Court that he intended to give notice of appeal; and that notice of appeal has actually been given, so that the question is still sub judice. An attempt was made to discuss in this House the whole question of Father Jerger's deportation, when the validity for invalidity of that action was before the Court for decision. When the matter was first raised the grounds on which the action taken was alleged to be invalid were not known, except by reference to a writ which had been issued in addition to the application for an order nisi. In this writ it is stated thatThe plaintiff's claim is for a declaration that the War Precautions Act 1914-16 and the War Precautions Regulations 1915 are no longer in operation, and are ultra vires of the Constitution Act",38
168,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That is a pure point of law.,38
169,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"But i u this w r it the plaintiff also claims an injunctionto restrain defendant by himself or his agents or servants from taking any action or step interfering with the personal liberty of the plaintiff, and' compelling him to leave Australia, and also for an order to restrain - the said defendant or his agents or servants from authorizing or permitting any military or naval authority from arresting the plaintiff or interfering with his personal liberty as aforesaid: It will thus b© seen that the question of a man's personal liberty, which is involved in this writ, was raised by the honourable member. During .the debate he sought to create, and might have been successful in creating, in this House a political opinion upon the case while it was still before a Court for decision. That was the atmosphere which the honourable member intended to create. Our functions as a legislative body are clear, and there can be no doubt that the House is perfectly justified in criticising freely the actions of the Government and in calling upon it to answer for its conduct. Such criticism is clearly within the functions of Parliament. The Courts of law, however, stand in a different position. They are created to deal, amongst other things, with questions relating to the liberty of individuals and to take into account the circumstances concerning such matters. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr . MCDonald) will no doubt have a clear recollection of the ruling that he, as Speaker, gave when Sir William Irvine, then the honourable member for Flinders, sought to discuss something relating to - the Australian Workers Union, which at that time had a case before the Arbitration Court.",39
170,Mr MCDONALD,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The case was actually before the Court. Mr GROOM . ^ - It was; and the honourable member ruled that, since it was nub judice, the matter could not be referred to in this House. The principle then laid down was that it was not right .or proper for the House to discuss matters which are pending before the judicial tribunals of the country.",39
171,Mr RILEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"If a Judge committed an .outrage on the bench, .could we not discuss his action?",39
172,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Yes . The procedure is .clearly laid down by the Constitution .ijbself. If a Judge is guilty of misconduct we can deal with that misconduct.,39
173,Mr MATHEWS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,^ B ut th© majorit y in this House would prevent us from doing so.,39
174,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"^-Not at all. I am merely showing .that there is a proper procedure to follow. If a Judge is guilty of misconduct his actions can be challenged in this House, and by resolution of the Parliament he can be removed from office. Mr Ryan,-The question here is not the removal of a Judge for misconduct, but the removal from office of the Executive of the d a y ' for misconduct.",39
175,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,And in dealing with that alleged misconduct the honourable member was tryin g tp bring before the House the facts concerning the case .which was before the Judge for decision.,39
176,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,^-Nbt at all.,39
177,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That was the actual position when he was called to order. In the House of Commons, as reported in ""Vol. 64, 4th Series, of the Parliamentary Debates, page 867, an honourable member sought to discuss allegations of bribery before any legal proceedings had been brought before a tribunal, but before the time within which a petition could be lodged had expired. "" Mr R. G. Webster rose to a point of order, askingIs it in order for an honourable member to refer to an election at a time when the period during which a petition may be lodged has not yet expired ? Mr SPEAKER. - I must say that I think it is most unusual. Sir J. MACLURE - I think, if I may be allowed to say so, that it is disgraceful. Mr SPEAKEfli -^Order, Order! It is a most unusual coursej nnd I think it is out of order. The honourable member is now about to go into the allegations that there was bribery and corru.pipm at the Great - Grimsby election. That, 1 understand, is his object.",39
178,Mr LEWIS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Yes .,39
179,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Such allegations may be true or they may not, but it appears to me to be quite irregular to discuss that question in this House. Supposing an election petition had been lodged, very clearly it would be out of order to ask this House to discuss or pass judgment upon a matter which is under consideration in an election Court. The same reasoning must apply if the tw.enty-one days, which is the period within which a petition may be presented, have not lapsed. I think it would be quite out of order for the honourable gentleman to enter into ,a discussion as to whether .corruption took place at an .election when the twenty-one days have not expired - within which a petition may be lodged. So careful was the Speaker to preserve proper relations between Parliament and the Courts that, although in the' case in question an election petition had not been presented, he held it to be absolutely i m proper to discuss in the House matters relating to the election which might come before the Court for determination. It is a decided principle, and I am showiug the extent to which the Speaker carries it°out. The facts in the case were clear as they presented themselves to the House at the time, the ruling was given. The matter was before the Court, and the extent to which"" the circumstances of the case were to be brought forward could not be known.",39
180,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The Justice of the High Court had already given his decision.,40
181,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Not altogether. of appeal had been lodged, and still holds good. The case is still sub judice.",40
182,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,But not this particular matter.,40
183,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"We cannot separate one isolated fact. The deportation proceedings must be taken as a whole, and Mr . Speaker gave his ruling on them as he had them before him in this House. Honourable members endeavoured, as far a3 possible, to get around that ruling and discuss the facts of the case.",40
184,Mr FOWLER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,What was the nature of the inquiry before Sir Robert Garran?,40
185,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,All the facts in regard to the case of Father Jerger were placed before Sir Robert Garran in his capacity of Solicitor-General.,40
186,Mr FENTON,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Si r Robert Garran's in quiry was not a Court case.,40
187,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The matter that is sub judice is the case before the High Court, and honourable members sought to bring before the House the facts relating to it .",40
188,Mr RILEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Is it claimed that Father Jerger's case is still nib judice?,40
189,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The questions concerning his deportation judice.,40
190,Mr RILEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Then why are tempting to get him away; why do you not wait u n t i l the Court has giveu its decision ?,40
191,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That is not the point at issue now. The issue is whether the question of his deportation is stib judice at the present time.  ment are endeavouring to get Father Jerger away by the use of black labour.,40
192,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That again is a different - question.,40
193,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Is it not a political question, and a matter which we should be permitted to discuss here? Are there not a dozen political aspects of the matter which ought to be discussed here""?",40
194,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Eve n if the case has its political aspects, we should not discuss them in such a way that they might in fluence the trial of an action. That is the whole principle at stake. Honourable members are endeavouring to evade the rule generally laid down.",40
195,Mr MAHONY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Would a discussion of the inquiry carried out by Sir Robert Garran influence the High Court?,40
196,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Every case is based on Notice facts, and it was the facts in connection with the whole case, including those submitted by Father Jerger, which were in quired into by Sir Robert Garran. It was the thir d time the facts had been examined.",40
197,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"That was the third travesty, and there have been half-adozen travesties since then.",40
198,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"It was a step towards ascertaining the facts, and while the matter was being dealt with it wasan improper thing to attempt to review them and discuss them in the House, seeing that a w r it of habeas corpus had been applied for, and an application for an in junction made, giving ample opportunity to the Court to deal with the case. The case is still going on. In Adelaide, an application has been made to a State Judge for a w r it of habeas corpus. In every way the matter is being attacked. It is certainly true that a man is entitled to take every legal remedy at his command, but that is not the point at issue today. The question is whether it is right or proper to bring political influraised ence to bear in this House in such a way are still sub that it might interfere with the administration of justice. you at- Mr BRENNAN (Batman) [ 4 . 4 3 ] - I rise to support the motion; and I hope that members will be very jealous of the right of the House to discuss matters of public importance. On a motion of this kind there is always a danger, as there is in regard to all public questions in Parliament, of its being decided, if not Govern- on party lines, at least under the influence of party considerations. It is a pity that this is so; but I hope that it will' not be the case today. When I was discussing this matter on Thursday last, I received from Mr Speaker a very explicit assurance that I must not discuss the Father Jerger case in any aspect whatever. That was nearly an end for me; but I went a little further under very great difficulties indeed, until I was ordered to cease my remarks. Some of the features in connection with the Father Jerger case are purely political; others are purely legal. One of the questions before the Court was a complicated legal one as to whether, on the facts before the Court, Father Jerger could be declared an alien. The question involved the examination of British law, and a comparison with Australian law, and also involved the whole ambit of the law concerning nationality. In fact, it was a question which might very well have gone from a single Justice to the High Court, and then to the Privy Council, and before a final decision might be given the time could very well extend to at least twelve months. i Sir ROBERT BEST - The question was decided by the Full Court.",40
199,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member is correct; that pure question of law was decided by the Full Court, and, therefore, we are bound to assume, although it is not material to the present discussion, that it had been decided that Father Jerger was not British, and was an alien. But is' it proper, when the Counts are leisurely considering a pure question of law involving an inquiry as to whether a man is an alien or not, that we in this Parliament should not he able to consider a purely political questionthe propriety of the Executive in taking a certain course of action in regard to deportations? That matter does not involve, the jurisdiction of a Court.. The, object of our Standing Orders was to protect persons upon trial, and to protect the Court. It was conceived for the purpose of guarding any person whose interests were at stake; hut it was not designed with the object of preventing the discussion of public questions which are not in issue in the Courts. For example, on Thursday last I was desirous of raising what I regarded as great impropriety on the part of the Government in preventing counsel from having access to Father Jerger to get his instructions; hut Mr Speaker prevented me from bringing forward that aspect of the matter, although it had nothing to do with the Court. I was about to submit that Father Jerger could not have a fair trial unless he was allowed to see counsel and give instructions for his defence. The matter was quite anterior to the trial, and I thought it was something that demanded the greatest publicity in order that the community might learn that the course of justice was being interfered with in every way. This was a purely political question, and not a legal matter at issue in this particular case. I also wanted to raise a purely political, or perhaps ethical, or even religious, question as to whethei it was proper on the part of the Government to prevent Father Jerger from being interviewed by his confessor, also a matter that had nothing whatever to do with the Courts, and the discussion of which could not possibly affect the judgment of a Court. There is onequestion of law as to whether the War Precautions Act is ultra vires that should be discussed in this House, and the Government ought to be subjected to caustic criticism for their attitude. But it is suggested that, because some proceedings have been taken under, say, Order 2 j or some other section of the War Precautions Regulations, it is incompetent for honourable members here to point out that long ago the Government should have removed from the statute book the whole of the war precautions legislation. Surely the House will be with those who declare that every honourable member should have the right to discuss the purely political question as to whether this legislation should be repealed or not. It has been a burning question with us, and every day it is becoming a more pressing political matter. Many of us consider that the administration of the Act is wrong, oppressive, and improper, and as it becomes more so every day, and is purely a political question, we should not be prevented from discussing it merely because some section of the Act is under consideration in connection with the proposed deportation of Father Jerger. I am sorry that there is now some doubt as to the question we are to decide. If the question is whether or not' a case which is sub judice may be properly discussed in this House it should be easy to decide. I do not wish to discuss in this' House any particular matter which is sub judice. But that is not the issue. The question before us is whether we may discuss political questions relating to the War Precautions Act and deportation, which were not in any way in issue in the case which was before a Court, and for our purpose and argument cite the case of the Rev. Father Jerger. I cannot understand the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), with his standing at the' Bar and his responsibility in this House, defending the position of the Government in this regard. The question of the propriety of such a discussion would not have been raised but that the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), when he saw that I was touching on ground that was delicate-no t from the point of view of the Court, but from the point of view of the Government-in order to protect himself from the unlimited resources of his intellectual vacuity, raised a point of order that I , ' by my own admission, proposed to carry this matter further. I did say that we proposed to carry it further, but I did not say whether it was to be carried to the platform or to the Courts, or merely that the indignation which was felt by the public would find expression in some way or other. I hope the House will display sufficient self-esteem and regard for its paramount public duty to vote for the motion, and thus assert its own righ t to examine urgent public problems carefully.",41
200,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND," I am not concerned with the legal argument as to whether or not a particular case was sub judice. I was authoritatively informed that it was so. The real point of my ruling was that matters awaiting the adjudication of a Court of law should not be brought forward in debate. This rule was observed by Sir Robert Peel and Lord John Russell, fccth by the wording of the speech from the Throne and by their procedure in the House of Commons, regarding Mr ' O'Connell's case, and has been rraintained by the rulings from the Chair. (Vide May, 10th Edition, page 316.) In the same edition, at page 264, it is statedr- A matter whilst under adjudication by a Court of Law should not he brought before the House by a motion or otherwise. I will quote from the authorities which I referred to in May as laying the foundation of this decision. In the address from the Throne, referred to in Parliamentary Debates, 1884, Volume 72, appeared this passageI forbear from observation on events in Ireland, in respect to which proceedings are pending before the proper legal tribunal. In that instance the Queen in her speech from the Throne forbore from mentioning a matter that was before the Court. On page 86, Lord John Russell is reported as having said I quite agree, that while the trials are pending before a judicial tribunal in that country, it would be impossible, with a proper regard to the proceedings of a Court of Justice, to discuss certain topics one way or the other, without involving the conduct of persons who are now obliged to defend their conduct before the Judges. Sir Robert Peel spoke to the same effect on page 98Her Majesty declares her reluctance, while the legal proceedings are pending, to refer to those proceedings; and it is indeed impossible to' refer to parties connected with affairs in that country without in some way alluding to the trials now going on. The actual issue raised upon the Speaker's ruling was in this case brought up in 1899, when the adjournment of the House of Commons was moved "" for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the conduct of the police at Ealcarragn, and the circumstances attending the arrest of Mr Harrison and the prosecution of Mr Conybeare."" Mr Wharton, at page 1254, volume 355, third series, said- : I rise to order. I do not wish to interrupt the honourable member, but I wish to ask you, sir, whether it is in accordance with the practice of the House for an honourable member to refer to the circumstance of a case pending legal jurisdiction. The fact is that all the circumstances to which the honourable member is alluding, will come before the Court of Appeal, and will probaibly form the charge against the honourable member opposite before that Court. I wish, therefore, to know if it is in accordance with the practice of this House, that the circumstances of the case can be referred to on this occasion?",42
201,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"When the honourable member on a previous night gave his notice, I thought it my duty to take upon myself the responsibility of saying that I thought, under the then circumstances, it would be indecorous in the highest degree to bring the circumstances under the notice of the House. But to-night, the honourable member has varied the notice on moving the adjournment of the House, namely, ' For the purpose of calling attention to the conduct of the police at Falcarragh."" He now appears to be dealing with another subject, namely, the prosecution of the honourable and learned member for the Camborne Division (Mr Conybeare), and I hope I may say I do not think I am travelling out of my responsibility and my proper functions when I say that 1 do not think the House will sanction any remarks which are likely to prejudice the trial which, though it is over in the first instance, is now the subject of appeal. The honourable and learned gentleman has asked mc whether it is the practice of the House. I am not aware that there has been any definite and distinct expression of opinion on the part of the House that pending trials should not be alluded to. Nor am I aware of any distinct and definite ruling from the Chair, though I am aware of frequent expressions of opinion, both from Ministers in this House and other members, with regard to the impropriety of alluding to pending trials in such a way as to prejudice a fair t r i al of the case.",42
202,Dr MALONEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"As the clock is nearing the hour of 5, at which time the debate will expire in the ordinary course, I suggest that the time for the debate be extended.",43
203,Sir JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I do not like the idea of preventing any honourable members from speaking. Of course, it is for Mr Speaker to say what he wishes in this matter, but I suggest that we might agree to take a vote on this motion before the dinner-hour. Mr TUDO:R - Tak e a vote before 6.30.

204,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"In our own Parliament Mr Speaker MCDonald ruledOur Standing Orders do not provide directly for this matter, but it is, I believe, a universal rule of the British Parliament, as laid down in May, pages 278 and 332, l l t h edition, that matters awaiting the adjudication of a Court of law should not be brought forward in debate. In accordance with that principle I rule that it would not be in order to refer specifically in the debate to the .Australian Workers Union. That is reported in Hansard at page 1126, volume 75, 1914. On referring - the division-list I find that ruling <on that occasion was upheld by the House, amongst the supporters of it being a number of honourable members who are fore the Courts. present colleagues of the honourable memthat ber for West Sydney.",43

The only question cuss it? I had to decide on Thursday was whether or not it would be in order for an honourable member to refer to a case that wa3 still pending before the Law Courts, not having been finally dealt witli. If it was still pending before the Courts, it must be regarded as sub judice. I pointed that out when the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was speaking and referring at considerable length to a particular case-the merits of which do not concern me-which I understood had been disposed of by the Court on Thursday morning. While the honourable member was speaking, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) raised a point of order as to whether ithe honourable member was in order in referring to a matter that was still sub judice. I replied that I understood that the cr.se in question had been decided by the Court that morning. I spoke in accordance with an intimation that I had received from the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), but the Minister for the Navy assured me that the case had not been finally decided, as notice of appeal had been given. I then asked the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) if he could give me an assurance that the matter had been finally disposed of by the Court. The honourable member said something to the effect that the matter would not be allowed to rest where it was, and I concluded from that statement, in the absence of a definite assurance to the contrary, that the case was .still pending before the Courts. Then the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), who is a member of the legal profession, entered the chamber and definitely assured me that the case was still sub judice.",43

210,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"A Minister of the Crown had assured me that the ease was sub judice, and I could not be expected to decide between two legal gentlomen regarding the legal facts of t!;e. maltar? When a responsible Minister of the Crown, who is a member of the legal profession, assures me that a case is sub judice, I must take his assurance; but when another honourable member, also a legal gentleman of recognised status and legal attainments, tells .me that the case is not sub judice, I am on the .horns of a dilemma. But that is not the point. What I had to decide, and the point on which I gave my . ruling, was that while the matter was sub judice it could not be discussed. Beyond that I could not go. I did not profess to decide whether it was or was not sub judice, but acted on the assurance of the Minister that it was. I might draw attention to another fact, and that is that the point of order was not raised for the first time when the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan) gave notice of his intention to move to dissent from . m y ruling . gether, it was raised no fewer than four times during last Thursday's discussion. I was temporarily called from the Chamber to attend to some urgent business, and the Deputy Speaker, who relieved me, informed me that during my temporary absence he had ruled that the matter could not be discussed. Then, when the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was speaking, my attention was called to his remarks by th© Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook). I ruled that if the matter he was discussing was sub judice, he could not continue to discuss it . The honourable member for West Sydney raised a. point of order affecting another phase of the question, and I ruled that my original 'decision still stood.

That was the fourth ruling on the point during that day, and it was not u n t i l my ruling had been repeated four times that notice of the motion to dissent from it was given. I feel sure that the House will see the unwisdom of discussing matters which are pending before the Courts. Had this matter been finished with by the Courts, there would have been no objection to a full and thorough discussion of it , and I should not have attempted in any way to interfere with such a discussion of it . It was only because, in my judgment, it was not right to discuss it , and not in accordance with our own practice and the traditions of the British House of Commons, and the decision of the House on Altoa previous occasion, that I ruled that the discussion could nob continue. My ruling was grounded on the practice of the House of Commons as I understood it , on the practice of this House, and on an actual decision of this House on a previous occasion, to which I have already made reference.",44
215,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Y a r r a ) [ 5 . 1 0 ] - I shall be brief, because other members desire to discuss the motion; hut there are one or two points which should not be lost sight of. Y o u stated, Mr Speaker, that your ruling was based on the principle which had been accepted by the House of Commons that nothing should be said in debate that tended to prevent men fro m getting a fair trial. Now, surely what was said on Thursday last did not tend to prevent any man from getting a fair trial, seeing that it was a demand for a fair trial. We have been told that the case is sub judice. If so, it is extraordinary that there should be an attempt to send Father Jerger away while he is still awaiting trial. The Government in formed you, Mr Speaker, that the case was sub judice, and yet they have moved heaven and earth to send the man out of the country while his case is before the Courts, and had it not been for the action of the British seamen on the Nestor would not be in the country today. What was said was not tending to prejudice the internment camps. granting of a fair trial. It is not right for the Government to prevent a fair trial, or to prevent members from speaking on this case. On Wednesday last, before rose to move my motion of censure, the honourable member for Hume (Mr the Parker Moloney) asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) about Father Jerger's case, and the right able gentleman's reply was that the orable memib'er would have an opporcountry tunity to talk as much as he liked about it during the debate on the censure moblack tion. The honourable member was, howI ever, prevented from talking on the which saysmotion because of the arrangement to take a vote on it-before 4 o'clock p.m. on Frigiven day last. I do not think the Prime MinOne ister endeavoured to mislead the honourable member. He, no doubt, thought against this man. that on the censure motion we should be able to discuss everything connected now before us? with the case, because it was not sub judice in the ordinary acceptation of words. When a case is sub judice, no one is allowed to say or publish anything about it. The press, however, is not treating this case as sub judice. It knows that it can say what it likes about ancl the Argus comments upon it freely today. If the press can comment on it, why should not members on this side be allowed to do so? The newspapers have judice. gone so far as to declare that this is first time that an objection to deportaing tion has been raised by us; but that stategentleman ment is a deliberate lie, 17th August last the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who was then Deputy Leader of the Labour party, moved a motion protesting against it, honourable members will see by reference to our Hansard Tecord. Outside chamber any member may say what likes about the Father Jerger case; War Precautions Act does not prevent discussion. Many of us have said a good deal about, not only this case, but other cases of the kind. Every person in the themselves. community isentitled to a fair trial, and to be told who are his accusers. We have no right to assume a man to without trying him. What we say now in this matter is what we said twelve months ago. The honourable member for the referring he Angas (Mr Gabb) some time back spoke of the ill-treatment of internees in",44
216,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The longer the Act remains the greater the scandal becomes.,45
217,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I realise that. To-day I the Government were asked whether they intended to employ black labour to effect deportation of Father Jerger. I assume that the suggestion was that they might utilize the black labour on board honour the Peninsular and Oriental steamer honEhyber. It would be a disgrace to a professing to believe in the White Australia policy for a Government to use labour to obtain their ends. To-day .received, a telegram from Adelaide, Glynn, ex-Minister Hughes Government, has exhaustive statement for publication. paragraph stating not a single direct . proof of any disloyalty has been adduced",45

219,Mr TUDOR,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"No ; but I am entitled the to say what I have been told of the opinion of a leading member of the party opposite, and an ex-Minister and ex-member. If the statement that this case is sub judice means anything, it means that it, the trial of Father Jerger - is not concluded, or that he is going to be tried. We say that he is being deported without a trial, and, therefore, the case is not sub If the case were sub judice, the .surely the Government should not he movheaven and earth to get the reverend out of the way before a trial because on the could take place!  [l 5.19] - The observations of Mr. as .Speaker seem to me absolutely to cloud the issue. The point was whether the the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. he Ryan) should be allowed to discuss a the matter which had been before Sir Robert its Garran, but not before the Courts.",45
220,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The Government tried to blame the Courts for what they had done  This is the Hansard report of what the be guilty honourable member said I should like you, sir, to be quite clear as . to what my assurance is. It is that I am not to any matter in connection with Reverend Father Jerger that came before the Courts. He was referring to the sham inquiry before Sir Robert Garran. It was upon the references of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) to that alleged inquiry that Mr Speaker challenged his right to discuss the question at all and ruled that he had no such right. It was - not a matter before the Courts which the honourable member was discussing. submit that no honourable member, if he is going to register a conscientious vote, will take the stand that it would be out of order to discuss a matter which is not before the Courts at all. Mr Speaker went entirely outside of his rights in giving his ruling. The whole position, however, is clear fro m the point of view of the Government. It is ashamed of the business, and of the action it has taken. It wants to shift the responsibility from itself to the Courts. Even today when the honourable member for Batman (Mr . Brennan) asked the Prime Minister if it was a fact that Eather Jerger was to be shifted from this country by the use of black labour or by non-unionists",45
221,Mr BELL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The honourable member asked if it was the intention of the Government to employ that kind of labour.,46
222,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The exact expression, if 'ryou desire to hear it again, was, "" To .invoke the aid of black labour or non-unionists.""  Prime Minister said, "" Yes, any means will be justified which the country can employ to deport Father Jerger.""",46
223,Mr BELL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The Prime Minister did not say "" Yes,"" but that he did not know.  "" I do not know and then the Prime Minister qualified that by saying, "" An y means that can be adopted will be justified."" If the matter is sub judice, obviously the Prime Minister does not recognise it to be so, because he said, "" An y means are justified in getting Father - Jerger out of the country,"" I am not particular about' the exact words used by the Prime Minister.",46
224,Mr BELL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Y o u certainly are not. You are not particular how you misquote him .  whatever he may have said, I am satisfied, that the Prime Minister would use any means. He will be prepared both to use and to support any means.",46

The honourable member may make passing reference to that point, but it is outside the scope of the motion, and he will not be in order in discussing it .  size that the matter could not have been sub judice, seeing that the Prime Minister virtually admitted as much. The authorities are trying now by ©very devious means in their power to send Father Jerger out of Australia.",46

I again remind the honourable member that he' is distinctly out of order.  you temporarily took the Chair honourable members were permitted to refer to this phase of the subject without hindrance; and to a great many other things besides. .

The honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Sir Granville R y r i e ) , in his statements in Sydney-whe n he referred to Father Jerger as a traitor and a rebel-mus t have considered that the matter was not sub judice or he would not have uttered those remarks. Further strength for my point is provided by the fact that the papers in Australia have been discussing the .same subject every morning without reservation.",46
230,Sir GBANVILLE RTBTE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"All I can say is that I do not think .he ought to go alone. He ought to have some companions.  that, it is not only the case of Father Jerger with which we are concerned. In answer to a statement which has appeared in a section of the press, wherein it asks why we on this side are interested so much in the case of Father Jerger, I would point out that the Leader of our party stated today that we had been conducting a campaign for the past twelve months against the principle of deportation without fair trial of any citizen. The sole question now is whether the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Ryan) was out of order in discussing the departmental inquiry before Sir Robert Garran.",46
231,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"It was notan ordinary departmental inquiry, because in such investigations the party concerned has the right to be represented by counsel.  aud neither was it a Court. It was the greatest travesty that could have been conceived. Only one conclusion can be drawn. I point out that Mr Speaker made his lengthy statement when, perhaps, there were present not half-a-dozen members on his own 'side.",47
232,Mr BELL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"What does the honourable; member mean by saying "" on his own side""?  tell the honourable member that after the vote is taken. I was forced into making the remark, because if there had been any desire on the part of honourable members opposite to hear what Mr Speaker had to say they would not have trooped out of the chamber when he stood up to speak.

235,Dr MALONEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I must raise a point of order. While appreciating the bluff personality of the Honorary Minister, I feel sure that on reflection he will withdraw what was an offensive remark.",47
236,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I withdraw.  answer the interjection by saying that those who believe in ""British justice are all on one side of this House. I hope that when the vote is taken it will not indicate that those who stand for fair play, for British justice, are confined to honourable members on this side.",47
237,Mr BELL,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That is not the question before the House.  not a question of pro-Germans or of any one else; but I hurl back in his teeth the Honorary Minister's offensive interjection. It is of no use for the Minister to have said what he did with a smile On his face.,47
238,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Order ! r The Honorary Minister - has withdrawn his remark, and it should not be referred to.  h© should have withdrawn it ; but some thing further is necessary.

I regret that we are about to cast a party vote. Every honourable member who stands for liberty, for the right of every citizen to fair and open trial, should be ranged on this side when the vote is taken. It is all very well for the Honorary Minister to seek to cover his unenviable position; and it is quite fitting, from his point of view, that he should drag in the racial aspect.",47
240,Mr WISE,RETURNED SAILORS AND,What has that to do with Mr Speaker's ruling?  arises from an offensive interjection.,47

Will the honourable member please desist?  is a lot more that I wish to say, but, judging by the limitations which are being placed upon me, I would not be allowed to proceed far. I shall take r another opportunity to reply to the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) when he referred to a certain vote taken in the course of discussion upon the War Precautions Bill. There was a Labour Government in power at the time, which gave its adherents every assurance that there would be no violation of tlic principle embodied in that measure.",47
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Order ! The honourable member is going entirely outside the scope of the motion.  clusion, I again emphasize that there can be only one fair way for honourable members to vote, and that is in support of this motion.",48
243,Mr RILEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"South Sydney) [5.35] I shall state very briefly the reasons why I intend to vote for this motion to dissent from Mr Speaker's ruling. I had the pleasure of introducing to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) the town clerk of Sydney (Mr Nesbit), who asked for an inquiry into Father Jerger's case. The righ t honourable gentleman promised us that he W9*dd grant an inquiry, but it merely took the form of a departmental investigation by Sir Robert Garran. . Sir Robert Garran is a public servant of the Commonwealth, and while I do not wish to reflect upon him in any way, it cannot be said that an inquiry by him constituted a hearing before a legal tribunal. His decision in this case does not carry with it the autliority that would attach to a decision by a Court of .law. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan), when he was called to order, was endeavouring to point out that when representing Father Jerger before this departmental inquiry, he was deprived of his right to put questions to witnesses. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) raised the point of order that the matter could not be referred to since the case was sub judice, and had actually been before a Court. My contention is that the inquiry by Sir Robert Garran was not an inquiry by a Court, and that even if it could be so construed, since a decision had been given and the case had not been carried on to any legal tribunal, the honourable member for West Sydney was entitled to discuss the whole matter in the House. By means of this point of order, we had' put into Mr Speaker's mouth the statement that the case was sub judice, and therefore could not be discussed. I am only a layman, but I have come to the conclusion that the honourable member was perfectly within his rights when he was called to order. We, as representatives of the people, have certain rights in this House. Surely it is open to us to criticise departmental in quiries, particularly when the proceedings have been completed. I am very friendly with Mr Speaker, and regret exceedingly that I shall have to"" vote against a ruling given by him, but I am convinced' that his ruling in this instance was wrong. It cannot be said that this Parliament does not stand above all Courts. The Justices of the High Court are our servants. We pay them to carry on the machinery of the law, and we ought not to be precluded from discussing any question - brought before them. No one could be injured by a discussion in this House in relation to an inquiry that had actually closed, and in which a decision had been given. It is now argued that since notice of appeal against that decision had been given the case was clearly sub judice. We are told that we are in duty bound to respect the decisions of the Courts. Is there not a greater obligation on the part of the Government to respect the orders of the Courts? When action is being taken before a public tribunal to restrain the deportation of Father Jerger, the Government should refrain from any attempt to deport him until the decision of the Court has been given. Our position, I contend, is unassailable. The honourable member for West Sydney, in my opinion, was quite in order. He was looking after the interests of his client, and the people of the country generally, when he was ruled out of order; and I shall certainly vote to dissent from the ruling.",48
244,Mr JH CATTS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Cook) [5.41] - Littl e remains to be added to the statement of the case against Mr Speaker's ruling. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has already f u l ly covered the ground, and there has been no answer to his arguments. In reply to him , other matters have certainly been discussed; but if I were to conclude that those who have followed my honourable friend were unable to distinguish between the point raised by him and that raised by them, I should have but a very poor opinion of their intelligence. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom) has had a legal training, but it would be utterly absurd to dignify the remarks made by him by describing them as a legal argument. If he were not dissembling, then his ability as a lawyer stands on a very low plane. As a matter of fact, there is on the Government benches a majority who are determined 1 that the Executive acts of the M in is try ehall not be discussed.",48
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND, Order ! I ask the honour the able member to discuss the motion.,49
246,Mr JH CATTS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I am doing so, and I am going to show the attitude of honourable members opposite in regard it. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER- - The attitude of honourable members has nothing rights and privileges of honourable to do with the motion.",49
247,Mr JH CATTS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The matter which the honourable member for West Sydney was preventing from discussing was an Executive act on the part of this Governvernment ment, and has nothing to do with the Law Courts.",49
248,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I Temind the honourable member that the motion before the Chair is merely one to dissent'' from Mr Speaker's ruling.,49
249,Mr JH CATTS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"And Mr Speaker ruled that a departmental inquiry which had been concluded- a Star Chamber proi cedure that had actually terminatedcould not be discussed. Notwithstanding, that the honourable member for West ney (Mr R y a n ) , an acknowledged constitutional' .authority, gave the assurwise ance time after time that he was not discussing any matter that was sub judice, and did not propose to do so. Mr Speaker called upon him to desist. He was called upon not to proceed f u r the r with cussion of the administration of the Government in regard to this Star Chamber inquiry. We have' now a very cunning attempt to side-track the real issue by describing it as a discussion of tracked. a case that is sub judice. I want to tear away the mask and let the public see the real issue is being side-tracked, to shield the Law Courts from political influence, but to protect the Government from their administrative acts which they know will not stand the light of day. That is the point.",49
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,That not the point. The only Question before the Chair is a motion to dissent from ruling of Mr Speaker. The acts Government do not enter intothe present discussion.,49
251,Mr JH CATTS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The Deputy Speaker now touches the very ground judice. that I want to discuss. He says that actions of the Government may not debated.,49
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The honourable member is misrepresenting what I stated. I said that the acts of Government may not bo discussed on' this motion. Mr J. H. CATTS - Surely one is in order in stating what is the case that is to being discussed. There has been a lot of misrepresentation, either wilful or otherwise, and I desire to show that the point for which we are contending is.that the members must not be taken away from them. We are not now proposing to discuss in detail the Star Chamber inquiry, but we are seeking to show what it is that the Goare cloaking under the vile pretence that the question is pending in a Court, and is, therefore, sub judice.

254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND," The honourable,member is not in order in reading from the Hansard, report of the debates of the current session . Mr ,J. .H. CATTS - I am showing - from the published reeord of this Parliament the matter which is now under discussion, .and which an effort is heing made to side track. I am proving - that Mr Speaker read out the notice - of motion to dissent from his' ruling, - and am endeavouring - to point out mat if there - was anything wrong in the statement of the case'by the'honourable member for West Sydney and in the wording of the motion, .then was the proper time for Mr Speaker to declare that it was not his ruling, and that it was quite out.side the matter. However, he did .not .do so. Afterwards there was evidently some second thought on his part, because the motion appears on the business paper in a reconstructed .form. It was not reconstructed by the honourable .member for West Sydney. This is how .the motion 'appears on the Business - Paper.:That the Speaker's ruling-That references to the inquiry before Sir Robert Garran in the Father Jerger case, and to the conduct of the Executive in connection with that inquiry, are not proper subjects for 'discussion in Parliament-*be ' disagreed :to. Compare the wording of this motion with what was read out by Mr Speaker When the honourable member .for 'West Sydney handed in his notice of motion to dissent from the ruling which had been givenj.",50
255,Mr BRENNAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"It makes it quite clear that the conduct of the Executivo .was .one of the points .at .issue and for discus-*ion here. . Mr JH CATTS,-Yes , but.it would .make it.ap.pQar .that,.the/point for discus.sioh .here is .that Mr - Speaker had .given 'his jruling in .regard to ;.the .Gamin in--quiry. .""However, - that iis ,no.t .the point at issue. Mr Speaker has thisafternoon sent to me by messenger .a slip .in .his own writing, .stating that .his ruling is not covered by what appears in . the motion on the notice paper, but .that his ruling really was as follows:Ruled: That references in debate .to matters which are pending before the Courts, and. thus sub judice, are not in order. The .Hansard .record of the .facts on pages 2790 and 2791 will be searched in vain for any such ruling. Pirst of all, the honourable member, for-West Sydney was prevented from discussing the Gar.ran departmental inquiry,., .which we - submit was .not sub judice, and which - he was perfectly, entitled .to discuss. Thereupon the honourable - member handed :in a notice.of motion to dissent from the :ruling. That motion, which was .relative - and pertinent, Mr Speaker read to the House,-taking no exception to it - It next appearson the 'business paper - in an altered form, the alteration not having been..effected by the honourable member rfor West Sydney; but now that the .matter .has come :before the House, Mr Speaker desires to have it discussed - on .a totally different issue, .as shown by this note which he has sent.to me. The . only point I wish to make in this - debate is this-: The manner in which-this matter has been handled all .through shows fthat there is more concern to close - the mouths of honourable members in regard to. the administrative acts of the Government than there is in regard to the discussion of cases sub - judice and before the Courts.",50
256,Dr MAEOKEY,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Melbourne) [5.54] tI support the arguments put forward by honourable members - Mr - Speaker is .placed in a difficult .position between two diverging statements, the claim of legal gentlemen of the Opposition that the case of Pather Jerger is not sub judice, and the assurance of the Minister who acts as legal adviser to the - Government that it is sub judice. 'Naturally, Mr Speaker cannot he blamed for accepting .the legal opinion given hy .a Minister of the - Crown. Surely ,in this House, which is, for the present moment, the .highest Court in Australia, our lips ought not to be .sealed .upon :this matter when nearly every - one outside and .the press are jpesmitted to comment on,it, as freely as they choose, without being penalized .for so 'doing. If the'gentleman whose name has been mentioned had committed some - wrong, it shonld be proved in open Court, and, if proved, there would be no claim from honourable members such as that now put forward. I merely wish to add that, although this Parliament may be the highest Court in the country, - what has been allowed to take place would not be permitted for one moment if the people, the creators of this Parliament, had the power of the recall. They would use it freely, indeed, too freely and very awkwardly for some honourable members here today.",50
257,Mr FENTON,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Maribyrnong) [5.56]. - Every honourable member should be - vitally concerned at any attempt to filch his privileges. Tho usefulness of this 'Parliament and its opportunity to debate a great many questions that ought - to be fully discussed will surely be denied to it if, on this occasion, Mr Speaker's ruling is supported. Any honourable member who votes in favour of the ruling will be .setting 'himself up as one who desires to curtail dobate. There has been no Court .proceeding in connection with the Father Jerger case except last week, when an - appeal was made to Mr Justice Starke in.chambers. I do not regard the inquiry .by Sir Robert Gawan as Court proceedings. Yet honourable members have boen pulled up at once by Mr Speaker for attempting to discuss what occurred at that inquiry.",51
258,Mr MCDONALU,RETURNED SAILORS AND,It is admitted that it was not a Court.,51
259,Mr FENTON,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Then surely Mr. Speaker's ruling was absolutely wrong. If members value their privileges, I look for votes from the Government side and - from the Country party in support of-the morion. Otherwise .our future proceedings will be very seriously handicapped in the discussion of many questions which should be brought .before - the House. I will put up a fight before I permit myself to be deprived of privileges I am supposed to enjoy as one of the mouthpieces of the people. There have been quite enough miscarriages of justice in the past.",51
260,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"West .Sydney) [6.0.] No honourable member on 'the other side iof the - House has faced 'the real issue at stake. I agree with a - good deal of what Mr Speaker has said.; but, like - the flowers that bloom .in the spring, his remarks '' have nothing to do with the case."" I quite agree that there might be some impropriety in discussing a matter in Parliament if there was a likelihood of prejudicing the fair trial of any person or of unduly influencing judicial functions; but the real issue in this case is as to whether the matter to which I was referring was sub judice. Mr Speaker has stated that this question has been the subject-matter of - several rulings, and I can quite appreciate the manner in which he has been mjsled on the point as to whether this particular case was sub judice. The blame rests entirely on Ministers of the Crown-in the first place, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), and in the second place, - the Minister for Works and Bailways (Mr Groom). However, in-order to make perfectly clear what was the issue I had raised, I cannot - do better than refer to the report of what took place on the occasion on which the ruling was given. Sir Joseph Cook rose in his place during the course of my speech, and, addressing himself to Mr Speaker, saidFor the last few minutes the honourable member has been discussing the Father Jerger ease, which it is not within the province of this Parliament to discuss at present, as you, Mr Speaker, well ruled this afternoon. .Is it in order to set aside your ruling and to discuss the case again while it is pending in the law Courts. Then Mr Speaker.said",51
261,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND, The honourable member is not in order in quoting from reports of this session's debates.,51

Mr 'SPEAKER-The rule which has.always been followed is that.an honourable member is not permitted to quote from the Hansard report of the current session's debates unless it is the same debate. This is not the debate in the course of which the remarks were made which the honourable member seekB to quote. Those remarks were made d u r in g the debate on the censure motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. The debate today is on the rulin g itself.",51
264,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"The debate is on the same subject-matter. If we are at one in regard to the facts there is nothing to argue about; but if there is a difference of opinion as to what are the facts, the most reliable source to which we may refer is the gentleman who sits at the table reporting for Hansard, who has no reason for misreporting what is said.",52
265,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"Standing order 267 is as follows: No member shall read from a printed book, newspaper, or the report of any speech made in Parliament during the same session. This point cropped up early in the history of this Parliament, and it was decided that reference might be made to the Hansard reports of the same debate. Of course, this is not tha same debate as that from which the honourable member for West Sydney is quoting.",52

268,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I aBk honourable members to be good enough to refer to the Hansard report when it is published. I also ask all readers of Hansard to refer bock to t h at portion of my speech on page 2790, when I was interrupted by the Minister for the Navy, and when Mr . Speaker ruled against me. there find that Mr Speaker ruled that I could not refer to the Reverend Father Jerger in any way.",52
269,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,Only while his case Ways sub judice.,52
270,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"No doubt that was your reason, sir,, but my contention was that, although a certain case was sub judice, the particular matter to which I was referring was not so. In effect, your ruling went so f ar as to say that because the Reverend Father Jerger had a case in the Courts I could make no reference to him or to his deportation.",52
271,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The honourable member oould make no reference to the matters which were to be inquired' into by the Courts.,52

I do not think I should alter the terms of the motion, because it expresses very well what was in my mind, if it is read into the context of the report of Thursday's proceedings. If honourable, members vote against this motion they will be voting for the curtailment of the righ t of parliamentary discussion on matters of public importance, and they wil l not be able to escape personal responsibility for their action.",52

275,Mr RODGERS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,The honourable member might leave that to honourable members themselves.,52
276,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I must do so; but I am concerned about the people. The electors will see. recorded in black and white how honourable members voted on this motion, and it will be to the discredit of this House if the majority vote to curtail the rights of Parliament in regard to free speech. I have an idea how the vote will go this afternoon, hut the day will came when another Parliament will reverse this They will decision, and the majority of members will declare that the ruling was wrong, and that those who supported it voted for the suppression of free speech and fair public criticism of the Executive, which they desire to keep in power.",52
277,Mr HIGGS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) has said that he does not propose to amend his motion. I understood that earlier in the afternoon he obtained leave of the House $o to do.,52
278,Mr RYAN,RETURNED SAILORS AND,If I wished to do so.,53
279,Mr HIGGS,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"I understand that you, sir, did not give the ruling which is set for t h in the motion now before the House. Which motion is in order?",53
280,Mr SPEAKER,RETURNED SAILORS AND,"W it h the intention of tryin g to clarify the original notice of motion certain words were transposed by the officers, and it seems to me that the result is to give a different complexion to the motion. The notice of motion, as printed, makes it appear that I ruled that reference to the inquiry before Sir Robert Garran in the Pather Jerger case, and the conduct of the Executive in connection with that inquiry, were not proper subjects for discussion in Parliament. I did not say that, although I did say that, while the case was sub judice, it could not with propriety be discussed in Parliament.

284,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 8 . 0 ] - I move That the Parliamentary Standing Committee upon Public Works having furnished their report, it is expedient to carry out the following works:-Mobilizatio n and vehicle stores at Sey: mour, Victoria, with the necessary Tailway connection, water supply, &c. Honourable members are familiar with the procedure that is usually adopted in cases . . 19 of this kind. Upon a previous occasion . . 36 I explained the nature of the proposed work, which was then referred to the Public Works Committee. That body has 17 since investigated it , and has presented AYES. a report in favour of the work being carried out. Honourable members will recollect that the - undertaking forms a part of the scheme of demobilization. Our troops having returned to Australia, there has come back with them all the military equipment of a modern type that is necessary for our own' defence purposes. This equipment, which represents an expenditure of several million pounds, is to be located in different ..parts of the Commonwealth. The stores at Liverpool, .which are designed to .house the New .South Wales portion of it , are well on their way to completion, and the proposed stores at Seymour, which form the subject of this - motion, are intended to' accommodate the Victorian quota of thir equipment. It is absolutely necessary that the works shall be unriertakfcji immediately for the simple reason that the equipment is now coming to^hand.",53
285,Mr WATKINS,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,Why are the . stores only located' in the State capitals!,54
286,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"They are not situated in the State capitals. For instance, these stores are to be located at Seymour.",54

Debate' resumed from .7th J u l y (vide 9 f t . page :257S), 'on -.motion by Mr MASSYGREENE-That this'-Bill be now *ead a-seeond time. Mr TWBOR'.(Yarra') i[-8.8] - I am .not suggesquite sure how many times - this >Bill has ! .the been befose the House, but certainly we Jt has already been passed by the Senate, but such important alterations have been made in the form of the measure as that Professor one on Orme Masson, the chairman of the Advisory Cou.noil, has .resigned. H is resignainthe tion was ^announced in the Melbourne Herald of 'the Sth. inst. According to the ground report of that journal Professor ""Masson of the equipment states that -- The present ..Bill has, however, - departed from the scheme in two important respects; omitting a provision for the appointment of advisory councils and substituting one single director for the three directors originally proposed. The Prime Minister's view is that these two alterations are not vital, and do not subto industry. ' stantially affect the position; but, even if that view ' be correct, it is urged that he was justified in making alterations without sulting the members of the Committee. In explaining the reasons for his action, Professor Masson expressed the view that the alterations made by the Government would utterly ruin the entire scheme. H said that late in 1915 the Government had started upon this work. He then proceededTlie movement for the establishment of Institute of Science and Industry was the come of the formation of a similar body Great Britain in 1915. The then Victorian Minister for Agriculture (Mr Hagelthorn) sent on to the Melbourne University Council the papers in connection .with it which receivedfrom the Colonial Office, with .a suggestion that the scheme might b.e widened so as to benefit Australia. The Council; ever, took the view thatAustralian problems should be attacked in Australia, and that English action should be followed on Austramonwealth lian lines. At about the. same time the Inter-State Commission made a similar suggestion. At the end of the year the University Counthink cil urged the Prime Minister,"" Mr Hughes', bring together representatives of science of industry, and such a Conference took in the following January, when a Committee was appointed to draft a scheme of operations. There were in this scheme three essential features-entir e freedom frompolitical trol (a provision with which the Prime. ister expressed ready agreement); the of the direction in the hands of three men, of whom two were' to be men of scientific attainments and one a ""practical"" man (.a provision with which also, after some sion, Mr Hughes expressed agreement); the establishment of an advisory council to consist of representatives of various branches of science and of industry. The only importblowfly,, ant variation afterwards suggested by the Committee in the proposals then ' put was in the direction of replacing the single advisory council for the entire Commonwealth by a number of such councils, one for each State. ' When, however, after 4$ years, the Government had brought down a measure for the formation of a permanent, institute, these provisions, deemed essential by the Committee, had been thrown aside without the Committee being in any way consulted. I look on' the alterations made as vital. That such a step has been taken .without sultation with the Committee is typical of whole trend of action on the part of the Government. As a net result of four and a years' work, I have no faith in politicians. During-that time,the Committee has met once a week or of tener,. and, as an outcome of its labours, it has advised 'the Government garding various developments; but the treatment of its recommendations has been such, as to induce and increase the conviction that the politicians are not in sympathy with the Committee in its desire to lay down lines along which science can profitably be applied not Those are Professor Masson's comments conon the' alterations which have been made in the Bill as originally introduced. I do not entirely agree with the view which he has expressed. I do not believe that the proposed Institute can be ene tirely divorced from political control. If Professor Masson is of opinion that all we have to do is to find the ""money for the Institute, and that the Advisory an Council is to spend it just as that body outlike3, or that it is to appoint whom it in chooses, and to conduct as many investigations as it thinks f it , I do not agree with him. But I do believe that the he Commonwealth Government should have utilized the machinery at present existing howin the different States which are already doing work along somewhat similar lines, the and that it should have placed the Comlaboratory at their disposal, so as to aid them in that work. I do nob that wei are justified in building up to another institute, which, if divorced from and political control, may become a spending place department. When speaking upon this subject, upon a former occasion, I was asked by the honourable member for the Barrier (Mr Considine) whether the conInstitute was intended to undertake the Mindestruction of such pests as the prickly placing pear and the blowfly. Certainly we should accomplish a great work if we r i d Australia of the prickly pear, and I have discusno do.ubt .that many honourable memand bers arei n a position to give us a similar assurance in regard to the which has inflicted enormous in j u r y upon stock in - this country. forward Does any honourable member think that the work of the Institute has brought nearer the solution: of the problems caused by the existence of these pests ? - I have, from the start, objected to the unpractical nature of what has been done. I have nothing to say against University men,but theorists have been put into positions which should have been held by practical conmen. I do not advocate the claims of any the particular person, but Parliament should half hesitate before giving to anybody power to appoint as many officers as he pleased, without control. The Bil l does not fix any reamount as the cost of the Institute.",54
288,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,Specia l scientific work requires the appointment of specially skilled persons.,56
289,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"That is so; but there is a tendency to keep on men after the work for which they were appointed is finished. There is nothing in the Bill to say that the Institute shall cost £50,000 or £500.000 a year, and, therefore, the only opportunity for discussing its cost will be when Estimates are under consideration. But honourable membra know that, perhaps, several days may be occupied with the earlier departments of the Estimates, and the remaining departments may be then passed almost without discussion. Of course, votes will come up on Supply Bills, but then, other things will be mentioned. Some honourable members may call attention to the fact that the South Australian Government has not paid for the Port Pirie grab, which it promised to pay for, or there may be a long debate on the administration of the Northern Territory , or concerning the trans-continental railway.",56
290,Mr BLUNDELL,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Often , everything is discussed but the Estimates themselves.",56
291,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Yes . The honourable member speaks with Ministerial experience. The Postmaster-General's Department, coming as it does at the end of the Estimates, is sometimes run through hurriedly, to enable members to get to their homes.",56
292,Mr BURCHELL,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,That does not happen only when some particular party is in power.,56
293,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"No . The point I make, is that Parliament ought now to determine what shall be spent on the proposed Institute. If it does not, there will be - little opportunity to control the expenditure later. Although there has been no Act to sanction the creation of the Institute, officers have been appo'nted, and for several years we have been voting money to pay their salaries. I am never averse to' spending money, from which a good return is likely. I have been denounced as responsible for' the establishment of the Commonwealth laboratory at Royal Park, and the bringing to Australia of Dr Penfold, a man of eminent scientific attainments; but the cost of equipping and working that institution has been recouped over and over again by the sale of meningitis and influenza serum, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of pounds saved to the community by' the distribution of influenza serum during the epidemic last year. But we are starting the Institute of Science and Industry on wrong lines. Last year I was informed that the journal which is issued by it , and of which a couple of hundreds of copies are sold at Is. each, was costing Is. 8^d. to produce. It is certainly not costing less now. Many of its articles have already appeared in other scientific publications, and are merely reprints. Here is one which is reprinted fro m the Veterinary Journal, without any statement of the place where that journal is published, though the name of . the"" writer is given.",56
294,Mr COBSEB,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"The publication of these articles give3 information to people in Australia, which they would not otherwise get.",56
295,Mr GREGORY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"I know nothing of the article to which the honourable member is now alluding, but the republication of some of these articles is a good thing.",56
296,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Eleve n or twelve pages are devoted to the subject of rats and rat fleas. I do not think that the journal serves the purpose for which it was established. If there were co-operation with the existing State institutions, Better work would be done. As to whether there should be three directors or one, gossibly as good work could be got by having Tme man at the head of affairs as by having three; but he must be a practical, not merely a theoretical man. I objected to the appointment of the late Dr Gellatly, who was a journalist, on that ground. Following the article on rats, come two pages on sharks, which, we are told, are good for food.",56
297,Mr WATKINS,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,The Chinese have already told us that.,56
298,Mr RIOHABD FOSTEB,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,It is possible that you have eaten shark without knowing it .,56
299,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Yes , because at restaurants, one eats many things without knowing what they are. It is for that reason that I prefer to have my meals at home. Not only have honourable members been sent a copy of the May issue of the Journal, giving an account of the work of the temporary Institute, but they have also received a separate account of its work. Most of the investigations that have been carried out up to the present time have been into matters already dealt with by the State Departments, and many of the articles which have been published in the Journal have appeared in other publications.",56
300,Mr BLUNDELL,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,In the Commonwealth ?,57
301,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,Yes ; in the Agricultural Journals of the States. Any person interested in the problems that have been dealt with in the Journal could easily get elsewhere the information that it has contained.,57
302,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"There should be co-ordination, so that there might be an Australian scientific magazine, which would take the place of the separate State magazines.",57
303,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,Does the honourable member think that the State Departments will permit us to do the whole of the work? I think with him that there should be some co-ordination.,57
304,Mr RICHAED FOSTER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"If I thought it could not be obtained, I would not support this proposal.",57
305,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Experienc e has shown that the States are very reluctant to hand over to the Commonwealth any of their functions. It was my privilege to be a member of a deputation that waited on a member of the Victorian Ministry the other day on the question of venereal disease. When I was speaking he suggested that it would be a good thing for the Commonwealth to take on the work, and I told him that the Commonwealth had already voted money to help to eradicate the disease, in view of its danger to the community. In spite of what the Commonwealth has done, no State Government will give up the work. When we took over lighthouses and quarantine, which were spending Departments pure and simple, the States raised objections. It has to be set down in the Constitution before they will agree to our taking control. I guarantee that if we propose to undertake anything outside the Constitution the States will not give it up. The men who fight any such proposal most bitterly are some of the State officials in the Departments concerned.",57
306,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"You have just struck the sore point - financially under control. Mr TUDOR,- I know the position. Any honourable member who has been here for any length of time realizes that the men who will block the Commonwealth from extending its activities are men holding positions in the State services, and doing the work which we propose to take over, such as that outlined in this Bill.",57
307,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,And the Federal Departments very often are equally guilty.,57
308,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"That is quite possible; but, after all, if there is any force in the honourable member's suggestion that we should co-ordinate the work with the States, we must remember that we cannot do it by setting up another expensive Department where six exist at the present time, or where we are not going to do a scrap of new work. That is why I object to this scheme. The Minister has not given sufficient information as to how the States will co-operate with us in this particular matter. I believe the Bill will cause unnecessary expense by duplicating the work that ds now being done. Paragraph c of clause 9 gives power for "" the making of grants in aid of pure scientific research."" I believe that is a thing we should do, but we can do it equally well by other means. When I was a Minister, a man came to me and showed me how much lanoline was being wasted every year in the wool, and how it could be utilized. We could have a little experimental plant at each of our Commonwealth laboratories, of which there is one in every State, to do that sort of work. If one. manufacturer wants the work done for himself he should pay the whole cost of the experiment, but if the whole of the manufacturers, or the whole of the public, are to reap, the advantage of the services of our technically-trained men, whose salaries we are paying all the time, then all the manufacturers or all the public should meet the cost. That would be a far better way to do this than setting up an expensive Institute such as is being proposed. There is no limit - to the amount that may be granted under paragraph c of clause 9. The In stitute, if it is under no direct political control, as some desire, can spend any amount of money.",57
309,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,It must be,57
310,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"It must be directly under the control of a Minister. If we have to find the money, and are responsible to the people, we have no right to give those running the Institute absolute control, or to allow them to spend as much as they like on auy proposal, but that is what will happen unless we impose a limit on certain of these clauses. It is our duty to put a limit to the power to make grants in aid of pure scientific research.",57
311,Mr GREGORY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,It is all subject to regulations and to the Minister.,58
312,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"We have had too much lately of regulations which have gone absolutely contrary to the spirit of the Act, or to the intention of the Parliament which passed the Act. Clause 12 provides that the employees shall not be subject to the Public Service Act, but shall be engaged for such periods and subject to such conditions as are prescribed. That means that those in control can employ any and as many persons as they like, and keep them on as long as they like. If there is any evil in connection with public Departments, it is the existence of "" temporarypermanent "" men - They are under the control of no one, and frequently, in order to keep sweet and make themselves good fellows, they do things they ought not to be called upon to do. What has been the trouble in this building? Have not you, Mr Speaker, been asked frequently whether the employees of Parliament are being treated properly? These complaints occur simply because those employees are outside the purview of the Public Service Act. We come in contact with the men; we know them well, and they do little services for every member. Directly you take men outside the Public Service Act, you establish conditions far worse than anything which occurs under the Act; I know the difficulty of getting rid of a man once he is in the Public Service. He' is there tically for life - That might not be desirable in the case of the new Institute, but we should have some systemof control over its employees, independent of whoever happens to be the head of it for the time being. Under sub-clause 1 of clause 12 the Director may appoint as many officers as he thinks necessary;",58
313,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,The Governor General.,58
314,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,That means the Government. They are responsible.,58
315,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,The Minister makes the recommendation.,58
316,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"But it is the Ministry, and not the Governor General, that takes the responsibility. I have always been averse to sheltering the Ministry behind the term "" Governor General."" The Governor General or the State Governor simply presides at the Executive Council meeting. There is no discussion, and things go right through.",58
317,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,But the Executive Council means more than one Minister.,58
318,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,There must - be three present.,58
319,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"It establishes the - principle of having, more than one person responsible for an appointment.",58
320,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"How many outside the Minister concerned actually know onehundredth part of what' is going' through ? It takes Ministers all their time to control their own Departments, without having any to spare to fool round to find out what is going on in others. The Minister is quite convinced by the advice of the head of his Department that a proposal is absolutely necessary, and of' course it will go through unless'there is financial stringency such as exists now. In that case the - Institute may - not be extended very far, but in times of plenty it may grow and be found very expensive when lean times come again. By clause 14 power is given to the - Director to pay to successful discoverers or inventors working as officers of the Institute, or under the auspices of the Institute, such bonuses as the Governor General determines. It is quite right that an energetic officer who makes a valuable discovery should be fairly rewarded, but when thatreward is paid the discovery should become' the property of the Commonwealth Government. Some of the bounties which we prachave passed to assist industries have proved inadequate. Others have turned out fairly successful. Perhaps the most successful have been the iron and steel and wool tops bounties. We agreed to a bounty for the discovery of a phosphatic rock to turn into marketable artificial manure: Some of - the bounties would not tempt people to - take - up a new industry. A - bounty was' offered for flax, but very little flax wasproduced. I think more is being grown today on account of the high price. In fact, war conditions have brought about far more discoveries and new products in Australia 'than anything else. Some of the discoveries have been made by scientific men, and some by workmen engaged in the industries. The theorist has gone around and used the brains ol"" the employees. In many cases the men engaged in the industries have given the information to smarter men, who have reaped the advantage.",58
321,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,The Broken Hill people for the last twenty years have rewarded every man who has found them something new.,59
322,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"That is a good idea; the companies ought to pay. If an Institute like this is to be a success there must be complete harmony between the men at the head and the employees. It is all in embryo at the present time, and we do not know whether 10 or 100 or 1,000 men will be employed.",59
323,Mr BLUNDELL,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,It will not remain at ten very long.,59
324,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"The honourable member speaks out of a full knowledge of the ways of Departments. I do not think the Institute will be very prolific in advantages to the Commonwealth, to judge by the work done so far. The Bureau has been in existence now for some time - perhap s four and a half years, as Professor ' Masson says-althoug h the Bill has never been passed. Every year an amount has appeared on the Estimates for the purpose, rising to, I think, £30,000 in the last Estimates, of which nearly every penny was spent.",59
325,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"The vote last year was £14,000, of which £13,000 was spent.",59
326,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,We - are told that a lot of the work is honorary; but very often that sort of service costs a great deal more than skilled professional work.,59
327,Mr GREGORY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,A good deal has been spent in travelling expenses.,59
328,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,Where has been the need of travellingexpenses in connection with an. Institute that has never been formed ?,59
329,Mr GROOM,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,There has been a number of investigating committees doing advisory work.,59
330,Mr TUDOR,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"I should like to know where they have done it. What I am most concerned about is the type of man who is to be chosen as Director - . He should be a practical man, and not a theorist, if the people are to obtain the advantage which the Bill is designed to give them. If we do not see to that, we shall be throwing the money away. It would be - better to postpone consideration of the Bill unless we can obtain a definite statement from the Government as to the type of man they intend to appoint as Director. I am sorry that, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), who is responsible for the Bill, has not been in the best of health.lately, but we should hear before we embark on the spending of this money a definite statement on that point. After all, this is not a party measure. If the passage of this Bill can be postponed for a few years until some concrete scheme is laid before Parliament, by which time the Government may have decided upon the right type of man to place at the head of the Bureau, the best course will have been followed.",59
331,Mr RILEY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"South Sydney) [8.46] As a Labour man, I welcome the introduction of the Bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) pointed out directions in which the Bureau has been already at work. Those attached to it have been working in an honorary capacity for more than four years,' and have been carrying on in conjunct-ion with the various States, which are anxious for the establishment of the Bureau upon a sound basis, so that finality can be arrived at in regard to certain matters which have for some time claimed attention. One important thing, which the Bureau has been able to achieve is in regard to the standardization of iron and steel.' In that direction alone its establishment has been more than justified. ' Mr WATKINS - There is another side to that argument.",59
332,Mr RILEY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"The honourable member should know that if a man refuses to believe good of a thing there is no argument that will shake his views. The whole trend' of civilization today is to link up science more and more closely with industry, and the outcome has always been - to lighten the burden' of the worker. I have seen the effect of that during my own life-time in relation to the building industry, with which I have been concerned. The same illustration applies, for example, to boot manufacture. Machinery has completely revolutionized the boot - industry,' and one man today turns out as much work as did twenty formerly.",59

Throughout the into dustrial world science has proved - enormous factor for progress. The sailing ships have disappeared; science has revolutionized sea-going traffic.",60
335,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"If you are ing to make the industrial picture plete, you must admit that the bricklayer today handles 400 bricks where he used to lay 1,000.",60
336,Mr EILEY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"As the honourable memaltogether. ber knows, that has nothing to do with science. I invite his attention, rather, the linking up of science with agriculture. Science has come to the aid of the farmer, and today he can carry on ever so more cheaply and more easily than days when there was only the crudest machinery to help him. Despite all the great inventions and the tremendous adbe distinctly scientists. vance of the past few years,' we are but touching the fringe of scientific ploitation. This Government should not hesitate to spend money in the encouragedency ment of scientific research. At the prelook sent time the Bureau is studying the economic application of a 'by-product molasses to the creation of a motive spirit. Activities along this particular lino have practically come to a head, but the authoFederal rities are hampered by the lack of money in placing the discovery on the market. An attitude of ridicule or indifference respect to scientific research will not help the world along the path of progress. I Australia is to take her place among leading nations she must encourage linking up of science with our young inwhatever dustries. Here, for once, we can Germany. The German nation has taken a pride in encouraging scientific research and discovery. I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It is a subject which should be above party. With respect to detail, I would prefer to see the appointment of three directors rather than one. The selecwould tion of one man might mean that we would secure an excellent scientist in reBureau. lation to one particular interest; but there are hundreds of branches of scientific and we want to make the direct torate as broad as possible. It would be wiser to appoint three men of an allHowever, if the and Government deem it wise to choose one We director, I shall not oppose it. I hope n that, as an outcome of this legislation, a Board will be established which will call its aid the best men in every State, an thus creating one great and important old - body for the whole of Australia.",60
337,Mr GREGORY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Dampier) [8.55] - I do not offer opposition to the Bill, but am gosomewhat in disagreement with the honcomorable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) in his desire to bring about full political control over the working of the Bureau. We cannot get rid of political control So far as finance is concerned, we must control operations; but to it will be far wiser to appoint three directors than one, giving them the much ful l power of commissioners. One in the of the three should be a good sound practical man with scientific attainments, while the. other two should The tendency still in this Parliament has been to reexduce rather than enhance the powers of the States., In this measure that tenis not marked, but I cannot over the fact that members of this Chamber, generally, seem to have a natural of leaning towards ignoring State organizations, and securing the domination of control. If that should be the case with the Bureau, it cannot expect to become as valuable as it should be. As in for the theory of the honourable member for Yarra that if the director, or direcf tors, were given full power outside of the the Public Service Act to make appointments the to the Department, and to spend amount of money was copy deemed necessary, the cost would be altogether too great, it is a very good thing that those who are to be in charge should he able to make appointments. Then, if they - can see that they have made an unsuitable selection, they can get rid of the officer concerned, and endeavour to replace him with a worthy man. It be impossible under this Bill to provide a fixed sum for the cost of the Probably it would cost comparatively little at its initiation. It will be the duty of Parliament to watch its growth, and to see that, the Commonwealth - is getting full value for whatever money may be expended'. To say, for example, by inserting a clause in the Bill , that the Bureau should not cost more than £30,000, would be almost tantamount to.a'n invitation to spend up to that amount per annum. We should record our objection to money having been expended on the Institute, year after year, without parliamentary authority. I have always objected to any Government spending public money without the authorization of Parliament. I hope the Government will appoint three directors instead of one. These officers must be,' to a certain extent, under the control of the Minister, and, thus, of Parliament. But I want some assurance that the Government will do all that is possible to work hand in hand with the various States in the matter of research. The Minister should have power under this - measure to appoint advisory committees in every State.  mitting the Minister, that that is his in tention.",60
338,Mr GREGORY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Mr Kingsmill, a member of the Western Australian Parliament,' is now in Melbourne as a member of, the Advisory Board in Western Australia, and I have been discussing the matter with him. He has informed me of the magnificent work done by the Board in Western Australia in connection with forestry research during the past few years. They have received very great assistance from the State Government and outside individuals. The State Government expended a large sum of money in connection with a laboratory, and has given a grant of land worth £20,000 for this special work. Recently the Board' felt that there was a possibility of utilizing local timbers for the manufacture of paper-pulp, and approached several of the principal printing nouses in Perth on the subject, with the result that they subscribed a grant of £500 for research work. Surely the same kind of work can be done in the other States, and if , say, in Queensland, special investigations carried out by the State Advisory Board, under the control of the Commonwealth Director, were successful, the results would become the property of the Commonwealth in stead of any individual State, and thus prove invaluable to Australian produc[118] tions. I ' f in d that there is no provision in the Bill to indicate under which Department the Act will be administered. Mr RICHAHD. FOSTER , - At present it is under the Customs Department. :",61
339,Mr GREGORY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Yes , but very often a change of Government means a change in departmental administration, frequently with the object of more equally distributing the work among Ministers. Mr HI CHARD FOSTER - If this In s t itute is to justify its existence it will require .more than the fag-end of a Minister's attention.",61
340,Mr GREGORY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"I think an amendment should be inserted in the Bill to insure that the Institute shall be controlled by one particular Department for some time, because then the permanent head will be able to keep in close touch with all that is being done, and so insure more efficient administration.",61
341,Mr FENTON,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Maribyrnong) [9.7] I was somewhat astonished at the concluding remark of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley), who said in effect that if the Institute were established any person of an inventive turn of mind would be able to have his proposals elaborated and perfected. I remind the honourable member that we are.not absolutely destitute of such facilities already, for in - Mr Wilkinson, whose laboratory is situated at .the rear of the Customs Office, we have a gentleman who is always ready to render assistance to anybody with a decent idea worth consideration. It is his complaint that hitherto his Department has been, somewhat neglected: In addition, we have in practically every State of the Commonwealth universities, technical schools, schoolsof mines, agricultural colleges, and such - institutions. I do. not know of any branch of primary or secondary industry that is not in some respect catered for, and, so far.as I can see, this proposed Institute will simply be a duplication ofexisting State institutions. One of the most important items of discussion at the Premiers' Conference which recently concluded its sittings in Melbourne, was a proposal to have one tax-gatherer and one form of return for the Commonwealth, and I understand some good result will be the outcome of the deliberations, so that probably next year tax-' payers will be required to make up only. one return, and pay one tax-gatherer in stead of two, as at present. This will mean the saving of thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money, and do away with a lot of inconvenience. Why, therefore, should we now be called upon to consider a measure which will mean, duplication of existing services? proposed Institute will cost a"" great deal of money, whether we appoint one, or three, directors. A leading member of the Country party has given the scheme his endorsement. The measure has been watered down considerably, and some of the objections raised by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) have been met; but although the pill has been sugar-coated, its effect wi:l be the same. Once an opportunity is allowed any person to establish a Department, it grows and eventually becomes a most expensive concern. In my opinion, if any member of the Economy party sanctions expenditure on this In stitute, he is a very poor economist indeed.",61
342,Mr RILEY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,Do you not think it sible that the Institute will save the country a great deal of money eventually ?,62
343,Mr FENTON,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"No . It has been very expensive up to the present, and has rendered next to nothing in the way of services. When one looks at the list of men who have done most for our more important industries, one looks in vain for the names of trained scientific men. They may be good in theory, and able to deliver interesting lectures to students ; but when the acid of a practical test is applied to them they are, very often, found wanting. Although these manufacturers have done well for themselves through their inventions, they have also conferred great good upon the community. I may mention one who happens to be an elector of mine, but is, nevertheless, a strong political opponent: Mr H . V . MCKay, the inventor of the combined harvester. He is not a graduate of any scientific school. far as I know, he made a very humble beginning as a farmer, but undoubtedlv is a man with a touch of genius. And he has been reminded that some of the most important improvements to his combined harvester have been made, not by trained scientists, but by farmers' sons. I may refer, also, to the achievement of a well-known South Australian manufacturing firm, Hume Brothers, who have perfected what is known as the reinforced concrete pipe. This, again, is the product of a practical, and not a scientific, man. Mr Hume has evolved a pipe that has been put to varied uses in every part of the Commonwealth. Indeed, it This is being universally used now in South Africa , Great Britain , America, and other parts of the world. It is displacing cast-iron pipes in many water schemes and in Queensland, where recently great - difficulties were encountered when boring for water owing to d r if t sand, the authorities are now using great reinforced concrete cylinders, 8 feet in diameter, in order to overcome the trouble. These pipes are also being used in connection with many domestic water supply schemes. At the outbreak of the war, I strongly advocated the encouragement of chemical research. In many directions industry has been revolutionized in Germany as a result of discoveries made by chemists. One of the most serious obstacles in the way of the progress of manufactures and pos- industry generally in Australia is the lack of commercial chemists. In Germany, thousands of such men have been employed by private enterprise, and have made many valuable discoveries. It often happens that an analytical chemist in the course of his experiments makes a. more valuable discovery than that on which he was bent. Reference has been made to what has been done by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. It s chemists and other experts, many of them intensely practical men, have done many wonderful things in regard, not only to the main product, but many of the by-products of the Broken Hill mines. I fail to see in what respect the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry will benefit Australia.",62
344,Mr RILEY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,Will it retard the progress of industry in Australia?,62
345,Mr FENTON,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"The point is that the same taxpayers that are paying for our So State experts will have to pay for this Institute. We have a large number of experts in all the State Departments. Why should we add to the national expenditure by multiplying them in this way? Members of the Country party will agree with me that in Victoria we have no better wheat expert than Mr . Richardson, who is associated with the Department of Agriculture.",62

I have been recently in touch with the Agricultural Departments of New South W!ale3, South Australia, and Victoria, and have found that they are able to supply excellent information as to the purposes for which various areas are best suited. I am not going to say that the establishment of this Institute will lead to no improvement, but I certainly do not think it will improve very much upon the work now being done by the State experts. It must result in a considerable increase in Commonwealth expenditure. I do not think we should be expected to do more than obtain a little extra plant and a few additional appliances, and place them under the control of either one or two Universities, or the present Federal Analyst. I shall certainly vote against the second reading of this Bill , because I see no necessity for the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry at the present time. Various arguments have been advanced as to the class of man to be appointed as Director. He will have to possess considerable organizing capacity. If he is to f ill the bill he will need to be a man of scientific attainment-on e of those splendid men who are few and far-between.",63
347,Mr RILEY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"If we could find such a man, the honourable member would not agree to his employment by the Commonwealth, since he is opposed to this Bill .",63
348,Mr FENTON,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"We could employ such a man in the Commonwealth laboratory, without incurring the expense attaching to the creation of a new Department. There is no reason why we should not call to our aid some of the best experts, but to do so it is not necessary to create this Institute. Minister responsible for it will have various branches to engage his attention, and instead of his controlling the Director the Director will control him . The Minister will not be able to keep the expenditure of the Institute within reasonable bounds. Everyone that at the present time taxpayers are groaning under the load of taxation, and public expenditure, which they have [118]- 2 Pye. to bear. The Government which appointed a Commission to deal with the whole ramifications of the Commonwealth expenditure, with the object of suggesting economies, now asks us to agree to this additional expenditure. I do not wish to assume a dictatorial attitude, but I remind honourable members that, in supporting this Bill , they will vote for a considerable increase in our expenditure, and that the results accruing from it will not be worthwhile. We have the Hawkesbury College, in New South Wales, and the Dookie College and various experimental stations in Victoria and other States, all engaged upon matters relating to primary production. Coming to the secondary industries, we find that Victoria is dotted with technical schools. A boy on leaving the State school may go to one of the many technical schools and acquire much information in regard to primary and secondary industries. If he wishes to forge still further ahead, he may go finally to one of our Universities. W it h all these opportunities offering, surelyi t is not worthwhile overlapping the work of the States by the establishment of this Institute!",63

It is true that we have'in Australia the blowfly pest, the prickly pear, and' many other pestsy but while we are afflicted in one direction, other countries are afflicted in many others.

352,Mr FENTON,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"That Government is doing very well. The Premiers' Conference, which has just concluded its sittings, would have been well advised had The it told the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) that already the people of Australia are well catered for by the existing State institutions. If we take into consideration our technical schools, our schools of mines and agriculture, our colleges and Universities knows Mr GREGORY - And our kindergarten!",63
353,Mr FENTON,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"The honourable member is still at the kindergarten! stage, and I shall leave him to deal with that matter. Roughly speaking, these various institution tions must cost the people over £500,000 per annum. Shall we add to their utilit y by superimposing upon them this Institute of Science and Industry ?",63
354,Mr RODGERS,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"No one will object the expenditure if it is devoted to search in relation to agriculture and plant life of the Commonwea'th. If the money is to be - swallowed up in the purhence chase of machinery and in dealing with secondary matters waste will occur. Mr - FENTON - I do not take the honourable member's interruptions seriously, since I know that he has a great admiration for the secondary industries of Australia. They play a very promiMaribyrnong (Mr Fenton). nent part in the development of our primary industries, and the two must go hand in hand. My objection, to the establishment of this new Institute will , I fear, be of avail.

It has been, watered down to the measure. meet the strong criticism levelled at the original Bill , and it means, practically, given to scientific research. that we are to appoint one expert, and be dependent to a very considerable upon the existing State, institutions.",64

363,Mr CORSER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"There are very few institucountries in the' world which offer a field for the investigations of a Bureau of this kind than does Australia. We are some 12,000 miles from the principal centres of the world, and we resuch' an institution as is provided , for under this Bill to keep us in touch with the results of scientific research in other parts of the world - This great continent is capable of sustaining a larger population than is the United any States of America. The area of Australia is greater 'than the' area of the States of America, and its undeveloped'- resources., are equal, if not supe: rior, to those of America-. It is probably more to oiir' interest than to the interest ""of any other people in"" the world that we should be brought .into touch as rapidly 'as possible with-the latest developments of science. Of what-use is it to establish industries on wrong premises ? We should Bfe up to date in-all 'these matters. If we can be made'so by the expenditure of a'few.tens of thousands of pounds, the money'will be,well expended. *. We .have been told that by this Bill we-shall-be duplicating our institutions for scientific research; but similar institutions in. every State areco-operating with the Commonwealth in this, regard, and are, in favour of the. establishment of the,proposed Federal Bureau.",64
364,Mr RYAN,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Is it true, as we read in the? A'ge', that 'scientists' have 'discovered a - new method of baking bread which issue hp s slower than the old method? ur *' Mr CORSER - I have not had much experience of baking, and perhaps the honourable member is in a better-position to'-answer his question . himself.. It is especially necessary - in this-, country that w'e'-should establish new industries, and should safeguardthose : we> have established - i . . To-day One' of the principal obstacles .to settlement in many 'parts ofQueensland is the rapid spread>'o£ the prickly, ipear. We have in that State 419,000,000' acres of 'land;'of-.whifeh'^uite:4O0,'00Oi;000 acres are still unalienated!- Upon..the best 'information we'can obtain, it. isestimated that at least 1,000,000 acres'of land in Queensland'."" is - being - infested with the prickly' pearevery'year - Many attempts have beeh'made.'to destroy the pest, but, ; so far,'the-only - really successful means of dealing with - it is by close settlement. - With so sparse a population covering such an enormous area, it is unfortunately not possible to do very much '-in that way -' Before the war a company formed, I think, in Melbourne entered into an arrangement with the Queensland Government by which they were - to be given 100,000 acres of land, provided they cleared it of prickly pear, and kept it clear of the pest. means this company proposed for the destruction of ' the prickly pear was the application of a gas. Two expert - chemists, from 'Germany were employed by the company)-and .'their operations'at Dulacca- - were eminently successful - : As soon as the war was spoken-of,- these twoexperts cleared out of Australia. The company tried to carry on' the - destruction of the pear by the application of a gas which they mistakenly assumed was similar to that manufactured by the German scientific experts; but they largely failed in the experiments they made. As the' experts at first employed were successful, it should be possible to discover the exact nature, of the gas they applied, and such a discovery would alone be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds .to Australia. ' Before long the Commonwealth, and more especially Queensland, will have to undertake the. establishment of the cotton-growing industry. I can go back to the time of the Civil War in the United' States v of America; when it '.was - found necessary that some attempt should' be made to grow cptton in this country. Cotton was grown here successfully"" at the. time.. I know of many, plantations - in' Queensland upon which it was profitably grown; but when the American Civil War had.terminated those engaged, in. growing'cotton in Queensland could - not continue in competition with the coloured'labour in the industry in the 'United States of America. 1 the price of cotton has' gone up to such an extent)- and the cost of its production elsewhere' so nearly - equals .the cost 'of-its production'by white labour in 1 Australia, that I believe there is a"" great : future for; the cotton-growing-industry? in Queensland. . Many ..people, are growing cotton there now: To give' honourable member's some. idea of the i extent .to which cotton was grown in that State fifty , years agio, - I . recently - took up a Brisbane Courier, of the 2nd July, in which it was stated that fifty years ago a large sailing vessel, named the Maryborough, left Queensland for London half , full of cotton, the balance of her cargo being tallow. Many people are now going in for the cotton-growing iudustry, and it has been proved up to the hilt that it can be grown there profitably - One of the problems to be solved in connection with the industry is the discovery of an effective machine for picking cotton. Some means must be discovered which The will save labour in the picking of the cotton. The requisite machinery for the purpose has heen developed up to a certain stage, and it - is hoped that before Long an effective machine will be available. The best method ,of dealing with the tick pest is a matter which must be the subject of scientific research. science is brought to bear upon the solu-_ tion of this problem very grievous errors may be committed. I have heard cattle growers, and amongsb them very capable men, advocating as a means of dealing with the tick pest that certain areas of country should, be completely cleared of ticks. l,have heard others, equally capable, say that that is the worse thing that oould possibly be done - They urge the continuance of dipping, which is the present means adopted to keep down the pest, because they say that only cattle reared in tick-infested country become gradually immune to tick fever, and continue to be immune while the country has a few ticks, and that it would only lead to the spread of the disease if portions of the country were absolutely cleared of ticks in close proximity to tick-infested country. This is a question which should be taken up and finalized by a Bureau of the kind to be established under this Bill. Another pest with which we have to contend is the fruit fly. So far we have not been very successful in dealing with it, and as we are starting a large number of returned soldiers on orchards in Queensland it is to be hoped that nothing will be left undone to effectively deal with this pest in the interests of these returned men. I have dealt with the necessity for coping with the advance of the prickly pear, and it might be as well to mention that no less than 23,000,000 acres of good land in Queensland is infested with this pest, and the Government of the State are only too pleased to part with the land for next to nothing to persons who will undertake to eradicate the pear upon it. I have already said', in reply to objections by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) that State institutions of this kind desire that this Bill shall be passed, and are ready to co-operate with the Federal Bureau. I know that the Australian Industrialists Association of Queensland have written very stronglv in favour of the establishment of a Federal Bureau, and urging the' passage of this measure. Their only objection to it would appear to be that sufficient provision is not made for consultation with scientists in the different States, but that Mr Corser. is a difficulty which might he easily overcome. Unless Mr GROOM - The Minister is willing to constitute Advisory Committees in the different States.",65
365,Mr CORSER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"That will meet the only objection raised to this Bill by the association to which I have referred. I suppose that there is no country in the world which possesses a greater variety of minerals than is to be found in Australia, We know very little about some of these minerals, or how to treat them, and we require to have information as to the way in which they are treated in other parts of the world. We can look to a Bureau of this kind to secure that information for us.",66
366,Mr FENTON,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"Hav e we not led the world in some things, and can we not do so again ?",66
367,Mr CORSER,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"We have led the world in some ways, and the world may lead us in other ways. Each should profit by the experience of the other. Mercantile men who believe that it is possible to gain further information of advantage to their concerns do not sit down and say, "" We are satisfied with the things of today,"" but despatch men of ability to other parts- of the world to acquire it. It is this which leads to their success, and the methods they apply ought also to be applied to the industries which, when the Tariff is passed, we hope to have firmly established in Australia. These concerns will Tequire the most up-to-date machinery, and the assistance which an Institute of Science and Industry can provide for them will most certainly be welcomed by them. We are told that the States are co-operating in every way with the Federal Institute, and that they are most anxious to see the latter placed upon a firm and up-to-date ' basis. I have no word to say in detriment of what the States are doing in this direction, but I claim that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to furnish the money for a central Institute which will keep in full touch with the State Bureaux and supplement their work. Now that the Bill is before the House, T hope that honourable members will realise the necessity for it and feel the responsibility that is cast upon them.",66
368,Mr HAY,MOBILIZATION AND VEHICLE,"New England) [9.48] - I approach the subject covered by this Bill with all the seriousness it involves. We must realise the hearing that science or knowledge will have on our future undertakings, because if knowledge is not applied to production, which alone, we are told, can enable us to meet our obligations, there will not be much prospect of our solving the grave situation confronting us. I do not care whether the word ""-science,"" which seems to terrify a great many people, is applied. I prefer the words "" better methods."" Australia is twenty-five years behind those countries which have applied science to their undertakings. As a poet has saidEye to eye all order festers; M l things here are out of joint, Science moves but slowly, slowly, Creeping .on from point to point. Those who seek to apply knowledge to our undertakings we at first doubt, then tolerate, and then accept. However, as it is applied in Australia today, the process is too slow. We can only make this a great country and fill its great spaces by the application of knowledge, thus magnifying our undertakings which alone will serve to attract the population we need. No country in the world is better provided with the gifts of nature. No country is more dependent on what nature has given, and does less for itself. For many years I have had the great privilege, and, at the same time, the great responsibility-for there is no greater responsibility than the sacred task of dealing with human nature-of having under'my keeping, at it were, as many as 400 tenant farmers, 95 per cent, of whom I eventually made their own freeholders. To-day they are the most prosperous men in New South Wales. This result was achieved because for years I have been successful in my endeavour to get them to apply the very best knowledge and the most up-to-date methods to their undertakings. associated with many - of these men from the very beginning of things-the clearing of the land, the fencing aud housing, the financing, and so on to the end, until the tenant farmer became a prosperous freeholder. Twenty years ago I visited Denmark in order to ascertain the methods adopted there which made those engaged in primary production a prosperous people, and I had their methods applied by those whom I was controlling. Thus it was that I was the first person in New South Wales to apply the methods adopted in Denmark in the manufacture of dairy products. I introduced the system of pasteurization. The knowledge gained in this way was not confined to our tenants alone. All who could might enter; none were denied the privilege of the knowledge we gave them. As a result of the application of this tknowledge our farmers were able to get for their produce £5 per ton more on the local market and £10 ""more in London, and had that principle of knowledge been applied universally in the State of New South Wales, the dairy section of our producers would not have lost about £5,000,000, which, according to Mr Knibbs' statistics of production, would about represent the difference between the price realized and what would have been gained by them had science been applied to their efforts. After .many years of endeavour to have science applied to industry, it is a matter of sorrow for me to note the indifference of our people towards the adoption of better methods. I shall give a little instance of my effort to have science applied to production. The late David Berry, of the South Coast in New South Wales, in his will bequeathed the sum of £100,000 for a hospital in the district in which he lived. But the area benefiting by the bequest was so circumscribed that the income from the trust was more than the local conditions could absorb, and in order that the district should benefit in another direction, I , as trustee for the bequest, had a Bill passed through the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1906. While providing - in the Bill for those who were sick and dying, I thought it right that the surplus income should be applied to those who were to be the future producers I was of our country. I believe it is the only instance-at any rate, in New South Wales-whereb y a will has ever been altered by an Act of Parliament. The Bill provided that the income not required for hospital purposes should be used for technical and agricultural colleges, and for the promotion of agricultural and veterinary science. The primary producers of Australia suffer more than any others, as they have - to contend with pests, blights, and bugs, as they are called in America; but they suffer more from legislation. engaged in producing sliould not be placed on the same basis as tbose employed in the ordinary affairs of ' life. They have to pay taxation on all .they require, and, - in addition, are heavily taxed on the implements used in produc tion. .The farmers of Australia must be regarded'. as. individuals - who ' w o r k merely to produce cheap ""food for those who require it . The farmer.of the future must stand on his dignity and seek knowledge,; which, is. the greatest steset of A-person may lose, his moheyj'-but he never lpses knowledge., - The childrenof those engaged in primary - undertakings, particularly 'in a small way, 'do.. not acquire the.information that the children of the industrialists. in the city acquire. The 'artisans' in Melbourne; or ""'in -'any other large - centre, 'can' send .their children, from, the State, schools to the highest seat of learning; but the children of - the men on the land have to submit to conditions which do not permit them to obtain that instruction which is absolutely'neoeasary for their future success - Unless"" .he is-a prosperous settler,-which'is not'joften the case,; hi's children have riot the 'privileges-of; attending the large educational institutions ,in the cities that are open to .the children of city workers. The natural result - is - that, when the average boy reaches ,-the . age when he-begins to-think for himself, he. realizes that his'.'prospects in the cities are brighter. The - children of settlers d r if t . towards . the populous centres, and the parents follow to .look after them i At present jbhere are only - three, classes of. settler^ who can live on the .land, and prosper, and-these comprise-the man'with special knowledge, the one who inherits his property free of debt, and the one with a large family, who is prepared to stay on his holding and work for .nothing. These are the people.' to whom we are looking to relieve iis from our present position. Are we goingto shirk our responsibilities to ""'them? - 'THis is . one. of the ' most ""important measures that has ever .been' presented to the * Pedera'-l.

It is an - undeniable fact-it is not-'causedby the war; but the fact remains-that the producers of Australia are growing stale ""oil the job. Twenty-five years"" ago"" "" Mr J . ' ""3"".

This statement roused the nation - into activity. We cannot close our' eyes to the fact that-we are' approaching - a similar crisis,, but nothing is being done by ""legislation to > encourageproduction'. The, Bill in'its'present',form is a bowelless'measure."" ' When I visited the .Wisconsin University, I inquired into the best' methods of., stimulating production and of making the. work of those engaged in. the in'dustry attractive?''The activities foreshadowed in the Bill'should not coine into conflict with undertakings by agricultural colleges of the States: I believe it is the intention and desire, 'of the Government to provide for co-operation with the different States, and to harmonize their work in every direction. I have had the opportunity of discussing this question with men associated with our agricultural col1 leges, an'd from my conversations with competent authorities I have gathered .'that they would; hail a measure such as ""this with delight.! - If ' the Government are'not prepared to confer with State ^educational authorities 'the measure is doomed to failure - I do not think, however,: that I will join .'forces '.with.the honourable member for: Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) unless ""be is prepared. W change his views. In the.

They each receive an annual 'remuneration of .£4.00,,'and are provided with automobiles., "" To defray, the 'annual' expenditure'the farmers'* con tribute '£200 , the State authorities £ 1 0 0 , and the Federal Government .£100'.: j The-difficulty we experience, in Australia is 'that men who are engaged to. perform; similar. work are only half qualified, and the ordinary man knows by experience more than the man so circumstanced. That is one - reason why scientific methods have not ' been adopted. The graduates employed in the State of Wisconsin commence - with the soil and advising the proper methods of cultivation. They also recommend as to- ^selection of seed, methods of harvesting,- _ transport, and marketing. The intrusion of these officers was resented at first,- but-'later there wasan outcry when 'they were not on the job.

I hope that the stores will be divided, and that a good portion of them will be transferred to the shipbuilding yards at Williams- town, and that in the end no detriment to Williamstown will result. As to the the shipbuilding section at Williamstown, the position is that, notwithstanding that there is a huge shipbuilding yard at that port, the Navy is building boats for the variouB Departments. The question of whether or not the boats are being well built is immaterial. The outstanding fact is that, although an expensive and well-equipped shipbuilding yard is right alongside, the Navy Department is busying itself with the building of small ships for the Departments. Surely the big shipyards can undertake that work quite as well as can the Navy. Tho present practice involves an unjustifiable duplication of public expenditure which must be stopped at the earliest possible moment.

The Postal Department should endeavour to expedite the delivery of these mails, because even in ordinary times there is great delay in the transit of mails to the back country.
