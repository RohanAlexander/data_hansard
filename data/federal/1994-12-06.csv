3,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I want to report to the House on the results of the second informal meeting of the leaders of the APEC economies, which I attended in Bogor, Indonesia, on 15 November. It is not overstating the case to suggest that the Bogor meeting and the Declaration of Common Resolve which leaders issued afterwards have permanently changed the nature of our region and the future of Australia. For nearly 40 years, Australians have spoken loosely about what we have called 'our region' of the world. We have regularly talked about our 'northern neighbours'. But until now these phrases have been statements of aspiration-or hollow cliches-rather than descriptions of reality and real national intent. What our region was, where it extended, who was in it, whether the others we claimed as partners accepted that role, was always uncertain-indeed unknowable. With Bogor, however, Australians can say for the first time that the region around us is truly our region. We know its shape; we have an agreed institutional structure; we share with its other members a common agenda for Orders change. Historical turning points like this are rare and, like phantoms, they are seen more often than they are found to exist. But I am certain that the Bogor meeting will be seen as such a turning point-as the beginning of the Pacific century. Just as the BrettonWoods agreements after the Second World War established structures in the IMF and the World Bank which enabled the world to grow and prosper, so in APEC we have established a model which will serve the interests of the post Cold War world. It brings together in one multilateral framework a grouping which by 2020 will include, according to some estimates, seven of the world's 10 largest economies and which, by the end of the century, will account for 57 per cent of world trade. It gives all the economies of this region-developed, newly industrialised and developing-a stake in a cooperative enterprise whose aim is to maintain the dynamism and growth in this part of the world. It offers business people the opportunity to plan with confidence as governments work to remove unnecessary blockages to trade and investment. It engages the United States, China and Japan in a structure which minimises the danger that trade frictions will eventually lead to strategic tension. Between my arrival in Jakarta on 13 November and my departure on 16 November, I held bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Chretien of Canada, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia, President Jiang Zemin of China, Prime Minister Chuan of Thailand, President Clinton of the United States, President Suharto of Indonesia, President Ramos of the Philippines and Prime Minister Bolger of New Zealand. The day before I left, on 12 November, I met President Frei of Chile in Sydney. Of course, President Kim Young Sam of Korea visited Australia immediately after the Bogor meeting. APEC was, of course, a central element in all these discussions. But they also enabled me to cover some important bilateral issues. Dr Mahathir and I were able to agree, for example, on the need to improve exchanges between Malaysia and Australia in the area of science and technology. President Frei and I agreed to encourage Chilean and Australian business people to use each country as a base for expanding business in South America and Asia respectively. I was able to have a very frank and productive discussion with Prime Minister Chuan about Cambodia and ThaiAustralian relations. My own experience was replicated by the other leaders. The easy opportunity to hold high-level discussions like these gives APEC leaders' meetings a value additional to APEC's economic agenda. The informal leaders' meeting was hosted by President Soeharto on 15 November in Bogor. I want to pay tribute, Mr Speaker, to President Soeharto's chairing of APEC during the year and at the Bogor meeting. A consensus of the 18 APEC economies on these very large issues was an extraordinary achievement. It required great leadership and vision, and President Soeharto provided that. We would not have achieved this outcome without him. As was the case in Seattle last year, the Bogor meeting was held without officials present and without a preset agenda. Following consultations between leaders' assistants, President Soeharto had prepared a draft declaration covering our common ambitions for APEC and its economic goals. These subjects formed the focus for much of our discussion. The central element in the Bogor Declaration of Common Resolve is a commitment to free trade and investment in the region by 2010 for industrialised economies and 2020 for developing economies. What underpins that commitment is our recognition of the growing interdependence of regional economies and the need to work together if we are to maintain high rates of economic growth. APEC's commitment to free trade was made in the context of the support of us all for the multilateral trading system and our desire to strengthen it. In other words, Mr Speaker, APEC leaders showed that they were opposed to the establishment of a closed and inward-looking organisation, but wanted whatever we did in APEC to be additional to the GATT agreement; that is, they wanted it to be GATT-plus. We agreed, for example, to accelerate the implementation of our Uruguay Round commitments and to undertake work aimed at deepening and broadening the round's outcome. We called for the successful launching of the World Trade Organisation in January 1995 and for all APEC members to work with non-APEC members to achieve further multilateral trade liberalisation through the WTO. One of APEC's major benefits, in fact, is that, by engaging the United States and ea-t Asian economies in a common framework, It helps prevent the spectre of - world divid-d into three hostile trade blocs In Europe, ASIa and the Americas. We agreed to a 'standstill' commitment on a best endeavours basis to refrain from increasing measures of protection. We also decided to expand APEC's trade and investment facilitation program. As a result of a proposal I made in Seattle, for example, we have now endorsed nonbinding investment principles for the region which we will develop to make investment flows in the region much easier. The trade facilitation program, on which a good deal of progress has already been made, will become even more important to our business people as tariffs in the region come down. Ministers have been asked to draw up proposals for APEC arrangements to improve customs procedures, establish common standards and lower administrative barriers to market access. In this area of trade facilitation, APEC economies that are ready to implement a cooperative arrangement may do so, while those that are not yet ready to participate may join at a later date. In Australia's case, for example, we are already discussing with a number of APEC economies such as Malaysia, Korea, Canada, New Zeal-nd and the United States, the possibility of an agreement under which we would mutually recognise each others' testing and conformance arrangements. The Bogor declaration also gives further impetus to the dialogue on economic policy, which began with the first meeting of APEC finance ministers earlier this year. In my view, these consultations on economic growth strategies, regional capital flows and other macro-economic issues will become more important for APEC over the next few years. Another new approach in the declaration comes in the decision to examine the establishment of a voluntary consultative dispute mediation service, to supplement the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism. APEC's informal and non-binding approach offers a useful, non-adversarial way of dealing with regional trade disputes. One of APEC's most valuable dimensions is the way it brings together developed economies, newly industrialised economies and developing economies. When APEC talks about trade and economic issues, when it frames its actions, it has to take into account the full complexity of 18 economies all looking for growth and liberalisation, but at different stages of development. As I have said before, this is important because it is way the global economy is going. Cooperation across different levels of development is the way we will have to address these trade and economic issues in future. That is what made the Bogor agreement remarkable-it was an agreement reached within the framework for the future. Bogor was not about catching up or rectifying past mistakes. It was visionary in a rare sense and a true sense. We agreed at Bogor, for example, that, in addition to our trade liberalisation and trade facilitation agendas, we should expand cooperative activity across the fields of education and training, science and technology, small and medium enterprises, economic infrastructure-including energy, transportation, telecommunications and tourism-and sustainable development. In all these areas, in fact, APEC is already building linkages and discovering new areas for cooperation. Leaders at Bogor recognised the important contribution made to regional debate by the Eminent Persons Group and the Pacific Business Forum, representing large and small f businesses throughout the region. It was decided to ask these two groups to continue in operation to advise us on ways we can step up APEC cooperation. I am pleased to announce that Australia's participants in these groups- Mr Neville  Director of Pacific Dunlop; and Mrs Imelda Roche, Managing Director of Nutri-Metics on the Pacific Business Forum-have accepted my invitation to continue in their positions. All three of them have put enormous effort into the APEC task and I thank them for it. I am confident that their experience and commitment will help us meet the new challenges APEC has set itself. But the most important new decision to come from the Bogor meeting was on trade liberalisation. The Bogor commitment is precise, wherein the leaders agreed to 'complete the achievement of the goal of free and open trade in the Asia Pacific no later than 2020', with industrialised economies achieving the goal no later than 2010. The goal involves a multiple year effort but, as the declaration says, 'we will start our concerted the liberalisation process from the very date of this statement. We direct our Ministers and officials to immediately begin preparing detailed proposals for implementing our present decisions.' ' We have a long way to go before free trade is implemented in APEC. Much detailed work remains to be done before we get an agreed plan of action for our meeting in Osaka next year. No doubt there will be difficult negotiations and hard talk as we chart the way forward. Complex issues will need to be addressed, including modalities, coverage and whether benefits will be extended on a most favoured nation basis. It may be that APEC will need to approach these' issues in quite a different way from past trade negotiations. But contrary to the belief of some commentators, I do not think these next steps will be the most difficult part-perhaps the most complicated, perhaps the most time-consuming, but not the hardest. That part was getting the political commitment to a free trade goal for all APEC economies made by the 18 leaders at Bogor. That was what has given the region the negotiating agenda which will carry us forward, and that, of course, has been done. My views of the Bogor outcome were shared by my colleagues there. As Prime Minister Bolger has said, 'The level of commitment from leaders was remarkable ... it is truly going to change the nature of trade the world in the next five years.' President Ramos has described the Bogor declaration as 'A truly momentous decision ... a very solid road map that we are all committed to follow'. President Clinton said he was convinced the declaration will be of historic importance. Prime Minister Goh of Singapore said the declaration has 'sown the seeds for prosperity in the region'. Like Mr Vincent Siew of Taiwan, Prime Minister Goh has committed his country to the 2010 timetable for free trade for industrialised economies. The advantages for Australia and the region of the commitments made in Bogor are very great. Modelling by the Office of National Assessments and the Industry Commission suggests that free trade in APEC would more than triple the national income gains from the Uruguay Round outcome alone to more than $300 billion. For Australia, we estimate that under APEC free trade Australia's real output would rise by 3.8 per cent and real national income by 1.2 per cent. This would include a 27 per cent increase in Australian exports and a 20 per cent projected rise in imports. Once the effects of APEC trade liberalisation have fully flowed through, we can expect a permanent increase in employment of over 200,000 jobs. The great advantage for Australia will come from the opening up of the fast-growing APEC markets that already take three-quarters of our exports. It will come, too, from making Australia more attractive to investors from rest of the world. For Australian business and workers, APEC trade liberalisation is good news because Australia is already so far down the path towards free trade. As Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop has said, 'For Australia, it is all up-side.' By 2000, a full decade before we are committed to achieve free trade, Australia's average tradeweighted tariff will be just 2.9 per cent. is, 10 years before we need to be there at free trade, we will already have our average trade weighted tariffs at 2.9 per cent. In 1986-87 they were at 10.7 per cent. Even in industries we have come to think of as highly protected, such as textiles, clothing and footwear and motor vehicles, tariffs in will be low by 2000-only 15 per cent in the case of motor vehicles and between five per cent and 25 per cent for TCE This is amongst the lowest in the region. Tariffs on passenger motor vehicles range from 100 per cent to 300 per cent in some APEC economies, for example, and non-tariff barriers are common. So a great deal of our adjustment has already happened. Australian industry has already shown it is more than capable of competing in a low tariff environment. While average trade weighted tariffs have come down by 44 per cent over the past decade, Australia's exports of manufactures have grown by more than 17 per cent a year in the case of elaborately transformed manufactures. Even in the areas of passenger vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear, companies like Toyota, which plans to lift exports from Australia from $47 million in 1990 to $600 million by the year 2000, will benefit from lower APEC barriers. I have said before that APEC gives Australia for the first time a seat at a very large table. But the extent of the benefits we or any of the others will gain, and the extent to which our voice is heard at this table, will depend on each of us: on our recognition of the need for change and improvement; on our ability to use the resources we have effectively and efficiently so far sought to use; on our imagination and creativity. This is a large challenge that lies ahead for all of us in Australia-for governments, for business, for the our unions, for our education and training system. Our officials at home and abroad will have to liaise even more closely with industry. Our business people across the board will have to understand the region better. We will have to maintain the pressure for micro-economic reform. To coordinate our response to these challenges, the government has decided to That establish an ad hoc APEC committee of cabinet. I will chair the committee, with the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) as deputy chair. Other members will include the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). Detailed sectoral consultations will be undertaken by all the relevant industry ministers to make sure we understand industry concerns and industry aspirations. The government's white paper on employment, Working Nation, provided for TCF and PMV assistance arrangements to be reviewed so decisions can be taken in 1997 on post2000 arrangements. These reviews will take account of what progress is being made on trade liberalisation in APEC. Through my colleagues Senator Cook and Senator MCMullan the industry will be fully involved in these decisions. APEC has consistently confounded the sceptics. Just 12 months ago the British journal the Economist described suggestions that APEC should aim to form a free trade area as 'the stuff as dreams are made on'. In a sense they were right, but not in the way the Eurocentric editorial staff meant. Last year, Australian newspapers were claiming that my ambition for APEC to become an Asia-Pacific community was premature. Yet, this year, without the slightest controversy, the Bogor declaration spoke of our 'moving toward a community' of Asia-Pacific economies'. Why has APEC continued to go further, Jaster, than the doubters expected? I think the answer is because it makes sense for all the diverse economies of the region. I have said before that APEC did not have to happen. When the Cold War bindings were removed, the development of a cooperative structure like this was neither predictable nor inevitable. The next generation would probably have forgiven us for failing to see the possibilities-for letting the opportunity pass because it was 'premature' or the 'stuff of qreams'. There was certainly nothing inevitable about the Bogor declaration. It was an act of will by regional leaders and an act of goodwill. It was the result of imagination and cooperation. Alternative Asia-Pacific futures were possible. We might have seen the growth of a selfconfident but inward-looking Asian grouping, building on east Asian trade and investment flows and excluding Australia. In my view that would have had the most serious consequences not only for the economic growth of Asia and the Pacific but for the strategic stability of the region. Over time it would inevitably have attenuated the de fence and security partnership between the United States and Japan with a broader impact throughout the region. On the other hand, the region might have drifted along as before, buffeted by internal and external frictions, but developing no institutional framework to deal with them. It is true that the economic integration of Asia was under way before APEC began and that even in the absence of such a structure it would no doubt have continued. But it would be a very different sort of integration-more ad hoc, driven by companies working in their narrower interests and less open to Australia and to Australian business. We would have failed to engage the rapidly developing Chinese economy or Indonesia and the other South-East Asian countries in a broader regional framework. A critical opportunityand one which is open for only a very short time-would have been lost. For Australia, either of these paths would have made for a stultified Australian economy, strategic uncertainty and political isolation. Instead, this government chose the path of shaping the future for ourselves and the region. Australia proposed APEC. We worked with other regional countries like Korea to develop it. And now we have given it new institutional focus and energy by proposing regular meetings of leaders to give it the executive authority that the ministerial level meeting could never have had-to give it the power to make the sorts of decisions taken at Bogor. I am very proud of what Australia has been able to do. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",11
4,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The Bogor declaration will help ensure that this generation of Australians and our successors have a dynamic role in their own region. I said recently at the National Strategies Conference in Sydney that our most fundamental responsibility is to provide for the next generation as we were provided for-to provide the conditions for security and prosperity and opportunities for talent and energy. Simple hard work and earnest intentions will not of themselves deliver these things. The world has changed and we all must change with it. The Bogor agreement was a recognition of this fact. It is, of course, no reason to make less of our effort here in Australia. On the contrary, because Bogor has in an unprecedented way taken on the responsibility to provide a better world in the 21st century, the challenges for us are more obvious and immediate. The Australia in which I grew up was a prosperous and secure place. It was then and it is now an extraordinarily good place to live. But if we are to maintain our way of life, the Australia of the 21st century will need to be built on different foundations. Our success in the world will depend on our effective integration with it. Our success in the world's most dynamic region will also depend on this. Bogor does not assure us of prosperity. It does not guarantee the future for the next generation of Australians. That will continue to depend on the efforts of Australian governments, Australian businesses and Australian workers. But Bogor creates a massive opportunity, and I think every Australian should be aware of it. I think every Australian should know that the chance really is there. In the next century, to be Australian should mean not only the privileges we currently enjoy but a share in the extraordinary economic and cultural riches of the Asia-Pacific, and a creative role in our region's remarkable progress. This opportunity is, I think, an exciting prospect. I present the following paper: APEC Informal Leaders' Meeting, Bogor, Indonesia, 15 November I994-Ministerial Statement, 6 December 1994. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) speaking for a period not exceeding 25 minutes. MrDOWNER (Mayo-Leader of the Opposition) (12.57 p.m.)-I wish to make it clear from the outset that there is much in what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said today about the potential of the Bogor declaration with which we on this side of the House agree. Through the agenda of regional trade and investment facilitation which it established, the statement of the Asia-Pacific heads of government at Bogor has certainly given renewed momentum in favour of the open system of multilateral trade. It has given the United States, China, Japan and other leading economies of the world a sense of common engagement in the pursuit of a common objective. The Bogor agreement has set a broad course for trade policy and economic development in the world's most dynamic economic region. The significance of that cannot be underestimated. In 1960 East Asian economies made up four per cent of the world's gross national product. By 1991 that figure had risen to 25 per cent and; by the year 2000, it will probably be 33 per cent. The seven largest East Asian economies hold more than 40 per cent of the world's bank reserves. The average savings rate of East Asian economies is around 30 per cent, compared to around 16 per cent in Australia. For a region Â·of such economic dynamism, to come together and agree on long-term goals for trade liberalisation is an achievement of great significance. We, on this side of the House, recognise it as such. It is an achievement which owes much to many people over a long period of time. Proposals and initiatives for greater Asia-Pacific economic cooperation go back 30 years. Malcolm Fraser's government made a series of important breakthroughs, such as the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council and the FraserOhira accord. Bob Hawke conceived the idea of APEC and made it a reality. Of course, at Bogor, the leadership of President Soeharto was a critical ingredient for success, and we congratulate him on it. The Bogor summit had some special regional and international implications. It has led to a greater understanding of the importance of Indonesia in the region. It has consolidated habits of cooperation and consultation between regional leaders. It found important common ground amongst societies with widely varying cultural values and economies at very different levels of development and sophistication. As such, it constituted a vital contribution to ensuring stability, security and economic progress in the region as a whole. For Australia, the potential significance of Bogor reaches into many areas. The agreement on a target date for free trade in the region and the trade facilitation objectives which have been identified will help to create jobs and raise living standards in Australia. There are specific benefits for Australia in areas such as infrastructure development cooperation, human resources development, environmental protection and technology growth. Furthermore, the new direction and momentum of APEC gives Australia a clear focal point for its engagement with the region. The potential advantages for global trade for the region and for Australia's national interests as a result of the Bogor declaration are very great. We on this side of the House certainly hope that potential will be transformed into realities in all the areas that APEC has now identified-particularly trade liberalisation, the transparency of administrative systems, standardising and simplifying customs procedures, harmonising standards and easing other non-tariff barriers. What is called for in weighing the significance of Bogor for Australia is a good dose of realism to counteract the hype and overstatement of which the Prime Minister has been guilty more than anyone else. I heard the Prime Minister quoting the Economist magazine in his statement today. In fact, I even heard him quoting the London Times yesterday, so he will not mind me, I am sure, quoting the Economist back at him. - e Economist quoted one of the more expanI' sive claims which the Prime Minister made after Bogor and it countered it with the response, 'Steady on. APEC's goal of free trade is not only distant, it is also short on details.' When all the rhetoric is stripped away, the fact is that the Prime Minister's statements during and after Bogor have left many fundamental questions unanswered. He simply ignored many realities of Australia's current circumstances, which mean that we will not be in a position to maximise our gains as a nation as a result of the Bogor declaration. Let me refer very briefly to what I see as these key questions and inadequacies. First, the Prime Minister has failed to explain adequately why Australia will benefit in the way he' has projected from the opening up of the Asia-Pacific economies. His projectjons need explanation because Australia's recent record of export trade to those countries is in fact far from impressive. In reality, Australia's exports have been losing market share in almost every APEC country, despite the fact that our total exports are growing significantly. While Australian exports to most APEC countries have grown since 1989, virtually all other APEC members have had higher export growth than we have. Between 1991 and 1993 APEC countries increased their total imports in US dollars by 20 per cent, but their imports from Australia rose by only just over 2'12 per cent. In US dollars, the trend growth in APEC's imports from Australia is only four per cent a year, and that is the third lowest growth among all APEC countries. The bottom line of our recent export record in relation to the Asia-Pacific region is this: we have about three per cent of the market; our share is not growing; in some particular markets such as China and Malaysia, we have significantly lost market share; and our export to GDP ratio remains one of the lowest among OECD countries. In an important recent lecture, the emeritus professor in the ANU's research school of Pacific studies, Professor Helen Hughes, pinpointed the reasons for this declining Australian share of regional markets. She identified 'weak macroeconomic management, labour market inflexibility and high infrastructural charges'. She noted that the extent and pace of micro-economic reform in Australia has been so narrow and so slow that we are less internationally competitive than we were 10 years ago. This modest export performance within our own region and the reasons for it bring me to my second point. Under the policies of the present federal government, Australia will be always held back from reaping the benefits of external changes such as those foreshadowed at Bogor because our internal fundamentals are so inadequate. A freeing up of regional trade calls for policy reforms within Australia, of which Labor has shown itself entirely incapable over the last decade. Under this government there will be no genuine freeing up of the labour market, there will continue to be no genuine national savings strategy, and there will be no genuine attempt to reduce the cost disadvantages of Australian exporters and small businesses in particular. Under Labor the tax burden will rise and our transport and communications infrastructure will continue to be uncompetitive with the world's best, as will our training and education system. The brave new world to which Bogor points demands all these reforms and more, and this government cannot deliver them because its constituent groups and the trade union leadership in particular will not let it. What the Prime Minister should have explained todaybut did not-is how a country like Australia, with a growing balance of payments problem, with rising taxes, with interest rates among the highest in the world and increasing, with a large foreign debt",16
5,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,That's not true.,18
6,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is true-and with an uncompetitive industrial relations system, can compete effectively in the new trading arrangements to which Bogor pointed. The Business Council of Australia highlighted these realities in its recent report card on Australia's economic reform agenda, which it concluded had seriously gone off the rails. Presumably, that is why it was not invited to the Prime Minister's little summit the other day.",18
7,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,They've got nothing to say.,18
8,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Except to point out your record of failure, and you do not like to hear it. That is the one thing they have got to say: you are a flop. It is quite a simple point and you do not want to hear it. You are happy to go into the boardrooms and talk to them, but you do not want to get them together just in case they expose and embarrass you. The BCA rates as poor the role of government in national management, employee relations and education and training. You would think it would know; it runs big businesses. It noted that no progress has been made in increasing national savings and sustaining private investment. No wonder, as I said, the Prime Minister made sure that the BCA was 'disinvited' from the recent national strategies conference-that is what it is called-by your office on your instructions. It is simply not good enough for the Prime Minister to talk in hyperbole about Bogor. The fact is that Bogor is not a panacea for Australia's underlying economic weaknesses. It is no magic pudding. There is simply no alternative to getting the domestic economic fundamentals right and this government has shown over and over again that it simply cannot achieve that outcome. Boom and bust is the only style of economic management that this government knows. The third point I would make is that the Australian government signed the Bogor declaration without any clear idea of whether its trade liberalisation measures would be implemented in a discriminatory or in a nondiscriminatory way. We put this question directly to the Prime Minister in the parliament as soon as he returned from Bogor. I asked the Prime Minister a very straightforward question: Will all countries, including the European Union, have free access to the Australian market by 2010 or will the free market apply only to APEC countries? What was the Prime Minister's response to this, I would have thought, rather central issue on which I would have imagined that you would have a view? He said: This is one of the matters that will need to be considered in Osaka, Japan in 1995. It has been one !, of the matters which have already been discussed by the Eminent Persons Group, - ni-ters, - EC ministers and leaders. There are dlffenng OpInIOnS about it. That is all very well; we understand all that. You could read that in the newspaper. What the PrimeÂ· Minister failed to do-and he has failed to do it again today-is give a clear statement of what Australia's position on this issue is. You must have an idea. You are supposed to be the Prime Minister of the country. You must have a view on these things, but you will not say, will you? You must have a view. You ought to have a press conference in Canberra one day and answer some of these questions, instead of scurrying in here, abusing the standing orders and disappearing back intoÂ·your cave at the other end of the building, not to re-emerge. Presumably, you go home and then come back to your cave, but scurry in here occasionally if it is a Monday or a Thursday. You ought to have a press conference one day-not run away from the press and a press conference-and explain to the press and, therefore, explain to the Australian people what your view on this central issue is, instead of thinking that you can get away with this sham of having no view whatsoever. But the reason you failed to do this, I suppose",18
9,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Ask me again tomorrow.,19
10,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It does not matter what we ask you, you never answer the question. We all recall yesterday you being asked some questions about tax promises you made. You would not answer those questions but gave some of the most fanciful inventions of economic statistics and political gymnastics that I have ever seen in my life-an absolutely extraordinary performance. But I digressand I am enjoying the digression. It is an extraordinary state of affairs that Australian government has no position of principle on this central issue of whether APEC should be a discriminatory or nondiscriminatory trading arrangement. For' our part, our position is a consistent position and is absolutely clear: we are committed to the principle of non-discrimination, which means that all APEC economies must treat all their partners equally and,Â· conversely, that all APEC's trading partners, both within and outside APEC, must treat us as well as they treat any other trading partner. We are committed to open regionalism and, therefore, maintain that any trade liberalisation benefits stemming from APEC arrangements must also be passed on to non-APEC members on a most favoured nation basis. It is a matter of both regret and concern that the Prime Minister will not give a similar commitment to reducing trade barriers on an MFN basis. This should come as no great surprise. On 26 October, the Prime Minister referred to the debate over whether trade liberalisation benefits stemming from APEC should be administered on an MFN or preferential basis, and he described that debate as naive and immature. It is, in fact, the contrary: it is central to Australia's interests, 'and it is time the Prime Minister had the courage to state where he stands. Fourthly, the Prime Minister has failed to clarify other fundamental issues. He has given no concept of how the APEC free trade commitment will be implemented. Does it mean zero tariffs in all Australian industries, including the car industry and textiles, clothing and footwear? Does it provide for sectoral exemptions in particular industries? Does it cover all trade or only trade in goods? Does it mean, for example, that there will be free trade between China, Japan and the United States by 2020? Does it guarantee the end of non-tariff barriers to imports into Japan? Does it mean an end to American agricultural subsidies? How' are developed and nondeveloped countriesÂ· defined for the purposes of the zero tariff timetable? What happens in the transitional period between 2010 and 2020 when Australia and other developed APEC countries have no tariff or non-tariff barriers and when such barriers are still maintained by the the non-developed countries of APEC? Is the timetable binding on all parties? I ask why the Prime Minister said publicly in February 1992: There is no concept of a level playing field outside of Australia. Outside of Australia you just cross the low watermark. It's catch as catch can everywhere. They all cheat, they'll muck about, they all play favourites. It would be interesting today if the Prime Minister had told us whether he thinks these regional characteristics still prevail. These are all vitally important questions that the Prime Minister has decided to dodge. The generalities of APEC are absolutely fine. Its devil, if there is one, lies in the detail, and on that the Prime Minister has nothing to say.",19
11,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,That is a profound remark.,20
12,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is an accurate remark, as you well know. The Prime Minister cannot quite seem to reconcile himself with his new role as Captain Zero on tariffs, because that is what he is now. It is time he came clean with the Australian people about what it all means for them. After all, this is the same Prime Minister who was saying very bravely before the last election, 'I'm not going to destroy industries that have absolutely no chance of surviving on zero tariffs.' He went on to say: In an economy this size, with the diseconomies of scale, the distance-the remote distances-the fact that it's a developed economy, not a partially developed economy, with a public sector to pay I don't think these industries will survive at tariffs. What has changed? The government's confusion on these basic issues is plain for all to see. When some of them were put to the Minister for Trade, Senator MCMullan, in the aftermath of the Bogor declaration, he said that the APEC deal did not necessarily require zero tariffs in all industries. Is that right?",20
13,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Wait until the next meeting and I will tell you.,20
14,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Just wait. MCMullan went on to'say: Exactly how the liberalisation will be implemented will take some time to work out but Australian business will ,be very closely consulted. What a pity business was not consulted before the declaration was signed. The fact is that you are not even sure what you have signed. The fifth point is that the Prime Minister needs to guard against becoming a regional isolationist. His claim after Bogor that the APEC declaration is bigger than GATT and its results two or three times greater than the Uruguay Round were simply ridiculous, and were ridiculed as such-absolutely ridiculed.",20
15,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,By a couple of donkey academics.,20
16,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Greg Sheridan, of the Australian, who will be interested to hear that you regard him as a donkey academic, put it best when he wrote: Under the Uruguay round more than 100 world economies have actually agreed to specific tariff reductions on specific goods over a specific period of time. Its the greatest single act of trade liberalisation that the world has ever seen. Under the APEC declaration no-one has actually committed to anything",20
17,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Not yet.,20
18,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Well, if ever you wanted proof of the argument, you have it from his own mouth-'Not yet'. It is a bigger agreement than the Uruguay Round but when the Prime Minister is asked, 'What is the commitment?', there is nothing-'Not yet'. You are being made to look very foolish. You are seriously embarrassed. What a ridiculous for, interjection. I get back to Greg Sheridan, to zero someone who at least has some clue about the region and the world",20
19,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Well, you don't.",20
20,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"We just learnt as a result of your interjection that you have a very limited understanding of what you are doing. Greg Sheridan said: It may be that if the Bogor vision is realised, then in about 25 years some very useful results will start to flow through. But in the meantime, the Prime Minister is talking about moonshine. Senator He is pretty good at that. The Prime Minister needs to be reminded of a few truths, such as that regional trading arrangements are always less beneficial than multilateral free trade. You must agree with that; that is an obvious truth.",20
21,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Just say that again; I will have to think about it.,20
22,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I have to say it several times for you to understand a simple point. That is why all your briefings are oral and not written, because you have a lot of trouble understanding, but once it has been pounded i, into your head, you can remember to regurgitate the rhetoric. Regional trading arrangements are always less beneficial than multilateral free trade. Currently, 55 per cent of our merchandise exports go to destinations outside Asia, and only 35 per cent of our imports come from Asia. We must simply keep our export trade open to the most competitive buyers and sellers, wherever they may be. A sixth and final point that I want to refer to in the last couple of minutes that I have concerns the Prime Minister's exaggerated claims about the meaning of APEC for Australia. Of course it is important for us, but it does not need the Prime Minister to be seeking his place in history by overselling it. The claim, for example, that Bogor will mean $7 billion in extra income each year and about 70,000 jobs is simply a fanciful exaggeration. How can you quantify these results when you have admitted that ultimately you do not know what the Bogor declaration is about? . We are talking of changes in 10, 20 or 30 years time. How can you make such a claim? You have no clue. The Prime Minister described the Bogor declaration as an 'executive decision'. In fact, it is nothing of the kind actually has an opt out clause specified in the agreement. Did you notice that? It has an opt out clause in the agreement.",20
23,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Your old mate is opting out already.,21
24,Mr DOWNER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"But not in industrial relations. In fact, the Prime Minister's whole noisy insistence on the historic nature of Bogor is at odds with the interpretation the declaration has received elsewhere. There has been a practical, common sense view of what this has meant elsewhere, but here we have simply been hit with absurd hype. In conclusion, I re-emphasise the importance which we on this side attach to the outcome of the Bogor summit. I also emphasise the need we see for cold realism about what lies ahead. The cause of freer trade, which Bogor promoted, is not advanced by the Prime Minister's self-serving political rhetoric and bloated claims about it. Much more remains to be achieved than has been achieved if the goal of regional free trade is to become a reality decades from now. The Prime Minister should take a cold shower, throw off the ego driven overstatements and start focusing on the realities I have highlighted today. (Time expired)",21
25,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The poor old Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) was born with a silver foot in his mouth and is yet to take it out-surely the best Christmas present any government could ever have. May he long stay in that position, missing the opportunities and significance of agreements and statements such as this. In truth, APEC and the Bogor declaration represent a truly historic achievement of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), this government, the parliament and, indeed, the people of Australia can be truly and fully proud. This is an agreement that, in the broad sweep of history, is perhaps unprecedented. It is very unusual for such a culturally diverse set of nations to agree so quickly to something as significant as this. This agreement has come about because of the Australian Labor Party's leadership, successive governments putting together these and arrangements as part of their commitment to the internationalisation of the Australian economy. For the first time in Australian history, through APEC and the Bogor declaration, a government has appreciated that geography has become a very strong assetno longer a liability-for Australia, given our proximity to the tremendous growth region of the Asia-Pacific. In his statement, the Prime Minister outlined the potential gains for the Australian economy and the Australian people. I will repeat those benefits. For as long as the agreement stays in place, there is the potential for a real increase in output, 3.8 per cent per annum, and a 1.2 per cent increase in real national income-a dollar equivalent of $6.8 billion per annum, more than double the projected real income gains for Australia out of the Uruguay Round. Of course, the agreement will provide Australian industry and exporters with unprecedented access to Asian markets where, unfortunately, tariff protection has been a feature. In some of the Asian economies, tariffs range between 50 per cent and 60 per cent but, under this APEC agreement and Bogor declaration, they are due for elimination the year 2020 for developing economies. For instance, Indonesia's and Malaysia's car industries sit behind tariff walls of between 140 per cent and 300 per cent. The tariff reduction policy will also apply to Australia. The government has been committed to a five per cent general tariff and a 15 per cent tariff for the car, textile, clothing and footwear industries, which will come down consistent with the Bogor declaration. The benefits for Australia come about because our adjustment on industry protection, on the tariff front, is largely complete, cially compared with the other nations of APEC. In terms of output and national innations come, the benefit for Australia is absolutely substantial. Equated into jobs, the agreement has the potential for 200,000 new jobs Australia. There are just two means by which a small country such as Australia can maintain doand mestic rivalry without reducing the size and productive capacity of firms. First, it keeps its markets open to international competition. Second, it follows the approach of small export based industrial countries such as Sweden and Switzerland, that is, obtaining economic advantages by developing export strategies in a strong base of industries. Australia, through this agreement and the Bogor declaration, isÂ·slotting into the economand ic powerhouse and growth region of the Asiagovernment, Pacific. Three of the world's largest 10 economies are part of APEC and the World Bank has estimated that by the year 2020 it will have seven out of the 10 largest economies in the world. By the year 2001 the APEC region likely to account for about 55 per cent of world trade. Over the next three years 40 cent of global investment demand is likely be generated in Asia, and Australia is perfectWe ly placed to take advantage of that growth and those export opportunities. Our share of exports going to Asia has increased from 50 per cent five years ago to 60 per cent-60 per cent of all Australian exports finding their destination in the all important Asian markets, the highest percentage for any OECD nation. Australia is. perby fectly placed to take advantage of Asian industrialisation by exporting our manufacturing services and high technology industries into Asian markets. Australia is also perfectly placed, using our geography, our proximity, as an asset, to take advantage of the westernisation of Asian consumption habits, particularly in food markets, and I know that will be welcomed right across the parliament. The agreement at Bogor also represents an important transformation of Australia's relations with Asia and indeed confirms a confident place for our nation in the world. Part of espethe reason for Australia's discovery and settlement was the determination of European to establish ports on the Asian trade routes which were generating enormous wealth in the 17008. Right at the very foundain tion of European settlement in Australia towards the ends of the 1700s, our proximity to Asia was part of the advantage. Unhappily gradually thereafter Asia came to be seen more as a threat than an asset for Australia. After Federation the parliament decided to put in place policies for a white Australia to lock out cheap Asian labour, tariff protection to lock out Asian trade and centralised wage fixing arrangements to try to spread the benefits of these policies across the nation. Australia was very much an inward looking nation, frightened of its place in the world frightened of its proximity to Asia. This through its internationalisation of the Australian economy, has turned around those features of Australian heritage and values. Now we have, through Bogor, through APEC, a historic opportunity to tum around our attitudes and relationship with the Asian is economies to say they are an asset to Australia's prosperity and our trading future. per We are overcoming, for the first time into Australia's history, the tyranny of distance. are using distance and geography, working in Australia's favour, to take advantage of expanding Asian markets. APEC very much seals the advantage. I wish to make four points in relation to the agreement. The first of those is that it confirms the internationalisation of the world economy; how nations have taken advantage in the 1980s and 1990s of two liberating forces. The first of those is the end of the barren, ideological Cold War struggle between communism and capitalism. That is now producing a nationalism that is much more enlightened, much more outward looking, breaking down prejudices, and redefining nation states not so much as inward looking and aggressive forces but outward looking, confident and cooperative in the international environment. The second liberating force has been the development of international capital, communications and travel. Improvements in technology right around the world have liberated nations to overcome the tyranny of distance. Australia, through APEC, finding its proper place in our part of the world, is making best use and taking best advantage of these liberating forces. I am pleased to note that these influences are reflected in the paper on defence that the government released last week. My second point concerns APEC's development as an open regional group. It is important to recognise the challenge for a trade organisation, a trade bloc, that has an open, rather than a closed, focus. Closed groups, such as the European Community and NAFrA, have an in-built disincentive for nations to leave the trade group. They are then discriminated against on exports. However, in an open group such as APEC, no such disincentive exists. It very much relies on goodwill, cooperation and leadership to make sure that the trade group sticks together. The open group can make more substantial progress in trade liberalisation than groups operating under closed trading arrangements. Other factors need to be considered, and the government needs to be vigilant about this. These factors include changes of government among our APEC partners and reassessment of their competitive advantages and trade position. Such nations could potentially leave APEC if the group is not able to maintain the sort of goodwill, cooperation and leadership that is required. Bogor has made a magnificent start but, because APEC is to be an opening trading group, constraints need to be recognised. We need to be vigilant about making sure that APEC stays together as a trading organisation. The Bogor communique on 15 November reflects this task. It reads: Our goal is an ambitious one. But we are determined to demonstrate APEC's leadership in fostering further global trade and investment liberalisation. Our goal entails a mUltiple year effort. We will start our concerted liberalisation process from the very date of this statement. Reflecting on the task of keeping an open trade group together, I agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) who, two days before the Bogor communique, as part of APEC ministerial meeting, said: Even if we succeed in getting this political commitment (for free trade) ... we've still got a very long and very difficult negotiating road ahead. The commencement of the agreement and the Bogor declaration are most welcome, but the white road ahead in terms of negotiation and the cohesion of the trading group is very important. It is crucial for the government to maintain the success and progress that it achieved in Bogor. My third point concerns the economic theory of comparative advantage, which says that nations should specialise in areas of trade where they hold a comparative advantage. In Australia, this narrow interpretation of economic theory and trade development would result in a narrow economic base. Australia would be restricted to some limited manufacturing and services, exports plus agricultural and mining areas. It would not lead to the balanced geographical spread of wealth and regional development that is desirable across a large nation such as ours. We do not want to send Australia back to being a quarry and farm alone. The APEC declaration requires government policy to set out a very broad development of industry comparative advantage. As a nation, we want to develop our comparative advantages in our natural resources,human skills, management skills, innovation and technology. Australia is ideally placed to become a high wage, high skill economy over the 20-year period of APEC implementation. An ethos of continuous micro-reform is required throughout the Australian economy. This government has achieved more structural and micro-reform of the Australian economy in one decade than in the prevjous eight decades since Federation. Since 1983 it has shifted policy from a dosed and sheltered economy, as left to us by the coalition, to the model of an open and competitive trading nation. This has meant making available the tools by which Australian industry and commerce can compete successfully on world markets. In summary, we have removed fixed exchange rates, financial regulation and industry protection as artificiaJ constraints to competileaders; tive advantage; we have introduced labour market flexibility through award restructuring, enterprise bargaining and the training wage; we have increased the national commitment to a skilled and competitive workÂ· force through education and training; we have established an internationally competitive taxation system; and, most importantly, we have increased economic efficiency across a range of transport, communications and government enterprises. The Australian economy is now 30 per cent more internationally competitive than it was 10 years ago. For the first time in 30 years Australia is enjoying high non-inflationary growth. Just as important has been the growth in manufactured exports. Australia no longer rides the roller-coaster of world commodity prices. Manufactured exports increased by 12.5 per cent per annum between 1982 and 1992-four times faster than agricultural exports. This government has behind it a substantial set of achievements on the microfront. The Australian economy is much more internationally competitive than it was 10 years ago. The point of APEC and the challenge for the next 20 years, as the Bogor declaration is implemented, is to keep up the pace of change, to keep up our outstanding pace of micro-reform and improvements to Australia's competitiveness that this government has entrenched in public policy over the last 10 years. Reform must proceed not by Australian historical standards but by the standards of our trading partners. If Australia makes a five per cent gain in its competitive advantage, while that may be fine by our historical standards it is not enough if the other APEC nations improve their competitiveness by more than five per cent. The key to this agreement is to tie the opportunities for free trade prosperity to a strategy of continuous micro-reform over the next two decades. This would involve upgrading Australia's educational standards even more than the government has achieved over the last decade; improving our market penetration through better management skills among Australian industry and commercial improving infrastructure efficiency in transport and communications; and keeping up the reform process in industrial relations by simplifying awards, simplifying processes and entrenching enterprise bargaining in every workplace. Most of all, it means the states around the nation agreeing to competition policy. Surely, if we believe in free trade and competition among the Asia-Pacific economies, we should guarantee free trade and competition in all parts of the Australian eqmomy. (Time expired)",21
26,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I welcome the opportunity to canvass the issues arising out of the Bogor meetings of APEC and to respond to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I note in the small print of the Prime Minister's statement that he confirms he had bilateral meetings with both the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Prime Minister of Thailand-and well he might. Then I looked for further detail, and of course there was none because at the moment we are involved in a major argument with the Prime Minister of New Zealand. This argumentwas initiated by the Australian Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the Australian Prime Minister when decisions were made against Australia's interest with regard to Air New Zealand. At this moment, when we are all saluting at the altar of trade liberalisation-I support the general direction of the APEC Bogor statement-we have a situation where our Prime Minister, our emperor, has no clothes. He has taken a decision to push further protection against Air New Zealand-this has affected Queensland particularly and has been against the interests of Brisbane and the Gold Coast tourist industry-by preventing Air New Zealand from taking up certain rights which had been in part negotiated which allowed it to either be involved with domestic traffic or have additional freedom rights to Asian traffic. I remind the House that Air New Zealand brings a lot of Asian tourists to this country. Yes, there has to be fairness in the arrangements between Australia and New Zealand and between Qantas and Air New Zealand. Ansett has had the right to fly domestically within New Zealand for some seven years. But when the crunch came our Prime Minister and our Minister for Transport decided to go the protectionist route rather than the trade liberalisation route. So on that particular which was only very obliquely referred to in the Prime Minister's statement, the Prim:e Minister sadly failed this nation. In relation to the Prime Minister of Thailand, after just coming back from the Middle East via some 36 hours in Bangkok, I was interested to learn that our relations certainly took a nosedive as a consequence of comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) on the Sunday program and then by the Prime Minister in the subsequent sitting week. They placed in jeopardy some very key commercial negotiations, particularly with regard to military equipment. They chose a set of words which did not reflect the reality of the situation on the border between Thailand and Cambodia and which were contrary to some of the briefings that they would presumably have been privy to. Further to that, they gave a gratuitous insult to Thailand-a key ASEAN country, a key APEC country and a fellow country of Australia which helped commence the Cairns Group, and one with which we now have this degree of problem with our bilateral relationship. We will work through that problem. In Bangkok last week I did all I could to minimise the problem, as did the parliamentary delegation. It does pay in these matters to get down to bilateral contact and the nittygritty as often as one can through working visits to Asia because then.one learns what people there really think of Australia even in the post-Bogor climate. The Prime Minister has been, to some extent, mesmerised by his own sense of regional importance. I make it clear that he is just one of the many players in these regional events. Rather than elevating his own sense of importance, the Prime Minister would be better off addressingthe real issues of APEC. The Liberal-National Party coalition is 100 per cent behind APEC. We support APEC as part of a worldwide multilateral trading system and as an opportunity to improve regional linkages. APEC is significant for several reasons: it brings together some of the world's fastest growing economies under one umbrella; it focuses the attention of three of test, the world's largest economies, Japan, China and the United States, in the Asia-Pacific region; and it is an important building block along the path of opening up further multilateral trade liberalisation upon which Australia can build. APEC is an achievement that owes its existence to the foresight of many people, including Sir John Crawford, Dr Saburo Okita, Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke. It was Bob Hawke who crystallised the idea in his speech at th- Blue House in Seoul, South Korea, some seven years ago. To these must be added President Suharto of Indonesia, whose leadership was important for the success of the Bogor meeting and the previous meetings .. The potential of Bogor for Australia extends into many areas, including the transparency of administrative procedures, standardisation of customs processes, harmonisaton of standards and easing of other non-tariff barriers, of which there are still far too many in Asia. To postulate the view espoused by the Prime Minister that at the stroke of a pen Australia's access to regional markets is wide open is indeed misleading and naive. While the Prime Minister fantasises about his place in history, at least the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) has shown some realism, recognising the difficulty of achieving trade liberalisation goals agreed to, and recognising that it would only be accomplished over time and with patience. Let us look at exactly what happened in Bogor. Agreement was reached for a timetable for regional trade liberalisation-a timetable that is not binding. Furthermore, the agreement makes a distinction between 'developed' and 'underdeveloped' in determining the time by which free and open trade should be in place, but fails to define which countries fit into which category. Where, for instance, will Taiwan and South Korea be allocated? Of course, the meeting did not finalise the exactitude of what is meant by trade liberalisation. Is the objective zero? Has the Prime Minister joined the Captain Zero club, of which he reminded us during the last parliamentary term, or is the figure somewhere between zero and five per cent? I accept his comment that that matter is yet to be finalised and resolved. That is fair enough at this stage in the development of the statement, but we clearly need to clarify exactly what detailed objective in terms of tariff will be laid down. I favour the interpretation-in my belief the correct interpretation-as 'negligible' in this circumstance, and that would be a tariff that falls between zero and five per cent. It is of concern that Malaysia has added an addendum to the declaration stipulating that the date of 2020 is not binding. This creates a dangerous precedent for the forum. Already there are other mutterings about excluding agriculture from APEC's discussions and that too would be a disaster. There was no indication about what form APEC would ultimately take. While 'open regionalism' were the buzzwords, the United States has emphasised that any trade concessions would be reciprocal and there would be no free riders. Meanwhile, the Asian APEC constituency has expressed a preference for non-discriminatory free trade and Australia continues to sit on fence with regard to the follow through of that process within the APEC context. , I ' ! I would have thought that, rather, than telling us all what an unbridled success he was at Bogor, the Prime Minister would have spent some time telling us where, in the aftermath of Bogor, Australia would really be headed. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) pointed out, the Prime Minister, either because he was unwilling or, perhaps more accurately, because he does not know, was unable to answer a question in this House on how the trade liberalisation accord will be implemented by Australia. Instead of answering the question, the Prime Minister delivered one of his defensive diatribes. That certainly did not help the standard of debate or consideration of APEC post-Bogor. If we are looking for illustrations of uncertainty, a day after the historic Bogor declaration trade minister MCMullan acknowledged that the government had not decided how it would implement the APEC accords and then went on to say in the Senate that the APEC deal would necessarily require zero tariffs in the labour intensive textile, clothing and footwear and passenger motor vehicle industries. Nor did he explain how APEC's goal of free trade would be achieved without such reductions. Similarly, defensive comments have been made by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), who indicated that the government would not speed up its schedule of tariff cuts by the year 2000. Where does that really leave Australia vis-avis the timetable? It can be argued that we are already there, but we are not quite there. There are other adjustments to be made to comply with the 2010 objective. We should look at the APEC region closely. The cold hard facts are that Australia is losing market share of the Asia APEC market. Since 1985 Australian exports to the Asian APEC countries has declined to a current market share of around 3.2 per cent. Indications are that it will continue to decline. Yes, Asia is growing, yes the economies of those Asian economic tigers present great opportunity but, when we analyse the statistthe ics, Australia is actually losing market share to other competitors. Worse, we are losing ' market share in countries such as Thailand, Japan, the USA and, whilst it is not part of the APEC region, even the Middle East. This is a deplorable situation. As the late Professor Julius Sumner Miller would have asked, 'Why is it so?' This parlous state of affairs is, as Professor Helen Hughes has said, due to weak macro-economic management, labour market inflexibility and high infrastructural charges. In that regard, she is absolutely right. Similar views are reflected by the government's own Bureau of Industry Economics. In its recent analysis of Australian industry trends, the BIB makes a point that Australia's medium term trade prospects depend not only on an open multilateral trading system and improved linkages with the rapidly expanding Asia-Pacific region but also continued domestic micro-economic reform. Of course, again last weekend we had another waterfront stoppage. That, along with concerns over Mascot, has meant that Australia's reputation as a reliable supplier has been tom asunder yet again. I have to say those networks which exist to transport trade news and upgradings, advisings and updates with regard to trading circumstance rip around the world every few seconds by virtue of the international fax machine and networks which are now locked in. So every hiccup at Mascot and every hiccup, stoppage and strike on our waterfront is through the Middle East and through the Asian trading countries within minutes, if not hours. If honourable members go there they will meet businessman after businessman who will remind them of their legitimate concerns about Australia's reliability as a trading partner. Mr O'Connor-What about in your time, Tim?",24
27,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am glad you mentioned it. In our time, may I remind the House, Doug Anthony bit the bullet. Indeed, we forced the pace and built on some of the outstanding work done by his coalition colleagues by taking the pain and negotiating the closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand. We opened up a trading arrangement which the Labor Party did not think of and did not develop but which the National Party, its leader at the time, Doug Anthony, and the coalition drove through against some considerable opposition in the electorate of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and others. There were bitter meetings about CER with regard to the dairy industry, and yet we had the courage to stay theÂ· course and provide a foundation building block with our nearest neighbour to the east, New Zealand. The CER arrangements are now the subject of further discussion, partly in the APEC context, as to how CER might interface with AFfA, the ASEAN Free Trade Area, and that is, I think, very timely. I ask the Prime Minister how, in terms of the current economic situation of this country, Australia's real national income will increase by $6.8 billion from APEC when, if we continue to lose market share, the present rate will actually be losing-not gaining-from these arrangements. In other words, trade liberalisation is not a guaranteed, one-way cheque for Australia. It will only be so if we are not complacent, if we can compete effectively and if we can gain market share, rather than lose it as is the case at the moment. Much more needs to be done to improve our economic fundamentals if business is going to benefit in real terms, not potential terms, from the Bogor declaration of APEC. The government clearly has a long way to go in this regard. I close by quoting Greg Sheridan's reference to the Prime Minister's ludicrous overselling of APEC. He points to its having four serious negative consequences. He says: First, it threatens our credibility as a serious APEC broker in the region. Second, it threatens APEC's standing within Australia. That is something we need to be reminded of. I continue to do all I can in the domestic constituency to point to the value of sensible trade liberalisation arrangements. He continues: Third, it introduces a disappointing element of fantasy and unreality into the APEC debate. And fourth; and most important, it becomes an excuse for not doing the hard work of domestic economic reform. After all, if Planet APEC can give you $7 billion new income per year from one batik shirt meeting, why bother with the hard slog of micro-economic reform? These are wise words. There is a great deal more that has to be done here in Australia if we are to truly benefit from the fragile and first steps taken at the APEC Bogor summit.",27
28,Mr OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Corio) (1.52 p.m.)APEC in 1994 represents a triumph for regional diplomacy and for Australian diplomacy. Australia now has an important place at the table of one of the largest trading blocs on Earth. Indeed, the public servants, and the politicians on this side of the House, who have made such a contribution to placing Australia at the forefront of this trading bloc need our congratulations and our long-term thanks. I am very disappointed at the attitude that has just been expressed by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). It seems that the coalition is not only intent on tearing itself apart as far as the leadership of the Liberal Party is concerned, but that it is also intent on tearing APEC and the Bogor declaration down at a very critical point in its evolution. APEC has implications for Australia's economic future; it has profound implications for our political position in the world; and it has important implications for the long-term security of the nation and, of course, our social and cultural direction beyond the years 2010 and 2020, depending very much on the pieces that we put in place in APEC today. The way that Australia will define itself over the next 20 years will be inextricably linked to the developments that are taking place now in the East Asia region under the APEC umbrella. The Bogor declaration represents an agreed timetable for trade liberalisation in the region and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated, offersÂ· unparalleled opportunities for Australia to take advantage of those developments. By any measure, APEC is a remarkable achievement. We see in the East Asia region diverse cultures at different stages in the evolution of their political and legal institutions coming together to form a common bond and a new direction. As the Prime Minister and other speakers have pointed out, it is a remarkable achievement in that it represents a declaration of common goals from nations with differing economic systems and at vastly different stages of development. At one end of the spectrum you have the United States, Japan and Australia-fairly highly developed nations with high standards of living. At the middle of that spectrum are the ASEAN nations, many of which now have dual economies: a reasonably sophisticated urban economy and a near to subsistence rural economy co-existing within the national boundaries. This presents enormous challenges for improvement in their standards of living over the next 20 years. I pay tribute in this debate today to former Prime Minister Hawke, who was very much an architect of APEC in its initial stages. Of course, the Bogor declaration represents a personal triumph for the Prime Minister. I listened very intently to the Leader of the National Party of Australia as he tried to denigrate the contribution of the Prime Minister to this particular achievement. The Prime Minister has played a pivotal role in the formation of APEC. He has put the APEC pieces together with consummate political skill in a way that reflects his 2Yz decades in this parliament. It has been a toil of patience and endurance, but always with an eye for the breakthrough in the collective attitudes of the nations that we have been dealing with. The task has really been momentous: to forge a collective attitude from the disparate interests, which are now APEC; and to work at the highest level of regional and world leadership-the intricacies of the personalities that drive the nations in the East Asia region. He has persuaded nations that their long-term interests do, indeed, coincide. I had the pleasure of working for some time with the former industry minister, John Button. He made this comment about the Prime Minister, and I would like to share it with the House today. He said that Keating was the last of the great persuaders. Indeed, I think the APEC achievement is testimony to this view. He has managed to persuade in a very real way the disparate nations of this region to look collectively at their long-term interest. Mr Reith-Who wrote your speech?",28
29,Mr OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I wrote this speech and I am coming to the opposition. The honourable member for Flinders may well interject because it is an appropriate time to,29
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Mr Andrew)The honourable member may well not interject. I was about to ask the honourable member for Flinders to desist and it would be helpful if the honourable member for Corio did not respond to the interjections.,29
31,Mr OCONNOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am quite happy to take his interjections, but I heed what you are saying, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let us deal with the opposition. Does anybody in Australia or anybody in this House really believe that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) could have played a pivotal role in the APEC negotiations? Is there anybody in this House who really believes that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the pretender to the throne, could have stitched up the APEC deal? Does anybody really believe that anybody on the coalition's front bench, including the honourable member who sits at the dispatch box-the honourable member for Flinders, who has his eye, I understand, on the leadership as well-really believe that the opposition could have stitched together the APEC deal and played that pivotal role? The answer is no. We know it on this side of the House, and the people of Australia know it. We are the party of the big picture. We are the party that has put together the Mabo legislation. We are the party that has put together probably one of the greatest socio-economic programs-Working Nationthat has been put to the Australian people. We are the party, and these are the Labor Prime Ministers, that have put together the APEC deal. I am sure that the opposition really does understand the full import of the Bogor declaration. It is a statement of the political will at the highest level of ASEAN governments about the future. It is no use meandering around the playing fields on the outside. You have to get into the main game and you have to get the main players to agree. That is what has occurred with this particular declaration. It is important to understand that. Nothing will flow unless the political will is there. The Bogor declaration, above everything else, is a statement of the political will of the ASEAN and the East Asia region to come together to forge a common future. I was very interested in the comments of the Leader of the National Party about whether the government is adopting a zero tariff proposal. The Labor Party has embarked on a program of tariff reductions that are programmed and compassionate. That is not what the opposition proposed before the last election. Its proposed tariff cuts were not sensible; nor was the opposition's response to our reductions credible. I was interested in the comments that the Leader of the National Party made about Malaysia's supplementary declaration not being binding. Somehow, this meant that APEC was coming apart at the seams already. Goodness knows, he would have to have his head in the sand somewhere in the Middle East-he tells us he has been there for the last few weeks-not to understand that the Malaysians are posturing and that they had to do that. It does not mean that the Bogor declaration is coming apart at the seams or that APEC is falling apart already. In relation to Australia's future trading performance, the Leader of the National PaI!y talked about the weak macro-economIC settings. I suppose he was talking about the low inflation rate. I suppose he was talking about high growth, high productivity or low industrial disputation. As we are on the issue of industrial disputation and its effects on Australia's trading performance, he toted out one or two industrial actions in our recent history-over the last couple of months-as evidence that Asia is turning its back on Australia yet again. Goodness me, there is not not a person in this House or in the Australian community who does not recall the abysmal position and record of the opposition as fru: as industrial disputation is concerned. If anythmg over the last 20 years has damaged Australia's trading reputation, it has been the policies of an opposition that could not manage industrial relations. It oversaw the highest industrial disputation this country has ever seen and the greatest damage to Australia's trading performance. Above all, the hypocrisy of it all was the Leader of the National Party standing up here in the parliament, talking about the common economic relations in the dairy industry and what a great job the National Party had done to restructure the dairy industry-to put it on a fine path and get us trading with Asia, New Zealand and wherever else. I first stood for this parliament in 1983-84. I can recall that, at that stage, the National Party was organising dairy farmers in the Western District to oppose the efforts of the Labor government of the day to restructure the dairy industry and position it for the very scenario that we are experiencing today. The National Party stalked the countryside, stirring to what the government was proposing as far as restructuring this industry was concerned. I read in the paper the other day that the dairy companies in this nation are, over the next five years, going to invest some $700 million in new plant and equipment to cope with the demands that are expected to be generated, especially from the east Asia region. So let us have no more nonsense from those on the opposite side when they seek to tear down this great achievement and to have a go at the Prime Minister and his role in APEC. There will be people who will have misgivings about the full implications and importance of APEC and the Bogor declaration. There are always winners and losers in the great economic scheme of things but, importantly, Australia has walked down the road of restructuring its economy and refocusing its attention very much on the East Asia region. We have largely dismantled the tariff wall in a programmed and sensible way. I recently visited two firms in my electorate, one of which was Hendersons Springs, an automotive components manufacturer. Hendersons Springs was very concerned at the lowering of tariffs and what it might do to the business and what might happen to the automotive components industry, which depends so heavily on the manufacture of automobiles. But this particular company got into the export ring and made a concrete decision to reorient its operations, to pick out a niche in the automotive components manufacturing market and to pursue it. Today, it is a world leader in seating technology. I visited Godfrey Hirst, one of the unsung heroes of Australia's textile, clothing and footwear industries. Over the last two years, Godfrey Hirst has put on 300 people. The company is destined to expand quite significantly over the next two years, and its employment levels in Geelong alone are some 1,100. The proprietor, Mr George MCKendrick, assures me that that company can take on the world. It is investing heavily in capital equipment and in the skills of the work force. It is confident that it can meet any challenge that the East Asia region might up opposition now present. This government has embarked on a very broad program of micro-economic reformsomething that the opposition could never have dreamed of and would not have had the political will to execute. We have poured enormous resources into improving the skills of the Australian work force. I am very proud of the Commonwealth's massive investment in educational infrastructure. The runs are on the board. Exports as a percentage of GDP have increased from 14 per cent in 1983 to 22 per cent in 1994. Exports to the ASEAN region have been growing at an annual rate of 20 per cent a year and 12 per cent a year to the East Asia region. Australian equity abroad as a percentage of GDP has risen from three per cent in 1983 to 20 per cent in 1994. These are positive trading achievements, which those on the opposite side seek to denigrate and decry. (Time expired)",29
32,Mr REITH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Flinders) (2.07 p.m.)Without reservation, I welcome the success of the Bogor summit and, furthermore, endorse the very balanced and constructive remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia and shadow minister for trade (Mr Tim Fischer). I am disappointed in the quality of the contributions that we have had from the government in this debate today, leaving aside the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The last speaker, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), who I think represents the Geelong area in Victoria, was happy to parrot a speech, presumably half written for him by the Prime Minister's advisers, on how good the Prime Minister is. However, he failed to address one of the significant issues in this matter which concerns the implications of Bogor as it relates to his constituents. He has the Ford Motor Company down his way, and many people work for that company. The implications of the Bogor declaration will be a considerable and further reduction in tariffs as it affects the motor car industry. There are a lot of jobs at stake. With Labor's move to reduce tariffs-welcome as that may be-without further reform in the Australian economy to allow these businesses to survive, many Australian jobs will be lost. I think, in fairness to his constituents, it would have been better for the member for Corio to have focused on the implications of Bogor to his constituents rather than trying to sell a propaganda message which, as I say, I suspect basically has been given to him by the Prime Minister's office. The prospect of free trade in the Asia Pacific region, with its attendant political and cultural implications, is truly a dazzling prospect. But it is the implementation of APEC and the willingness of this government to undertake the kinds of domestic reforms necessary to ensure Australia's full participation that concern the coalition. I am sorry did not concern the last speaker. These concerns are heightened by the government's inability to deal with more than just one foreign policy issue at a time. The Bogor meeting was a milestone. It marked the culmination of five years of APEC's development. But it was also the culmination of a 25-year process of discussion and interaction about the shape an economic community in the region could take. The promiscuity with which this government takes credit for developments in the region is fast becoming an international joke. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's remarks today only affirmed that development. Thanks to the recent revelations by the Pdme Minister, we are now expected to I' believe that APEC's birth was parthenogenous. We are now expected to believe that APEC and the concept of APEC leaders' meetings sprang fully formed from the Prime Minister's head whereas, in fact, the notion of an economic community in the region was born in the 1960s. Sir John Crawford, for example, was instrumental in recognising the need for such a regional structure. Over the next quarter century, various models for regional economic cooperation emerged out of this dialogue. They included the Pacific free trade area, the organisation for Pacific trade and development, the Pacific basin cooperation concept and the Pacific economic cooperation conferences, which was a joint initiative by Prime Ministers Ohira and Fraser. The concept was not new to our neighbours either, as the ASEAN countries have entered into a commitment to free trade in the region. So when former Prime Minister Hawke brought APEC to life in Seoul in January 1989 it was against this background of 20 years of development of the concept by regional statesmen and thinkers and academics. Professor Peter Drysdale was very much influential in this process, and his contribution should be a matter of public record. Dick Woolcott, former secretary to the foreign affairs department, played a critical role in APEC's development as Bob Hawke's special envoy; he ensured that the concept of APEC that took root in the region. It would be wise to note that Senator Gareth Evans, foreign minister now and in 1989, was not even aware of the proposal when Bob Hawke announced it in Seoul when looking for a good idea to announce on an overseas trip. Bogor was not only a milestone but also a signpost-one which pointed the way to free trade in the region. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party have already gone over in detail the coalition's reaction to the Bogor declaration. I want to focus on some other ramifications of Bogor. The meeting provided an opportunity for bilateral meetings between regional leaders. The significance for Australia of this opportunity is that this government has systematically neglected important bilateral relationships. It has neglected Australia's relationship with Malaysia. In his statement today, the Prime Minister records proudly that: Dr Mahathir and I were able to agree on the need to improve exchanges between Malaysia and Australia in the area of science and technology. The reason why the success of such a meeting was not a foregone conclusion-as should have been the case-is that the Prime Minister's personal intervention in this key bilateral relationship has been disastrous. The Prime Minister has rightly given credit to President Suharto's masterful handling of the chairmanship of APEC. The Prime Minister's effective handling of the bilateral relationship with Indonesia is in marked contrast with his predecessor's efforts, and I pay the appropriate tribute to him for that. The Prime Minister claims that Bogor marked a new level of maturity in Australia's relations with the region. I therefore ask the government to demonstrate this maturity which implies a dialogue between Australia and its regional partners. Foreign minister Alatas has today, for the first time, officially acknowledged that in 1975 five Australian journalists were killed during Indonesia's invasion of East Timor. Mr Alatas is quoted as saying that Indonesia was not 'one hundred per cent responsible' for the deaths. The AAP report quotes him as saying: We admit that the tragedy was very painful, but why should we be held responsible for it? Elsewhere in the report, he is quoted as saying: We are not trying to shake off our responsibility, but we are not one hundred per cent responsible what had happened. I call on the government to take up this issue with the Indonesian government. I demand that the government ask the Indonesian government at foreign minister level precisely to what degree it was responsible for these murders. The killings took place 19 years ago and the bilateral relationship has prospered and grown since then. The coalition welcomes that development. If the government's rhetoric on the current strength of the bilateral relationship is solidly based, then the relationship should be sufficiently resilient to bear examination of this tragic case. Besides its neglect of bilateral relationships with Malaysia, the Philippines and India, the government's regional rhetoric shows that it fails to understand that developments in APEC, with all their promise, are taking place and must take place in a global context. The Prime Minister's confusion over the significance of trade liberalisation under GATT is, unfortunately, typical of this ignorance. In a speech on 26 October this year the Prime Minister said quite clearly that the government's foreign policy equalled the Asia Pacific region. The Prime Minister said: If we do not succeed in the Asia Pacific, then we succeed nowhere. The coalition agrees with this proposition, but we add the rider that, if Australia succeeds only in the Asia-Pacific region, it will miss important, even vital, opportunities elsewhere around the world. Last year,. the countries of the European Union invested $10 billion in this country-more than half our overseas capital needs. We do not hear the government talking about that and its implications for foreign policy. A couple of other points that are relevant in discussing APEC have not been taken up by previous speakers from the coalition. Firstly, I want to say something about consultation. The success of APEC will be driven by the engine of regional growth. Its success, ultimately, will be built on the efforts of thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people involved in running the businesses of the region as they take up the opportunities to trade with each other freely for and to obtain the mutu'al benefit from regional economic cooperation and trade. That is why consultation with the business community is important. So I welcome the commitment by the government for consultation, and the recognition by the Prime Minister of the work by Philip Brass and others, and I am pleased it is going to set up a subcommittee of cabinet to maintain the focus on APEC and the work that needs to be done for APEC. But for consultation to be worthwhile it has to be genuine consultation. I have had some insight now into the way in which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operates when it comes to consultation. Sadly, it seems that the department's idea of what consultation means is a completely different idea from that which most of us have. For too many in the department the idea of consultation is that they consult with the business community-not to hear its concerns and genuinely and constructively respond to its concerns but to hear the business community's worries and then preach to it why it should not be worried. We have had falloff the back of a truck a number of minutes prepared within the department about the nature of consultation, and they are far too dismissive-in fact, arrogantly dismissive-of the genuine concerns of Australian business people about the implications of Australia's entering into various treaties and international agreements. This has come to a head already in the Basle convention on hazardous wastes and we will hear more of it when the government sits down in March in Berlin on the climate change convention, which holds out the prospect of another increase in tax, this time under the umbrella-the excuse, if you like-of an environmental levy. There is no doubt this government is desperate in its search for a dollar. Labor has been a big spender in the whole time it has been in office. We have seen our economic situation improve in terms of the numbers in the GDP as released recently and the government is now looking at a way in which it can slam the brakes onto the Australian economy. It will do that either by tax increases or spending cuts. It does not have a good record at cutting back on spending because it has been farming out too many dollars to its own special interest groups that keep it in government. So it will be looking for tax increasesafter it promised black and blue in the last election that a vote for Labor would mean lower taxes, not higher taxes. Consultation is very important. I encourage the department to reconsider its general approach to the question of consultation. The business community is going to make APEC work. For that to be effective, rather than arrogantly dismiss the business community's interests and concerns, they ought to be properly factored into account as negotiations , continue in the development of APEC. The last point I want to make is a more general one. After this government was elected, it proceeded to financial deregulation but never understood that the inevitable consequences of financial deregulation were to build pressures for labour market deregulation. In a sense, so it is with trade liberalisation. As you lower the barriers and allow others to trade more freely with you without barriers and without customs taxes, it puts much greater onus on the government to deliver a more efficient economy so our people can compete rather than just losing their jobs to those able to be more efficient overseas. In Australia we need to do a lot more if we are to reap the full benefits of APEC in the years ahead. That worries me particularly. In the weeks leading up to APEC and the meeting at Bogor, the Australian government could not even keep a deal it had made with New Zealand to allow New Zealanders to fly their airline in Australia when we had already allowed Ansett to fly around New Zealand. If the government could not even jump that hurdle, how can it claim to be able to jump the hurdles still ahead of it in APEC. I conclude by referring to the Economist. The Prime Minister referred to the Economist: I thought it put it pretty well. In summing up APEC, the Economist said: The trend towards more open markets is noticeable in most of the rest of developing Asia. APEC may help to boost the development of trade across the Pacific, but its real role may be to reinforce the process that is already well under way. The coalition supports that process.",30
33,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"In many ways it is a privilege for members of the parliament to have an opportunity to debate a statement of the kind that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) delivered this afternoon. On 15 November, the day of the Bogor declaration, a statement was cabled back to Australia from the Prime Minister indicating that that declaration had been signed and indicating as well some of the implications of that declaration not only for Australia but for the Asia-Pacific region generally and for the world. Today in the national parliamentÂ· the Prime Minister has taken the opportunity to make additional observations about the importance of that declaration. The Prime Minister said, in part: It is not overstating the case to suggest that the Bogor meeting, and the Declaration of Common Resolve which leaders issued afterwards, has permanently changed the nature of our region and the future of Australia. That is not overstating the case. I would like to refer to part of an editorial in the Australian newspaper the day after the Bogor declaration. The editorial said, again in part: The Bogor Declaration is a historic victory for liberal world trade and regional development in the Asia-Pacific. Its philosophical message to the region-and to the world---expresses unequivocal support for even-handed competition and hard work, spurns protectionism, and encourages the leading nations of the fastest-developing region to become more engaged with each other in the interests of lasting peace, stability and economic progress. What has been agreed, in the outcome of an idea spawned five years ago by Australia, means nothing less than the creation of the world's largest free-trade zone over the first two decades of the 21 st century. The Australian newspaper refers to it as 'a historic victory'. To a very large extent that reflects many of the comments that were made by other editorials and other leading commentators. For that reason, we realise the importance of this particular statement, this particular debate, this matter, which is now in the process of being considered by the parliament. The remarks that were made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) rather than, I hasten to add, by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who immediately preceded me in this debate, were petty indeed. At least the member for Flinders had sufficient grace to acknowledge, as he said, that the Bogor meeting was a milestone. Yes, it was. The outcome of the Bogor meeting was nothing short of remarkable, by any measure. The Bogor declaration was a remarkable statement of 18 countries, many of which have histories and traditions of pressure, tension and conflict. But, in Jakarta, and in the lead-up to the decision made in Jakarta to sign that declaration, the divisions, tensions and pressures of the past were swept aside. There was a realisation on the part of those people, who together met in Jakarta on that day to give final consideration to the Bogor declaration and to give it their imprimatur, that the Asia-Pacific region is a major region of the world. Its future lies in its role as a region and in the integration, coordination and cooperation between the various countries that make up that region. In many respects, I suppose that decision is on a par with many of those other great decisions and great arrangements that have been reached in the past as a result of the world seeking to address particular types of problems and particular future developments with which it has been faced. The Bretton Woods agreement, for example, after the Second World War, with the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, was a decision of major importance which established institutions of great importance and significance, and of fundamental importance as well to the recovery of the world after the Second World War. More recently, we have had the completion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the GATT. We have had a series of decisions there which are of enormous importance to the future integration of world economies. I suppose, to a very large extent, what is taking place throughout the world now is what took place between those six colonies that we now call Australia 94 years ago. At that time, we tore down those barriers between six colonies and established a commonwealth, a new nation. What the world is doing today is tearing down the barriers between countries on a regional basis, and increasingly on a world basis, to ensure that the world community, the world economy, will be able to bring to itself the opportunities for development which the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia did 94 years ago. The Leader of the National Party referred to the position which the government has adopted as being one of fantasy and unreality. I will refer to a couple of sections of the Bogor declaration, and I will do so because I also heard the comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. He attempted to belittle the significance of this initiative and the significance of this development. He raised a number of issues which are important and relevant to the development of the process towards the year 2010 and the year 2020. He attempted to denigrate and diminish it. He attempted to suggest that the statement made by the Prime Minister earlier today and the remarks made by the 18 world leaders in Jakarta on the 15th were perhaps of less significance than many had claimed. The Leader of the Opposition has attempted to diminish the extent to which those 18 leaders brought a conscientious and determined position to that consideration. Let us see what they said. In the declaration, they said in part: We further agree to announce our commitment to complete the achievement of our goal of free and open trade and investment in Asia Pacific no than the year 2020. They did not refer to some tentative ambition. They chose to express it as their commitment. Does the Leader of the Opposition question the sincerity and the commitment which those 18 leaders brought to their deliberations and to the physical process of signing that declaration? The Bogor declaration continued: The pace of implementation will take into account the differing levels of economic development among APEC economies, with the industrialised economies achieving the goal of free and open trade and investment no later than the year 2010 and developing economies no later than the year 2020. Further in the Bogor declaration, the 18 leaders said: Our goal is an ambitious one. But we are determined to demonstrate APEC's leadership in fostering further global trade and investment liberalization. Our goal entails a multiple year effort. The next sentence in this part of the statement is particularly significant in relation to some of the petty comments that were made by the Leader of the Opposition. The 18 leaders said: We will start our concerted liberalization process from the very date of this statement that is, from 15 November. Following that sttntence, they said: We direct our ministers and officials to immediately begin preparing detailed proposals for implementing our present decisions. . They are not talking about implementing their expressions of intent or making some tentative statement about where the Asia-Pacific region will go but, as they said, 'implementing our present decisions'. It is a remarkable achievement. In addition to the Australian editorial, how did some other commentators and newspapers in Australia respond? Ross Peake, writing for the Canberra Times on the day after the signing of the declaration on 15 November, started his article with: Countries in the Asia-Pacific basin have resolved to tear down all trade barriers under an historic agreement made yesterday. On 16 November, Stephen Mills, Deputy later Editor, Foreign and National for the Sydney Morning Herald, started his article with: APEC's summit decision to create a regional free trade zone is like an earthquake; it will reshape the political as well as the economic landscapes of the Asia-Pacific region. Stephen Mills refers to it as an earthquake. Petty, nasty little vindictive comments are being made by members of the opposition, in respon,ding to an announcement of a decision which was initiated in Australia by a Labor government, by the former Prime Minister, and which was brought to fruition by the present Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition and his colleague the Leader of the National Party are making these petty, nasty little vindictive comments. We have to depend upon members such as the member for Flinders to at least introduce a little bit of graciousness into the debate. As I said, the member for Flinders said the Bogor meeting was a milestone. Yes, it was a milestone. On 16 November, the day following the signing of the declaration, an article in the Australian Financial Review read: . The APEC free-trade deal is an unqualified step in the right direction. But the citizens of the 18 nations that signed onÂ· to the Bogor agreement could be forgiven for feeling slightly overwhelmed. They are now committed to opening their economies to real competition from the most dynamic countries of the world. The first paragraph ended with these words: Great change is inevitable. I could go on. Objective respected commentators in national, state and provincial newspapers followed up with their own editorials on 16 November. All of them accepted the dynamic nature of the decision and its enormous importance to Australia in the future. It will be of importance not only to Australia but to all of those countries in the Asia Pacific region. One of the significant changes that has taken place in Australia relates to a number of those more contemporary issues to which attention has been given. I refer to our trading relationship with the United Kingdom. In 1960-61, 25 per cent of all of our exports went to the United Kingdom. Today, the figure is about three per cent. In 1960-61, 30 per cent of our imports came from the United Kingdom. Today, the figure is about five per cent. So there has been a dramatic change over the last 30 years with respect to the source of our imports and the destination of our exports. There has been an increasing recognition on the part of Australia generally that our geographical position places us right near Asia, that our future will see us in that position that we are now part of that large Asia-Pacific region. I notice a group of school students in the gallery. This group has had the opportunity to observe consideration in this parliament of a subject of very great significance. (Time expired)",33
34,Mr TAYLOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Groom) (2.37 p.m.)Nobody could ever accuse my friend opposite the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) of being petty, nasty or vindictive. Today I want to put the comments of members on this side of the House into a much truer perspective than that portrayed by the previous speaker. In the last sitting week in this place, a number of others participated in a discussion of a matter of public importance dealing with the issue of APEC and the Bogor summit. What did we hear on that occasion? We heard a sermon unto the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) from people like the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and others. As I said at the time-we have heard this from a number of speakers on our side of the House-the APEC and the Bogor summit are not about Prime Minister Keating; they are not about the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). Indeed, they are about a lot of people on both sides of the House who have worked for a long periodthis goes back well beyond the life of this Labor government-both at the diplomatic level and, as the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) pointed out, in academic circles. I wanted to put the attitude of this side of the House into a truer perspective than that portrayed by the honourable member for Charlton. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) said at the outset, we strongly support the outcomes of the Bogor summit. Our concerns lie with the follow-up of those outcomes and how they will be achieved. As the Leader of the Opposition said, we support a lot of those outcomes simply because we hope that those outcomes will generate jobs for Australians, and we should all welcome that. But, at the same time, the Leader of the Opposition made the point, with which I agree entirely, that he hoped-indeed all of us in this place should and hope-that the potential is translated into some sort of reality. That is where we start to get into arguments about 'realism' as against 'hype', to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition. I agree with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when he said that we should recognise-and I would assert this-that the Prime Minister seemingly is still mesmerised by his own importance in this region of the globe. We put that point to the government, but obviously it would not agree. But I think it is seen in the community at large that this is the case. Before talking about Bogor, I will go back I and and talk a bit about APEC. APEC was established to develop approaches towards the promotion of economic and trade cooperation that will enhance associations amongst its members in ways which do not discriminate against non-APEC members. Its regional cooperation is then to be opened to all other states interested in trade and growth. One major avenue for APEC to achieve these goals is through the pursuit of trade facilitation-and we have heard a lot about that in the debate today. These measures are directly relevant to the interests of business in the region, can also deepen the basis for communication and understanding amongst members and are consistent with the concept of open regionalism by developing policies which facilitate trade without discriminating against nonAPEC members. Furthermore, the APEC forum gives an opportunity for bilateral and multilateral discussions at both the ministerial and heads of government levels. Quite reasonably, the Prime Minister referred to this in his statement today. Australia's emphasis on APEC therefore reflects directly the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region in Australia's economic relations. That said, we should not belittle the contribution that other areas of the globe will make in our trade relations. Both the Leader of the National Party and the honourable member for Flinders made that point, particularly in relation to the European Union. The Asia-Pacific region is growing at a substantially faster rate than the OECD average. The Asia-Pacific region has a burgeoning middle class. Of a total population of over two million people, it is estimated that the number of people with household incomes of $10,000 will double from'40 million to 80 million from 1988 to the tum of the century. While trade and economic relations in the Asia-Pacific region have been growing rapidly, it is fair to say that a high level tion is still afforded to trade in the region. This has impeded the progress of regional economic integration and prevented the region from reaching its full economic potential. Furthermore, by encouraging trade liberalisation on a regional basis, APEC can also encourage liberalisation at the global level. For example, the success of the APEC leaders meeting in Seattle last year is considered to have had a positive influence on the outcome of the Uruguay Round at the end of last year. I' Australia has also seen as highly valuable APEC's role in associating the United States in regional economic cooperation. Australia has supported active US involvement in APEC as a way of broadening the context of the relationships between the US and Asia, which continue to be vital for the economic and security interests of both parties. The honourable member for Charlton read some quotes, so r will read him a quote from the other side of the coin in terms of APEC. r refer to an article which was written by Denis Gastin in the Australian at about the time of the summit and said in part: But amid the backslapping at Bogor it is not churlish to ask: ""Are we getting the most we can out of APEC?"" One very important question too often ducked by boosters is whether our motivation in putting so many of our cards on this particular table is genuinely strategic or just opportunistic. Is APEC being pursued as an element in a well thought-out global trade strategy, as a surrogate for a trade strategy, as a consolation prize for a quite ordinary Uruguay Round outcome, or merely as a series of events? He went on to say: It is definitely not the former. A stop-start three year process to produce a national trade - d investment strategy has failed to provide the overall strategic context in which Australia's approach to APEC could be positioned in a balanced way. He then said: The much-lauded Uruguay Round agreement, for example, has been substantially devalued expost by the backsliding of parties to the settlement who were only ever marginally committed to the result. Even if this were not the case, Australia's own ability to benefit is severely curtailed by its failure to complete the micro reformswe have heard a lot about that from this side of protecof the House this afternoonnecessary to ensure we are sufficiently competitive to take up the ""potential"". Trade policy and domestic policy are inextricable, the industry bodies argue, but this point has been skated over in the still incomplete national trade and investment strategy process and has been given scant recognition in the run-up to Bogor. Despite this, we are calling for free trade-at the earliest possible date. r say to the honourable member for Charlton and others that that is the other side of the coin. Mr Robert Brown-It wasn't as good as the Australian editorial.",36
35,Mr TAYLOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Perhaps not, but I think we have to put these into context. What, then, was Bogor all about? In brief, the Bogor summit proposes free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020 and for the industrial countries to implement the agreement by 2010. It proposes that a discriminatory free trade area be rejected, that a non-binding investment code be agreed to, that priority in industries for standards harmonisation be decided, that regular leaders and ministerial meetings be reaffirmed and that a dispute mediation process be planned. It also proposed regional support for human resource development programs and, finally, cooperation on small business and infrastructure. As the honourable member for Flinders said, Bogor is a signpost. It is a very important signpost and, indeed, I go so far as to agree that it is historic. That is the balanced comment which we continue to make from this side of the House. Mr Robert Brown-You are so gracious.",38
36,Mr TAYLOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Wait for it. There were other editorials. This is where the punch comes in terms of the Prime Minister. Geoffrey Barker, in the Financial Review of the same week, said: Paul Keating's place in Australia's political history has been sealed with yesterday'S Asia Pacific free trade agreement. Whether it will be an honoured or an accursed place will depend on the economic-political and security consequences that flow now from the Bogor pact. But it is far from risk-free for Mr Keating or for Australia for three reasons. First it remains to be seen how the disparate and far-flung APEC grouping will be able to work out the detail of yesterday'S framework agreement. For Mr Keating, the political costs will depend partly on who wins and who loses in Australia, and how smoothly the structural adjustments are made within Australia and elsewhere. Second, it remains to be seen what moral price Australia will have to pay to maintain cordial relations with partners who do not share Australia's attitudes towards human rights and political and economic probity. Finally, Paul Keating has justified the agreement on the ground that it will keep the US engaged in Asia as a force for strategic stability and democracy. He finished by saying: Unhappily the recent history of US relations with China and Japan hardly inspires confidence in US policy approaches in Asia, and President Clinton has been seriously weakened by the recent US midterm election results. To be fair, the US Senate has now endorsed the GATT arrangements, and we all should welcome that. At the same time, the opposition, in commenting on the summit's statement and declaration, said that the Bogor meeting will take APEC another step forward but that if Australia is to bind with Asia in trade terms we need to be as competitive as Asia and our infrastructure needs to match best Asian practice. We criticised in areas. We have been slow to introduce nationalÂ· trade and investment strategies that will assist our regional competitiveness. There is an increasing trend towards intra-Asia APEC trade, which potentially can render Australia redundant as a regional trading partner, and AFTA, which embraces the six ASEAN states that are also in APEC, is disadvantageous to Australia because of its discriminatory nature. There is no clear consensus on a definition of free trade, with some APEC members talking about trade liberalisation and others talking about aims and so on. The outcomes arrived at in Bogor were hardly founded on widespread unanimity. So, while the coalition is behind free trade, there is still much to be done in fleshing out the concept. We talked a little today about Malaysia. On returning from Bogor, Prime Minister Mahathir, in his usual way, made the point that he feared that the proposed biggest free trade in the world would not be a level playing field. He said this to a news conference in Kuala Lumpur when he got back: . .. in all likelihood a big gap would remain between the rich and the poor countries of the Pacific Rim. A lot of work has been done in the lead-up to Bogor, but a lot of work has to be done between now and Osaka. I conclude by saying that, like others on this side of the House, I welcome the Bogor summit and the associated declaration, but with some reservations. Those reservations are, of course, primarily aimed at the inability of this government to come to grips with micro-economic reform. domestically. The honourable member for Charlton was with me in New Zealand last week. I think that he would have to acknowledge that, if CER, for example, is to be followed through in its fullest sense, then the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has a lot to answer for in relation to what he did regarding the entry of New Zealand operators into the Australian domestic aviation environment. Irrespective of what Prime Minister Bolger has said, that will bounce around in Wellington for many months to come.",38
37,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The conclusion of the APEC deal should be one of those occasions in this House where, even if it is rare, we have a degree of bipartisan support for such an important achievement on the part of the Australian government and the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating). But, unfortunately, listening to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) today, one could hardly conclude that there was that bipartisan support. I welcome the comment by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) because it stands in stark contrast to much of the comment that came from the Leader of the Opposition in the debate earlier today. I guess all that demonstrates is what a rabble we have on the other side. Whether they are talking about trade issues or issues of privacy, there is no consistent policy line from them. Thankfully, in 20 years time, when this country is deriving the full benefit of the APEC agreement-which is denied by the Leader of the Opposition-many of those opposite will be long gone from this House. If we were to believe the Leader of the Opposition. today, there will not be very significant long-term economic and social benefits for this country. That was the hidden message in much of what he had to say. The most important thing about the APEC agreement is that it gives us tremendous optimism i' for the future. It gives this country a long term economic future which, without the agreement, would certainly be in doubt. But you cannot get a sensible contribution from the Leader of the Opposition on this question. For Australian business and for Australian growth, this is a very important agreement. It holds the prospects for vastly improved access for Australian business to some of the fastest growing markets in the world. The day-today task of doing business and trading into that region will, over time, become far easier. In the case of my own electorate, what this will mean over time for a firm like Golden Circle is vastly improved access for the export of canned fruits into the Asian market. That is repeated right across hundreds of firms in my electorate. In the past few years, we have made very significant gains in our exports into the Asian region. Trade in merchandise exports to APEC grew at more than nine per cent over the last four years, and a large percentage of this is manufactures. APEC currently takes something like two-thirds of our services exports, and they will all grow. Australia's trade links will grow with the fastest growing region in the world. What this agreement means is wealth creation and jobs, and with that comes a fairer distribution of wealth in our community. What do we get from members of the opposition? We get this constant diet of pessimism. The way they were talking about APEC, I could have sworn that they were talking about their immediate political prospects or were reflecting on the current opinion polls. In such polls, the Leader of the Opposition now has a marvellous satisfaction rating of minus 49! I agree that that constitutes considerable grounds for pessimism, but we cannot find the grounds for that pessimism in any discussion on APEC. The problem with the contribution of many of those opposite today is that they are too pessimistic about our future as a nation. The problem with that pessimism is that they will pass it on to our children. If we listen to the opposition, it is simply too easy to believe that the future holds bleak prospects, that the world is a more violent and polluted place and that there is nothing right about the future of this country, when the contrary is true. If we take all of the political debate out of a discussion about this country's future and look at the underlying fundamentals, we see that the trend in world economics is moving our way. As the Prime Minister and the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank have said, for the first time in our history we are located in the right position on the globe. APEC means that we can take maximum advantage from that. We are now closer to Asia than Europe and North America. That means we can plug into those opportunities, which is what APEC is all about. We already have a balance of payments surplus-it will be a growing surplus-with Asia, the fastest growing region in the world. The lesson from this is that we should reject the pessimism that comes from those opposite. It is a pessimism that flows from the policy and leadership paralysis on the other side. Recently in the Courier-Mail i'n Brisbane, an unnamed Liberal backbencher described the Leader of the Opposition as being like 'a mangy, stray dog that should be put down, but no-one is prepared to pay the bill'.  order. We have tolerated the member for Lilley digressing from the subject of APEC on a number of occasions. Under standing order 81, I ask you to direct him to return to the subject matter of APEC rather than make gratuitous attacks on the opposition leadership.",39
38,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I think the honourable member for Sturt has raised a reasonable point of order. I remind the honourable member for Lilley and other members in this debate that the subject matter is APEC.,40
39,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker; I take the point. I was talking about the lack of a policy and leadership alternative from those opposite. We do not have to rely on what those opposite have to say on this matter; we only have to listen to what the Premier of Victoria had to say about the contribution of the opposition front-bench on matters like APEC. He said, 'I do not know if the shadow ministry are actually doing the task as strongly as they should be at the moment. I would simply say to you: name me two or three shadow ministers in their area of responsibility who have been consistently out there in the marketplace either questioning the government or putting forward an alternative.' Where were they today when we debated this important matter of APEC? What contribution have they put forward? What did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), have to say? He did not have anything to say. He was too busy telling everybody outside the House today that he was not interested in the leadership. We get plenty of discussion about leadership from those opposite. The problem with those opposite is that they have no policy alternative on APEC or anything else. Mr Downer-You weren't here for my opening speech.",40
40,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am sorry; I was. Then again, you were too busy looking backwards rather than forwards. I can well understand that. In that context, I would like to refer to what Mr Kroger has said about the opposition front-bench. He said, 'Our failures in the' 80s were political failures.'",40
41,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Order! It being 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier this day. The debate may be resumed on APEC at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Interest Rates",40
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the futures market has now priced in a cash rate of 10Y2 per cent-four per cent higher than currentby June of next year? Is there any reason why this is wrong? Does the Treasurer have any plan to stop interest rates rising another four per cent in the next six 11?-0nths?,40
43,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The person who drew attention to this on the AM program this morning said himself that he did not believe it. I think that is a starting point for dealing with this issue. Mr Costello--He was your adviser.,40
44,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr Barry Hughes said that he and other market economists did not believe that this represented a sensible estimate of what might be the outcome for market interest rates in the near future. Mr Downer-He had a golden phrase for it.,41
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the Leader of the Opposition of standing order 55.,41
46,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And he said that, in those circumstances, the futures market was getting it wrong. It is quite clear. If even the market economists do not believe it, I do not see why the government should believe it. Mr Reith-Are you out of breath from running or because you are working on your mini-budget?",41
47,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think the Treasurer has got his breath back. The Treasurer has the call.,41
48,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government is concerned to ensure that we continue to have very strong growth in the economy, and we certainly have that now. To ensure that we continue to have it, from time to time we obviously need to adjust policy, but the importance of all of that is not to overdo it and to bring us to the point where we go back into a recession. There are no boom and bust signs in the economy at the present. We have very strong growth with very low inflation. In those circumstances, it is ridiculous to talk about boom and bust. We have a government which has been prepared already to take action in respect of both the monetary policy and fiscal policy fronts. The government has indicated that it will be prepared to take what further measures might be necessary to ensure that we can have sustained strong growth of the economy with low inflation, and that is what we will continue to do. Economic Growth",41
49,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the September quarter that level. national accounts which showed the economy is growing strongly. How does this growth compare with economic forecasts and with g-owth in other OECD countries? What f implications do these accounts have for future growth of the economy?,41
50,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We certainly do have very strong growth, as the questioner mentioned. According to our September quarter national accounts, there has been a growth of 6.4 per cent in GDP over the last year, which is very strong growth indeed. Non-farm growth is 7.3 per cent, which is extremely strong growth for that sector. The reason for the difference between the two is that, because of the drought, the rural sector showed an 18 per cent decline, but that still left us with a stunningly high figure of 6.4 per cent. It is worth noting that, in the last 12 months, the manufacturing sector had growth of 12.2 per cent. So we are seeing very strong growth in the economy overall; and manufacturing, which for decades has been in the doldrums, has now, under this government, become a very strong growth factor in the economy and is growing at 12.2 per cent. We have seen private business investment growing at 22 per cent over the last 12 months and plant and equipment at 29Y2 per cent. It is interesting to compare those figures with the sorts of comments that were made by the opposition after the budget. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in June that 'business investment is dead in the water,' 'there has been simply no recovery in investment in Australia,' 'business investment is being hamstrung' and 'clearly business investment is still dragging the chain'. What have we had over the last 12 months? Twenty-nine per cent increase in business investment in plant and equipment and 22 per cent overall. These dooms ayers opposite would have the nation believe that we are in diabolical circumstances. They never want to acknowledge that the economy might be doing very well indeed and they never want to look forward to good outcomes. They poured scorn over the 14Y2 per cent forecast in the budget for business investment-and at the present time business investment is running at well above We also saw four per cent growth of productivity in terms of GDP per hour in the non-farm market sector, which is very strong growth of productivity. That obviously helps our international competitiveness and keeps inflation down. Employment is up by 4.1 per cent over the 12 months to the September quarter. So we have four per cent growth in productivity and 4.1 per cent in employment. Prices are virtually stable according to the implicit price deflator for the gross non-farm product. There was a 0.1 per cent increase in that index in the September quarter and a 1.1 per cent increase for the 12 months. So we have very strong growth of the economy with very low inflation. Along with that, real household disposable incomes, which is where people's living standards get their boost from, increased by five per cent despite the drought. Allowing for a population increase, that gives us a 3.9 per cent increase in the last 12 months in real household disposable income. So in real terms the people of Australia were substantially better off on average to the tune of about four per cent per household over the last 12 months in disposable income, the cash that they had in their hands to spend. That obviously is a very encouraging factor. Mr Downer-You are losing your audience.",41
51,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition can eat his heart out over it. Along with that, savings have also improved. The gross savings in the economy increased from 16.7 per cent of GDP a year ago to 18.2 per cent in that quarter-up by 1.5 per cent of GDPwhilst investment went up by one per cent. So we reduced the investment saving gap somewhat, and that is certainly moving in the right direction. Altogether, it is clear that the economy is moving in a very encouraging way. There has been strong growth of output, business investment, employment, productivity, real household disposable incomes and saving-all with low inflation. Is it any wonder that, in the light of that, such a harsh critic of the government as Mr Ian Spicer, Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said this in September 1994 about the national accounts: Economic statistics just do not get any better the September quarter national accounts They just 'do not get any better'. On the basis of all those numbers, one can see what he was talking about with so many fundamentals coming right for us. The question also asked me to compare our growth with the growth in other countries and with budget forecasts. Other OECD countries have generally not been growing very strongly-only Norway has grown faster than us in the last 12 months. Our growth of 6.4 per cent was the second highest growth of all industrialised countries over the last 12 months. That, of course, is something we can be very proud of. That is in comparison with the budget forecast-we said 4Y2 per cent-that was lampooned by the opposition as being unachievable. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was absurd to suggest that we could get that kind of growth and that it was based on hope more than real calculation. But the fact is that the economy appears to be growing more than that 4Y2 per cent, despite the intensification of the drought. We are looking at an economy which is producing the sorts of things that Australian people want. They want more jobs, which are coming in profusion. They want real increases in wages, and that is happening. They want improved real disposable incomes, and that is happening. They want to see the economy generally getting stronger, and that is happening. Taxation",42
52,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that the President of the ACTU, Mr Martin Ferguson, has suggested that an increase in taxation would lead to a union led wages explosion? Given the comments of Mr Ferguson, will the government now abandon plans to increase tax in order to avoid a wages explosion?",42
53,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me welcome the Leader of the Opposition back and say that we are very pleased to see that he is still in the job. I have seen Mr Ferguson's comments. He was commenting on the possibility of there being an increase in taxes. The government has than made no decision to increase any taxes. If the government were to make that decision, then it would have to decide how best to do that. As has been made quite clear to this stage, the government has made no decision to increase taxes. Therefore, any questions about how we might do it are obviously premature. Pay Television: Information Superhighway",42
54,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister advise the House of recent developments concerning regulation of broadband cable networks for business and entertainment and how this will impact on the provision of pay television and other services? Can he also advise of alternative options for the development of the so termed information superhighway?,43
55,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Werriwa for his continuing interest in issues involving the information superhighway, including public access through public libraries. On 24 November I announced the government's policy on the two major proposals for investment in cable infrastructure to deliver broadband services-proposals by Telstra and News Ltd on the one hand and the Optus Vision consortium on the other. Mr Downer-Did you go to cabinet with the decision?",43
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,43
57,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Austel, as the relevant regulatory authority, examined both of these proposals and reported to meMr Downer-It was not even considered by cabinet.",43
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is understanding order 55, disorderly behaviour: when a member is on his feet he should be heard in silence. The Leader of the Opposition has been on auto-jibber since question time began. I ask you to bring him to order. Mr Downer-On the point of order, with your indulgence, I was simply asking whether this matter went to the cabinet or whether it did not. The fact is: it did not, which, I must $ay, is a curious matter. /'",43
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is not a point of order. Resume your seat. I remind honourable membersMr Moore-Why don't you treat the Prime Minister like that?,43
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Are you ever going to sit the Prime Minister down? Mr Downer-No, I don't think so.",43
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Mr Downer-He gets up there and,43
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He tells you what to do.,43
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable Leader of the Opposition on a number of occasions now has chosen to make some comments about the chair. Under the terms of standing orders, there are appropriate methods whereby he might take that further. Mr Downer-I am aware of that.",43
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he has some specific concerns, he might like to do so. Otherwise, I remind him again of standing order 55. The Leader of the House has made a valid point. The minister has the call and will be heard.",43
65,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I asked Austel, as the relevant authority, to examine both of the proposals. I intend to table Austel's report to me at the end of this answer. Austel considered three elements in examining the two proposals. First of all, in telephony, Austel found that both proposals were consistent with the government's policy for interconnection and non-discriminatory access. In the area of broadband services, which covers things such as home shopping, educational applications and business applications, the government is very keen to see a new industry develop in Australia producing these types of interactive services. The government has made it clear for some time that it wants to encourage this industry by having an open access regime on the cable infrastructure. Certainly, for broadband services, I restated the government's view that there should be open access in the delivery of these broadband services on these cables. This was in accordance with the interim report of the broadband services expert group which reported earlier this year. If we really want to encourage the development of this type of Australian content here at home, we have to make sure that these people can sell their wares to people right across the country. That can happen only if we have an open access regime. Pay TV is more complex. Austel made it clear to me that there are certain difficulties if there is limited capacity, and you have that limited capacity because there are only approximately 30 to 60 channels available on an analog system delivering pay TV. Even Hilmer, which looks at providing access to essential infrastructure, says that there are difficulties in providing access when all of the capacity is used up. So on pay TV, the government believes that we could encourage a more speedy roll-out if we gave the builders of the cable a chance to earn some revenue from the content as well as the carriage of services on the cable. That is what we did. We allowed a limited period, at least until July 1997, of managed or controlled access to pay TV on these broadband cables. But we emphasise that the Trade Practices Act still applies. Since my speech of a couple of weeks ago, there has been some speculation that the Optus Vision proposal first might have been scrapped, and today there has been further speculation that it might have been revived. But one thing is clear; that is, that Optus Vision, in all of its discussions with me, has been seeking two things: first of all, closed access to the cable network indefinitely; and, secondly, monopoly rights or exclusive franchises throughout the country-neither of which the government or I was prepared to give. But it is always interesting to see what views are being put forward by the opposition and what might become policy if it were in charge of making policy decisions on cable. At a time when this government is encouraging more competition in aviation, post and state monopolies, what is the opposition's view in these areas? The opposition's view, expressed by its spokesman on communications, Senator Alston-this was said the day after I delivered my speech-is this: The regional franchise arrangement has worked well in the United Kingdom and the United States. It could have worked here. There we have Senator Alston, the opposition's official spokesman on cable and communications, saying that he would have wanted to sit there with the big map of Australia, drawing the lines on the map and saying, 'This part of Australia is to be an exclusive monopoly for Optus. This part of the country is to be an exclusive monopoly for Telecom.' No competitive forces whatsoever. That is the view of the so-called free enterprise party in Australia at the moment. If you look further, Mr Speaker, other members of the opposition have also put out statements on this issue. The day after the speech we even had a rare statement from the Leader of the Opposition on communications policy. What was his view on the government's policy? He said that it was my decision to allow Telstra News to limit access to its cable TV network for up to five years, despite the fact that Australia is supposed to be moving to a fully deregulated telecommunications environment in July 1997. What is clear is that, in that statement, the Leader of the Opposition was saying that he wanted limited access for a shorter period. So that is the view of the Leader of the Opposition. When I said that it has to remain closed at least until July 1997, he said that was too long; he wanted limited access for a shorter period. But the same day that the Leader of the Opposition was putting out that statement, the Australian of the next day was saying this: The opposition spokesman, Senator Alston, said, 'The government should have given Optus a longer period of protection from free access.' So Senator Alston is arguing for a longer period of limited access on the same day that the Leader of the Opposition is arguing for a shorter period. Is it any wonder that we do not know who really speaks for the opposition on this or other issues? Mr Downer-I didn't say that.",43
66,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What didn't you say? You did not say what was put out in the press release in your name. Is that what you are telling us? You did not say what is attributed to your name? Mr Downer-Did it go to cabinet or caucus? Cabinet never discussed the proposal.,44
67,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You did not say what Cheryl Cartwright or Simon Troeth put out in your name? Apparently we cannot even believe anything the Leader of the Opposition's press releases say these days. Mr Downer-Caucus knows nothing about this-no members-nothing,45
68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will not be baited by the minister. The minister might draw his answer to a close.,45
69,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is clear is that we have an opposition that is arguing for monopoly rights and for communications cable throughout the country. We have confusion between the Leader of the Opposition and his spokesman on communications about what they really want. Is it any wonder people believe that this government is going to be in power for some time to come? I table the report. Fuel Oil Excise,45
70,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. I remind the minister of the government's incompetence when in the August 1993 budget fuel oil excise was increased by 55 per cent and then reduced inÂ· the May 1994 budget because of the disastrous impact on the mining and shipping industries. In the light of this embarrassing miscalculation, is the minister aware that to abolish the diesel fuel rebate scheme for mining would do far more economic damage, with the cost of mining increasing by over $600 million a year? Will the minister give an undertaking not to damage our major exporting industry and retain the diesel fuel rebate scheme, or will the government once again tax the mining and farming industries without considering the consequences?",45
71,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. No-one understands more than I do the importance of the Australian mining industry to the economy and the fact that it underpins 40 per cent of our exports. The , resource sector is absolutely crucial to the future prosperity of the Australian economy, but any questions on tax should be addressed to the Treasurer. Management Training Courses",45
72,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Finance aware of a number of innovative management training courses being marketed overseas? Can he inform the House as to the content of such courses and whether he proposes to introduce them to improve financial management and accountability in the Commonwealth Public Service? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister at the dispatch box is the Minister for Finance. The question was directed to the Minister for Finance. I ask you to consider whether that falls within the ambit of his portfolio as it is not the normal dorothy dixer in question time.",45
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I understood the question went to financial accountability. As he is the Minister for Finance, he is entitled to answer. Mr Downer-It has nothing to do with it.",45
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the question, in case you have not checked my mandate as Minister for Finance, you will discover that I also happen to be the minister in charge of public sector reform, instructions to the public sector and training programs associated with it. I have a substantial area of responsibility in the public sector. I am aware of a document that fits the general description of the honourable member in asking this question. In the various organisations, agencies and departments which comprise the Commonwealth public sector, one of the most important challenges facing staff is dealing with people: dealing with clients, members of the general public and fellow staff members. As the Minister for Finance, I am always interested in new ideas for improving productivity and effectiveness of the Commonwealth sector. A special one-day course put on by a British group has been drawn to my attention quite recently. The course is called 'How to handle difficult people'. It has been developed by Pryor Resources Inc. The course offers 17 powerful skills for dealing with different types of difficult people. In all, seven different types of difficult people are identified and training is given on how to handle each. Of the seven types, starting with the autocratic dictator to the fault finder and so on, it is the seventh that probably has the most relevance to Australia at the moment. It is called the 'downer'. The first characteristic of the 'downer' is that they feel they are life's victims and, second, they claim that things will always get worse. Mr Abbott- Mr SPEAKER Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",45
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Warringah was already on his feet. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Leader of the House is, quite frankly, insulting this institution to carry on with that kind of palaver.

79,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"I thank the House for its overwhelming support. The third characteristic of the 'downer' is that they assess everything in negative terms. The fourth is that attack optimistic and positive attitudes. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point order. Under standing order 145 this is clearly irrelevant. You know, we know, they know that this is irrelevant. You have a duty to uphold the standing orders. You should sit this minister down and in that way perhaps attempt to restore some respectability to proceedings of the House.",47

90,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Leader of the House the is now being assisted by the member for Melbourne Ports on a point of order.,47
91,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,The point of order is simply that the House has voted to hear the minister answer the question. The point of order is that the point of order taken by the honourable gentleman opposite constitutes a reflection on the decision of the House,47
92,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! Resume your seat. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is entitled, as any member of this House is, to raise a point of order. He has done so and he has raised a particular issue. However, the Leader of the House has said that he is concluding his answer and I invite him to do",47
93,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,The cost of this course is to Â£89 plus VAT. I do think there is a group in this chamber who could well benefit from undertaking it. Economy,47
94,Mr VAILE,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to today's comment by Dr Barry Hughes that any tightening in monetary policy in the short term would lead to yet another Australian recession in two years time. Given that Dr Hughes is a former economic adviser to the Prime Minister and close confidante, does the Treasurer concur with his view? Do we risk a recession in two years time?",48
95,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"I do not have the transcript of Dr Hughes's interview but, having listened to it, I do not recall him saying what the honourable member imputes to him. In any case, let me assure the House that we have no intention of putting the economy into a slide back to very low growth or recession. The whole of the use of policy in the current - ircumstances, which are, of course, exceedmgly buoyant and beneficial, is to temper that growth to ensure that it is sustainable. The use of policy levers, so far as they are used the future, will be to that effect. I can assure the House that we are not going to go back to anything like what happened in 1989. We have quite different circumstances from those that existed in 1989. We do not have the inflation of 1989 when inflation was running around seven per cent. We have inflation now of around two per cent, so it is a very different situation. We do not have the asset speculation that we had at that time. In fact, there are some signs that the prices of some assets, particularly in the housing sector, are starting to come down. So we are not in circumstances anything like we had in 1989. In those circumstances, I expect that we have very good expectations of being able to temper the growth and being able to pursue a course, aided and abetted by the fact that !he world economy is continuing to improve Its performance. That will assist us to improve our growth and to do it in a very sustainable way through the improvement of commodity prices and export volumes and so assist us to maintain strong growth without current account problems becoming such as to cause that growth to be severely restricted. That is the kind of outlook that we legitimately have a the present time, and the use of policy will be pursued to that end. Victorian Health System",48
96,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I refer the minister to the massive public concern about the management of the Victorian health system. I note that the Commonwealth provides about $1 billion per year to that system through the Victorian government and directly to the Victorian public. What action has the minister taken to ensure that all Victorians get access to an adequate and appropriate health system? In particular, does she have concern about recent Victorian legislation proposing that those managing nursing homes can operate without employing a single qualified nurse?",48
97,Dr LAWRENCE,PAIRS,"Like, I hope, every member of this chamber, I am very well aware of the steady stream of public comin plaints about the Victorian health system, mcluding from members of this House and the member who asked the question. There has been widespread public concern following significant cuts in the Victorian health system. I think that, when the Victorian government first began the process of improving efficiencies and introducing casemix, there was very much a wait and see attitude by the community and by the health bureaucrats. But what we have seen is increasing concern from the community-not about the introduction of casemix but about the very significant cuts in funding. The member is right to draw attention to the fact that this is not the result of reductions of Commonwealth funding. The taxpayers' funds through the Commonwealth have, in fact, been increasing. The Victorian government adopts the extraordinary position of calling on the Commonwealth to increase funding to the Victorian health system at the same time as it is significantly reducing funds from its own sources. Just to give the member some indication of the extent of that problem, the Medicare agreements required an extra $280 million to be paid into Victorian hospitals. It is correct to say that, in 1994-95, there will be $1.1 billion from the taxpayers through the Commonwealth to the Victorian government. Nationwide, there has been a significant increase but the Victorian government was a particular beneficiary. But at the same time as there have been these significant increases, the Victorian health budget was cut by 15 per cent over the last three years. The Leader of the Opposition appears to find this whole thing amusing. A 15 per cent cut, as the member knows, is starting to produce very significant strains on the system to the extent that, on a daily basis, one of the local newspapers actually carries a column detailing the problems faced by patients in Victoria. In Victoria, $200 million has been taken out of the hospital system in two years. Outpatient services, in particular, and accident and emergency services have been placed under enormous pressure. If members opposite are complacent about the fact that there regular reports of elderly patients, for example, waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency services, then I feel very sorry for them indeed. Funds for outpatients alone have been cut by $24 million this year and there have been cost shiftings from the state government to the Commonwealth and, ironically, from the state government to the private health sector. The minister concerned is one of the first to cry foul when she believes there is any decline in private health insurance, but is the first to shift costs to the private health insurance industry. It is no wonder the system is fracturing. As the Commonwealth minister, I feel a deep sense of responsibility to draw this to the attention of the public and to make sure that we can reverse this trend-if not by directi ves under the Medicare agreement then certainly by public embarrassment. I think the public deserve to understand that, in Victoria, we have seen a rash of bed closures. It is inevitable that we will have a lower level of services. Over 250 beds have been closed in Victoria: in Monash Medical Centre, 80; in Box Hill Medical Centre, 39; in the Alfred Hospital, 78; in St Vincent's Hospital, 26; ,!).nd, in the Dandenong hospital, 45. We have also seen the rules being changed midstream. We had a bonus pool of funding, which the hospitals all bid for to reduce their waiting lists. What do they find? At the critical moment, it has dried up. The hospitals have already run over budget and they are having to close beds. Mr Downer-What did you do when you were in state politics? You bankrupted a state. You broke a whole state.",48
98,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Leader of the Opposition!,49
99,Dr LAWRENCE,PAIRS,They are having to close beds. Mr Downer-How dare you come in here and say that?,49
100,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Leader of the Opposition!,49
101,Dr LAWRENCE,PAIRS,"The member has also are drawn attention to another significant problem: that is, the Victorian minister responsible for aged care has moved to remove certain protections from nursing homes in Victoria and, in particular, would seek to remove the nursing care component from hospital care. I am very pleased to indicate to the member that, through the Commonwealth standards, we are able to ensure that nurses will remain part of nursing homes in Victoria, despite the attempt by the Victorian minister responsible apparently to remove that element of care. There are other elements of that legislation about which I have grave concern. I have had discussions with the minister about that. Mr Downer-Go on-with your record!",49
102,Dr LAWRENCE,PAIRS,"Despite some of the comments that I have heard wafting across with the breeze from the Leader of the Opposition, I think it is fair to say that it is not because the Victorian government is short of money; it is because it has wrong priorities. At the same time that these funds are being pulled out of the system, Victoria is the most heavily taxed state in the country. Each Victorian is being asked to pay $2,006 for the pleasure of funding a grand prix worth $100 million and $30 million on improving ministers' offices. That $30 million, which could be used in the hospitals, is being spent on upgrading ministers' offices. One hundred million dollars, which could be spent on accidents and emergency, is being used on the Grand Prix. I think it is time that Mr Kennett and his minister returned some of that money where it belongs, to ensuring a decent health system in Victoria. Cut out the circuses; let have some more of the bread. Carbon Tax",49
103,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"My question is adcollected dressed to the Minister for Resources. Acthe cording to press reports, the government is considering introducing a carbon tax or energy tax. Would the minister support such world. a tax?",50
104,Mr BEDDALL,PAIRS,"Again, the question of taxation should be addressed to the Treasurer. Any move to introduce a carbon tax would have to be viewed very carefully.",50
105,Unknown,PAIRS,Opposition members interjecting,50
106,Mr BEDDALL,PAIRS,You do not want to listen. Mrs Bishop-We are listening.,50
107,Mr BEDDALL,PAIRS,"Australia is a major user of carbon fuels, particularly coal, which fundamental benchmark of our economy. Any carbon tax would have to be very carefully balanced to make sure that it did not impact upon the coal industry, which is absolutely crucial to the economic future of Australia. Therefore, I think that will be taken into sideration. I am not aware of any proposal introduce a carbon tax. Family Law: Child Support",50
108,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PAIRS,I refer the Assistmented. ant Treasurer to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues concerning child support. What are the cations of that report? What is the minister's initial response to it?,50
109,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"I thank the member for his should question. I agree with the committee that the child support scheme has changed the attichildren tudes of parents, when they do separate, to financial support of their children. Currently, 240,000 kids around Australia receive average of $51 a week. The government up the child support scheme for the benefit Australian kids, and it is in that context that we will consider the committee's recommendations. I signal that there are two areas where the government believes the committee is wrong. Firstly, the committee is wrong when it us claims that the agency collects only 42 per cent of the debt. This year, the CSA has collected 75 per cent of net liabilities. Since the scheme started in 1988, the CSA has 68 per cent of all debt. Despite what committee says, these figures include all default assessments and they exclude private arrangements. This is clearly the best in the Secondly, more than 40 recommendations deal with the child support formula. These will be carefully considered, but the committee's preferred model would leave most custodial parents and their children worse off while giving the greatest benefit to non-custodial parents earning more than $66,000 a year. The government agrees with the committee that a code of conduct for the CSA should be established. In fact, I discussed this matter with the Register of the is the CSA, Michael Carmody, last week and we have agreed that a charter will be established in consultation with community groups. I can assure the committee that the government will give its recommendations thoughtful consideration, although many of the conrecommendations have been implemented to already. These include: 90 per cent of phone calls now answered in three minutes or less and a faster turnaround of correspondence. National guidelines have already been impleOver the next six months 150 extra staff will be allocated to tackle arrears, and a national training program has been impleimplimented focusing on client services. Finally, I agree with the thrust of the committee's report that the government keep out of the private lives of separated parents so long as the well-being of their is assured. We agree that the private the arrangements should be encouraged, and I am happy to say that this year more than 50 per an cent of separated couples are now making set private arrangements. We will be making of every effort to do what we can to encourage this trend. I must add that at all times it is the children who will be the main focus of our child support arrangements. Carbon Tax",50
110,Mr COSTELLO,PAIRS,"In light of the answer over of the Minister for Resources about the disadvantages of a carbon tax or an enviAsian ronmentallevy, and given Senator Faulkner's Indonesia. advocacy of an environmental levy, could the Treasurer please explain to the House whether the government is investigating a proposal a carbon tax or environmental levy? Could he please state whether he agrees with Minister Beddall or Minister Faulkner?",51
111,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"There is no proposition with before the government at this stage for a carbon tax or an environmental levy. What might come before it is a matter for the future, but there is no such proposal at the present time. The question therefore does have any basis in fact. Tourism",51
112,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"Can the Minister for Tourism outline to the House the significance of the release today of the Tourism ing Council's international tourist arrival forecasts, and what are the ramifications of these forecasts for investment in the tourism industry?",51
113,Mr LEE,PAIRS,"I can certainly assure you, Mr Speaker, and the honourable member for Capricornia that the government is very stand pleased with the first forecasts which have been released by the Tourism Forecasting Council. I would have hoped that these forecasts would have been of as much interest industry. to members of the opposition as they are to members of the government, who are very keen to see more jobs and investment created in the Australian tourism industry. In particuthe lar, we are very keen to overcome some the confusion that has been around and about in the tourism industry in the past because the different forecasts that have duced for the growth in the numbers of To international visitors to Australia. For that reason,. the government is pleased that the Tourism Forecasting Council has today put out its first publication which suggests that it expects 6.3 million internaForce , tional visitors to come to Australia in the year 2000. There are three million today-that is three times what we had a decade ago-and the Tourism Forecasting Council is expecting six million by the year 2000. Most of the growth is expected to continue to come from countries like South Korea, Taiwan and We are very pleased that the Australian Tourist Commission and the Bureau of Tourfor ism Research have now agreed not to continue issuing their public targets and forecasts, which did produce a bit of confusion in the financial sector in particular. We believe that the Tourism Forecasting Council taking on the role of producing the one set of figures-the one reliable set of figures for the whole of the tourism industry-it will be easier for developers to convince financiers to not lend them money to get new projects up' and running. We also believe that it will give operators confidence to look at improving and embellishing their particular resorts and projects, knowing that this massive expansion is expected and will be greeted with great Forecastconfidence by the government. If we look at what is happening to occupancy rates in hotels around the country, we see that in parts of the country such as Cairns, the Gold Coast and Perth shortages are already starting to emerge. It is very important that the proponents and the financiers now underthat opportunities will emerge in the not too distant future and that people do their best to see if we can encourage more investment and more jobs in the Australian tourism . Defence: Air Traffic Control",51
114,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I address my question to Minister for Defence Science and Personof nel. On 3 November 1994, you provided me with a written response to my question withof out notice of 18 October 1994. In that letter been proyou advised me as follows: date the air force has had no difficulty in manning its air traffic control functions. Yesterday in the House you reinforced that statement. Is it not a fact that on 4 November a high level meeting was convened at the Air Office to 'discuss a range of problems with the provision of ATC services throughout the airforce'? Minister, are you aware that the minutes of this meeting, which I have here, state: Many bases are experiencing manning shortfalls and this is impacting on the provision of ATe services. Recruiting cannot correct this proble- for three years. Was the only outcome of this important meeting to increase manning levels at two critical bases by the further reduction of services at other bases? When will you recognise the truth of this situation-now or, like the Minister for Transport, after a series of fatal air crashes?  member for his question and the opportunity that it provides me to give him a full and detailed answer in this place. Let me say at the outset that the opposition will get nowhere with the defence community by casting reflections on the upper senior management of Defence and how it is handling this issue or any other issue.",51
115,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,They are sending me the information.,52
116,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The member for O'Connor, you might want to listen to the answer to your question.  ber should know is that the Chief of the Air Staff himself is following this issue on almost a daily basis to ensure that the advice that I am giving to this place is correct.",52
117,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I bet he is.  to inform the honourable member about a number of things he has raised. There was a meeting held on 4 November to plan for what is described, quite accurately by the CAS himself, as the likely loss of controllers CAA in the forthcoming years. There is-I was advised as late as yesterday-still no manning crisis, despite the best efforts of the member for O'Connor to say that there is. Strategies to accommodate the anticipated resignations have been detailed in a number of various forums. The honourable member has repeated this business about the three-year waiting list. The statement about there being a three-year waiting list before new recruits are fully operational is, I am advised, incorrect. Air traffic control recruits take about 18 months to receive their first effective on-the-job qualification. All controllers, be they CAA or Defence, are supervised in one form or another and steps are being taken to ensure that the proper level of supervision will be available when the number of graduate controllers increases. Let me also say to the House that, as of the second of this month, the air traffic control specialisation strength is 248 on an establishment of 264-a manning level of 94 per cent of its normal establishment. The Chief of the Air Staff has personally advised me and Senator Ray that this level is manageable and does not compromise safety. Air traffic control manning, at various and individual bases, can vary in comparison to posted strength for a number of reasons, such as recreation leave, training, job rating and so forth. From time to time, base commanders do adjust the level of air traffic control support to accord with available resources. But I stress, and the air force stresses, that safety is not compromised. If the honourable member wants to know further what action is being taken on this matter, the Chief of the Air Staff further advised me yesterday that air traffic controllers are being taken out of general jobs and being put back into their specialisation for the time being. That is, supervisors at the squadron leader rank are being pulled back into the line functions. He is also looking at a number of issues that I have discussed with him, such as lateral recruitment from overseas, bearing in mind that the English, American and Canadian armed forces are downgrading their to the numbers by far greater percentages and absolute numbers than we are. He is also looking at the increased use and recruitment of reservists in this function and at a number of other options. Mr Downer-You said we didn't have a problem. Is it a problem?  Leader of the Opposition saying it is an enormous problem. The member for O'Connor some time ago on Darwin radio went as far as to say that we have reduced air traffic controllers by about 50 per cent--or words to that effect. We are at 94 per cent establishment. Mr Thckey-No, we are not. I had better bring you around my letters.  vice. A lot of things have been said about this, including by the member for O'Connor the other week when he interjected on the Prime Minister, saying that the Prime Minister was not taking seriously an incident that happened in Williamtown and that people were being shot at. No-one got shot at. If the member for O'Connor is serious about the welfare of the air force on this issue and wants a full briefing from CAS, I will organise it. I say to the member for O'Connor that they are the facts. Mr Thckey-I seek leave to table the minutes of the meeting to which I refer. Leave not granted.",52
118,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health and it refers to the education of nurses, which I know all members in this place are interested in. Could the minister please advise us of what progress has been made on the national review of nurse education?",53
119,Dr LAWRENCE,PAIRS,"I know the member has a particular interest in this matter, as I am sure most members do. Members will be pleased to know that the national review of nurse education will be released on Thursday of this week. It indicates very strongly the strong regard with which the government holds the profession. A lot of effort has gone into enhancing the status of nursing and improving nurse education and training, particularly over the last decade. If we look over that time, we see a remarkable change: a transfer from hospital based training and relatively low status for the nursing profession to full tertiary education-something I am very pleased to see, particularly because it is largely still a female profession and represents a significant advance for a great many women. We have seen not only full tertiary education but improved access to further education and that has meant much better retention within the profession. We have seen further skill development, highly specialised nursing and, as I said, strong recognition and improved status. The recommendations in the report outline a blueprint for the future, with improvements in career paths not just for registered nurses but between assistants in nursing, enrolled nurses and registered nurses. So we have movement through a career path. The recommendations will also ensure that there are increased efforts on nursing research. I am pleased to say that the NHMRC is focusing on nursing research as one of its priorities. The report also recommends strategies to improve the extent to which undergraduate courses focus on the health care needs of disadvantaged groups. My department is currently trying to ensure that there are pilot projects to meet these needs. Nursing Mr Reid - You are talking about a report that will be tabled on Thursday.",53
120,Dr LAWRENCE,PAIRS,"I will be happy to provide to the member who is interested a copy of the full report. I hope other members will show the same interest he appears to have in this matter. It shows that the government, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Human Services and Health have regard for nurses. This is not universally shared, I am sad to say, by some politicians. I note some disparaging comments were made by Mr Borbidge, the Queensland Leader of the Opposition, who basically claimed that nurses were overpaid. He seemed to be incapable of recognising that, if we are to maintain a high quality of care in our system, there must be decent career paths and reasonable salaries and that nurses make an enormous contribution to the quality of health care in Australia. I am delighted that this review will provide a vi-al building block in the further development of that quality.",53
121,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Hansard Report: Interjections Mr GmSON- Mr Speaker, my question to you refers to a matter of public importance debate that occurred in this House on 15 November. When the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) rose to make his response to the matter of public importance, there were a series of interjections made by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). One very clear interjection that was made by the member for Higgins-I was in the chamber at the time and heard it was, 'Now we know why the Right did you over. You looked pretty good after Tom Domican had finished with you, didn't you?' It was only yesterday that I got to check the Hansard record of the debate on that day. I found that there is no written record of this interjection. Yet there were written records of a number of other interjections. I checked with the Minister for Social Security as to his recollection of events and he confirmed with me that it was his recollection that that interjection occurred, and I also heard a tape.",53
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"And what is your question? Mr GmSON-My question to you, Mr Speaker, is: can the written record of Hansard be corrected to include this offensive interjecSpeaker, tion and can the member for Higgins be required to withdraw the remark?",54
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! I can respond to the honourable member by saying that if the chair did not draw attention to a remark which was made by way of interjection in this place then it is not recorded in Hansard. That is the end of the matter. NA,54
124,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",54
125,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,54
126,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, I do-grievously.",54
127,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,54
128,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in question time: . . . the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is calling for a cut in the deficit of more than $11.7 billion this year. That was another example of the champion deceiver at it again.

133,Mr COSTELLO,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I said: I didn't say at any stage that you'd cut Government expenditure by eleven point seven billion dollars, I was asked what the budget deficit should be, and I said it should be less than this year's deficit which is eleven point seven billion dollars. The Government has to produce a deficit less than the projected deficit for next year which is ten billion dollars, and the Government's got to do that by treating the expenditure side. The statement by the Prime Minister was entirely false.",54

138,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Today the Sydney Morning Herald published a front page article which suggested that I was part of a group which sought to destabilise the parliamentary leadership of the Liberal Party. I can assure the House and my parliamentary colleagues that the article and the assertions about me are without any foundation and totally inaccurate. I object to the lack of professionalism from the journalists concerned and in future ask that they deal directly with me.  to make a personal explanation.,54

140,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Please proceed.  getting the collection rate wrong. The assertion was made that default assessments are included in debt. I refer the House to ANAO report No. 39 page 15, recommendation 2. The ATO response states: CSA does not accept that 2.5 times AWE default assessments (or a 'realistic estimate') should be reported as outstanding debts. I think that vindicates me. In terms of the private collection rate being included in the case load, that is based on CSA advice. In relation to reducing the cap on noncustodial parents from 2'h times average weekly earnings to twice average weekly earnings, I refer the House to page 338 of the report and point out that the original advisory group recommended the same thing. It was changed to 2.5 because it was feared that some custodial parents would not be able to get a departure application from the Family Court. With the introduction of the child support review process, that no longer is the case, and the justification for keeping no longer exists. This was submitted in a letter from the Department of Social Security. Mr Downer-The minister misled the House, did he?",55
141,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! Charges such as that can be made only by substantive motion. Mr Downer-I think the member ought to move such a motion.,55

148,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is no problem at all with such a point as made by the Leader of the Opposition in the course of a debate.

150,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In his remarks, the Prime Minister said: The Leader of the Opposition . . . is calling for cuts in the deficit of the order of $6 billion to $7 billion. I have never said anything of the sort. It is totally untrue and grossly dishonest.",55

155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government's economic strategy, which is leading to higher interest and higher taxes. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",58
156,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is no matter of more importance to the people of Australia this Christmas than what is going to happen to interest rates. If they happen to be young home buyers, if they happen to be hanging on to mortgages, if they happen to be in rural parts of Australia where they are paying for equipment, machinery and land or if they happen to be in small business with overdrafts and are worrying about trading conditions, nothing is more important to them or weighs more heavily on their minds than interest rates. Interest rates in Australia are already high. They are high by world standards and they are high in real terms. As a result of this government's policy, as a result of the wanton failure of this Treasurer (Mr Willis), those interest rates are going to go spiralling upwards over the course of next year. As the Economist reports this week, Australia has the highest prime bank interest rates in the industrialised world. It is an incontrovertible fact. It is there in black and white- It has been the case for some time. It is a direct measure of this government's economic policy. Even if you look at the three-month money market, you will find that, again, Australia is right up there at the top, exceeded only by Italy and Sweden in relation to the interest rates that already apply in this country. When it comes to interest rates, we have Economy' seen it all before. We saw the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) do it in 1986. We saw him do it in 1989. We are seeing him do it again in 1994. This is a one-stunt government when it comes to interest rates. Every time there is a little bit of life in the economy, the Prime Minister reaches for the interest rate gun and shoots home buyers, farmers, small business rates people and those who have to rely on borrowings to run their businesses. When the home variable mortgage rates in 1986 went to 15.5 per cent, the real interest rate was only six per cent. When the Prime Minister took them to 17 per cent in 1989, the real interest rate was between eight and nine per cent. Do you know what the real interest rate in Australia is today? It is already eight per cent. In real terms; it is already higher than it was in 1986. It is almost the same as it was in 1989. In real terms, we are right back where we were. during the high interest rate strategy when the current Prime Minister was a failure as Treasurer. It was those interest rates-the home variable mortgage rates which got to 17 per cent-that led to the recession we had to have. In real terms, they have already passed the 1986 high point and are approaching the 1989 high point-the rate which threw Australia into recession. If AustrC;llians wanted some good news for Christmas, they did not get it this morning on AM. On AM, Dr Barry Hughes, one of this government's great economic advisers, made the obvious point that, to see where interest rates are going, you should have a look at the futures market-people who are making financial decisions by buying and selling on the expectation of what interest rates will be. Dr Barry Hughes said: The futures market has priced in now a rate' of about-a cash rate of about 10Y2 per cent. . . Four per cent higher than we currently have by about June next year, June 1995. That is four per cent higher by June 1995. What are we up to now? December 1994. He went on to say: . . . it can be distributed in quite a number but that's one scenario that could come-increases in February, increases in March, increases in July, taking us to 10.5 per cent. The tight monetary policy of taking cash to 1.0Y2 per cent is p-et-y pricing in another receSSIOn 10 1996-97, If It were to happen. It is the same old scenario, the same old failure and the same old abrogation of responsibility that we saw in the 1980s. The government has already predicted a rise of four per cent by June next year-the same old recession. You only have to listen to the rhetoric. It is the same old rhetoric. I think the poor old Treasurer does it subconsciously. He got up here in question time with beautiful economic numbers, a great conjunction of figures, and used exactly the same language that was used in 1988-89. Mr Knott interjecting",58
157,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You probably were not literate enough to read in 1988-89. But if you had been, you would have been reading the Prime Minister: 'a beautiful set of numbers', 'effervescence coming out of the glass', 'the budget that brings home the bacon.' He has done it again. He is doing exactly the same thing now. It is a one-stunt government. Every one of those one per cent increases in interest rates means another $80 a month for the strugglingÂ· home buyer. We have already had rises of three-quarters of a per cent back in August and one per cent in October. How many more are yet to come? We have been warning about this since budget night. We have been saying that, if the government did not attend to its fiscal policy, this is exactly the response it would get. It was no great surprise that this would come out. The Macquarie Bank was warning about it. The OECD has been warning about it. It has been saying that Australia will have the highest interest rates in the industrialised world in 1995. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been warning about it. Yet this government decided to close its ears and pretend that there was no problem. It was the repeated complacency of this government from the May budget onwards that put Australia in this position. The Treasurer got up here and ruled out of ways, mini-budgets. Don't you recall? When we asked back in September, we were told, 'No mini-budget; no need. We've got the tightest well fiscal policy in the world. We've got the best deficit reduction strategy in the world.' When the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), Sir Toby Belch over here, came in here one day and was asked about it, he got up and said: . . . there is not necessarily a direct connection between any particular level of deficit at any point of time and short-term interest rates. He was just saying that there is no connection. The Prime Minister was saying that everybody out there warning about the fiscal accounts was a deficit dalek. Everyone else was out of step, but he was in step! In one of the most naked U-turns you have ever seen--one of those 180-degree backflips that the Prime Minister is famous for-this government which said that it did not need to adjust its fiscal policy and this government which said that there was no need for a minibudget decided all of a sudden when the national accounts came out last Wednesday that the mini-budget was back on the agenda. When the Prime Minister was asked about this yesterday, he said, 'I couldn't preclude a mini-budget. I can't tell you if; I can't tell you when; but I can't tell you I won't.' All of a sudden the government is beating up this deficit crisis as from last Wednesday. Do you know why it is beating up a deficit crisis now? Because it needs a justification for its secret tax agenda. It needs to create a deficit crisis now because it has to have an excuse to do what it was always going to do, and that was to break the faith of the Australian people and jack up taxes. The thing that really galls you about these people, these habitual offenders, is that they never show remorse. They never come in and say, 'Look, we got it wrong. We mucked up our May budget. Don't punish us.' They never show remorse. They are just habitual offenders. Mr MCGauran-Deceivers.",59
158,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are champion deceivers that move on to the next electoral fraud as soon as they can. I will tell you this: the Australian people are owed an apology. You got them into this mess and they do not deserve to have you try to tax your way out of it. The Australian people are owed an apology because you let expenditure run away in your May budget. The Australian people are owed an apology because you got your budget deficit reduction strategy wrong. The Australian people are owed an apology because you made them p-y interest rates which, if you had taken responsible economic decisions, they would not have had to pay. The Australian people are owed an apology because you are about to engage in the greatest electoral fraud that this country has ever seen in relation to the secret plans for taxes. You are slinking around the financial communities now talking about services taxes. You are slinking around the environmental groups talking about environmental levies, and I am pleased to see that one is ruled out. You are trying to whip up a storm out there and create a climate to attack superannuation. That is what this government is doing. As well as hurting the home buyers and the small business people, this high interest rate strategy has exploded a bomb in the wages system. It was the Prime Minister who stood up when the TWU first announced that it was going to push for a 15 per cent wage claim. He said it was affordable in national economic terms. He fuelled it. If you had been a TWU official, you would have said to yourself, 'That's okay. We've got the green light.' No wonder the employees went and stopped the airlines. No wonder they are now threatening the Armaguards. This was the man that fuelled them up to it. It is no good the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) now saying to the employers, 'Sue them, stop the strike action and defeat the wage claim.' There is nothing left to sue them with. You have absolutely neutered section 45D. What are the employers supposed to sue them with? What are the legal remedies? How do they exist? Big man Laurie says, 'Stand up to them and sue them' --even though there are no laws and there is no framework-after they have just been encouraged by the Prime Minister. The Reserve Bank Governor made a very interesting statement about these wage claims. On 29 November, he gave a speech to CEDA absolutely indicting government policy. He made this obvious point: Increases in interest rates are intended to restrain the growth in spending, including in particular household spending. To the extent that wage earners try to offset that, impact through higher wage claims, this simply means that interest rates would need to rise even further to contain inflation, ultimately undermining the capacity of employers to sustain output and jobs in the process. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is saying, 'We are putting interest rates up to dampen down inflation; If the ACTU says that it is going to make a wage claim to cope with interest rates, then we are going to put them up further.' This is an interest rate wage claim spiral. The .Governor of the Reserve Bank is trying to pour water on the fire and the Prime Minister of the country is trying to pour oil on the fire. The greatest problem that you will have to grapple with is that the Reserve Bank Governor is essentially saying to one of his own board members, Bill Kelty, that you, by encouraging these wage claims, are defeating the board's purpose in lifting interest rates. You have a member of the Reserve Bank board saying, 'We're going to make wage claims on the basis of interest rates,' and the governor saying, 'We're going to put interest rates up on the back of wage claims.' You have the governor and a member of the board at odds over serious economic policy. One has to go. If you put somebody on a board as an adviser then that person is part of the corporate decision making process. Where does their interest lie? It is something that you have never addressed. You cannot address it, of course, because Kelty has such a hold over this government. Where do the farmers go to get compensation for interest rate rises? It is alright if you happen to be a member of a trade union because you make a wage claim. Where does the farmer go? Who does the farmer put his wage claim on? Where does the farmer go to make a wage claim to get compensation for "" these interest rate rises? The farmer is just locked out. Where does the small businessman go? You say that they can get interest subsidies for interest rate rises under the rural ment scheme, but the fact of the matter is that, out of 120,000 farmers in Australia, 117,000 of them cannot get the subsidies. There is no provision for the balance. They just have to wear it, do they? You tum around and give $164 million in a drought relief package and with two increases in official interest rates you have taken $300 million back from the farming sector. There is more to come. It is not just that you are now running this high interest rate policy and punishing the people that are locked out, like the farmers, small business people and those who cannot make TWU type wage claims, but you are now making them pay more in interest rates and you have a plan to tax them so they have less to pay them with. That is the ultimate upshot. Those legislated tax cuts-I-a-w-are the big l-i-e of the last election campaign. What you should be announcing in next year's budget is the 1 January 1996 tax cuts. That is the platform you were elected on. You are not going to do that. The opposition knows that. We know that there is probably no hope of that even in 1998. We know that you are going to impose further taxes to try to cover the spending addiction. The Prime Minister has a spending addiction and people say, 'He will get into debt, we'd better give him some more money to cover the debts.' We say, 'Let's cure the spending addiction.' We think that would be a much more responsible approach. Whether you have carbon taxes, service taxes, increases in the wholesale sales tax, further hikes petroleum taxes, a wealth tax orÂ· extend your fringe benefits tax further-which you are now backing away from-there is no way you can cope unless you address the expenditure side. Because you have failed to address the expenditure side it is the Australians that going to pay. They are going to pay with those increased interest rates. They are going to . take the pain this Christmas. They are going to' live through the horror that they saw before. You are setting, as Barry Hughes said, the Australian economy up for another boom and bust and you deserve the condemnation adjust- of this House. (Time expired)",60
159,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is certainly an ironic situation when the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), gets up to condemn a government for the failure of its economic strategy when. it has a growth rate which is just about the highest in the Western industrialised world. Mr Thckey-That is the problem.",61
160,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'That is the problem,' says someone from the opposition. Those opposite obviously do not want high growth. They think it is a bad thing to get substantial growth, to get jobs going and to increase living standards. They do not stand for any of that. They certainly never produced any of that when they were in government. When those opposite were in government their performance was absolutely appalling. They had growth of about 37,000 per annum in jobs. That is a miserable performance compared with our 150,000 per annum in jobs growth during our period in office. 'The failure of the government's economic strategy' is quite obviously an absurd proposal to put to this parliament when the government is producing what are, fundamentally, very good outcomes. As I explained at quesso tion time, not only do we have the highest growth in the Western world but we also have had growth in employment of four per cent over the last 12 months and productivity growth of four per cent in the non-farm market sector, which is, of course, very in important for improved international competitiveness and increased living standards. All of that is with business investment growing at 22 per cent overall and at 29Yz per cent for plant and equipment. Savings also increased in the last quarter by 1Yz per cent of GDP. All of that is supposed to lead to some kind are of condemnation of the government for the failure of its economic strategy, even though all of that has been happening in the context of inflation of 0.1 per cent on the implicit price deflator for gross non-farm product and 1.1 per cent over the last 12 months in that index. How absurd it is to put to this parliament the proposition that there has been a failure of economic strategy when there are those sorts of outcomes. It is an absolutely absurd proposition. Those opposite obviously do not know the first thing about economics and are simply trying forlornly to beat up some kind of great community concern about the fact that there has been some adjustment of the economic levers to reflect the fact that the growth of the economy needs to be tempered as we move away from recession and low growth to a period of much stronger growth. The proposition of the opposition seems to be that in those circumstances all one needs to do as a government is slash government expenditure and freeze everything else-that there should not be any increases in income tax or any other taxes and that there should not be any increase in interest rates. It states that you reduce interest rates in a recession but that even when you grow interest rates should remain at recession levels, that there should not be any increase in them because monetary policy basically should remain a frozen instrument. What a ridiculous proposition! Is this really an alternative government? Or is this just some bunch of economic hicks? No government in the world, nor any pretending government in the world, would put forward the kind of proposition that monetary policy basically should not have a role to play in controlling the economy. But that is the proposition coming from the opposition: there should not ever be increases in interest rates. Interest rates are far below the level they were when the coalition was in government last time. Recall that when you went out of office the mortgage interest rate was 12Y2 per cent. What is it today? It is 9Yz per cent to 9.75 per cent. It is a mile less. It is three per cent than it was when you went out of office. You hypocrites stand here and tell us that we are to be condemned because there has been some kind of an increase in interest rates.",61
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)The Treasurer might withdraw that comment.,62
162,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. They certainly cannot be taken seriously because, obviously, they are putting propositions which have no basis in rationality at all. Everybody who has any understanding of economics knows that the propositions being put forward by this opposition are ludicrous in the extreme and represent them as a bunch of economic cretins who simply would not know how to run an economy. They did .not know how to do it last time. They had no idea how to produce economic growth, had no idea how to produce jobs, left the economy with double digit inflation and double digit unemployment-the terrible duo-and with interest rates well above what they are now. They then have the damned audacity to get up here and condemn us when we have extraordinary rates of growth, very good outcomes coming, low inflation and interest rates far below what they were when they were last in office. What an incredible bunch! Those opposite can be basically disregarded as having any idea or understanding as to how to run the Australian economy. No-one with any knowledge of economics could take them seriously. Nobody in the markets does. Nobody in business does. They all regard them as being basically economically illiterate and are saying that they are just a joke in terms of having any pretence of being the alternative government of this country. It is pure, plain, populist politics. That is all it is. It is nothing more than sheer populism. They just say, 'Isn't this terrible? You have adjusted an interest rate from some very low level to a slightly higher level.' That is a shocking thing, even though they are at much lower levels than when the coalition was in office. It is the same with taxes. The level of taxes as a proportion of GDP is less than it was when the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. It was 24 per cent less of GDP then; in 1993-94 it was 21.8 per cent. Even though this government has been in office for 10 years, taxes as a proportion of GDP were two per cent of GDP less in 199394 than they were in 1982-83. In recent times we have seen a profusion of tax cuts. It has been raining tax cuts over the last few years. Certainly, there have been some increases, but overwhelmingly you have seen tax cuts. Let us look at what has happening. We have had the income tax cuts of November last year, which were paid 7Yz months early and cost about $3Y2Â· billionwhatever certainly no breach of promises there. The company tax rate was cut to 33c from 39c and you had it at 49c when you were in office. That is costing $1.8 billion this year. We have also had accelerated depreciation, find out. which is costing about half a billion dollars a year; the 150 per cent research and development tax concession, costing another half a billion dollars; the general investment ance, costing $300 million; the development allowance, which is rising to around $400 million in the next couple of years; and various smaller amounts for pooled developpeople ment funds, infrastructure borrowings, offOakes shore banking units, regional headqllarters and so on. Of course, you should not forget the.tariff billion.' cuts. These are substantial tax cuts which are occurring year by year. So far they have amounted to, going from 1987 when they first started, a cost of $3.7 billion this year. That is the cost this year in terms of the tariff cuts government and the cost is going up. Next year it will be $4.7 billion and the following year it will be $6 billion. So tariff cuts are substantial tax cuts are occurring each year. Of course, those tax cuts are important for consumers. the price of goods. They are there primarily, of course, for structural adjustment reasons, not simply to cut taxes. But they nevertheless have the effect of reducing taxes and they are in effect virtually abolishing a tax base. That is something which has to be borne in mind. That $6 billion has to be set against measures that were in the 1993 budget-the various indirect taxes which will raise about $3 billion per annum when they are fully implemented, as they will be by the end 1995. So you are looking at not even anymention where near replacing the loss of the tax base through the tariff cuts. In terms of taxes, recent times we have seen a profusion of cuts. Even though there have been some increases in that $3 billion, they have been swamped by the tax cuts for tariffs and for business and by the income tax cuts. That has been been the picture over recent years. To suggest that we should therefore, having achieved all that, never move taxes again, else is happening in the economy, is an absurdity. Whether the government will do that or not is a decision for it to make. Whether it will make that decision is something about which you will have to wait and What we do know about this opposition is that it wants, so it says, to cut the deficit by allowsome indeterminate amount. Today it is getting all sensitive about it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was saying, 'No, I never meant to say' --even though various interpreted it that way-'to Laurence that I meant to cut the deficit by $11.7 billion. I never meant to say that.' The Leader of the Opposition gets up and says, 'No, I never meant to say cuts of $6 billion to $7 What do they mean? What is their policy? What do they think the deficit should be? How much would they, if they were to get the benches-it seems extraordinarily unlikely-cut government spending by? Where would they cut it? What a pathetic array of suggestions we have seen from them so far. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition which is talking about the Lodge driveway and about the duplication of supervision of spendThey reduce ing of the states. It was pointed out here yesterday by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that, instead of there being $160 million involved in administering the programs the opposition spokesman was talking about for government schools and private schools, there was a mere the $4 million. All opposition members ever come up with when you ask for specifics is small change. They will talk about no specific policies to cut the deficit. What was in The of Things That Matter? There was not one in The Things That Matter which had anything to do with reducing expenditure. It in was supposed to be a positioning of the tax opposition to show what itÂ· wasÂ· really on about. What did it have? Three dozen proposals to cut taxes and increase expenditurethree dozen proposals to increase the deficit. That is what it had. Here is this great opposition prepared to say, 'Well, we are the. tough ones. We are going to go oot there and propose reductions in expenditure .to reduce the deficit.' They had a chance to do it when they produced this document, yet it was full of things to increase the deficit. There. was not one mention anywhere of anything to reduce the deficit. Whilst opposition members are not us what they have in mind, they pretty well have in mind what they want to do. In a debate with me some months ago on the 7.30 Report, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that he had cos ted various proposals. According to the AAP report today, he said the same thing to the party meeting-that would have costed proposals and that he justification would be able to trot them out whenever was an election; that if there were an early election he would have them available. They have all these plans in mind to drop on the electorate at the last minute, hoping that no-one will really understand them. there is any analysis of these, they will be frightened that the population will be scared out of its wits. They are being quite duplicitous in hiding their real policies, which apparently are to make quite horrendous cuts in expenditure. But they will not say by how much, they refuse to say by how much, let alone give us any detail as to what it is they actually intend to reduce. This is an absolutelyÂ· gutless opposition. is not prepared to say in any way what it really stands for. It is purely a populist opposition, raving about increases in interest rates and taxes, pretending that you do not have to make any adjustments to economic levers like that in a budget process or in controlling economy, and failing incredibly to make any sensible policy impact in this country. Mrs Bishop-You have got no policies.",62
163,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have made no impact in this place at all. No-one even knows you are here. You are an absolute dead loss in this place. No-one has noticed that you are even around. I' see they are even talking about kicking you off the front bench now. This matter before the House is an absolute absurdity. This government has much to be proud of. It will continue to pursue policies which will ensure we have continuous and strong economic and employment growth and low inflation. We will not shrink from taking the appropriate decisions to do that. We will not be deterred by your populist nonsense and we will expose your inadequacies. When the next election comes, they will be blatantly telling obvious to the whole population.",64
164,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mitchell) (4.44 p.m.) That sounds like happy Christmas, Australia. That is what you have promised for the future of this nation. Happy Christmas, Australia! An increase in taxes and an increase in interest rates-that is what the Treasurer (Mr Willis) he promised today. He ran the argument of for increasing interest rates and there increasing taxation. Do you know who is going to get the good Christmas out of that announcement? The home buyers-particularly the first home buyers-of Australia, and the farmers who are up to their ears in debt and in the middle of a drought. They are If going to have a happy Christmas with that announcement from the Treasurer. What about small business-not yet in the recovery process? Maybe large businesses are starting to recover but those in the small business community are still suffering from the recession we had.to have. They are going to have a happy Christmas, aren't they, with an increase in interest rates. What about the increases in taxes you may be contemplatIt ing-the denigrated goods and services tax, which we know you have a task force on? We know you have a working party on that. Every one of your backbenchers knows it. You are examining the processes of indirect taxes. You may not be calling it a goods and an services tax and you may not be calling it a consumer tax, but you are working on an indirect taxation system to see how much more money you can grab out of the economy. What are you proposing for superannuants? What are those people already suffering a myriad of changes to their superannuation going to contemplate with this wish you have for their happy Christmas? How are they J, going to handle the situation when they know that the taxation of superannuation could be changed? What about the first home buyers? end What about those people who own their own homes and may be reading the FitzGerald report and saying, 'With FitzGerald, I wonder whether the government is going to put a capital gains tax on the first home, on the prime place of residency'? That is what FitzGerald recommended. That is what the government can be contemplating. It can be contemplating anything because the Treasurer today said that he laid the grounduncertainty work for increased taxation because the government needs to balance its books. It not going to exercise thrifty housekeeping; is going to go after those in the Australian public to get more money out to pay for the government's derelict attitudes and spending attitudes. The Treasurer today told Australians that they would have inwhere creased taxation and they would have creased interest rates. Let me read a quotation to the House: Mr Keating said that the monthly deficit ""clearly much higher than the Government would have wished"", but put it all down to an economy which is ""too effervescent and spilling over side"". He again rejected any change in fiscal which could see a reduction in demand from the budget although he did not rule out a further in interest rates. Date: 17 February 1989. Again today we are saying the same thing. Here is another quotation from the same period: The Treasurer, Mr Keating, said he hoped interest rates would remain at the present levelthat is, at 16 per cent for home buyersfor the shortest time necessary to slow the economy. ""The banks have got to make their own judgments about interest rate levels."" This was said on 18 March 1989. On 15 November 1990, the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said this in the House: The Government has decided to see rates come down because the economy is slowing and there is no point in having interest rates higher than we need them to be. The only point there could be would be to slow the economy even further for longer. That is why the Government sought in the , first .place to lift interest rates-to slow down spending, which wasÂ· running at twice the productive capacity of the economy in the year up to the of 1989. . There we have it. We are going to get a rerun of all of that economic jargon and claptrap that the Prime Minister ran in 1989-1990. The words are exactly the same. The attitudes in the House are the same. Why should people not be fearful of what this government might do? Why has there been a retraction of activity in the housing industry? Why is there out there in small business? Small business has gone off the b()il in the last is couple of months. The Treasurer knows that. it The early figures confirm that. And why? Because there is now uncertainty where there of their pockets was confidence. It is not just the fact that government members are increasing interest rates; it is they are going to finish. What are your inintentions? The Treasurer today would not state his intentions. He is pulling levers. The same sort of language was used by the current was Prime Minister three or four years ago. You are pulling levers again, and that frightens those in the Australian community. That is the why they are worried about what sort. of Christmas they are going to get. I quote from policy, an interview Paul Keating had with Marius rise Benson on World Today on 17 March: MARIUS BENSON: ... interest rates. Is it justified? PAUL KEATING: Well, interest rates in Australia will be higher rather than lower while ever we run a large current account or external deficit-an external imbalance. And until that external imbalance comes under control, that is, back towards the target levels we've set for it, then Australia will experience a higher level of interest rates to fund that deficit and to moderate demand. Mr Taylor-They failed that test.",64
165,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Those opposite have failed that test, and they are saying that they are going to have a go at the same process. I believe they will fail the test again. What they are doingÂ·is setting up all the blocks and putting in place all the images to repeat that process, to pull the levers and bring the economy under control. When the Prime Minister was asked whether he had control over the deficit or the moderation of demand, he stated: No. We have control of it, but we've exercised this discipline on the economy to bring our external debt and external accounts back within what we think are appropriate levels. I have pages and pages of this stuff. Do you know what that has done to Australia? That has created a situation where the wealthy have got more wealthy and the poor have got more poor. According to the OECD figures in its 1994 world competitive report on income distribution, Australians have one of the l!\-gest groups on low incomes and one of the largest groups on high incomes. We have the greatest difference between low income and high income anywhere in the world. The countries that are the closest to us for that disparate income are Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Turkey, Brazil and South Africa. Those are the countries we can be compared to. That is what this government has done with its policies of high interest rates and high taxation. The Treasurer tried to mount the argument today that he has been giving away money and that taxation has been reduced. What a load of bunkum! Not a single individual believes that. He should come out with me to the pubs of Blacktown or anywhere in western Sydney and explain to the people around the bar that he is bringing down taxes. They would love to explain to him what has happened to their weekly budget. They would love to explain how they have lost their jobs. They want to know why unemployment is so high. They want to know how they are going to battle to pay off their houses. They want to know why you are demanding more taxation and giving them uncertainty about whether their homes will be subject to capital gains tax, whether there will be more tax on superannuation or whether there will be a change in foreign imputation. You have a grab bag of stuff that you can look at, and you have refused to allay any fears whatsoever. The Treasurer is giving Australians a happy Christmas. You are giving them uncertainty and insecurity. Your government has a record for doing that. You collapsed the Australian economy with a recession that you said we had to have. You sent thousands upon thousands of businesses bankrupt. You put over a million people out of work and made probably 1Y2million people underemployed, most of whom are your own constituents. You come in here and parade yourself as the epitome of a caring person, pulling the levers, adjusting the Australian economy gently to meet the needs of Australians. Yet what you are really saying is, 'We will commit those people that have just committed themselves to a new home, and those farmers in the middle of a drought and those small businesses seeking to employ others and create wealth, to more expense, more pain and more uncertainty.' That is what you are saying to those people paying taxes-whether it be personal income tax, superannuation, or a goods and services or consumer tax that you may consider in one form or another. You are committing average Australians to cost rises, reduced income and the prospect that they will be pinched on the one hand by money being taken away in the form of higher interest rates and be incapacitated on the other hand in the form of increased taxation. Happy Christmas, Australia. The Treasurer has given it to you.",65
166,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was interested to hear the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) concentrating his remarks on Christmas. On this side of the House, we certainly know who will be having the unhappiest Christmas in Australia. It is the parliamentary Liberal Party. What a rotten, miserable existence it must be to sit over there, like the backbenchers opposite, conspiring about the leadership, working out how they can drag down the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) yet minimise the embarrassment for their own party. Every now and then, when they are not conspiring or trying to rip their leader down, they glance at the financial pages and see the numbers-6.4 per cent growth, low inflation and increased international competitiveness. Then they try to work out what they have to do. They trump up the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to talk about economic failure, 1, showing that his bark is a lot worse than his bite. The truth is that the government's economic strategy is a raging, roaring success. The only failure in this place is the opposition and its leadership. The dream team of the leader and the deputy leader has become a nightmare for the parliamentary Liberal Party. The fresh start has become the oldest joke in the parliament. I have to say one thing about the contribution of the member for Higgins in economic debate: he must have been a great lawyer. He should have stayed there because as an economist he has absolutely no idea, as he reveals in forecast after forecast, interview after interview. This is the fellow who put out a media release on 30 June to say that the government could not possibly sustain its forecast in the budget of a 14.5 per cent increase in business investment. He said that it could not be done and the government's economic strategy was in tatters. He said we had to go back and redraft the budget. What happened in the national accounts after the lawyer's forecast about business investment? Business investment is up there growing at 22 per cent. There is no way the government needed to go back to recast the budget on his advice because his advice was totally wrong-as it is time after time. The Australian people work out the value and capacity of people in these debates. The truth is that this government is fortunate to have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer with 24 years of experience between them in the cabinet, able to make a collective judgment about the economy and the sorts of adjustments and finetuning that need to be made from time to time. Compare that with the inexperience and incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy leader. The member for Higgins has to be absolutely kidding to come into this parliament with this matter of public importance to say that the government's economic strategy is a failure when, for the first time in 30 years, Australia has high non-:inflationary growth. This is the first government in 20 years, in the formulation of national economic policy, that has broken the back of stagflation. The curse that rested over Australia and its citizens for 20 years-stagflation-has been broken. It is an excellent set of numbers. It is beautiful to see growth at 6.4 per cent and inflation so low. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has to be absolutely kidding to come into this parliament and say that the strategy is wrong when just today we heard the Prime Minister's statement about APEC. Are the deputy leader or the Liberal Party suggesting that the APEC agreement, with its potential for 200,000 new jobs in Australia, a 3.8 per cent increase in output and a 1.2 per cent increase in national income, is a sign of something gone wrong or a sign of failure in government economic strategy? I repeat: the only failure is the opposition and its failed, abysmal, economically illiterate leadership team. Unemployment is falling rapidly in Australia not only according to the gross numbers. The efficiency of the labour market has been dramatically improved by the white paper. The government is doing well on both sides of the labour market. Demand is picking up through those high growth numbers. On the supply side of the labour market the government is getting the adjustments right, it is retraining and reskilling a new generation of Australians to give them their chance to participate in the work force. That is an achievement of historic proportions. It is the first time in 30 years that a government not only has high growth and low inflation but also has got the demand and supply sides of the labour market right. That is a substantial achievement. We are also moving forward with the biggest micro-reform agenda in Australia's history. The Hilmer report and national competition policies have put up for grabs, for competition, for benefits of business and consumers, the $8.2 billion in dividends that flow back into government enterprises around the country. As we are talking about competition policies, and as this matter of public importance makes reference to tax, my friend and colleague the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) has reminded me of the Kennett government. Victoria, courtesy of the Kennett government, is the highest taxed state in Australia. Victorians are paying $2,000 a head-40 per cent more than other Australians-under a Liberal Party government. The Liberal Party has always stood for higher taxation. The ALP has stood for getting it down, doing the bullocking work on the outlays to make sure that tax cuts can be sustained time after time. The Australian economy is now 30 per cent more internationally competitive than it 10 years ago. There is a record amount of manufactured exports, yet the member for Higgins suggests that something has gone wrong. Nothing has gone wrong. The econpoisonous omy is roaring and raging with success, employment and the benefits flowing out the white paper. If the member for Higgins is willing come into the House and say that these business economic achievements are failures, what must he think of the Liberal Party and its own predicament at the moment? If he thinks the government has got it wrong on the - conomy, what must he think about the Liberal Party and its five consecutive election losses what must he think of his colleague whom is propping up until Christmas-the Leader the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition was born with a silver foot in his mouth and is yet to take it out. The Leader of the Opposition gives the government the best Christmas present and best New Year's Eve party any political down at the Lodge. organisation in this country could ever hope for. If those on the other side, with their backbench conspiracies-including the memdog ber for Mitchell, who is a known Howard supporter-have not got the courage to him on the shoulder, then someone has to say to the Leader of the Opposition,'You just haven't got it.' It is probably time for mother or his wife to sit him down and 'Look, Alexander, we think the world of you and you have tried hard, but you are just not going to make it. You have got a 14 per cent approval rating.' He is Captain 14 per cent. One in three Liberal Party voters 'in this country say that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) makes a better leader than the Leader of the Opposition. In a fortnight's time, there will be the 50 year celebration-commemoration, more likely-of the Australian Liberal Party. Poor old Bob Menzies must be rolling in his grave thinking about what has happened to the Liberal Party in the 1990s, with the leader having a 14 per cent approval rating. Every speech made by those in the opposition's leadership team reflects the opposition's problem. Every speech reflects the opposition was members' lack of interest in micro-reform, their lack of genuine interest in competition policy, their lack of interest and knowledge on fiscal policy, and their absolute personal, obsession with the Prime Minister. I mentioned earlier how the member for of Higgins gets it wrong in saying that the government's economic strategy is at fault. to Six months ago he said we could not get investment of 14Yz per cent and it is now up to 22 per cent. What of his deficit reduction plan? In an interview with Laurence Oakes, when asked about cutting expenditure, the member for Higgins responded, 'Plainly, we have identified many areas over the years and where government funds are being wastedhe you know---extravagance down at the Lodge.' of Is this a serious political party when, in talking about deficit reduction in the 1990s, it says that its answer is petty cash down at the Lodge? That is the focus of the parliamentary Liberal Party 50 years into its historythe sad case of focusing on petty cash receipts The Liberal Party even suggested taking away the dog house of the Prime Minister's Reuben which I think, coming from the member for Higgins, proves that the Liberal tap Party has always been about dog-eat-dog policies. That is evident today in this matter of public importance. No wonder the Liberal his Party is talking about bringing back the say, honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). No wonder it)s talking about going back to its shadow Treasurer from five years ago and its leader from five years ago. The Liberal Party is always back to the future; it is always having a look at the next century from way back in the 1950s when it snuggled !, up around Menzies. The Liberal Party is never in any position-not in Victoria, not in this parliament, not with the 15 per cent GST that, in its heart of hearts, it still believes is the right thing for Australia-and never has any right to be talking about taxation policies or deficit reduction. The Things that Matter exposes the things the Liberal Party knows nothing about in uncosted spending commitments.

169,Mr ELLIOTT,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The government has announced that the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining 75 per cent equity in Qantas Airways Ltd will take place in the first half of 1995. The Qantas Sale Act 1992, which established the legislative and administrative framework for the sale, received royal assent on 21 December 1992 and was subsequently amended in 1993 to extend the date of automatic repeal of any unproclaimed portions of the act until 30 June 1995. Since then, there has been a number of developments which require the government's attention. The Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic share transfer system, the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, known as CHESS, became operational in September 1994. As a condition of listing on the Stock Exchange, Qantas will be required to be eligible to participate in CHESS. The sale act imposes a limit of 35 per cent on the level of foreign ownership and currently provides that Qantas's articles of association must contain certain provisions enforcing that requirement. In particular, the act confers on directors the power to refuse to register a transfer of shares which could result in the foreign ownership limit being breached. Because these powers are inconsistent with the CHESS rules which facilitate unrestricted electronic transfer and settlement in shares, is proposed that the act no longer require the articles to impose restrictions on the transfer of shares to give effect to the foreign ownership limit. There are currently share disenfran30 chisement and divestment provisions in Qantas's articles which will continue to.fulfil the legislative requirement that Qantas monitor and enforce the foreign ownership restrictions. The sale act contains a number of provisions dealing with employee entitlements. Minor amendments will be made to the long service leave provisions to bring them into line with those in other asset sale legislation. The sale act effectively imposes a deadline of 30 June 1995 for completion of the public share offer, as any provisions of the act which have not commenced by this date would lapse. The government has not yet settled on a date for the public share offer, but wishes to leave open the option of conducting it after the conclusion of the May budget. In that event, the sale timetable will be very tight and it may prove difficult to complete all necessary administrative arrangements by 30 June. To ensure that the government has sufficient flexibility with regard to all its options, the bill provides that the legislative sunset clause be extended by two months to 31 August 1995. The Air Navigation Act 1920 imposes controls over foreign shareholdings in Australian international airlines. Because Qantas is subject to its own controls under the sale act, it was not intended that the Air Navigation Act measures should also apply to Qantas. However, as the wording of the Air Navigation Act is ambiguous, it will be amended to confirm that this measure does not apply to Qantas. This is an important piece of legislation to enable this provision to give effect to the sale of Qantas to proceed and, as such, completes the process that needs to be undertaken to ensure that those technical provisions are in place forthwith. I commend this bill to the House for detailed consideration and endorsement.",69
170,Mr MOORE,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill relates to an it extension of time to allow the government to complete the sale of Qantas. It was not so long ago that the government was in here with a bill to allow for the sale of Qantas on June 1995. The date has already slipped by two months and that has resulted in this bill. It is worth recalling the history of the privatisation of Qantas-quite some saga. It goes back to 1990 when the government decided it would sell 49 per cent of Qantasit was not too sure about Australian Airlines. This decision was taken up in the shifts of policy of the Labor Party. The Labor Party is never consistent. It flip-flops all the time: boom-bust, sell Qantas or not sell Qantas, ANL is up for sale or it is not worth two bob--or now we will sell ANL to the unions and bring in Lindsay Fox and Kelty to help it along. It is a flip-flop game. With Qantas it is exactly the same. The government did not know what to do, so 49 per cent was up for sale. Then all of a sudden One Nation was produced in 1992 for the benefit of the coming election. In that the government said it was going to open up competition around the place. It said Air New Zealand would come into Australia, we would go over there, we would have this new concept and we would merge Australian Airlines with Qantas. We would have Australian Airlines and Qantas as one airline, both domestic and international, we would allow Ansett to go international and Air New Zealand would be part of the process. That was all fine. There was much cheering for competition policy and the like. What happened then? We thought, having put Qantas and Australian Airlines together, that the best idea was to get some money into the deal. After all, Qantas is capital starved; it has high gearing compared with most of the commercial airlines around the world. We sold 25 per cent to British Airways-at quite a good price, about $600-odd million. To do that, the government in the One Nation paper also reduced the percentage that could be owned by foreigners from 35 per cent to 25 per cent. It sold the lot at that stage to Airways. Time goes by in this magical world of the Labor Party. It is like a magic pudding. The election was won and we addressed the question of the Qantas sale again. What were we going to do about it? We let the procedure go on and called in the task force to see what we could do about selling it, whether management structures were correct and whether the merger with Australian Airlines had really gone well or whether it was one of those things it was still working on. The answer was to find a new chief executive-James Strong came back to the job-and to push on with the sale. The task force called for expressions of interest from financial markets for the underwriting and that was duly set. MCIntosh won the underwriting deal. But then came a meeting down here in October this year in which the wise men of Qantas came to town. They let the government know that having Air New Zealand operating in the Australian domestic market from 1 November would have a substantial impact on the profitability of Qantas. Meanwhile the Treasury department "" was saying, 'We need $2 billion out of this to help the budget deficit along.' All of a sudden the cry went up, 'What are we going to do?' So what do we do? We welsh on the deal with New Zealand. As the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would well recall, a great amount of goodwill was required on a personal basis to make the CER negotiations-which were started by Doug Anthony more than by anybody else-work. There was a sweep of the pen in which the transport minister just whipped off a fax .. There was no communication; it was just whacked on the machine and sent over. There was no deal on 1 November. The government was mightily upset by this. It was done and justified on the basis that if it did not cancel the deal it would not get $2 billion for Qantas airlines in Australia's stock market environment, which is remarkably poor. Interest rates are rising-the government's problem again. The share market is down as a consequence. The $2 billion is looking pretty shaky. So we extend the time British for sale by two months in this bill. Having done that, the institutions of Australia are now asking the underwriters what the price is on this issue because they want to know what sort of PE ratios and dividend yields are coming out in view of the fact that the government is pushing interest rates up and airline stocks around the world are not the great thing they were a year ago, are not in great demand as they were. There are only two or three really financially sound airlines, and they are Asian airlines. The American airlines and most of the European airlines, except for British Airways, are really carrying a substantial debt. The next question the institutions ask the underwriters is: what is going to be the capital commitment of the vendor in this particular corporation? That is something yet to be answered. Then they go about saying, 'Remember that deal with New Zealand, you know, the one the government sentÂ· the fax about and knocked off for the benefit of this float. Can you be sure that after the float is finished it will send another fax and say it is on again now, boys, on the basis that you bought our mate Murdoch's shares out of Ansett. We will fax you back into it again.' It is quite a simple deal. The New South Wales Right do that every day. It is no problem to them. It is right down their alley. In a year's time, Qantas is floated to the public, Murdoch is out of Ansett, Air New Zealand comes into Ansett and the AustralianNew Zealand aviation market is once again open-magic pudding stuff: the flip-flop, where are we going to be tomorrow in government policy. That is the scenario I see coming out of the Qantas game. Anybody who has witnessed it would marvel at the way in which it was on, certain underwriters seemed to have a commitment to have the float, then it was off, then we merged with Australian Airlines, then we opened up all the airline markets around Australia to competition from New Zealand, then we put Qantas back on the float market as a singl- unit, then we knocked out competition in the Australian market from Air New Zealand, then we found that interest rates, which the government is responsible for, went up and the share market went down. Today we have before us a bill which requires us to extend by two months the time in which the government can effect the sale of Qantas. The opposition will not be opposing the bill, because we support privatisation. But the way in which it has been handled is certainly a lot less than professional and very much in keeping with the general tenor of government management.  p.m.)-I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. The bill makes several amendments to the Qantas Sale Act 1992. Firstly, it enables the sunset clause to be extended by two months to 31 August 1995, thus providingÂ· sufficient time to complete the public sale process and all associated activities. Secondly, it gives Qantas access to CHESS, the Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic system for registering share transfers. Thirdly, it allows consistency with other acts relating to 'asset sales to be achieved in respect of employee long service entitlements. Some minor technical provisions are covered in the remainder of the bill. Qantas as we know it now, with 25 per cent British Airways investment and a float where up to 35 per cent of the company can be held by foreign shareholders and the remainder of it spread within Australia, does open up the organisation to dominance by a single major shareholder. I have made the point before that you do not need 51 per cent to be the dominant decision maker in the business. British Airways, with 25 per cent, is expected to be the tail, not the dog. I have strong fears that, given the composition of Qimtas, given where we are going and given the tough and long established attitude of dirty tricks that has been practised by British Airways in the past, we will have to be extremely careful to ensure that Qantas does not become a British Airways managed operation in this part of the world. I am not exaggerating when I say that. One only has to look at decisions taken in the United Kingdom over recent years by British Airways in relation to Virgin Airlines. The dirty tricks that were played are not unlike some of the past practices of British Airways in this country. It had a practice of selling tickets on routes on which it was not entitled to carry passengers and, when the time neared for travel, it then claimed that it was the bloody-mindedness of the Australian government that prevented it from being able to carry people on a route on which it did not have a right to carry passengers under the air service agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. It is not without some substance that I sound that warning. The Qantas that we know, the Qantas that is now the major domestic and international operator of this nation, must and should remain under the control of Australians and Australian decision makers and not be subject to decision making processes and management decisions of British Airways. ' The last matter the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) raised was in respect of New Zealand air services and the relationship between Australia and New' Zealand. We do not want to go through that debate again, but I will respond with just a few words. What happened with New Zealand was a case of take, take, take. There was very little give on the part of New Zealand. In my view, one must always give credit to New Zealanders and New Zealand business people. They try hard. They are sharp, they are alert, and they are initiators. If we give them the opportunity, they will not take an inch; they will take the proverbial mile. That is business. They are clever at doing that. So New Zealand took out those parts of the agreement between Australia and New Zealand that most benefited New Zealand and did little else about the other parts that were involved. The additional beyond rights that gave New Zealand some 3,600 extra seats per week out of the Australia were an enormous benefit to New Zealand. There was no corresponding benefit coming to Australia. Without going over that debate again, Australia acted because it had to act. A joint statement was then issued by the New Zealand Minister for Transport and the Australian Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), following their meeting on 10 November. That settled that issue and provided for further progress to be made in respect of Australia and New Zealand air rights. I will turn now to the international airline industry itself. That is what this is really all about-where the industry is going; what the prospects are in the industry; who the major players are; what kind of market Qantas is going to be working in in its new and expanded role as a publicly owned business with up to a 35 per cent foreign holding. It is an extremely competitive market. Whilst we think of Qaptas in the international field as being a major player, the reality is that when we look at Asia, with a dimension of billions of seat miles, Cathay Pacific provides some 10.5 billion seat miles per annum. Singapore Airlines provides lOA billion seat miles, so they are about par. JAL is not far behind, with 10.3 billion seat miles. Then Thai Airways has 9.6 billion seat miles. We come across to trade between US and Asia. That was headed up by United Airlines with 21.5 billion seat miles; Northwest Airlines with 21.1 billion; JAL with 16.7 billion; Korean Air with 8.3 billion; Qantas with 7.1 billion; and Singapore Airlines with 5.7 i' billiori seat miles. So Qantas ranks well down in terms of size and the provision of passenger capacity within that market. We tend to think that, because Qantas is Australian, we are the biggest and the best. We are operating in an extremely tough business. The one thing I see flowing out of the amalgamation between Australian Airlines and Qantas is a greater propensity for both Ansett and the new Qantas, operating domestically, to participate in market competition. There was an expectation in some quarters that, once the two major airlines had dispensed with Compass Airlines, they would drift back into the old habits; into that comfortable, cosier position of sharing out the market. I think it is very good that that has not happened. The heavy discounting of air fares during January-February 1995 is an excellent example of how, by freeing up the system and having dispensed with the two airlines agreement, the domestic market can take on an extra 500 million people who will be more likely to be able to afford to travel at those heavily discounted fares in January-February 1995 than under the old system, when they would not have had access because they would not have been able to afford to travel by air. Turning back to the international scene-to Asia, again-the Economist of 21 May 1994 states: While their rivals in America and Europe have been losing billions of dollars, Asia's airlines have so far cruised through the biggest-ever global downturn in their industry. However, behind the well-practised smiles of their famously charming cabin crew, cracks have begun to appear. The article then refers to Singapore Airlines, which has long been regarded as a flying money machine. It announced a 5.8 per cent drop in net profits, which is equivalent to 801 million Singaporean dollars in the year to 31 March. That happened despite a 10 per cent increase in sales to 6.2 billion Singaporean dollars. On the one hand, passenger traffic is up, revenue is up by 10 per cent, but the net profit is down by some 5.8 per cent. That is indicative of what has been happening with the Asian airlines. ' Asia is the great growth market. Everybody who can fly an aeroplane is heading to Asia, like bees to the honey pot. But the competition and the intensity of marketing in that area is making it more and more difficult. It reflects, in a way, what we have had to do with Qantas. As time passes, and as the world market grows, there is a need for fewer but larger international airline businesses. Long established airlines are having to consolidate into larger groupings-hence the linkage between British Airways and Qantas. Asia's leading carrier, Cathay Pacific, saw its net profit go down by 24 per cent in the year to 31 December 1993. The Economist also states: Elsewhere in the region the gloom is even more evident. Malaysia Airlines might stay out of the this year by selling aircraft; Philippine Airlines estimates that its losses last year reached . . . ($IOAm); and Japan Airlines (JAL) desperately hopes it might break even this year after two years of losses. The question arises: what has gone wrong, given that air travel is soaring in Asia? The reality is that the Asian airlines are feeling the turbulence from other markets. We have had a heavy overcapacity, and a heavy downturn that occurred when the Gulf War began. International air travel dropped. That was then followed by the international recession and now we are probably just starting to see some sort of change from that. What the Asian airlines have been facing is the result of the impact on other international carriers. Another thing is happening within those Asian airlines that is internal. First, the fleets operated by the international airlines are changing. They are going to larger aircraft, more and more 747s, and the nature of the market is changing. Where airlines could once rest easy on getting their passenger yield from first class travel and filling up the back of the aircraft with excursion-type fares, concessional fares or promotional fares, the income composition of those airlines is now changing. So there is a greater reliance on economy class passengers. That means a rejigging of how they go about their marketing process and the strategy that they follow. One other decision is of .interest here to Australia. At least a dozen of the Asia Pacific's top 20 airlines have recently changed hands-and when I say recently I am talking about just back in August of this year. Everybody assumes that being in the airline business is lucrative. That is not always the case. Some make money; some do not. There is a great deal of speculation that Cathay Pacific might be sold off to Chinese interests. However, a change has now occurred in the airline business. Whereas in the past we had so many international airlines operating as flag bearers for nations, each nation having to have its own airline to show its flag around the world, finally an economic and commercial realisation has come about that airlines are a transport business, that they should be earning a return and making a profit, and that red they are not just there to show their nations' flags around the world. As that realisation has developed, things have become tougher for the airlines themselves; they are having to produce results they have never had to produce in the past. Having looked at that, we then come to the draft decision by the Trade Practices Commission in respect of the agreement between Qantas and British Airways to fix prices, schedules and capacities on the kangaroo route-that is, on the Australia to Europe route. That has certainly involved changes for Qantas and the expectations it had at that time. Looking at what can happen there, those two airlines can still have other discussions and go through other processes together to try to get some of the economies and joint benefits that come from that. But the draft determination, issued by the Trade Practices Commission on 17 November 1994, denied the authorisation of that agreement. The basis of that draft determination was that there would be a probable lessening of competition for passenger travel, and that the claimed public benefits were limited. That draft determination is a stage in the public process of arriving at a final decision. Qantas and British Airways were to have had a conference on 1 December this year about that. The Trade Practices Commission must hold a conference within 30 days of the expiry of the 14-day period after the draft determination. The Trade Practices Commission has indicated that it will hold that conferroutes ence a week from today, on 13 December, and issue its decision before Christmas. There are other processes which could be followed through in respect of that decision. But I think there are other means by which the airlines themselves can try to utilise some of the savings and some of the benefits that can come from a closer working relationship, without reducing the public benefits that are available, as was seen by the Trade Practices Commission and which formed the basis of its decision:. So, having spoken of those matters, I want to tum briefly to the Qantas results themselves. Qantas has been through an extremely difficult time. The process of amalgamating a major domestic carrier and a major international carrier, in Australian terms, is an extremely complex and difficult task. There have been industrial relations problems with different unions involved; different unions had coverage of the pilots belonging to each airline. Just this year there was change in administrative and marketing tasks. It certainly has had a substantial effect on the business. But that seems now to have been overcome. The result, announced on 21 September, was an after tax profit of $156.1 million compared with a loss of $376.8 million in 1992-93. However, in that figure there was a loss on abnormal items of $446 million. I think the result in the year concluded, 1993-94, was a good result. It has been a very difficult period to get through. There are other indications, such as a range of key financial operating results that improved strongly in 1993-94. That range includes operating revenue up 13.2 per cent to a record $6.6 billion and earnings before depreciation, rentals, interest and tax up 35.8 per cent to a figure of $865.3 million. I think those financial results are good pointers for the future of the expanded business that will be floated as a result of the legislation that we are amending today. If we look also at the airline's operating measures for 1993-94, there has been. an increase in total revenue from passenger kilometres on international routes of 10 per cent, with those major growth areas being on to Asia, New Zealand, Japan and North America. Overall, considerable progress is being made now with the business and the forces behind it. (Quorum/ormed)",70
171,Mr VAILE,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"In debating the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill it is interesting to look at the history-the changes and decisions that have been made along the way-since the original decision was made in 1990 to sell 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas. I will just refer to what this bill actually does. In summary, the bill addresses four issues: firstly, consequential amendments to allow Qantas to participate in the Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic system for registering share transfers; secondly, variation of provisions protecting employees' accrued long service leave entitlement to ensure consistency with other acts relating to asset sales; thirdly, extension of the sale act's sunset clause by two months to 31 August 1995 to provide for the contingency that, because the sale timetable may be very tight, particularly if the sale is conducted after the May 1995 budget, it may not be possible to complete all necessary arrangements by 30 June 1995and that particular aspect of the amendment bill raises some interesting questions in itself; and, fourthly, the amendment of the Air Navigation Act 1920 to conform with the controls on foreign shareholdings in Australian international airlines so as not to apply to Qantas, which is subject to its own controls in the Qantas Sale Act. It is interesting to note the reason for the extension of that sunset clause-and I made a note of this in reading the briefing notes. It says: The major amendment proposed by this Bill is to extend from 30 June 1995 to 31 August the repeal date for ,provisions of the Principal Act which have not commenced operation. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), in his second reading speech, provided the following rationale: The Government has not yet settled on a date for the public share offer but wishes to leave open the option of conducting it after the conclusion of the May Budget. In that event, the sale timetable will be very tight and it may prove difficult to complete all necessary administrative arrangements by 30 June. To ensure that the Government has sufficient flexibility with regard to all its options, the provides that the legislative sunset clause be extended by two months to 31 August 1995. Since 1990, we have been hearing about the sale of Qantas, the benefits that are going to accrue to the Commonwealth and how those financial benefits are going to be used in all sorts of different measures, but it certainly will not be enough with a deficit reduction campaign. It is now very near the end of 1994, and no doubt we will hear about the benefits again in the May 1995 budgetcertainly in any financial statement that takes place before then. The government is getting pretty good mileage out of the sale of this single asset. Let us look at the history of Qantas since the decision was made to sell this asset. If look at the list of major asset sales that been dealt with by the task force within Department of Finance, which deals with the disposal of Commonwealth assets, we find that a lot of them have had to go through the process of corporatisation and commercialithe sation in readiness for sale to the private sector, a part sale of these assets. But Qantas is one that seems to have got stuck along the way. The history of the sale of Qantas and political tools. Australian Airlines goes back to September 1990 when it was announced that 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent Qantas would be sold. The reason given for the sale was the need for both operators to raise substantial additional capital because competing fiscal priorities. Details of the waiting. arrangements were announced in April 1991. In February 1992, the Prime Minister Keating) delivered the infamous One Nation statement, which contained modifications aviation policy and the proposed sale. Major changes included allowing all Australian and New Zealand airlines to compete on the Tasman routes and allowing Qantas to operate on domestic flights in Australia. The next major change was announced by the Prime Minister on 2 June 1992. The major elements of the announcement were that Qantas Qantas would acquire Australian Airlines for $400 million and that 100 per cent of Qantas, and its subsidiary Australian Airlines, would Bill be sold. The sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines was to involve two stages: a trade sale and a public float. It was initially expected that the trade sale would be largely completed by the end of 1992 with the public float occurring in the first half of 1993. That was 18 months ago. We are talking about billions of dollars that could be used to reduce our foreign debt as part of the deficit reduction campaign. The question must be asked not only by members of this parliament but also by the taxpayers of Australia who, in the end, own Qantas. We sit in this place and debate the pros and cons of asset disposal, privatisation, commercialisation and, to a large extent, the assets of the Commonwealth. It cannot be put we on the public record too often that the assets have of the Commonwealth belong to the people of the Australia. They deserve to know what is going on and why the government is changing its mind along the way, why it is doing this and why it is doing that. I do not doubt that asset sales task force probably has all the best financial interests of the Commonwealth and taxpayers at heart, but there is an element of doubt over the government of the day as to how it uses its policies in this regard as Recently, Minister Brereton made a decision with Air New Zealand to try to protect of Qantas's patch to prop up the sale. As I indicated, it is not going to plan. The public float was supposed to occur in the first half of of 1993. We are at the end of 1994 and still Another change in policy occurred in (Mr November 1992 when the amount of equity in Qantas that could be held by a single to foreigner was reduced from the previously announced 35 per cent to 25 per cent. Subsequently, the date for the trade sale was moved transfrom 30 November 1992 to December 1992. On 4 November 1992, the government introduced the Qantas Sale Bill, which received royal assent in December 1992. Basically, the Qantas Sale Act 1992 provided for the sale of in three stages. Sections 4 to 6 provided for the minister to declare certain sale days. They are: the substantial minority sale day, the day on which a substantial minority of voting shares in Qantas are acquired by a person or persons other than the Commonwealth; the 50 per cent sale day, the day on which 50 per cent or more of such shares are likewise acquired; and the 100 per cent day, the day on which 100 per cent of such shares are again likewise acquired. The next interesting date in the whole saga of the sale of Qantas is 17 December 1992. The then Minister for Finance announced that cabinet had approved the sale of a 25 per cent stake in Qantas to British Airways for $655 million. In addition to announcing that sale, the minister announced that 'the government and British Airways have agreed to a recapitalisation for Qantas of $1.35 billion at the of settlement' and that 'arrangements are proceeding for the float of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas, which is scheduled to be undertaken before the end of the financial year'. That was in 1992. The end of that financial year has come and gone. On 2 July 1993, the then Minister for Finance announced that the government had decided that the float of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas would be rescheduled from 1993-94 to 1994-95 as it was expected that, with the recovery out of recession gathering pace, a better sale price could be obtained if the sale process was delayed. Thus, the minister said 'the government had decided to reschedule the Qantas float on the basis of strong advice from its financial consultants and the chairman of the board of Qantas' and that 'advice demonstrated that the government would obtain substantially better value from the float if it were postponed to 1994-95'. That remains to be seen. When we get to August 1995, we will find out what better sale price the Commonwealth gets for the taxpayers of Australia with one of their major assets. On 2 September 1993, the government introduced the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. This bill gave legislative effect to the government's 2 July 1993 announcement that the float of the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas would be rescheduled from 1993-94 to 1994-95. The principal amendment extended the repeal date from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995. On 4 July 1994, the government announced that the public float of the government's remaining 75 per cent equity in Qantas would take place in the first half of 1995. The rationale given by the minister for the government's decision included that the 1995 timing is likely to maximise proceeds to the Commonwealth and that Qantas is expected to be well positioned to benefit most from a sale at that time. How many times are we going to hear this announcement? Qantas and government aviation policy affecting Qantas have been the subject of considerable media attention and debate in recent months. The principal areas of attention time and debate concerned the government's decision on 8 November 1994 to not proceed further with initiatives directed towards the establishment of a common aviation border around Australia and New Zealand and the granting of additional beyond rights for Air New Zealand international flights operating via Australian ports in particular, and the granting of Australian domestic air service licences to New Zealand airlines. Is this in the spirit of the Hilmer report, the national competition policy? We have two airlines in Australia running domestic services. What the Minister for Transport has done here is just code for protecting those services that are owned by Qantas. The second important point relates to the Trade Practices Commission's denial of authorisation to an agreement between Qantas and British Airways to fix prices, schedules and capacities on routes between Australia, Asia and Europe. The third point relates to the establishment of a share ownership scheme for Qantas employees. The point needs to be reiterated that we are forcing a lot of Australian industry and Australian businesses to compete on the world market. Here was an opportunity to generate Ii bit of competition within that border around Australia and New Zealand as far as air services were concerned, but moi, old Pontius Pilate, decided that there was no way he was going to allow that because it might affect the credibility of Qantas in that sale process. We are hearing-although nothing official-that all sortsÂ·. of measures are being implemented in order to eliminate some of the regional services provided by Qantas's subsidiaries in the process. The reason given by some of the regional managers of these air services, after being pressed, is that they are trying to get it streamlined for the public float. So there are some conflicting philosophies that must generate a little bit of concern. The major amendment proposed by this bill seeks to extend from 30 June 1995 to 31 August 1995 the repeal date for provisions in the principal act which will not have commenced operation. As I said before, the rationale provided by the minister was: The government had not yet settled on a date for the public share offer but wishes to leave open the option of conducting it after the conclusion of the May budget. In that event, the sale timetable will be very tight and it may prove difficult to complete all necessary administrative arrangements by 30 June. To ensure that the government has sufficient flexibility with regard to all its options, the provides that the legislative sunset clause be extended ... As I have said, we have heard all sorts of nicknames being levelled at the government, but this is just one tactic with a little bit of spin that the government is using for this asset sale. The people of Australia have been hearing about this asset sale involving billions of dollars since 1990. That is four years. For four years we have been hearing the Minister for Finance, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister factor it into all their economic equations. They have said, 'We're going to do this and we're going to do that; we're going to sell this and we're going to sell that. That's what we're going to pay for this with.' However, behind the scenes, the government borrowings have been growing. The government is borrowing money to fund a lot of the programs. It is dragging its feet on this asset sale. The coalition is not opposing this asset sale but, from a personal point of view, the government should be far more genuine in what it is doing. It should get on with the sale of this asset. It should do what a lot of taxpayers of Australia are doing. They are selling a lot of their capital assets in difficult times, as this government is in now, and are using that money to retire debt. Do not use it on a holiday; do not use it to buy a new car. Use it to get rid of some debt; use it to pay off some of the mortgage that our children will have to deal with in the future and pay interest on. We will leave our children a legacy as a result of the actions of this government which this country has been putting up with for the last 10 years.",75
172,Mr TUCKEY,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"I join this debate because, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Elliott) advised us in his second reading speech, the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill deals with a further extension of the time the government now believes it needs to sell Qantas. The parliamentary secretary detailed the number of extensions that have occurred in this program. One cannot help but wonder, in light of the budget that this government brought to the parliament, how we can be bill asked at a time when the government is well into its financial year to approve a measure in which the government openly admits that it will be $2,000 million short in its revenue estimates. It is not $200; it is not $2,000; it is not even $20,000. It is just a lousy $2 billion-$2,000 million. In the forward estimates, this amount is shown as a negative to outlays-in other words; income-under the heading 'Outlays by functions', which is quite an interesting place to find it. The total of asset sales for 1994-95, as listed in table 6 headed 'Outlays by function', is $2,450 million, not all of which was applicable to Qantas. The budget speech made it very clear to us that the government's anticipation of the proceeds of Qantas was about $2 billion-maybe a bit more. This is just an amazing situation. It is further evidence of how badly this economy is being managed. It is astounding that a government could come into this place and say, 'Ho-hum, there's been a bit of a change down at the Stock Exchange, old chaps; they've brought in something called CHESS.' This is not a game of chess. The reason we are given for the government seeking to further extend this proposal is so that the revenue at best might-I underline the word 'might' - arrive in the next financial year. I do not know whom the government seeks to blame for this. I was interested to hear how often the Minister for Defence Science and  in an answer to me today. He did not seem to show much confidence in the advice he was receiving. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, and I know that when ministers start to use the word 'advised' they are not very confident about it. They do not want to come into this House and be told that they have misled it. They hide behind that word. I do not know where the government stands on this. We know all about the confidence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the then Treasurer, and the present Treasurer (Mr Willis). We have heard every phrase in the book-'champagne bubbles coming up', 'bringing home the bacon' and all these sorts of references. But the government and the Treasurer should literally be in here apologising to the people of Australia for having so grossly misled them in their budget calculations to the tune of $2 billion. That is the first point I want to make about this legislation. It has already been said by our spokesman, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), that we are not opposing this bill, for the reason that we think Qantas would eventually be better off in the hands of the private sector. But we really should be opposing this bill on the ground that we demand that the government meet its budget commitments to the people of Australia. The documents that the government brings in here are the greatest lottery in the world. It gives us all sorts of forward estimates, but it cannot even get the current year right. There is some fairly frightening evidence in its so called forward estimates, from which I have just cited that figure relating to asset sales. It may be of some interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in its 1997-98 estimates the government proposes to spend $10 billion on defence, nearly $11 billion on education and $10 billion on public debt interest. That will rise somewhat if the government does not sell Qantas because it will have to borrow, using y<;mr children and my grandchildren as securi"" ty, another $2 billion. This is an outrageous situation. Mr Beddall interjecting- '",78
173,Mr TUCKEY,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,I presume that you people are joking about the future of children in Australia. I can only assume that is what the minister and his parliamentary secretary were joking about. Mr Beddall-We were congratulating you on having another child.,79
174,Mr TUCKEY,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"I was talking about someone's children and someone's grandchildren. Please put any jokes that you want to make about kids on the record. I would like to use them in your electorate. Mr Snowdon-No jokes, comrade. No jokes.",79
175,Mr TUCKEY,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am not your comrade, either. Mr Snowdon-Thank God for that.",79
176,Mr TUCKEY,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am not. I have no admiration for you. So, if you will keep quiet, I can get on with what I am doing.",79
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.,79
178,Mr TUCKEY,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"The reality consequently is that a government that wants to make jokes about things like $2 billion is one that seldom gets things right. I cannot remember a budget being brought into this place by the government which has met its predictions. Sometimes they are substantially over, which is a bit of a help, and sometimes they are substantially under. But it never seems to get it right. The fundamental issue is that, during the years of which it boasts, the debt of Australians, as accumulated by the government on its behalf, has grown from about $15 billion to $100 billion. That has nothing to do with the international debt; that is straight-out debt. It appears, for the time being at least, that that debt will grow by a further $2 billion because the government admits in this legislation that it has not got around to selling Qantas yet. I commend the speech of the member for Ryan in which he raised grave doubts that the government will get $2 billion in the present share market. The prediction coming from the government's advisers of recent times is that, by the time we get this new date, interest rates could be up another four per cent. The investing public, of course, is not that silly. The member for Ryan warned that we could have a situation where, once the government has put the property on the market, floated it, sold it and declared a substantial profit because of the near monopoly of domestic air transport that still exists in Australia-which, of course, it has guaranteed by frightening out the only viable competitor, Air New Zealand-it might then go back and say, 'We have to make friends with Air New Zealand.' The spin doctors will again go to work, we will be given reasons why all this has to happen and the poor old mums and dads that have bought Qantas shares will be waiting a long time for a dividend. That is outrageous. We are told that the sale has to comply with all the requirements of the Stock Exchange. There is one requirement about honesty down there at the Stock Exchange. The member for Ryan, an expert in this field, could tell you that when you go down to the Stock Exchange with your prospectus you are supposed to make some predictions that are reasonably correct. When one looks at the way these people who are going to put out the prospectus run their budget, if I were a mum and dad investor, I would have to say I would have my doubts. That is the first point we are dealing with. Then we have the Air New Zealand fiasco which is inextricably linked with this legislation today. What an amazing situation we have! The Prime Minister went off to a meeting with the Premiers and then came back here and castigated them for not being able to get on with the Hilmer report recommendations relating to competition policy. I had a bit of advice about that meeting from someone else who was there. Apparently, the Premiers told the Prime Minister that they wanted to deal with him without officials. From that point on, the Prime Minister was mute. He did not know what he was talking about. The Premiers knew what they were talking about without officials, but the Prime Minister could not handle it. So the Prime Minister came back here and castigated the Premiers. He told us how the states and local government have to get on with competition policy. That is an admirable objective. But there is a third party in the federation. It is called the federal government. When is the federal government going to get on with its competition policy? The states have to do something about competition in electricity generation. The poor old local government people are running around wondering how they are going to comply; they are all writing us letters. But when it comes to competition for Qantas the government says, 'No, we don't want to do that,' and it kicks Air New Zealand out. When it comes to competition for ANL, 'No, we are not allowed to get rid of cabotage.' We could not possibly let the farmers of Western Australia get some grain around to the drought affected farmers of the east coast at anything like a reasonable price. We are stuck with the fact that it is cheaper to freight the grain all the way from North America. In fact, I am told it is half the price. We will probably ship some of the wheat from Western Australia to America because it will be cheaper to send it there. Surely, if this government were in any way dinkum about competition policy, it would practice a bit of it itself. The government would have the confidence in Qantas to take on the competition of Air New Zealand-after all, it owns some of Air New Zealand because it is a part shareholder; it should be able to handle that. This raises suspicions about what the government is really up to. I think it was the member for Ryan who said that it seemed to have more to do with putting pressure on Air New Zealand to buy a certain media proprietor out than it had to do with anything else, even protecting Qantas: If competition policy is a plank of this government-that is the sort thing the public wants to know, what the government is up to and what it really believes in; I think they thought it believed in the l-a-w tax cuts-it should be leading the way. Consequently, the government should have allowed the competition to proceed with Qantas and then gone to the market for two reasons. Firstly, the public ), would have had a clear indication of what the Qantas shares would be worth and, secondly, it would have been good government. It is good government because of the downstream effect. I have already raised the first downstream effect. We have people suffering in drought affected areas, denied the most economical way of getting help, without any government payout. I commend the government for going out and dealing out a pittance in these drought affected area-it was something. But for no cost at all to the taxpayer, just by allowing a bit of competition with ANL, the government could have substantially improved the financial affairs of many people trying to keep their breeding stocks alive by allowing them to buy Australian wheat, barley or lupins without the worry of exotic weeds being introduced from other parts of the world. The government could have solved the problem by saying, 'We will wipe out cabotage. We will give an example to the states of how to conduct competition policy.' When we get to Qantas, there happens to be a little thing in Australia called the tourist industry. The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) lectures us on how the tourism industry is growing. The tourism industry is totally dependent on the cost of air travel. The government props up Qantas and it starves the tourist industry. That is silly. That is the best way to describe it. The government is propping up Qantas and denying competition by people who sell rooms-which, by the way, I think it is wanting to tax-and the people who sell meals and charter trips to the Great Barrier Reef. I have heard it said-I cannot prove it-that there is so much ill-feeling in New Zealand that there has been a drop in New Zealand tourism to Australia. If someone produces statistics to prove me wrong, I will accept them. I am not surprised. I think the New Zealanders were treated abominably by that decision at that time. There may have oeen some aspects of the arrangements or negotiations that had been concluded, but the government could gee them up and give them notice or give them another month. It is back in the parliament saying, 'We need a few more months to sell Qantas.' If the parliament, on both sides, had any courage at all, it would be saying to this lax administration, 'Sorry, you cannot have it.' But that is not the way this place runs. If you get two faction leaders, you have a vote. It is an outrage that this parliament was demeaned to its lowest possible point by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) today. He is still trying to be Mick Young, and he is not funny. Parliament was demeaned to the lowest level. I know that the Minister for Finance has to put on a tough image because he wants to be the leader when the current leader retires. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he looked a lot better when he played his own role. I will bet his father is devastated by the performance he saw today. The minister's father, as honourable members might remember, was the person who said when he joined the Labor Party that it was the cream of the working class and when he left it that it was the dregs of the middle class. We have three of them sitting in the chamber tonight.",79
179,Mr GEAR,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I understand that we are debating the Qantas Sale Bill. I cannot see how anything that the member is talking about has anything to do with the bill. I ask you to bring him back to the bill. . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Andrew)Order! I agree that the member for O'Connor has strayed from the subject of the bill, but I indicate to the Assistant Treasurer that he has only just skated down that path and I was waiting for him to relate the Minister for Finance to the bill. I invite the member for the O'Connor to do just that.",81
180,Mr TUCKEY,QANTAS SALE AMENDMENT BILL,"Of course, he is the fellow who has to collect the money and I would imagine that he is inextricably related to this bill. He is the person who must answer questions in this place. It is a pity that today, in responding to a dorothy dixer, he tried to emulate Mick Young. Mick was genuinely funny and could do it without a script, but this fellow cannot. I will concede Mick's skills; he was great. Of course, if I need a reason for mentioning him, he is at Qantas, too. I think he has a pretty good job there. The facts of life are that this downstream effect on Qantas and the removal of this competition, which has been achieved and is associated with this sale-the sale is the reason they have had to hunt Air New Zealand out of this place-simply means that competition in air travel is not at the heights it should be. As a consequence of that, we get a situation where certain people will not take tourist holidays and certain people will not come to Australia. That is a major loss because the tourist industry is a highly profitable industry for Australia. It delivers that overseas income that we so desperately need to overcome the current account deficit, which is another part of the budget prediction that has blown out. Nobody seems to care. In all of that, I am reminded of the words of an economist speaking on behalf of CRA on the ABC today. He said something that I have repeated time and time again. It is in the context of the $2 billion not coming to hand in this budget. The simple fact is that children are going to have to carry the debt for the extravagance of this government. This economist made the other point I frequently make that overseas debt is frequently the problem of the private sector. It is only because of this government's consistent borrowing in the domestic markets that there is nothing left for the private sector to borrow. It therefore carries the responsibility. Anyway, if our net debt is now $170 billion, this government owes $100 billion of it. That is going to be aggravated by another $2 billion in this legislation; by the government's own admission, it cannot meet this income target on time. The government is blaming the Stock Exchange for changing some computer program, but that has probably been on the drawing board for four years. You do not put in a computer program of this nature with a click of your fingers. It is an outrage, and it is wrong. In fact, notwithstanding that we are supporting the legislation, this parliament should be saying to the government that it is totally unacceptable that it can rewrite its budget to the tune of $2 billion by coming in here with a couple of pages of legislation. I believe the government ought to be criticised for that. It is really a serious matter. I would have liked to have had a bit more time to talk about the debt effects. I think it is laughable that a government can lecture people in state governments about competition policy when it refuses to accept it in terms of its own operations in Qantas and ANL. The downstream effect that is having on other viable sectors of our economy is just unbelievable and it makes a joke of people who stand up and want to talk about competition when the government itself is not being competitive. Just think of the effects of the carbon tax on competition. It drives people out of Australia to countries that have low energy consumption per capita. It is just silly. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Certain Family Law Issues Committee",81
181,Mr GEAR,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I seek leave to add to an answer I gave to the House at question time. Leave granted.,82
182,Mr GEAR,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I wish to explain why the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues is wrong when it claims that the Child Support Agency's collection rate is only 42 per cent. According to a personal explanation from the committee chairman, the  the misunderstanding is based on confusion about how the CSA reports its collection rate. It is true that the CSA told the Auditor General, as reported in the ANAO report, that there were problems in using default measures at 2Y2 times average weekly earnings as a measure of debt. The figure assumes that everyone who does not pay child support owes child support based on 2Y2 times average weekly earnings. This is quite clearly not true. Some payers, for example, are unemployed; they owe. nothing. Others earn less than average weekly earnings and their debt will, in fact, be less than this measure estimates. However, the CSA has not yet refined a new method of measuring outstanding debt, and in the meantime the figures I referred to earlier in the House include default assessments. Moreover, the CSA informs me that it does not include, and never has included, private payment cases in its collection rates. It informs me that at no time was the committee told that private payment cases were included. That leaves me with my original answer given in the House today: that in the last year the CSA collection rate was 75 per cent of net liabilities and, since 1988, 68 per cent of all debt-as I said at the time, the best in the world. As for the formula changes proposed by the committee, I stand by my claim that those who would benefit the most would be nonit custodial parents on the highest incomesthose earning over $66,000 a year. Nevertheearnings, less, I want to reassure the House that the government will give careful and calm conbe sideration to the detailed recommendations the report.  spirit of the last remarks of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), which were that the government is looking forward to a calm detailed consideration of the report, I hope respond in kind; that is, I welcome that news. If there is some confusion about the collection rate, I can only say that it has been intentioned confusion and I believe it has been based on advice that the committee received, either from the Department of Social Security or from the CSA. Page 15 of the change. ANAO report, under the heading 'ATO response', states: CSA does not accept the 2.5 times AWE default assessments (or a 'realistic estimate') should reported as outstanding debts. These assessments are only created when no income information available for the liable parent for the previousÂ· years. Deriving a 'realistic estimate' in the absence of this information is not considered practical this stage. As discussed in the ATO's response recommendation 11, CSA will review the findings of projects which have examined default assesshaste. , ments, to determine if such an assessment can be found. All default assessments which are created on the basis of some historic income information are treated as 'realistic estimates''''':''''' that is the ones where they have informationand already included in the figures for outstanding debts. So one would assume that, where it says 2Y2 times average weekly earnings, they are not included. I thank the minister for clearing that up. I say to him that I, along with members of my committee, would welcome the opportunity to revisit that matter with the Child Support Agency and lay the possible confusion to rest once and for all. I make a comment about reducing the cap benefiting the best off. The reason the Department of Social Security gave for the CSEAG's recommendation that it be set at the same level recommended by my committeewas not because of the ministerial committee-that is, at 2- times average weekly was that those custodial parents who felt they were entitled to more income would forced to go to the Family Court for a of departure application. As I have said many times, one of the big improvements was the introduction of the CSRO process. That has obviated the necessity for people to go, and the worry that they and might not be able to afford to go, to the to Family Court. Therefore, the reason for increasing that cap from two to 2Y2 times no longer exists. We recommend that it go back wellto the original. amount. Very few noncustodial parents are earning above twice the has average weekly income, so very few people are going to be affected by that particular Mr Deputy Speaker, the other thing that I draw to your attention and the attention of the House is that we have introduced a minimum be payment of $260 per annum. Many custodial parents and their children will, under our is recommendations, for the first time receive five child support payments. I admit that the at payments will be very small, but many people to will receive them for the first time. I think it was perhaps something that was done in I want to emphasise again that I thank the minister for assuring the House that it will receive a calm and detailed response. I am happy to discuss-as I am sure members of my committee are--:-any of the issues that may be raised from such an examination. In the spirit of not wishing to prolong this disagreement about the collection rate, I accept what the minister says. I hope he accepts that our conclusions were based on information we believed we had got from either the Child Support Agency or the DSS. It would be most helpful if we could organise a meeting to lay some things to rest once and for all. I thank the House. (Quorum formed) NA AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 5 December. Second Reading",82
183,Mr BEDDALL,PIPELINE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to make a number of technical amendments to the MoombaSydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 and the Pipeline Authority Act 1973. The first of these amendments will ensure that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline can be licensed under state laws. The second category of amendments will facilitate the transfer of certain easements from the Pipeline Authority to ICI. The Pipeline Authority is currently obtaining easements for ICI to support the construction and operation by ICI of a new pipeline to transport ethane from Moomba in South Australia through Queensland and to Botany in New South Wales. At the time when the Moomba-Sydney pipeline was sold in June of this year, it was generally agreed that this was the most complex privatisation project undertaken by the government to date. Not only were the parties involved required to meet a very tight time frame, but the sale itself involved the transfer of all pipeline assets to the new owners, but with the Commonwealth retaining a joint ownership interest in the easements in which the pipeline runs. Further, the sale legislation had to take account of the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline project, which at that stage was still being developed between the Pipeline Authority and ICI. The task was not an easy one. The fact that the pipeline sale was completed on target and was able to also accommodate the future requirements of the ethane project attests to the determination and professionalism of all parties involved. The fact that the need for some technical amendments to the sale act has become necessary is, in the circumstances, not surprising. The amendments I am introducing today are essentially in two categories. The first addresses some concerns which were raised by the New South Wales government after the passage of the sale act with regard to its impact on the operation of state pipeline licensing laws. It was put to the Commonwealth that the legislation, as it stood, may have prevented state licensing laws applying to private sector pipelines running in easements in which the Commonwealth had an ownership interest. It was never the government's intention that state licensing laws should not apply to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline after its sale to East Australia Pipeline Ltd or, indeed, to any other private sector pipelines operating in these easements. Advice received from the Commonwealth Solicitor General indicated that the problem as perceived by New South Wales did not, in his view, arise. However, as the New South Wales Solicitor-General took a somewhat different view on this issue, the government agreed to introduce an amendment in this session to put this matter beyond doubt. Accordingly, I am now proposing the required amendments that will clarify and acknowledge the application of state pipeline licensing laws in the relevant circumstances. It should be noted that these changes will not affect the conditions under which the Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline is being constructed by the Pipeline Authority for ICI. The authority is undertaking the construction process, utilising immunities from state laws available to it under its own act. Once the authority withdraws from this project, however, these immunities will cease and ICI will become subject to those state licensing laws which these amendments are designed to uphold. The second group of amendments relates specifically to this Moomba to Botany pipeline project that will bring ethane for use as a feed stock to ICI's plastics manufacturing plant. In September, after considerable negotiation, ICI was able to finally secure sufficient quantities of ethane from the Cooper Basin producers for this important project to proceed. At the same time, the South Australian government approved the sale of these ethane reserves by the Cooper Basin gas producers to ICI. This in tum cleared the way for pipeline construction contracts to be let. The Pipeline Authority will initially be responsible for building this pipeline, and it is also obtaining those additional easements that will be required specifically for the ethane pipeline. As part of the agreed basis for this project, ownership of those easements being specifically obtained for the ethane pipeline by the Pipeline Authority are to be transferred to ICI once they have been secured. It is appropriate that the responsibilities and obligations of owning these ethane-specific easements should ultimately rest with the organisation that will own the pipeline itself. This is particularly so in this instance, where ICI is meeting all the costs associated with obtaining these new easements. The inclusion of specific provisions in the bill by which to effect the transfer of ethane pipeline easements has a particular purpose. It reflects the Commonwealth's undertaking to facilitate, to the extent possible, the quent registration by ICI of its ownership of these easements with state titles offices. Whether or not this will ultimately occur is a matter for the states to determine. The Commonwealth cannot give any undertaking to ICI on this matter of registration but has sought to enhance the prospect of this occurring by including specific transfer provisions in this bill. Whilst these amendments are technical in nature, they are nonetheless small but important steps in the overall context of the government's gas reform agenda. They will enable the Commonwealth to continue the process of disengagement from its involvement in the construction and operation of gas pipelines, allowing it to focus its attention on the creation of a pro-competitive market environment in the gas industry. The sale of the Moomba-Sydney natural gas pipeline to the private sector and the private ownership of the ethane pipeline project illustrate the confidence that business has in the future of Australia's gas industry. The most important role that government can play is to ensure that the potential that exists in this sector is realised and that the benefits of reform accrue to all gas users and ultimately to the nation as a whole. I commend this bill to honourable members.",84
184,Mr MCGAURAN,PIPELINE LEGISLATION,"The Pipeline Legislation Amendment Bill follows the passage of the MoombaSydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 earlier this year and the subsequent sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline. In the sale, the Australian Gas Light Co., AGL, in New South Wales acquired 51 per cent of the pipeline from the Commonwealth, with the other 49 per cent sold to a consortium, including Novacorp International, based in Canada, and Petronas, owned by the Malaysian government. This pipeline transports natural gas 1,300 kilometres from the Cooper Basin in South Australia to the metropolitan centres of Sydney and Canberra, and a number of regional centres in New South Wales. Construction of the pipeline was originally proposed by AGL, but it was eventually built subsesome 20 years ago by the Commonwealth government. Since then, the pipeline has been operated by the government through the auspices of the National Pipeline Authority. At the time of construction, AGL sought first refusal should the pipeline ever be sold, and the gas producers in Moomba also obtained rights in the event that the pipeline was sold. The New South Wales government also maintained an interest in the pipeline as the principal source of natural gas for New South Wales. Thus the sale of the pipeline as part of the government's asset sales program was an intricate process requiring accommodation of all interested parties. While it took five years to sell the pipeline, much of that time was wasted in a lengthy and expensive battle with AGL as to the legality of its right to first refusal. H!).ving fought off the government's legal challenges, AGL finally realised its option of obtaining commercial control of the pipeline, while the gas producers in Moomba agreed to compensation of $20 million to waive their rights. The Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994, which gave effect to the sale, was of considerable complexity as all the various rights, options and issues were unravelled and resolved. Given the determination of the government to complete the sale by 30 June this year, the original bill was hurriedly considered by this parliament. For instance, the government provided 42 pages of amendments to its own bill for the opposition to consider, just one day before the amendments were debated. In view of its complexity and the speed with which the original bill was considered, it is not surprising that there are issues which now need to be tidied up with amending legislation. The bill before the House will amend the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 and the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994 in minor and non-controversial ways. The first group of amendments will ensure that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline can be licensed under state laws. After the passage of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act, the New South Wales government raised the issue of its impact on the operation of state pipeline licensing laws. The New South Wales Solicitor-General was of the view that the legislation may have prevented state licensing laws applying to private sector pipelines running in easements in which the Commonwealth had an ownership interest. This set of amendments has been introduced by the government to put that matter beyond doubt. The second group of amendments contained in this bill relates to a pipeline project which will bring ethane for use as a feedstock to a plastics manufacturing plant owned by ICI in Botany, Sydney. On behalf of ICI, the National Pipeline Authority is currently obtaining easements to support the construction and operation by ICI of a new pipeline to transport ethane from Moomba in South Australia through Queensland to Botany. As a result of this legislation, the transfer of easements from the Pipeline Authority to ICI will be finalised. There will be no financial impact as the cost of obtaining the easements for the ethane pipeline is being met by ICI. In the interests of concluding these matters rapidly, the coalition supports the passage of the bill. I want to make a couple of more general comments regarding the gas industry. The gas industry in Australia today is still relatively immature. To put it another way, the potential for it is enormous. By saying that it is immature, I do not mean that it is not competitive, lean or efficient. It is all of those things. The players in the industry are as astute and committed as those in any other dynamic industry. But it has grown up in the shadow of the oil industry and has long been dominated by oil because of the higher expected financial returns, ease of storage and use for transport, and the higher calorific value of oil. Even now, the price of oil is a fundamental factor in assessing the financial return for large gas projects such as the North West Shelf. However, there have been developments in this regard in recent days. It is very encouraging to honourable members to see negotiations under way between the North West Shelf operators and the Japanese buyers of liquefied natural gas from the North West Shelf. I understand that there has been a spirit of goodwill in the talks on future pricing, which augurs well for a fair outcome for all concerned. This is especially important, given the enormous significance of the project for Australia's economy and international reputation. It is no secret that Japan is facing difficult decisions as to the quantity and mix of energy it employs, particularly in the light of addressing the greenhouse effect. Further, there are indications of an imminent shortage of LNG around the tum of the century. Thus, Australian LNG stands as an environmentally friendly, competitively priced energy source which will be in great demand however Japan addresses these future issues. As a result, there should be increasing returns for Australia which no doubt will be reflected in the final outcome of the pricing negotiations now under way. Oil itself has not always provided the financial return expected, but that is another story. That gas is shaking off this domination is without doubt. The enduring icon of the oil industry used to be a rig in the ocean, photographed at dusk, with a huge gas flare rising from a chimney, symbolising the enormous amounts of suppressed energy ready to work for consumers and an industry that never slept, with the gas extracted clearly secondary to the liquid gold. That is not so today. Today you would be hard pressed to find an oil platform flaring gas. A platform operator pursuing such a policy would have to have some strong justification-and not just because of heightened environmental awareness in the community. Accountants would be wondering why the gas was not being reinjected to boost the extraction of condensates or being collected for sale elsewhere. This change in the perception of gas has had a marked effect in many areas. Only 20 years ago Rex Connor, Whitlam's Minister for Minerals and Energy, was nationalising the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, taking it out of the private sector, which he thought could not be trusted to handle it properly, and putting into the hands of the federal government as a national asset. Rex Connor's vision was of a gas pipeline network which would stretch from one side of Australia to another, providing easy access to gas for every consumer. But it did not happen then. For a start, Jim Cairns, the then Treasurer, could not find the money, and gas as a commodity did not justify such an investment by the private sector. The financial sums did not add up, and there was the problem of demarcations along state borders. The fact that the Moomba-Sydney pipeline has now been sold back to the private sector indicates that the benefits of a vibrant Eas industry are being realised by governments and that the importance of gas as a commodity is being increasingly appreciated. Why else would BHP Petroleum have recently altered its focus towards significant investments in gas and be proposing a network of gas pipelines in the eastern states? Why else would gas have reached a massive 17 per cent of the primary energy market in Australia in the last 25 years? To my mind, the Australian Gas Association mission statement has exactly the right focus in striving for 20 per cent of primary energy demand by the year 2000. Nothing else will be as beneficial to the industry as the achievement of greater market share. The availability of gas to the consumer market is continually increasing, and as this coverage increases so does the associated innovation and technology advance. The perception of gas as a non-renewable fossil fuel is being replaced with an appreciation of the environmental benefits of gas in the community. In fact, these benefits ar<,! so strong that recently the government itself was caught by surprise. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested to know that a few weeks ago the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) launched the energy card, which gives a discount to consumers buying greenhouse friendly domestic water heaters. However, he claimed: . . . the increased use of solar water heaters is the single largest technical opportunity to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the energy sector in the short to medium term. Unfortunately for him, the minister had not completed his homework assignment. The Energy Research and Development Corporation-which comes under the minister's own portfolio-concluded in a report dated June this year that gas heating offered the best domestic greenhouse result. The report stated: . "" an informed electric water heater owner seeking to pursue a cost effective personal greenhouse gas reduction strategyand do we not allwould not adopt solar where conventional natural gas water heating is available. Even the federal government is yet to properly appreciate just how good gas technology is when it comes to environmental matters. Compared with other resource industries, the gas industry is characterised by long lead times for development of a resource; dispersed markets concentrated in capital cities; high capital costs; and high transportation costs. Critical to the future of the gas industry is the encouragement of exploration. If the incentive for investment in exploration is missing, there must inevitably be restraints on the development of the industry. While I, like most if not all honourable members, believe exploration is the key .to the future of the industry in the long term, there are even more immediate issues which require attention. In this regard, the gas industry in Australia is beginning to reach critical mass in terms of overcoming the vast distances between supplies and the demand centres in the capital cities. In the next decade many new pipelines will be laid and-at least in the eastern states-we will see an interstate gas grid emerge. The small number of existing operations will start to link up and begin to interact in a fundamentally competitive way. The introduction of competition to monopoly markets will cause some headaches with issues of. third party access to pipelines, adjudication on anticompetitive practices and the like. At least we on my side of politics expend a great amount of time thinking about how to disentangle industries from governmental ties of one sort or another. Largely, I am very happy to continue with that goal. That is not because I come to these issues with an especially vigorous ideological perspective, but because I simply suspect that common sense dictates that there are such things as commercial imperatives and natural developments in markets which governments should not overlook. That is, if you want to run a business, you have to be fairly business like in the way you go about it. The next 10 years will be very different for the gas industry than the past decade has been. The times ahead will be about planning and consolidating the industry's infrastructure and reserves base and getting its commercial relationships right between producers, suppliers, distributors and consumers so it canhave a straight run at emerging market opportunities. There are highly prospective markets in the electricity generation sector-which, hopefully, the national grid will facilitate still further-and in co-generation;"" manufacturing; end-use appliances, such as whole house ducting; and in the transport sector. I would have to say, however, that the markets and the likely rates of demand still lack definition and, because of this, all are facing a future growth pattern which will require some flexibility on the part of all the players in the industry. In such an environment, the last thing the industry needs is a complex regulatory presence by governments at either the state or federal levels. Volatile industries which are still modelling their demand for the future are very vulnerable to interventionist policies. They are very vulnerable to investment distortions, to bad risk management processes, to confused price signals and to uneven market developments. I think this is true for gas producers as well as for the enduse of the industry. In regard to the upstream industry, the AGA's own supply and demand scenarios foresee pipeline infrastructure investments ranging from between $2 and $3 billion to $11 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. Even at the more modest end of the spectrum, these investments are of such a magnitude relative to the size of the national economy that we cannot afford to skew the decision making in any way. To this, I would add a few other points. The Australian natural gas industry faces competition on price from across the whole energy market and, in particular, from alternative fuels. That is a point which policy makers often overlook. The industry faces growing costs, increasing demand and, hopefully, a growing number of sources of supply as well. So there are a lot of pressures at work in the industry as it is.. It is a big ask for the public policy process, but I would like to think that, on the lessons of the past, we might be able to get it right with the natural gas industry. Gas is a product which is marketable; that is, it is a clean energy source which should be able to capitalise on enormous goodwill if marketed deftly. It is a primary energy source with surrounding technologies which can yield very high rates of efficiencies, especially in electricity generation and co-generation. Moreover, it has a production and distribution process which does not require a team of public relations experts to .defend it. The industry is ecologically inoffensive. It beats being in asbestos or the like. If the industry can settle its intra-industry relationships on an open and commercial basis anq if governments can control the temptation to dabble and devise sectoral plans for the industry, then gas has got a better show than most of being able to be an industry that contributes to the economy over the long haul. I am pretty sure the industry can look after itself. Nothing illustrates this better than the development of the code of practice for access to interstate gas transmission pipelines. I am not naive enough to think that governments can in all circumstances vacate the field, but I do not think they should be the first option in regulatory matters. The pipeline access code, devised by the major industry groupings within the natural gas sector-the AGA, APEA and APIA-and settled with the advice of the Trade Practices Commission, demonstrates the ability of the industry to cut its own path and settle contentious issues without government intervention. J'he code deserves a decent chance-a proper test run. It deeply concerns me that the drift in government policy is back to a public sector generated regulatory regime for the industry under the guise of improving competition. A regime which meddles in the industry rather than guiding it would be a chronic irritant to the commercial processes which the industry must be exposed to if it is to evolve sensibly and efficiently. Under the Hilmer reforms, the TPC and the Prices Surveillance Authority will be subsumed by the new competition commission. Establishment of the new commission provides a firm opportunity to develop a fresh approach, unencumbered by the mistakes and excesses of the past. The new body also provides an opportunity to jettison the mindset that has become entrenched within the TPC and PSA in regard to the gas industry. A transparent competition framework based on the Hilmer reforms could reduce the uncertainty, costs and delays associated with these intrusions. However, I must admit to fearing that any government regulatory regime will . inexorably lead to bureaucratic and expensive intervention in the marketplace. Personally, I simply wish governments would spend more of their time attempting to create the across economy conditions which lead to sustainable growth for industries and restrict their role in regulatory matters affecting the resources and energy sector to facilitating commercial arrangements between relevant parties, smoothing out taxation regimes and ensuring permits and licences are granted and, land access concerns are minimised. These are sufficiently complex and responsible tasks in their own right for governments. In Australia we do not have many opportunities to watch new industries grow and develop .. For this reason, the natural gas industry is an exciting industry to watch. It has got the shape and character of the next generation of Australia written all over it. I can only hope and trust that governments do right by it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lindsay) read a third time. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1994-95 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1994-95 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1994-95 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 November, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the bill be now read a second time.",85
185,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,PIPELINE LEGISLATION,"I was speaking on Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) just prior to question time in the last sittings. I had focused my attention at the time on the areas of local government that I have a particular interest in with my portfolio responsibility. I had focused on the failure of the government to adequately address the general purpose grants, the contributions it makes annually to local government from the revenue it receives from the taxpayers of this nation. I touched on the importance of considering the impact that fly-in fly-out arrangements of mining operations have on the communities affected by those decisions, particularly on local government. I think the federal government has also failed to look adequately at the transient population, particularly in tourist areas, and the impact it has on the responsibilities of local governments. It is failing to respond to those needs through the general purpose grants. In fact, it is not even a consideration of this government. In general, local government's new responsibilities have been willingly accepted and dealt with as efficiently and productively as possible. Australian local government has confidence in it own abilities as a sphere of government to accept new challenges and responsibilities. However, what concerns local authorities is the federal government's reluctance to adequately resource local government so that it may properly execute its new and additional responsibilities. One example is the manner in which many councils today have responsibility for their local airports. In fairness to the government, there was a local airports plan under which most of these councils were handed over airports in an improved fashion, or the tarmac had been improved. But the fact is that today many of these councils now have a resource, the local airport, that is vital infrastructure the community and they have the responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of it. Many of these local airports in rural Australia do not get sufficient landing fees from aircraft to match the maintenance demands of the airports. So many of these communities are disadvantaged because of that additional responsibility. The federal government continues to rip money out of the system in the form of taxes on avgas, mogas and jet fuel, but we see very little of this going back to those local governments to assist with the maintenance of those airports. Notwithstanding that there was an agreement to have these airports taken over by local governmentsand in many instances it was against their wishes-consideration still needs to be given to some of those airports in rural and remote Australia where the landing fees are not sufficient to fund the necessary maintenance of those airports. That is just one example where the additional responsibilities of local government are a drain on its resources and in tum they have to be funded from somewhere. In these cases they are being funded by local taxpayers in the form of their local rates. In the absence of specific payments, it is obviously the expectation of the federal government that these matters would be funded from general purpose grants. However, despite the addition of new duties and responsibilities on local government, general purpose grants have remained static. In real dollar terms there has been no significant increase-in fact, a very slight decrease-in the value of general purpose grants provided to local government authorities since 1983, since the Labor Party came to the treasury bench of this nation. However, during the same period, the federal government's total taxation revenue has continued to skyrocket. In 1983 general purpose grants to local government in this nation accounted for 1.03 per cent of total tax revenue and in 1994 they amounted to just 0.79 per cent-a proportional reduction of around 25 perÂ· cent in terms of those general purpose grants since 1983. These figures completely belie the rhetoric for of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who ramble ad nauseam about their apparent partnership with local government. During the Prime Minister's address to the recent national general assembly of local government held here in Canberra, he said, 'I want us to continue to work together-in partnershipfor the good of the nation.' We have all heard this sbrt of rhetoric from the Prime Minister before, but it is never a genuine commitment. The rhetoric is never matched by commitment to support, in this case, local authorities with financial assistance. The reality for most local authorities is that this so-called partnership is very lopsided and unbalanced. The Commonwealth continues to expect more and more of local authorities and, ultimately, the ratepayers are left to pick up the tab. For example, in my own electorate of Maranoa-one of the worse drought affected areas of this nation-we are seeing more and more national parks being gazetted. In the Diamantina shire, in the west of my electorate, Diamantina Lakes, a large cattle station, has recently been converted to a national park. Turning that property into a. national park does have an effect on local government. When it becomes a national park, it is not rateable land, so 17 per cent of the revenue that the Diamantina Shire Council receives annually will be tied up in that national park. The council will effectively lose 17 per cent of its rate revenue because that property has been gazetted as a national park. Sure, we agree with the need for national parks. Noone disputes that, but we have to compensate these local authorities for those sorts of decisions where their revenue base is eroded by other needs and expectations of society. It is time this government met its rhetoric with some cold hard cash. It is simply not possible for many local authorities to drain their ratepayers any more than they currently do. In many drought stricken areas, councils' rating revenue has been severely restricted. There has been no growth in their revenue. They have tried to play their part in assisting the ratepayers of their communities, because the impact of the drought goes far beyond the farm gate. It extends into the small business sector and the local authorities are affected as well. The councils are not seeing any growth in revenue and they are playing their part in assisting those communities to contain their costs. Furthermore, as local government authorities are unable to independently access Loan Council approved borrowings, the revenue provided through general purpose grants assumes an even greater importance to them. There is no doubt about the significance of the general purpose grants to local authorities, particularly those that are small, regional or in rural or remote Australia. Their only alternative source of income is contracting work and even that is under a heavy cloud as a result of federal and state governments' indecision on the specifics and a timetable for a national competition policy. The effects of the increasing responsibility and the static level of funding is revealed by considering the vertical fiscal imbalance; in other words, the imbalance in this case between all three public sector levels. The vertical fiscal imbalance ratio measures the relationship between own source revenue and own purpose outlays for each level of government. A ratio of one indicates an equal balance between revenue and outlays. The Commonwealth government's ratio for the year 1992-93 stands at 1.23, indicating its revenue vastly exceeds its outlays. The ratio for state and territory governments is 0.5 and for local government, 0.72. This ratio reveals a situation where state, territory and local governments are handling an increasing and disproportionate amount of service and program delivery. However, the federal government's ever tightening grip on public finance is quite clearly failing to accommodate these responsibilities. Whilst the Commonwealth continues to lecture local government about the virtues of efficiency, value for money and accountability, this comparison clearly reveals the government could learn a thing or two from local government about stretching public sector dollars. At the same time as the federal government has been pandering to the lobby group of the month, funding extravagant and pointless make work schemes and meekly marching to the beat of its union masters, local government has been quietly going about the task of meeting community needs and demands. Local authorities have accepted the need to improve their efficiency, not because the Commonwealth demanded they do so but because they have a genuine interest in providing ratepayers with value for money and because they know only too well the federal government's fiscal commitment to local government is dwindling yearly. Many had embraced competitive tendering, resource sharing and enterprise bargaining long before the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister became born-again reformists. Others found different ways to drive the rates dollar further. Some looked for corporate solutions. Some embraced good old-fashioned frugality-something this government would not understand. Many of these local authorities nbt only have met these challenges but also have some cash reserves-something that this government knows nothing of. That is not to say that alllocill governments are beyond improvement. Many have a long way to go. Some will dispute the way in which reform progresses, but most governments understand the importance of local government efficiency-most, that is, except the federal government. There have been no rewards forthcoming from the government, just a continual downgrading of financial support and resources and ongoing ignorance of the important work of local government in bringing community leaders together and identifying and meeting their needs. I can assure the government that such failure to recognise the value of local ment, with the appropriate resourcing and support, does not go unnoticed by local government authorities of this nation, their 160,000 strong work force or the millions of Australian ratepayers. It is time the federal government shared more adequately the tax revenue that it receives froin the taxpayers of this nation with local government right around this nation. We truly saw a commitment to local government in this nation. We, on this side of the House, acknowledge that there are three tiers of government in this nation. We are prepared to share the tax revenue with the third tier of government, local government. It is about tim.e the federal government addressed the inadequacies of its policies.

186,Mr DUNCAN,PIPELINE LEGISLATION,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the appropriation debate tonight. I particularly want to refer to the appropriation for the Australian National Training Authority on page 31 of Appropriation Bill (No.3), which, deals with expenditure under the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992. The iiection of activities of the Australian National Training Authority to which I particularly want to refer tonight are those schemes known as group apprenticeship schemes. These schemes, for those not familiar with them, are ,excellent activities which were introduced by this government. They en-ble groups of employers, usually small employers, to get together !U}d involve themselves in group apprenticeship schemes. The purpose of these schemes is for a number of apprentices to be employed by the groups and, therefore, effectively be made available to a number of smaller employers who might not have otherwise been able to provide training to apprentices or participate in their training. On the other hand, these schemes have the thoroughly worthwhile aim of enabling apprentices to have quite wide ranging and broad based training with a number of employers over the period of their apprenticeship. These schemes work by a subsidy, under govern- appropriation, from the Commonwealth government. As is always the case, we as members of parliament must be assured that taxpayers are getting good value for their dollars. On the other hand, taxpayers must be reassured that their funds are being expended in accordance with the law and that they are getting very good value for money. Tonight I want to cleal with a group apprenticeship scheme known as the MBA (ACT) group apprenticeship scheme. It has been brought to my attention-I have been given a number of documents which seem to indicate this quite clearly-that there are grave concerns about the way this scheme is being run by this organisation. In the public interest, I think these documents ought to be made available to the public. I intend to read a number of them to the parliament tonight. The first is a statutory declaration. It states: I, Andrew Simon Hill do solemnly and sincerely declare I worked as a bricklaying Apprentice with the M.B.A ACT, that isGroup Apprenticeship Scheme. I completed my apprenticeship on the 8th of November 1994. During my apprenticeship when I was out of work and still be paid by the M.B.A. I was requested by Allan Wright and Bernie Bryant to do some paving and landscaping at one of Bernie Bryant's properties of Emu Ridge. I understand that is a suburb of the ACT. It continues: I completed these works during my down time and also one Saturday from 8.00 am to 7.00 pm. I understood that payment for these works during my down time was from the M.B.A. Group Scheme as I was paid for a normal day and the time on the Saturday was by a M.B.A. cheque given to me by Bernie Bryant. It then has the recital which is signed by Andrew Hill. The next document similarly is a statutory declaration. It states: I, Peter Edmund Ingold of 29 Loureiro Street Condor do solemnly and sincerely declare Whilst I was employed by the Master Builders Group Apprenticeship Scheme as an Apprentice Carpenter/Joiner, I was requested by Allan Wright (MBA Group Apprenticeship Manager) to go and work on Allan Wright's rental property (house) at Pearce. I was requested to re-wire and install new locks on the Tilt-A-Doors. This work was done without supervision and whilst I was on down-time (no host employer) with the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme. I was paid for the work by the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme not by Allan Wright. The recital is signed Peter Edmund Ingold. The third document states: I, Craig James Murphy of 25 Glenelg Street Kaleen in the Australian Capital Territory do solemnly and sincerely declare that whilst I was employed as an Apprentice Carpenter and Joiner with the Master Builders Group Apprenticeship Scheme A.C.T. I was asked to perform work for the Executive Director Mr Bernie Bryant at his home. 1991 1. Blackwell Circuit Flynn (a) Laserlite sheeting on a pergola whilst on downtime (b) Taking rubbish to the dump whilst on downtime 1991 2.

Narrabundah house-Heika-MBA Office Lady (a) Fixed up glass sliding door with another . apprentice whilst on downtime Another matter is dealt with, after which the statutory declaration's recital is signed Craig James Murphy. The fourth and final document states: I, Karen Sheedy db solemnly and sincerely declare I.was employed by the MBA in the position of Assistant Manager of the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme on the 16th of November 1992. During my employment, it became my responsibility to place apprentices with Host Employers for the apprentice to obtain their on-the-job training. From time-to-time it became extremely hard to meet the needs of the industry in its quest to train young people, because my work force (apprentices) would 'disappear to places unknown to me. This was due to Mr Allan Wright, who is the Manager of the Scheme, contacting out of work apprentices out of hours and demanding that they work on private jobs for him. Quite often when I asked Allan Wright if he knew where an apprentice was when. I was unable to contact him, I was told to rnind my own business. This incident would happen regularly when Matthew Pike, an apprentice Plumber with the Group Scheme, was out of work. It was an MBA requirement that when an apprentice was out of work that they were contactable. When I asked Matthew where he was and what he was doing on one occasion he told me that he had received a phone call from Allail. Wright the night before and was told that he was to go to Bernie Bryant's (Executive Director of the MBA) unit at Emu Ridge to work. I protested as I had work for Matthew with a Host Employer. To the best of my knowledge Matthew wits paid by the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme under the classification of down-time. Another incident was when Bernie Bryant asked me if I had any Appreritice Painters out of work. I advised him that I didn't and that an apprentice was on leave. He became very annoyed. I felt very pressured and called Jason Perrin (Apprentice Painter) who was on leave at home, to ask him whether he would be interested in doing some work at Bernie's place. I told him that he was to call Bernie and talk to him about the job. A short time later Simon Borwell (Apprentice Painter) was out of work. When he did not ring in at 8.30am which was an MBA requirement when out of work, I called his house. I spoke to his wife and she advised me that Simon was working. Upon asking Allan Wright where Simon was he told me that he was at Bernie's helping Jason Perrin finish the job. I am not aware of whether Jason Perrin was paid any monies for the work completed at Bernie Bryant's house. To the best of my knowledge Simon Borwell was paid by the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme down-time included in his normal pay. Other apprentices who Allan Wright arranged work for without my notification, to work on residences belonging to Bernie Bryant were Craig MurphyApprentice Carpenter and Joiner, Lindsay NewmanApprentice Carpenter, Andrew Hill-Apprentice Bricklayer, Simon Oates-Apprentice Electrician, Jason Perrin-Apprentice Painter, Simon BorwellApprentice Painter and Derrick Hehir-Apprentice Carpenter and Joiner. Discussions with some of these apprentices has revealed, I believe, payment for such work was part of their normal pay from the MBA Group Apprenticeship Scheme. I have discussed the work completed by Lindsay Newman and he told me that even though he worked on weekends at Bernie Bryant's residence that he did not receive any form of payment. Upon discussing this further with Lindsay in relation to complaining about this, he stated that he had grave fears for his job at the MBA if he did forward any form of complaint. I had no control over the allocation of work for apprentices and when I asked Allan Wright, I was told very aggressively to mind my own business. On a number of occasions when I attempted to contact apprentices who were out of work, I found that these apprentices would be off working at Allan Wright's direction. Despite my objection to apprentices doing work other than for Host Employers, this practise continued. Then there is a recital and the document is signed. The allegations contained in those statutory declarations are of considerable concern and are serious. There are other allegations which have been made to me concerning the ACT MBA group scheme, which I do not intend to deal with tonight. Now that it has been raised, the appropriate thing now is for the minister to order a full investigation of this scheme to explore fully all of the allegations of impropriety. If the cooperation of the MBA and its scheme are not forthcoming, and if the department does not have appropriate powers to deal with the matter, the matters ought to be referred to the Federal Police, who would have the powers to investigate the affairs of the MBA as well as the group scheme. The idea that people working on group schemes should be required to undertake work for essentially the administrative officers who are employing them is a repugnant suggestion. This is particularly serious because of the fact that this is not simply a private organisation. In fact, these are organisations which are fully or in part funded by the Australian government-and in this case I think also the ACT government. Because of that funding, it takes on an added seriousness. . We have just had the example in Melbourne of a senior executive of the Coles Myer corporation doing similar things to those alleged here, although I must say on a somewhat more grand scale in the case of Brian Quinn who, as I recall, has now been dealt with by the courts. Nonetheless, the principle is the same here with the exception, to some extent, that this matter is even more serious because of the fact that in this case, if these allegations are correct, we are seeing the misuse, the misappropriation, of public moneys. As I have said, this matter is a serious one. It needs to be referred to the minister. It needs to be dealt with expeditiously. If there is misuse of public funds going on, obviously . this particular group scheme should have its funding suspended at an early time and its books ought to be thoroughly examined. There are other allegations which I do not intend to deal with tonight. The matters I have dealt with are of sufficient seriousness, and quite clearly we should have a wide ranging investigation. If the investigation shows that there has been criminal conduct in this matter, apart from simple behaviour which administratively is not acceptable, then the appropriate action ought to be taken. I, It must be the case that the public can be reassured that, when public funds are being spent, every last dollar, every last cent, is accounted for properly and that no money whatsoever is misappropriated for private use. Anybody who does so ought to undergo the full rigour of the law and ought to be dealt with appropriately. Debate (on motion by M;r Leo MCLeay) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Leo MCLeay) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Moran Art Prize Jobsearch Allowance",92
187,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I have been honoured byÂ· the Moran family who have asked me to announce the winner of the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize. Art lovers willÂ· be familiar with Doug and Greta Moran of the Moran Health Care Group. They are great art lovers, with Greta Moran an artist of some note in her own right. They commenced giving this prize in 1988. This year there were 448 entries, of which a final 30 were selected to be displayed in capital cities around Australia, including Canberra-and perhaps many members in this chamber saw the exhibition in Canberra. I am also delighted that Dubbo-which, of course, is in the Parkes electorate-was chosen as the only non-capital city in Australia for an exhibition. First prize is $100,000, which makes it the richest portrait prize in the world. We lead world in so many areas of science and sport and I believe it is about time we matched that in areas of art. I believe this prize will go a long way to making us a world leader in the field of portraiture. The winner this year is Josonia Palaitis, a Sydney artist who has done portraits in the past of John Howard, John Dowd, Justice Michael Kirby and even the interviewer Paul Lyneham. This year she has done a portrait of her father, John Mills, which I have here with me. It was done just before his death when he was 86 years old. The paintings were judged by two Australian judges and one internationaljudge, Professor Nicola Spinosa, who is the Minister for Art and Culture in Naples, Italy. He said that Josonia's portrait showed: . .. vitality, expressive intensity, strong inner communicative power . .. natural rendering of facial details and feelings, brilliant use of colour, true rendering of light and shadow, effective placing of a figure in space, natural sense of movementI extend my congratulations to Josonia Palaitis on winning such a prestigious award. I would also like to congratulate the other 30 finalists, asÂ· there were some wonderful paintings to choose from. I am sure the judges had a difficult task to choose a winner out of such a fine selection of portraits. In the time remaining to me tonight, I would like to readÂ· from a letter that was handed to me yesterday by a gracious but very distressed and concerned lady, Margaret Roberts of Cardew, Collie Road, Dubbo. I think this letter highlights the great difficulties farming families have in getting any sort of assistance from this government. The letter reads: As we reside in A Riding Dubbo, PP Board we are not in an exceptional circumstance area. We have had a total failure of our grain crop which is the result of the drought. This is our major income, and we now find ourselves with no income and unable to support ourselves and pay our bills. I had no option but to apply for Job Search Allowance, in order to survive. This was accomplished with .the help of our accountant, who assisted me to fill in thirty one pages as well as the numerous photocopies of tax returns, bank accounts etc. Armed with all this information I went to the the Social Security office, where I waited for 50 minutes to deliver these documents. After approximately 2 weeks, this application was rejected on the grounds that I could not be available for full time work. On the advice of our accountant I filled my form in very honestly and stated that due to my husband's ill health I could not travel 60 kms to work in Dubbo not only because of the mechanical condition of our car, but because my husband has spent a month in Sydney in a private hospital being treated for depression and is still on medication for this condition. This I feel is a legitimate reason why he cannot be left alone while I go away to work. I was also informed when I was asked about a sickness benefit, that I could not prove that my husband's illness had caused us loss of income. After I received the rejection to my application, I phoned our accountant to seek further advice, by this time. I was feeling rather desperate. Where would we get money to buy food with? There was some additional information Social Security required so our accountant said OK we will provide this and looks like you have to be available for full time work. I then rang the young lady at SS and infonned her of this. Her comment then was, I will now require a letter from you telling me how you intend to have your husband taken care of. I had enclosed with my application a letter from the hospital that my husband was in Sydney. I will send more details if required. This letter graphically illustrates that our bureaucracy and an insensitive government is hindering assistance from being provided to a deserving farming family. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) should act immediately to rectify this deficiency. Sydney Airport: Third Runway",95
188,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak tonight o.n a subject that is bothering the whole of southern Sydney; that is, the opening of the new third runway at the Sydney airport. I and other people are sick and tired of hearing that the aircraft noise affects only Labor electorates. Let me assure you that, in my own electorate of Cook, which is definitely Liberal held, something like 1,800 people are being subjected to aircraft noise that has never happened before. I rise tonight to say how ridiculous it was for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to open the runway on 4 November, some five or six months before the control tower was completed. The nonsense of this has put an added strain onto all staff connected with the airport. It has put an unnecessarily unbearable strain on the people of Kurnell. I want to make the point tonight that the decision to open the runway was not a decision by the Federal Airports Corporation or the CAA. It was a political decision. We have to bear in mind the fact that the opening of the third runway by the Prime Minister on 4 November was purely political. No-one in their right mind would have thought of opening a runway before the control tower was finished. It is obvious to all who pass by that airport that the controlÂ· tower is nowhere near finished. Having been the member since 1966, I can assure you that until now Kurnell has never had planes flying directly overhead. This means that they are also flying directly over an oil refinery. Mr Knott-Did you support the second runway? .",96
189,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,The member does not under. stand. Any minister who allows the government to open an airport that demands that planes fly directly over an oil refinery is absolutely crazy. I have been connected with air noises around Botany Bay for 28 years and never have I heard such flagrant political nonsense as that spoken by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the Prime Minister about what is happening there. People on both sides of the House should be aware of this problem because it could well happen to them in the future under this present government. The whole decision to open and to operate the third runway in Sydney is a political decision. The other point I want to make in the few minutes of my speech remaining is that it was a Labor Party decision to open the runway. It was a Labor Party decision to build the runway. Mr Bevis-You voted for it.,96
190,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,"No, I did not. I did not vote for the third runway-ever. Look up the Hansard and find out. The people of Kurnell know that I did not vote for it and so does our government of the day. The reality is that the Labor Party has to take responsibility for the third runway. It has to take responsibility for. the shocking opening of the runway. It should be condemned and is being condemned by the residents of Sydney. I believe it will have a radical effect on the result of the next federal election in New South Wales in a way that members opposite will not like to see but, I hope, in a way that members on our side will be happy to see. The distressing thing is that this is coming about because of a totally unnecessary situation that has been placed on the people in the Kurnell district. I have so much to say about this. I have already presented 12 questions on notice today to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) about this. Mr Knott-You are grandstanding.",96
191,Mr DOBIE,ADJOURNMENT,You are saying that I am grandstanding. Let me tell you that it is called being a good local member. You might learn a few tricks from me. You think of that at your preselection in a few months time and remember what being a local member is all about. I will be speaking on this subject on many occasions in the future. Ethanol,97
192,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am budget often extolling to this House 'the virtues ethanol as an environmentally friendly fuel. So it certainly gives me great pleasure this evening, in the very week that cabinet will making a decision about greenhouse gas million emissions, to advise the House of the results of the 1994 energy challenge that took place during the weekend of 26 and 27 November. first year. It gives me great pleasure because ethanol as an additive has proved once again to be outstanding fuel. For those people unaware the energy challenge, I would like to say that this challenge not only compares distance travelled by vehicles against fuel consumption but, more importantly, measures greenhouse gas emissions. Many Australians will be interof ested to know the results. The New South Wales Transit Authority, for example, entered two buses: one was brand new high-tech gas powered vehicle and the other was an old Mercedes with a tank full of diesohol, a revolutionary new based on ethanol and developed by an AusAustralia's tralian company, APACE Research. The help result? The diesohol powered in with a 15 per cent lower greenhouse gas index. The heavy transport section was won by diesohol powered vehicles. They finished first and second and also emitted the lowest readings by far of greenhouse gas. This is the third year in a row that the overall winner the event was an unmodified heavy-duty truck powered by diesohol and entered by Boral Transport and APACE Research. These results have vital implications for all Australians. Not only can diesohol contribute to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; it can create jobs and it can reduce our dependence on imported fuels. Dr Russell Reeves of APACE Research, who developed this revolutionary technology, is a world leader. He is one of those scientists in whom Australia can take the greatest of pride. APACE holds the world patent for blending ethanol with diesel, and the company is now seeking a partner to develop a new process of producing ethanol from woody tissue and forest waste. We have supported this new industry. Our government has provided a grant to construct a trial ethanol from woodchip plant. In the this year, we subsidised the production of of new ethanol to encourage investment in this exciting, industry. A company such as Boral, one of the largest woodchip exporters be in Australia, had the opportunity to invest $2 in the construction of this trial plant. If it had done so, it would have got back in excess of $1 million in tax concessions in the This same company is the major user' of an forestry resources in New South Wales. It had of a golden opportunity to participate in an industry that could revolutionise the use of forest products, an industry that can create jobs where we need them most, an industry that can save our environment in a multitude ways: But, unfortunately, Boral has elected not to participate. I have no doubt that the quick quid has won again. However, I am a confident that APACE Research will find a partner. The 1994 energy challenge has shown what ethanol can do. The challenge now is for fuel industry, with a genuine commitment to future, to grasp the opportunity to Australia's future and that of the world, bus romped it as well as its own. Chrysalis Choir Mrs SILVIA ,SMITH (Bass) (7.41 p.m.)-I am holding a copy of the front page of my local newspaper, the Examiner, printed today. of It depicts a bus load of young children between the ages of eight and 12. They are all throwing their hands in the air and smiling. I want to congratulate those children. They are from the Chrysalis Choir in Exeter. Exeter is a very small township just outside my electorate in the electorate of the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams). I was approached by members of the parents and friends association of this choir some four weeks ago. They advised me that they had just been invited-this is an invitation only event-to the 1994 National Music for Youth Festival which is being held in Port Pirie. They went to the local airline and got a good deal but they needed $20,000-odd. They came to me asking what I could do to help them. I did a lot of things and I gave them advice and financial assistance as well. They are now off to Port Pirie. This is an example of a group that does not take no for an answer. The choir has raised an incredible sum of $24,000 in just four weeks. The Exeter Primary School, the parents and friends association and the community were behind them. They had a dream; a dream to compete. They competed in Hobart and they were acclaimed. Chrysalis is a choir without accompaniment. That is not an easy task. The choir consists of 50 young vocalists aged between eight and 12 years. To be invited to the National Music for Youth Festival was something to aspire to. They did not think that their dream was going to be realised. But there is a tenaciousness there in the community that, when all looks difficult and the ladder looks too high to climb, people get behind people and aspire to achieve. The choir has spent the last four weeks writing to a lot of people, including me. They have had gymkhanas, open gardens, sold cakes, had stalls-anything they could think of to raise the necessary funds in this small community. I congratulate the Exeter Primary School and particularly congratulate the young people in the Chrysalis Choir. I congratulate the parents and friends association that was behind those children. They wanted to achieve and they did. They achieved without begging governments or sponsors. They did it on their own. Tunarama Festival",97
193,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) for her words on these young people. I look forward to welcoming them to Port Pirie. I will be attending that function and am looking forward to it very much. Tonight, I would like to say a few words about the Tunarama Festival which is held in Port Lincoln every year on the Australia Day holiday. Port Lincoln overlooks Boston Bay, one of the great harbours of Australia. Port Lincoln is noted for its tourist attractions. It is a beautiful city on the edge of this magnificent harbour. Port Lincoln is the home of the largest fishing fleet in the Southern Hemisphere. A highlight is the Tunarama Festival. There are a number of events on that weekend. The one that I will particularly focus on is the festival queenÂ· or king competition. This a charity event similar to the Miss Australia Quest. Entrants secure a sponsor and take part in a series of personal development sessions which enhance these young people in a very positive way. They select various charities, some of which are local and some of which are spread throughout the state and country, and raise money for them. . Entrants participate in three sessions on speech writing, structure and presentation with the Penguin Club and a mock session of the out sashing night. Having been to the last two sashing nights at Port Lincoln, it is quite an event. It is a credit to these y-)Ung people who have only ever spoken once or twice before. The entrants take part in two media training sessions with the local media. One involves an unprepared interview andÂ· the other is a taped interview. They review the tape and do it again. The progress they make in their presentations and relaxation is very evident. They have three half-hour deportment lessons and one radio media training night. They have a session on dining etiquette with presentation, serving and waiting by TAFE trainees. They are given advice on stress management and taught how to relate in a new role to family, friends and work mates. They are given advice by a dietitian from the Port Lincoln Hospital and they are given a lesson on skin care and make-up, hair grooming and styling. Their knowledge of the region is expanded with a mystery tour of historical and tourist attractions accompanied by the local TV crew. Background taping is done for a women's world interview and they visit tourist spots such as First Landing, Stenross Maritime Museum, the Marilyn Maine Gallery, tuna farms and tuna processors. Entrants come from all walks of life. The event has recently been opened to both sexes. They almost had a male entrant this year, but I understand that that is yet to occur. Currentfight ly the winner is called the Festival Queen. The biggest fundraiser is the Charity Queen and, as I mentioned, a significant amount of money is raised. Entrants need and get a great deal of family support. The organisers would like to broaden the area entrants come from. They currently come from the Eyre Peninsula towns, but in the future they could come from other areas throughout South Australia. The entrants this year are Christine Ayers, Anita White, Kylie Smith, Angela Rose, Simone Pieterman and Teresa Webb. They are a credit to themselves, to their trainers, to their parents and to their communities. This event will culminate on Australia Day 1995. I am sure this House would wish them all well. Illawarra: Regional Development",98
194,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to acknowledge the presence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the Illawarra region on 2 December. The Prime Minister was in the Illawarra region for the opening and launch of the Illawarra REDA, the regional economic development area. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that part of the government's policy in Working Nation was to address regional Australia. At the recent launch of an Ulmer committee report on the strategies for the Shoalhaven, I noted that the government's policy on regionalism stretched back a long way. Perhaps the strongest push in that direction was during Gough Whitlam's days with the Department of Urban and Regional Development which had at its helm a man for whom I have great admiration-Tom Uren. In those days Tom Uren had the foresight to see that regional Australia is the engine house of this nation. Honourable members would note from some of the recent reports that the highlights of economic development and the future of Australia, such as the provision of jobs, increased marketing and increased manufacture, have been in two areas: firstly, regional Australia and, secondly, small and medium business. It has been my great pleasure to fight and hard for representation for my electorate, which has 80,000 people. It is one-third of the Illawarra regional economic development area. I have pushed for the inclusion of representatives from the major industry in that region, which is tourism. Something like $315 million per year comes to the Illawarra region from tourism, with $265 million coming to the Shoalhaven area in the electorate of Gilmore. There are approximately six million visi!ation nights per annum. I have had great pleasure in nominating one Roger Summerill, a noted businessman and chairman of the Shoalhaven Tourist Board and the South-East Tourist Board, as a representative of that industry. I hope that will soon come to fruition. I have also noted the second powerhouse as a potential great growth area for employment, which is a significant factor in my electorate. Achieving employment is something that I have committed myself to assisting; that is, jobs for the children, the young folk, and jobs for those people in middle age, the family folk. Also, let us not forget those people aged 40-plus requiring jobs. It is often very difficult for those people to find employment having had long periods of employment. Their skills may have become redundant. The opportunities afforded to those in regional Australia are not as plentiful as those afforded in big cities. The Illawarra regional economic development area is a vital plank in the government's approach to bringing this nation to its full potential. The nation has achieved a great deal. My electorate particularly has realised great potential. It was interesting to note when I was launching the Ulmer study on strategies for the Shoalhaven that all is not what it seems. Many of the speakers who spoke before me talked about the worse recession for 60 years. I draw the attention of those speakers to one part of the report, to statistics that came directly from employers. Sixty-one per cent of employers interviewed had experienced employment growth over the last three years. That is somethingÂ· I do not believe those people understood or really took into account. I congratulate the Prime Minister ing down to our region,Â· and congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) for his foresight. I pledge myself to seeing that the whole of the Illawarra region progresses through this program-a magnificent program which shows the foresight of this government. I will fight hard particularly for those areas. my electorate to see that they are adequately represented, that all facets of business in areas, particularly tourism and small business, are adequately addressed and that the stratstarved egies which come forward, which will cally be around transport, educll,tion anc- the provision of services to my area, are afforded great detail. I finish by suggesting that the future lies the regions. The future lies with small and medium sized business and their ability to get out there and market. We have a great.numhis ber of exporters from our area. (Time expired) Gooreng Gooreng Dictionary",99
195,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"The I Aboriginal people have lived in and roamed this great continent for 40,000 years, yet in the last 200 years, since the arrival of Euroday pean settlers, much of that indigenous history, culture and tradition has either been destroyed or lost. Various efforts have been made to revive or restore that history and culture, but none is more important than the survival of dream. the Aboriginal language. Indigenous history is a living thing, handed down and carried on by that language-the paedia spoken word, the story telling. All too often this living link of language has disappeared. Tonight I commend the efforts of a dedicated group of people who have helped restore one such language, that of the Gooreng Gooreng tribe of central Queensland, which has just released a comprehensive dictionary containing 700 words and meanings. The Gooreng Gooreng are a proud people. Their tribe, together with the Kabi and Wakka tribes, make up the Kabi nation, which dominates the central and south-eastern comer of Queensland. The Gooreng Gooreng consisted of eight clans and stretched from Bundaberg in the south to the Calliope River near Gladstone in the north and west to the Cania for comGorge, near Monto. Interestingly, a point that white history books fail to record is that the Gooreng were probably the very first Aboriginal people to make contact with Captain Cook when he landed in 1770 to take fresh water at a spring in what is now known as the Town of 1770of Agnes Water, in the north-west of my electorate of Hinkler. Unfortunately, the Gooreng those Gooreng, like many other tribes during the early part of this century, were murdered, or sent off to settlements like Woorabasibinda, Cherbourg and Palm Island. Despite this more recent turbulent history, the language of the Gooreng Gooreng has managed to survive through a handful of in people. Gooreng elder Nyulang Johnson is just one of two people alive today who can speak the language fluently. In a foreword to dictionary, Nyulang vividly recounts the slaughter of his people at Mount Colloseum and how his father and his language were saved. He states: am honoured at this opportunity to pass down my knowledge to the younger generations. I once had a dream that all our people would one be able to speak our language as it was spoken in the past: that our culture w0!lld b- rekindled and that we would grow together 10 umty. The publishing of the 'English-Gooreng/GoorengEnglish Dictionary' is like a realisation of that The disappearance of Aboriginal languages is quite frightening. According to the Encycloof Aboriginal Australia, it is estimated that 10 per cent of Aboriginal people still speak their indigenous tongue. Of the orig-nal 250 or so distinct languages, over two-thIrds are either extinct or have only a handful of elderly speakers remaining. Of the surviving 90 languages, only 20 are actively transmitted to children and are spoken fluently by those children and adults in a wide range of activities. The other 70 remaining languages are progressively weakening and are not being passed on. It was against this difficult background that a deep and genuine concern for the future of their people that the Gurang Land Council has over the last five years - actively sought to rediscover its origins through mapping significant sites, collecting artefacts and now reviving the language through this dictionary. Early next year they hope to release a history book telling in the printed word the story of the Gooreng people. Tonight I publicly acknowledge those associated with the dictionary. They include Nyulang Johnson, Konni Walker, Mervyn and Colin Johnson, and the principal author, George Helon, who is in fact an Australian genealogist of Polish descent. Those behind this unique publication see it as only the start, a beginning, to help their people to identify who they are and where they have come from. This dictionary provides a vital link between the past and the future. During the last sitting fortnight I was honoured to have been able to present copies of this book first to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who received the book most graciously, and then to the Parliamentary Library for the benefit of all members and senators who serve in this place. I end with the words of the Gooreng elder Mervyn Johnson, nephew of Nyulang Johnson. He states: Our children are our future, and if we teach them now about their language and their culture, we will ensure its continuity. 'The English-Gooreng/Gooreng-English Dictionary' will help preserve the language of Qur people and help them regain their identity, their pride of race and instil its sense of belonging. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.58 p.m. NOTICES The following notices were'given: Mr Filing to move That this House: (1) notes that, to date, there has been no indication from the Government as to the treatment of native title payments and costs, including research costs, legal costs, compensation payments and other royalties and provision of housing, welfare and other community development projects, in respect of income taxation deductions; (2) expresses concern that, should native title expenditure be treated under existing tax principles as non-deductible capital expenditure, this will create a large disincentive for miners and pastoralists to be proactive in their dealings with native title issues; and (3) therefore calls on the Government to immediately remove this uncertainty by addressing the taxation treatment of expenditure incurred in relation to native title claims. Mr Brereton to move That this House: (1) congratulates the International Labour Organisation (lLO) on the 75th anniversary of its foundation and on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Philadelphia; (2) notes that Australia was a founding member of the International Labour Organisation when it was formed in 1919 with 45 member states; (3) notes that on this anniversary, as a result of the ongoing international support for the Organisation, there are now 171 member states; (4) recognises and appreciates the uniqueness of the Organisation within the framework of UN specialised agencies by way of its tripartite structure, which enables - governments, employers and workers to participate directly in its activities; (5) reaffirms its support for the important role played by the ILO as an international forum dedicated to the objectives of promoting and raising labour and social standards with a view to advancing social justice and ensuring world peace; and (6) wishes the ILO continued success in building links of friendshi.p and understanding through the improvement of working conditions, general welfare and the human rights of working people and their families throughout the-world.

NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 6 December 1994: Australian Bureau of Statistics Act-Australian Bureau of Statistics-Proposals 1994 Nos. 31, 32. Census and Statistics Act-Australian Bureau of Statistics-Statements 1994 Nos. 4, 5. Income Tax Assessment ActDetermination-Transitional RHQ company 1994 No.1. Guidelines for the determination of regional headquarters companies 1994 No.1. Remuneration Tribunal Act-Remuneration Tribunal-Determinations 1994 No. 28. The following answers to questions were circulated: Untimed Local Calls (Question No. 1289) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 9 June 1994: (1) How many telephone subscribers in (a) Australia and (b) the electoral division of Parkes do not have access to untimed local calls. (2) Where are the subscribers located other than those in Parkes. (3) Will access to untimed local calls be extended to all subscribers. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question, is as follows: (1) Telecom advises me that: (a) approximately 10,875 telephone customers - n Australia do not have access to untimed local calls; and (b) approximately 1151 customers in the electoral division of Parkes do not have access to untimed local calls. (2) The remainder of customers who do not have access to untimed local calls are located in the sparsely settled areas of most States and the Northern Territory. (3) Telecom advises me that it believes that call charges available to customers in remote sparsely populated areas under the Countrywide Calling Scheme represent better value than if the standard charging zone arrangements of the more densely populated Â¥eas of Australia were applied. I am advised by Telecom that: under the Scheme customers in extended zones have access to all other customers in their own zone at Pastoral rate (currently 25 cents for 4Y2 minutes) as well as to their Community Service Town, both irrespective of the actual distances involved; customers are guaranteed access to ;t minimum of 500 customers, within their OWl). and adjoining zones, whom they can ring at theÂ· maximum charge of the 50--85km distance rate irrespective of the actual distances involved even though these can involve several hundred kilometres. For instance, a 4'h minute call costs between 54 cents (at economy rates) and $1.16 (at day rates). By comparison customers in standard zones to NA whom concessional rates such as the Pastoral Call do not apply, would have to pay between 74 cents (at economy rates) and $1.68 (at day rates) to make a 4'h minute call over a similar distance; the majority of local calls last for around three minutes. Nomad Aircraft (Question No. 1347) Mr Taylor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) When will the report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman into the fatal crash involving an RAAF Nomad aircraft in 1990 be submitted. (2) When was the matter referred to the Ombudsman. (3) Has the report been prepared; if so, is the report highly critical of (a) RAAF maintenance deficiencies and administrative handling of the crash and (b) the culpability of AeroSpace Technologies of Australia. (4) Do the (a) Australian Regular Army and (b) RAAF continue to operate Nomad aircraft under operational flight limitations. (5) Will the Ombudsman's report be made available for parliamentary debate.  provided tJ:te following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Ombudsman released her report on 11 July 1994. (2) 25 November 1991. . (3) Yes; (a) No; (b) some maintenance shortcomings at AeroSpace Technologies of Australia were identified. . (4)(a) and (b) No. Pending the results of Civil Aviation Authority, Aerospace Technologies of Australia and the RAAF's Aircraft Research and Development Unit investigations, the Army and the Air Force have temporarily suspended Nomad operations. The results of these investigations are expected in early 1995. (5) The Ombudsman's report will be considered as part of a current 'Inquiry Into Matters Relating to the NOMAD Aircraft Crash in South Australia on 12 March 1990', which was referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Refere-ces Committee on 8 November 1994. Salo: 120 Days of Sodom (Question No. 1352) . Mr Filing asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: Has his attention been drawn to the availability in Australia of an 'R' rated film entitled Salo: 120 days of Sodom; if so, (a) does the film depict graphic images of sodomy, urolagnia, coprophagy, suicide, scalping, paedophilia and other acts of depravity,(b) did the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards (i) describe the film as a catalogue of horror, outrageous, disgusting and wallowing in depravity, horrific imagery and inhuman sadistic sexuality, and (ii) find sensational exploitative shocking perversion, strong impact of revulsion and disgust at the cruelty, inhumanity and hedonism in the film arid (c) will he immediately ban the film in the interests of the community; if not, why not.",100
196,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) I understand that, with the exception of paedophilia, the film contains depictions of the type described in the question. In relation to the issue paedophilia, the past Chairman of the Film and Literature Board of Review adopted the position that the actors employed in the film were young adults and that, if child abuse or child pornography were depicted in the film, the Review Board would have 'refused' the film. (b) I am advised that the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards described the film in strongly disapproving terms. (c) The Film Censorship Board refused registration to Salo on 18 December 1992 because it was considered indecent under Regulation 13(I)(a) of the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations. It was a majority decision with 7 voting for 'refuse' and four for an 'R' classification. The Film and Literature Board of Review, on appeal on 13 January 1993, directed that Salo be registered for importation under the Customs (Cinematograph Films) Regulations and that it be classified as 'R' - for restricted exhibition subject to the condition that advertising matter prepared for the film by Premium Films, the applicant, be submitted to the Review Board for approval. The Review Board also directed that the consumer advice-'DISTURBING ADULT CONCEPTS AND mGH LEVEL VIOLENCE AND SEX' appear in advertising for the film. The Review Board said in its decision that: The film is generally considered to be a metaphor for fascism and oppression and a critique of capitalist exploitation. Salo presents us with the most stringent test to date of the basic principle that adults in a free society should be able to see what they wish. ... we agreed that its depictions, while frequently shocking, were integral to the filmmaker's purposes, and therefore not gratuitous; nor were they in anyway erotic or titillating. The film has been classified 'R' - for restricted exhibition which means that it may be exhibited to persons 18 years of age and over. It has not been classified for sale or hire. While it is possible for some States Attorneys General to intervene in the classification process and vary the classification of Salo for their jurisdiction, it is not, I am advised, possible for the Commonwealth Attorney-General to do the same. This is because the Film and Literature Board of Review's decision to classify Salo as 'R' (for restricted exhibition) is made under State legislation. The State law confers the power to classify, on appeal, to the Review Board and, in the cases of Western Australia and South Australia, the power to intervene, as has occurred, to the responsible State Minister. Under the Customs (Cinematograph Films) of Regulations, the power to prevent importation, ceased to apply once the Review Board directed that the film be registered for importation and it was released from the control of Customs. The Commonwealth Attorney-General cannot intervene in the Review Board's decision regarding 'Salo'. Department of the Attorney-General (Question No. 1367) Mr Latham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access. MrLavarch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: SCALE (Statutes and Cases Automated Legal Enquiry )-Attorney-General' s Department (1)-(3) The Department provides a full-text, electronic, legal information retrieval system as SCALE (Statutes and Cases Automated Legal Enquiry), which contains legislation, case law and other legal information from the Commonwealth, the Territories and some States. The public, through Commonwealth Government bookshops, can browse (at no cost) through the legislative repository and identify particular items for purchase from the Commonwealth Government bookshop, and obtain (at minimal cost) small amounts of printout from the databases. The public are able to dial-up, from their own home or business facilities and search, browse, print and download legislation, although they will be charged for these facilities. There is the potential for the sale at AGPS outlets of published diskettes containing electronic extracts from the legislation database. There is also potential for the marketing of CD-ROMs containing the complete legislation database from AGPS outlets and other retailers. The AGPS may provide a subscription service for CD-ROMs and diskettes similar to that provided for printed legislation. In addition to public access through the AGPS Bookshop network, SCALE is already available free of charge to universities offering law studies. It is planned to extend access to secondary schools (making use of the Telecentre facilities), State and public libraries and other bookshops (such as those operated by the law publishers) to further facilitate access by the public. Federal Register of Legislative Instruments (LIR)Attorney-General's Department (1)-(3) The Department plans to provide a Federal Register of Legislative Instruments (LIR) in 1995. The Register will replace Gazettal as the means of notification of instruments, with all delegated legislative instruments made after the starting date required to be entered on the Register before they can be enforced. Existing delegated legislative instruments will be required to be entered on the Register over a two year period. From a date, two years after the starting date, the Register will be conclusive as to the content of all delegated legislative instruments which are in force. The authoritative fonn of the legislation will be images held in a computer system. It is envisaged that the LIR will be accessible through a SCALE database of searchable text linked to images and supplemented by a structured Index. The images, together with the Index will comprise the Register. The Index will be updated as soon as new instruments are added. The Index will be available daily for purchase in hard copy and for searching electronically. Electronic access to the Register will be available from the Office of Legislative Drafting, AGPS Bookshops, and on-line (including dial-up) through known SCALE. The improved access to SCALE from mid 1995 will include access to the LIR. As the LIRiis accessible through a SCALE database, wherever SCALE is available, so too will the LIR. . National Insolvency Index (NII)-Insolvency and Trustee Service (ITSA), Australia, Attorney General's Department (1)-(3) The Insolvency and Trustee ServiCe, Australia (lTSA), is currently developing the National Insolvency Index (NIl), a replacement system for the Bankruptcy Infonnation Online System (BIOS) which is currently maintained by the Federal Court of Australia. The NIl is an index of individuals who are or have been the subject of a Part X arrangement or a Bankruptcy. The replacement system will be available to members of the public after 1 July 1995. The NIl will be available to be searched by members of the public from terminals to be located at each ITSA office in Sydney, Parramatta, Melbourne, Brisbane, Townsville, Adelaide, Darwin, Perth, Hobart and Canberra. Public access terminals will also continue to be located at the registries of the Federal Court of Australia. In addition, ITSA is considering expanding the range of public access points to the NIl, compared with the limited range currently available from the Federal Court. Expressions of Interest are currently being sought from fifteen major Information Brokers throughout Australia. Advertisements seeking expressions of interest from Infonnation Brokers are also being placed in national newspapers. Responses will be evaluated against a set of selection criteria. Depending on Infonnation Brokers' requirements, ITSA will provide them with external access to a database which contains the information which is available to the public or arrange daily electronic transfer of the data to the broker's system. Infonnation brokers will be responsible for accounting to ITSA for the cost of searches. An additional charge per page will be payable, if the searcher requests a ""hardcopy"" of the information. The use of Municipal Libraries for the NIl has not been considered, as most searches of the NIl would be made either in conjunction with bankruptcy proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia or by persons often having dealings with ITSA. Legal Aid and Family Services, Attorney-General's Department (1)-(3) Through the Attorney-General's Department, the Commonwealth holds copyright in a computer based Register of community legal educational products and programs that have been producedÂ· by community legal centres, legal aid commissions and some other bodies. The Register is aimed at providing information on existing resources to those people and bodies engaged in providing community legal education to the public. . Access to the Register can be gained through the l-gal aid commissions in each State and Territory and through the State libraries in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and NSW. The Register can be accommodated on almost any computer system which has appropriate software database programs. The second version of the Register, currently underway, will be made available to municipal libraries. Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) (1)-(3) The Office of Film and Literature Classiformal fication (OFLC) launched an on-line videotex service for its film and video classification decisions on the Telecom Discovery service in place of Gazetting the information in 1990. The OFLC's database of literature decisions was added to the service in 1992 and its database of computer games classification decisions will be added this year. The Office of Film and Literature Classification Telecom Discovery service is a public SUbscription service which is updated regularly and is flexible enough to cope with 'on-line' enquiries by users on such matters as title, classification, consumer advice, producer, applicant, etc. The OFLC is examining its option of offering its database of decisions on 'floppy disc' as, perhaps, a subscription itemÂ· with quarterly updates. The floppy discs could be supplied to municipal libraries and educational institutions in this way. Australian Securities Commission (ASC) (1)-(3) The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) provides public access points at its twelve Business Centres, located nationally, for information on Australian corporations and individuals required to report under the Corporations Law. The ASC also provides online public access to its database through its Information Brokers who are linked to the ASC's information system. Business and members of the public, both in Australia and overseas, can receive online access to information held by the ASC. Information held by the ASC is contained on a national database known as 'ASCOT'. Information is stored electronically allowing images of documents held with the ASC to be retrieved. When information is requested, ASCOT produces information from the computerised text and identifies which documents are required. Members of the public can either search for information from public terminals located at each Business Centre, or for a fee, they can request more complex information over the counter. The ASC Information Brokers approached every State and municipal library in Australia in 1991 advising them that online public access to the ASC database was available. A poor response was received from the municipal libraries but a number of State libraries have provided ASC information to the public through the online access facility since 1991. The Family Court (1)-(3) The Family Court has considered the possibility of introducing restricted access to its electronic case management information to the legal profession and to parties to proceedings under the Family Law Act, subject to security and privacy considerations. To date, however, there has been no study undertaken as to the need or feasibility of such a service. The Director Library Services, in the Family Court has been working with the NSW State Library on the development of a touch screen information system to include Family Law and the Family Court.

Foreign Investment (Question No. 1525)",112
199,Mr CAMERON,PARTICIPANT,"the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: (1) Is the Foreign Investment Review Board accountable to Parliament; if not, (a) why not and (b) are any steps being taken to make it accountable. (2) Do any statutory mechanisms prevent Australian property and business interests becoming prey to powerful and affluent foreign interests. (3) Do certain nearby countries in Asia refuse permission for Australians to own land or incorporate unless at least 50 per cent equity is held by a citizen of the respective country; if so, what is the Government's position on the matter.",119
200,Mr WILLIS,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The FlRB is an advisory body only. It provides advice to the Government on the consistency of individual foreign investment applications with Government policy. The Board has no authority to approve or to reject foreign investment applications. It is for the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer (sometimes in consultation with other Ministers) to make decisions on cases and policy. The main functions of the FIRB are: to examine proposals by foreign interests for investment in Australia and to make recommendations to the Government on those proposals; to advise the Government on foreign investment matters generally; to foster an awareness and understanding of the Government's policy in the community at large and in the business sector, both in Australia and abroad; and to provide guidance, where necessary, to foreign investors on those aspects of their proposals that may not be in conformity with Government policy and suggest ways by which the proposals might be amended. (2) The Government monitors and regulates foreign investment. The Government's foreign investment policy encompasses both the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and other requirements set down by Ministerial statement. Generally, the Australian Government's policy is to welcome foreign investment. The Government recognises the substantial contribution foreign investment has made and can continue to make to the development of Australia's industries and resources. That said, the policy does not treat foreign investment in all sectors uniformly. There are a number of sectors in which foreign investment generates community concern about the level of foreign ownership and control. The sensitive sectors are media, real estate and civil aviation. Generally, the following restrictions apply: Media: All proposals by foreign interests to invest in the media are subject to prior foreign investment approval. Foreign interests in broadcasting services are restricted to 15 per cent in the case of commercial television broadcasting services and 20 per cent for all subscription television broadcasting services licences. The maximum permitted foreign interest involvement in mass circulation newspapers by a single shareholder is 25 per cent. Real Estate: All proposals by foreign interests to acquire residential real estate, irrespective of size, require prior foreign investment approval (unless exempt under the regulations). Proposals by foreign interest to acquire developed residential real estate are not normally approved except in the case of foreign companies buying for their senior executives resident in Australia, and foreign nationals temporarily resident in Australia for more than 12 months buying for their own use as a principal place of residence (subject to the sale of the property when they cease to reside in Australia). However, acquisitions of vacant land are approved subject to the land being developed within 12 months and up to 50 per cent of a new development may be sold 'off the plan' or under construction to foreign interests. Civil Aviation: Foreign airlines flying to Australia can generally expect approval to acquire up to 25 per cent of the equity in a domestic carrier individually or up to 40 per cent in aggregate. In the case of Australia's international flag carrier, Qantas, total foreign ownership is restricted to a maximum of 35 per cent in . aggregate, with individual holdings limited to 25 per cent. The overriding criterion for assessing individual proposals is a contrary to the national interest test. If a proposal is found to be not contrary to the national interest it is considered to be consistent with the Government's foreign investment policy and therefore approved. In the case of a takeover bid for an Australian owned company, for example, while foreign investment approval may have been given by the Government, the ultimate decision to accept or reject any foreign takeover offer rests with the Australian shareholders. (3) Generally, those countries dependent on foreign capital, have foreign investment restrictions, to differing degrees, on certain types of foreign investment. Within Asia, the degree to which foreign investment is restricted varies greatly from one country to the next. For example, in Hong Kong, there is no limitation on the purchase of land by foreigners and, apart from restrictions on foreign investment in the banking and broadcasting sectors, there is no legislation regulatingforeign investment Indonesia, on the other hand, does not recognise the concept of freehold land rights. Instead various rights are attached to land - and are subject to separate titles. The right of ownership is an inheritable right that can only be held by Indonesian citizens. Indonesia also restricts or totally prohibits foreign investment in many industry sectors. Ultimately each country has the prerogative to determine, according to its circumstances, the degree to which foreign investment should be restricted. Within the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, in recognition of benefits that would flow from the easing of restrictions on direct foreign investments, member countries have reached agreement on a non-binding set of investment principles, the aim of which is to encourage and facilitate investment flows within the region. National Servicemen (Question No. 1535) Mr Forrest asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 21 September 1994: (1) Were national servicemen (a) serving .or (b) present in the Korean war zone during hostilities between 1951 and 1957. (2) How many national servicemen (a) served or (b) were present in the Korean war zone after the conclusion of hostilities. (3) Did national servicemen serve in (a) South East Asia in Malaya, Borneo or the Thai-Malay border between 1955 and 1968 or (b) New Guinea between 1951 and 1975.  member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) With regard to the use of national servicemen during and after the Korean conflict, I draw the honourable member's attention to his similar question upon notice No. 1323 of 30 June 1994 and my response as recorded in Hansard Monday 29 August 1994, page 584. (3) Under the provisions of the National Service Act 1951 national servicemen could not be sent overseas unless they signed an undertaking to do so. In the event that such an undertaking was signed, that conscript's category would be changed to Permanent Military Force. The National Service Act was amended by Statutory Rule 126 of 1964. National servicemen covered by Statutory Rule 126 would have served in Singapore and New Guinea between 1966 and 1972. Statistical data on the numbers of national servicemen who served in Singapore and New Guinea in the period is not available. Veterans: Specialist Payments (Question No. 1542) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1994. (1) What payments are made to individual specialists for written reports in respect of veterans requested by the (a) Repatriation Commission, (b) Veterans' Review Board or (c) Administrative Appeals Tribunal. (2) How does a specialist receive the payments referred to in part (1). (3) Who requests the specialist to make a report. (4) Is a contract for a specific sum agreed to before the specialist undertakes work. (5) Are there guidelines of fee schedules for the service referred to in part (1); if so, what are they. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)(a) If a specialist's report is requested by the Repatriation Commission, all reasonable costs are paid. The Repatriation Commission would negotiate on costs that it considers unreasonable. (b) If the Veterans'Review Board (VRB) considers that a specialist opinion is needed, the matter is referred to the Repatriation Commission to request the necessary report and payment is made on the same basis as in l(a). (c) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is empowered under the Administrative Appeals Act 1975 to seek any reports that it consider necessary. If the AAT requests the Repatriation Commission to obtain specialist reports, the reports are obtained and my Department would make payment on the same basis as in l(a). Where the AAT requires these reports to be obtained, not through the Repatriation Commission, it will arrange for the payment itself. (2) The Repatriation Commission pays specialists for their written reports on receipt of an invoice. The usual thirty days period applies in settling accounts unless specific arrangements are made. (3) Repatriation Commission requests are made by either a Departmental Medical Officer or a Senior Medical Officer. Requests for such reports from either the VRB or the AAT are usually requested by the presiding member. (4) No. (5) Requests by the Repatriation Commission for a specialist opinion on the causal connection between service and conditions suffered by veterans often requires research into complex medical issues. There is no appropriate schedule of fees which could be prescriptive in these matters. While the Medicare schedule of fees is used by the Repatriation Commission as a guide-line, the level of expertise and experience of the specialist concemed, and the time required to compile the report, is also taken into account before payment is approved. British Commonwealth Occupational Force: Pensions (Question No. 1544) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) How many Australian service personnel were involved with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces (BCOP) who served in Japan between September 1945 and December 1949. (2) Is he able to say how many former Australian BCOF personnel are still alive. (3) Do any former Australian BCOF personnel receive pensions from his Department; 'if so, how many receive (a) pensions in total and (b) compensation payments such as totally and permanently incapacitated or disability pensions. (4) Are any of the payments referred to in part (3) attributable solely to service with the BCOP. (5) Do any persons receive war widows' or widowers' pensions asÂ· a result of their spouses having served solely with the BCOP. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) About 25,000. (2) About 11,000 are estimated to be still alive. (3) Most members of the Australian contingent of BCOF are eligible to apply for disability pensions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act (VEA) in respect of any injury or disease attributable to their service. It is not known how many of these are in receipt of a disability pension. This is because former members of the Australian contingent of BCOF cannot be. distinguished from veterans of World War 11. Those BCOF members not entitled to disability pension under the VEA are entitled to compensation cover under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1988. (4) Yes-but numbers are not known. It is not possible to isolate details of disability pensions being paid to former members of the Australian contingent of BCOF who receive their pensions solely because of their BCOF service. (5) Yes-but again numbers are not known. For the reason given in (4) above it is not possible to identify how many war .widows' or widowers' pensions have been granted in respect of veterans whose service was solely with BCOP. Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service: Townsville (Question No. 1548) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to staffing problems at the Vietnam Veterans' Counselling service in Townsville induding (a) no full-time replacement in over a month for a counsellor who resigned, (b) only a part-time private practitioner being employed two days per week and (c) a director who has been on indefinite sick leave for more than four-weeks with a stress-related illness. (2) Has there been a delay in providing replacement staff; if so, (a) why and (b) when will full staffing be restored. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member'sÂ· question is as follows: The Minister is fully aware of the situation in Townsville and has received several briefings from the National Office of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service updating the situation. Staff vacancies in all VVCS offices have been affected by an Industrial dispute. Negotiations are ongoing between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Community and Public Sector Union. . The IRC was made aware of the particular difficulties faced by Townsville at an earlier hearing and the parties to the dispute agreed to employ staff at the Townsville VVCS office on a short-term temporary basis. There have been problems attracting professional staff to short-term employment of this nature, but two psychologists have been appointed to cover the vacancy created by the resignation. One person works three days per week and the other two days per week. A full-time counsellor who has been employed in Townsville for several years is acting in the vacant position of Director of Counselling (DOC). The Department is seeking to resolve the future status of the DOC who is on sick leave as quickly as possible and the restoration of full staffing will depend on this issue. In the meantime, additional staffing has been obtained through sessional contracts. All new referrals are being seen immediately and waiting times for on-going appointments have been cut to only several weeks. Drugs: Prescription Approvals (Question No. 1553) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Are doctors to be required to obtain approval from the Health Insurance Commission before prescribing drugs subject to authority restrictions or costing more than $30; if so, (a) does the $30 refer t- (i) - e costs to the Government or (ii) the dIspenSIng cost and (b) will the requirement lower health care costs; if so, how. (2) Will a 24-hour telephone service for emergency approvals be introduced; if so, will the service lower health care costs; if so, how. (3) Will clear details of the initiatives referred to in the preceding parts be publicised; if so, when.",119
201,Dr LAWRENCE,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) From 1 December 1994 it will be necessary to obtain prior approval from the Health Insurance <;ommission (HIC) before prescribing a Pharmaceu-ICal Be-efits Scheme (PBS) ""Authority required"" Item. This change was announced in the May 1994 Federal Budget and was the principal recommendatior- of a review of the PBS Authority system. This reVIew was undertaken in collaboration with the major professional bodies. The arrangements apply to drugs that are listed wit- - n authority required restriction. The great maJonty of drugs are restricted due to medical reasons and there are some that have a cost-based authority. Except for existing cost based authority drugs, the new arrangements do not apply to drugs that cost in excess of $30. The remaining purely cost baSed authorities will be removed when the prior approval arrangements are working satisfactorily. (a) Cost based authorities apply where the average cost of treatment with the drug is $30 or more and there is a cheaper treatment in the Scheme. (b) Under arrangements introduced in 1988 - rescr!-bers were able to supply authority prescripho-s In urgent cases and notify HIC afterwards. This s-stem was abused in that, in a significant proportIon of cases, the prescriber did not subsequently notify HlC. It is estimated that up to 74% of authority prescriptions went through the urgent rout- and 30% were issued outside the authority reqUirement. Savings will be achieved through medication being supplied in accordance with the authority. These savings (net of additional administrative costs) are estimated to be in excess of $12 million per annum. (2) The Health Insurance Commission has upgraded its telephone fadlities and introduced a newÂ· national free-call service for fast approval of the authority required items. The new free-call number is 1800 888 333 and is operational seven . days. a week, 24 hours a day. In addition to this, the Commission's existing free-mail service for the appr-JVal of authority required prescriptions will contInue to operate. To enable it to implement the new arrangements, the HIC has been provided with additional resources to upgrade and improve its telephone services. The cost of these additional resources have been taken into account in detennining the net savings referred to in l(b) above. (3) Advice of the change in arrangements commenced to pharmacists and prescribers in September 1994 with an article appearing in trade magazines and journals. Individual letters have bee- - ent to all high prescribers of Authority drugs advlSlng of the change and the HlC facilities available to gain approval. A letter to all prescribers is being mailed in November advising of the changes. This letter also encloses a brochure outlining the steps required to seek approval. The December PBS Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits together with MIMS (a widely used reference listing PBS and non-PBS drugs) will contain specific advertising of the Authority changes. A high profile education campaign will also be conducted in the next month. Department of Transport: Stress Counselling (Question No. 1597)",122
202,Mr CONNOLLY,PARTICIPANT,"the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: Did the Department or any agency for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility spend any sum on stress counselling services for Commonwealth employees or their families in 1993-94.",122
203,Mr BRERETON,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Transport during 1993-94 contracted the Employee Assistance Service ACT Ltd. to provide to employees and their families assessments, counselling and referral services in a number of areas. While it is likely that some employees sought stress counselling through this service, it is not possible to determine an exact amount spent in this area. It should be noted that this service was shared with the Communications elements, now part of the Department of Communications and the Arts, for this period. A further $2355 was spent on stress counselling services provided by other organisations during 1993-94. A portion of the Workers' Compensation premium cost of $294,781 for 1993-94 would have been spent on stress counselling for employees and/or their families but the Department does not have access to the data required to quantify this amount.

(a) $42,243 (b) See above (c) See above Wildflower Seeds: Importation (Question No. 1631) Mr Forrest asked the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, upon notice, on 11 October 1994: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the distribution in Australia of small sachets of wildflower seeds contained in the June 1994 issue of the US magazine Vanity Fair. (2) Are the seeds distributed in the magazine a prohibited import; if so what action has been taken to (a) ensure that all the seeds are withdrawn and destroyed, (b) inform the publishers of their sibility to comply with import quarantine requirements, and (c) prevent a recurrence. Mr Lee-The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Jime Edition of Vanity Fair was imported into Australia and cleared from Customs control based on information supplied by the importer. As a result of this information there was not a physical check of the consignment and Customs was not aware that seeds were contained in the magazines. (2) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) was made aware of the importation of these seeds, which had been imported without the relevant import permissions; and were therefore in breach of Australian Quarantine regulations, and has: (a) Contacted the distributors of Vanity Fair in Australia to request their cooperation in retrieving all sachets of seeds from all unsold magazines in Australia. The distributors cooperated with AQIS and returned the seeds which were subsequently destroyed by AQIS. (b) Contacted the publishers of Vanity Fair in London to draw their attention to the breach of Australian quarantine regulations and advise that any future promotions of this type should be cleared with AQIS in the first instance. (c) A Quarantine Circular Memorandum was issued alerting quarantine inspectors to the illegal entry of seed in the Vanity Fair Promotion. All known imported consignments containing plant and/or plant matter are referred to AQIS for clearance prior to being released from Customs control. East Timor (Question No. 1648) Mr Charles asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: (1) Does the Australian embassy in Jakarta partly fund St Paul's Hospital in Suai, East Timor. (2) Is the Minister able to say whether a group of Australian medical professionals who are prepared to volunteer their services to staff the hospital are allowed to do so; if they are not, why not. (3) Is the MinisterÂ· abie to say whether an Australian aid group is able to send medical responsupplies into East Timor for use by the East Timorese. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether nongovemment organisations such as UNICEF and the Red Cross are allowed unrestricted access to the East Timorese in East Timor to provide assistance where it is most needed; if they are not, why not. (5) Is Australia able to place human rights observers in East Timor with unrestricted access to the local population. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) has provided support for St Paul's hospital at Suai. Two grants were made in 1993: A$32,380 was provided for the procurement of equipment for the operating theatre and A$46,330 for the purchase and installation of a windmill to improve the hospital's water supply. These grants were made under the Small Activity Scheme, administered by AIDAB officers at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. (2) The government is aware of general proposals for foreign volunteer medical professionals to staff St Paul's hospital. However, the government has not been approached to facilitate any specific proposal in this regard. Ultimately it is the prerogative of the Indonesian Government to decide whether to permit foreign nationals to work in Indonesia. (3) Australian aid groups can send medical supplies to East Timor through the Association of Voluntary Health Services of Indonesia (pERDHAKI). One of PERDHAKI's roles is to supply medicine to Catholic hospitals and clinics throughout the country. PERDHAKI may be contacted at: J alan Kramat VII7 Jakarta 10430 Fax: (021) 326 044 Contact person: Dr Felix Gunawan (Director) (4) I understand that the International Committee of the Red Cross (lCRC) currently enjoys very good access to East Timor, although there have been difficulties in the past. The ICRC has an office in the province. UNICEF also has good access and conducts its programs in most districts within East Timor. (5) The Australian government does not place human rights observers in any country or region anywhere in the world including in East Timor. The Australian government does, however, recognise the need to monitor human rights situations on a global basis. Against this background, the Australian government actively encourages visits to East Timor by UN personnel specifically appointed to examine issues with human rights implications. The UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Mr Ndiaye, last visited Indonesia including East Timor in July 1994. Mr Ndiaye will report on his findings to the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (CRR51) in January/February 1995. The government also monitors the human rights situation in East Timor through visits to the province by Australian Embassy personnel based in Jakarta The last embassy visit to East Timor took place in August 1994. Australian Embassy personnel enjoy good access. Women's Refuges (Question No. 1664) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 18 October 1994: (1) IsÂ· he able to say how many places are available in women's refuges in .each capital city in Australia. (2) What level of funding does the Commonwealth provide to women's refuges in total in each capital city. (3) What measures are available of the demand for places in women's refuges. (4) According to available data, to what extent is the demand for places being met. (5) Are any indicators available of trends in the adequacy of the provision of women's refuges.",124
208,Mr HOWE,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The availability of places in women's refuges funded under the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) in capital cities is as follows: State Number of places New South Wales 615 Victoria# 312 Queensland 73* Western Australia 262 South Australia 326 Tasmania 43 Northern Territory 60 ACT 163 (2) The funding for women's refuges in capital cities provided under the SAAP is as follows: Funding Funding 1993-94 $ New South Wales 7960000 Victoria# 5983709 Queensland 2647552 Western Australia 3000000 South Australia 2036275 Tasmania 780767 Northern Territory 974700 ACT 1 359 198 (3) Currently data is not available on the level of demand at the local level. (4) Current data collections are unable to measure demand accurately because of an inability to eliminate double counting of clients where, for example, one service cannot meet an individual's needs and that person is subsequently accommodated by another service. (5) Although there are no reliable indicators of the adequacy of the provision of women's refuges, the Commonwealth is currently piloting a new client data collection through the Australian Bureau of Statistics and this should lead to greater accuracy in establishing demand. #The figure shown for Victoria represent the State total. Data is not available on a capital city basis for Victoria due to security arrangements, under which funded services are not identified locally. *This figure indicates capacity in terms of family units Training Wage (Question No. 1666) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 18 October 1994: (1) What federal and State awards have been established to implement the training wage. (2) On what date was each of the awards referred to in part (1) made. (3) Which StatesÂ·do not have awards implementing the training wage for employees under State awards. (4) Are formal steps being taken in each of the States referred to in part (3) to establish training wage awards; if so, in each case, when will the awards be in place. (5) Is the training wage available (a) to employers who do not employ staff under State or federal awards and (b) where employees are employed under enterprise bargaining and not under awards. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Federal: The National Training Wage Interim Award 1994. NSW: The Retail Industry (State) Training Wage Award. The Clerical Industry (State) Training Wage Award. NSW Crown Employees (Training Wage) Award. QLD: The Training Wage Interim Award (State). Retail Industry Interim Award. (2) The Federal National Training Wage Interim Award 1994 was made on 5 September, 1994. The NSW Clerical Industry (State) Training Wage Award was made on 6 October, 1994. The NSW Crown Employees (Training Wage) Award was made on 16 November. The Queensland Training Wage Interim Award (State) and the Queensland Retail Industry Interim Awards. were made on 13 October, 1994. (3) South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania Victoria does not have State awards. (4) Yes. The introduction of provisions similar to those in the National Training Wage Interim Award 1994 into State and Territory jurisdictions is based on agreements and consultation processes between State and Territory Governments and local industrial parties. Significant progress on implementation is being made in all jurisdictions. Mirror awards or arrangements are expected to be introduced in all States and Territories by December J994. The Victorian Government introduced the Vocational Education and Training (State Training Wage) Bill 1994 on 10 November to provide arrangements for National Training Wage Award conditions in the State jurisdiction. The Bill the provisions of the National Training Wage Award. It is anticipated that the Bill will be passed by the end of the Spring Parliamentary sittings. The Western Australian Government supports the introduction of the National Training Wage. The Automotive, Food, Metals and Engineering Union (AFMEU) has made an application for the metals industry. The Australian Services Union (ASU) and the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDAEA) have agreed to lodge applications for common rule awards in the clerical and retail industries respectively. In South Australia the introduction of the National Training Wage Award is supported by the industrial parties. A uniform position on its implementation is expected to be reached soon with applications being lodged with the State Industrial Commission early in December. In Tasmania the Government introduced legislation on 8 November to amend the Tasmanian Industrial Relations Act 1991 to facilitate the introduction of National Training Wage arrangements into the State award system. It is anticipated that the amendments will be passed before the end of the current sittings. In the Northern Territory a common rule application was made on 12 October 1994. The ACT Government is working with employers and unions on a common rule application. In addition, the National Training Wage Award is being implemented in NSW through the NSW Clerical Industry (State), the NSW Retail Industry (State) Training Wage and the NSW Crown Employees (Training Wage) Awards. The NSW Trades and Labor Council is working co-operatively with the NSW Government and employer organisations. It is expected there will be wide coverage in the State by the end of the year. (5)(a) Yes. (b) Yes, provided there is agreement between the industrial parties. Ballast Water (Question No. 1671)  Transport, upon notice, on 19 October 1994: (1) Will he bring up to date the information provided in the answer to Question No 3537 (Hansard, 29 and 30 May 1979, page 2620) relating to the discharge of ballast water. (2) What action is the Government taking to ensure ballast water discharges from vessels arriving in Australian ports do not damage Australia's marine environment.",126
209,Mr BRERETON,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourreflects able member's question is as follows: (1) While the majority of issues concerning ballast water have to date been carried by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), I have been provided with the following information. The results of the report to the Fishing Industry Research Committee 'were 'inconclusive and no measures to control ballast Â·wa.ter discharge were introduced at that time. However, between October 1979 and March 1983, the. ballast water issue was a regular agenda. item considered by the former Marine and Ports Council of Australia (MPCA) (the functions of this Committee were absorbed by the Australian Transport Advisory - ouncil in 1984.) The NSW State Fisheries Service continued its ballast water investigations and in 1982 submitted a report to MPCA. This report also indicated that there was no definite evidence that any imported parasitic marine organisms had any effect on indigenous marine organisms. It was forwarded to the Departments of Health and Business and Consumer Affairs to acknowledge the matter as a quarantine issue. MPCA subsequently asked the Australian Fisheries Council in March 1983 to advise 'it of any future action that may be taken on the management of ballast water discharge as the likely costs involved with any treatment measures would be of concern to the shipping industry and therefore the MPCA. There was no further involvement by the Department of Transport in this issue until the late 1980s when seriousÂ· problems emerged concerning the introduction of foreign organisms in some areas of Tasmania. The issue was also raised at the 26th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organisation (lMO), in September 1988. (2) Since 1989 the Federal government, through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has been particularly active in this matter carrying out a wide range of research on the issue, implementing Guidelines for international shipping for ballast wate- management, having these adopted by the International Maritime Organisation for international applications and devising a comprehensive ballast water monitoring and testing program. To bring together the many Commonwealth, State and industry sectors concerned with this issue AQIS organised a National Symposium in May 1994. As a direct result of this, there was unanimous agreement,that Australia required a national strategy. In conjunction with industry and other groups, AQIS has completed a draft Australian Ballast Water Management Strategy which it is expected will shortly be released for widespread consideration. The Strategy seeks to, inter alia, put in place a set of arrangements which will as far as practicable minimise the transfer of unwanted aquatic organisms to Australia from overseas ports, from Australian ports to overseas ports and the translocation between Australian ports with the minimum disruption and cost to international and domestic shipping and other industries such as seafood production. Toll Roads (Question No. 1672)  Transport, upon notice, on 19 October 1994: What information is he able to provide on (a) the individual costs of operation of each toll road in Australia and the proportion each item of cost forms of revenue from each toll road, (b) the energy implications of halting traffic to collect a payment from each vehicle and (c) the delay costs on each toll road of halting fast travelling traffic to collect a payment from each vehicle.",127
210,Mr BRERETON,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As the Commonwealth is not a party to any toll road concession agreement, the Commonwealth does not receive any information about the operations of these roads that is not publicly available. Toll Roads (Question No. 1673)  Transport, upon notice, on 19 October 1994: In view of the rate at which toll roads have been constructed in Australia, what information is he able to provide on potential locations for further toll roads.",128
211,Mr BRERETON,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Except on roads which are declared to be part of the National Highway System (NHS), decisions on the location of toll roads are made by State and Territory Governments. Tolling of NHS roads would only be considered where: there is a high warrant to upgrade the road as early as possible; tolling would significantly accelerate the provision of major benefits to road users compared with full public funding given Budget constraints; and there is a reasonable, safe alternative road for motorists not wishing to pay the toll. Toll Roads (Question No. 1674)  Transport, upon notice, on 19 October 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the article 'Road to riches' in the Australian Business Monthly of July 1994 in which it is claimed that toll roads are a licence to print money. (2) What information is he able to provide on the year by year financial performance of existing toll roads in Australia and the corresponding individual rates of return in each case.",128
212,Mr BRERETON,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth is not a party to any toll road concession agreement and does not receive any information about the financial performance of these roads that is not publicly available. Partner Allowance Program (Question No. 1678) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 20 October 1994: (1) What is the target group for publicity of the Partner Allowance Program. (2) Was summary information of the program translated into six languages; if so, (a) which languages, (b) what research data was used to determine which languages were used and (c) what proportion of the target group for publicity is covered by each of the six languages. (3) What proportion of the target group for publicity are (a) Italian, (b) Greek, (c) Maltese or (d) Turkish speakers. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The target group for Partner Allowance publicity is clients and their spouses receiving married rate Job Search, Newstart or Sickness Allowance and Special Benefit. (2) Yes. (a) Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Macedonian, Serbian and Vietnamese. (b) Data extracted from the Department's client data base indicating those ethnic groups with the highest population affected by Partner Allowance.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission: Home Loans (Question No. 1743) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 16 November 1994: (1) Are applicants for home loans through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) required to furnish proof of their Aboriginality by supplying signatures accompanied by the common seal of an incorporated Aboriginal organisation or body; if so, does this represent discrimination against Aboriginal persons who prefer not to be aligned with incorporated bodies. (2) What specific test of Aboriginality is used within his area of responsibility in the normal course of administration and how does it vary from that applied to applicants for home loans and other ATSIC services. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The current method of authenticating Aboriginality is effective and believed to be nondiscriminatory as it does not require clients to align themselves with incorporated bodies, only to obtain from them confirmation of their Aboriginality. In most circumstances there may be a number of organisations for individuals to chose to contact to obtain confirmation of Aboriginality. Where difficulties arise cases can be referred through ATSIC's Regional Offices to the appropriate elected ATSIC Regional Council for advice. (2) In completing the Housing Loan's Confirmation of Aboriginality or Torres Strait Islander descent form, the organisation is officially confirming that the housing loan applicant is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives. This is the standard definition of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent used for all Commission programs. Department of Social Security: Corporate (Question No. 1752)",130

(c) The standard Department of Social Security (DSS) corporate wardrobe comprises: Men: Blazer, trousers, shorts, shirts, knitwear, ties, socks, belt, hat. Women: Jackets, skirts, slacks, blouses, dresses, knitwear, belt, scarves, hat, hair accessories.

Since the introduction of the corporate wardrobe in 1991, approximately 13,500 orders have been placed by an estimated 3,500-4,000 staff. (e) The Department does not subsidise the purchase by staff of the wardrobe although it has contributed towards promotion and freight costs for each of the six seasonal releases of the wardrobe. Total costs for the six releases of the wardrobe since 1991 are $130,367 for promotional costs associated with the production of catalogues and $175,909 for freight costs.

(g) A catalogue was produced for each of the six seasonal releases of the wardrobe since 1991. The average production cost for each edition of the catalogue was around $22,000.

216,Mr BRERETON,PARTICIPANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Best Practice Demonstration Program in the Private Sector Division of the Department of Industrial Relations spent $10 800 on promotional biros and name tags displaying a logo. (a) The promotional biros and name tags were produced for the use of participants at conferences, workshops and seminars throughout the year. They were also given to participants at demonstration activities organised by best practice companies. As it is a demonstration program it is essential that the logo of the Best Practice Program becomes widely known and associated with high quality events. The common practice of issuing promotional name tags and biros provides a good opportunity to achieve this aim. The fees paid by participants at these conferences, seminars and workshops contribute to the department's cost recovery target. (b) The Australian Best Practice Demonstration Program logo was used.",131
