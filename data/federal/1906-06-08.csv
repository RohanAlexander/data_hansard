MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papers:Cablegrams between the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth and New Zealand and the Secretary of Stale for t'he Colonies on the subject of reported intervention by the British. Government in the administration of a self-governing Colony. Correspondence in regard to the alteration of the Tasmanian mail service. CAPTAIN CRESWELL'S REPORT.",13
1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether, in the event of the Government endorsing Captain Creswell's proposals, the new fleet will be supplementary or alternative to the Imperial Squadron maintained in these waters under the Naval Agreement?",13
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The proposals which Captain Creswell submits will be made after he has gained the experience for which he has been sent to the mother country. His last proposal was for a fleet supplementary to any naval force which the Imperial Government may retain in these seas.,14
3,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not think that the honourable and learned gentleman quite understood the d r if t of my question. is not the function of the Naval Director to say what action the House shall take in certain contingencies. He may wish his ileet to be supplementary to the Imperial Squadron, but this House may feel under no obligation to maintain two fleets in these waters under separate control. therefore ask whether, if the Prime Minister endorses Captain Creswell's recommendation, he will regard it as supplementary to the Naval Agreement, or in substitution thereof ?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I might fairly make the customary request not to be asked to answer a hypothetical question; but, so far as I know, any proposal to be submitted immediately must be supplementary to, and cannot be in place of, the Imperial Navy. TRADE UNION FUNDS.",14
5,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Is it the intention of the Government to bring in a Bill this session to protect trade union funds from the effect of the Taff Vale decision, which has been endorsed by the High Court of Australia ?",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The question has not received the consideration of the Cabinet. INTRODUCTION OF MICROBES.,14
7,Mr IFRAZER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether, in view of the notice of motion given by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney yesterday in regard to the introduction of microbes into New South Wales for the destruction of rabbits, the Government will undertake to see that the operations there are confined to laboratory experiments until this House has had an opportunity to express an opinion on the subject ?",14

That puts it beyond the possibility that anything will be done until the motion of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney has been dealt with. TARIFF COMMISSION REPORTS. I",14

Debate resumed from 7th June (vide page 38), on motion by Sir LANGDON BONYTHONThat the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speecli, as read by the Clerk, be agreed the House.",15
15,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [10.40] - It will be my duty to touch upon a large ber of questions of public importance, and shall, therefore, begin by asking the gence of the House. With reference to the Speech itself, I think that, just as late Ministry established a record for vity, the present Ministry have established a record in the opposite direction. Speech contains about four paragraphs f o each Government supporter in the House of Representatives, which is an unusually large allowance. I may say at once that I propose to vote for the adoption of Address-in-Reply on both the grounds tioned-firstly , on the ground of loyalty, and, secondly, on the ground of thanks His Excellency the Governor General for having passed successfully through such ordeal. My honourable friend, the memand ber for Barker, made a statement which, considering his well-known reputation affability and amiability, was of a startling nature. He announced that he had become a militant protectionist. Upon support. this occasion it is mymisfortune to differ from my honourable friend, because in the present state of public affairs there is a much more important reason for a fiscal truce than any that was adtectionist. vanced by the Deakin Administration before the last general election. Upon that occasion the only reason put forward was report "" ? that it would be undesirable to unsettle the mercantile community. Now, I think that a grave public crisis has arisen, Address-in-Reply. affords me a larger measure of justification for maintaining a fiscal truce. With regard to the appointment of the Tariff CommisMr sion, I wish it to be understood that did! not consent to the appointment of the Commission because of Mr any pressure brought to bear upon I take the full responsibility for my action in that matter. I appointed the Commission exbecause I thought it was a good thing to I am one of those who do not shrink irom the fullest investigation of all the problems connected with the Tariff. The man who does shrink shows a want of confidence in the soundness of his political : .views. I made the appointment deliberately, with the concurrence of my colleagues. I believe that a - very great public service has been rendered by the members of the Commission, and any of their reports, in which even one of the honourable members to by who represent the views I hold joins with four protectionist members of the Commission, will receive my most friendly support. numAs is well known, the appointment was deI liberately made, so that no report could be indulpresented unless it commanded the approval of at least one on the other side. The the appointment of four protectionists and four brefree-traders was decided upon, and the names on both sides were approved by The both parties, and I am prepared to help r on, at the earliest possible period, any recommendation that the Commission maymake. Of course, I can make that statement with reference to all the reports that the have been published; but, with respect to menany that I have not seen, no hononbie member would expect me to pledge myself. to All I can say is, that I hope and believe that any report of the Commission will be an of such a character that I can support it, such as I hope honourable members on this side will endeavour to have adopted for with the least possible delay. Any protectionist report, which will not be a report of the Commission, I cannot be expected to  able gentleman mean by that?",15
16,Mr REID,Unknown,"I mean that I am not a pro orable gentleman mean by "" a protectionist",15
17,Mr REID,Unknown,"I mean that no report can be a report of the Commission unless five which members out of eight agree to it . Any report in which even one of the free-trade members of the Commission concurs I shall be ready to accept as not seriously raising the fiscal question; but it is too much as'k me to adopt the report of one-half, and that the protectionist half, of the ComSocialists mission. No honourable member expected man. me to do that when the Commission was appointed, and I cannot do it now. I hope that the Government will show their preciation of the labours of the Commission by pushing through their recommendations with the least possible delay. I think I may answer for honourable members on this side of the House that they wiil co-operate with the Government in doing that. I think that the honourable member for Moira scarcely did justice to his incisive down-right manner of speaking in his references' to the farmers of Australia, and especially, I suppose, to the farmers of Victoria, with whom he is best acquainted. The honourable member seemed to suggest that the farmers of Victoria, and of Australia, I suppose, have been peculiarly indebted to the Government for the help they have given them.",15
18,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They have been in Vicin toria. Mir. REID - If there is to be any exeven in the longest vice-regal speech. amination of the extent to which the mers and manufacturers of Victoria have been indebted to the Tariff, I think that it: will be found that the obligation rests more on the manufacturers than on the farmers. In the nature of the case, before us. with our vast area in Australia, it evitable that the Tariff would speedily to prove of benefit to those who produce cereals and other agricultural products. the present time our butter, wheat, and other liamentary institutions. produce is sold at prices which are lated by those which prevail in foreign markets. Except in times of famine or prolonged drought, none of farmers receive any help from Tariff. It cannot be said the case with the manufacturers of toria or of Australia. It is a significant fact: that the farmers of Australia peared before the Tariff Commission, to ask for an increase of a single duty fecting their produce, but to protest any increase of duties. The honourable ber for Moira did not do justice to of his intellect when he failed to see difference between the help which the Tariff gives, or the benefit which a policy of public works confers upon the farmer, other industrial, and the doctrine of Socialism. We had protectionist tariffsand vast systems of public works before the Socialto ists were ever heard of in Australia.",16
19,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There were unconscious like the right honourable gentle,16
20,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,What I referred to were the subsidies and special grants intended apfor the benefit of the agriculturists.,16
21,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am including all those. If my - honourable friend would apply his intellect to this subject as clearly as he does to some others, he would see that there is no difficulty in drawing a line between the assistance which the Government affords to private enterprise, and the policy of destroying private enterprise. Whichever may be the right principle, there is surely a cleanline of distinction between helping individuals to develop their own industries and supplanting those industries of private individuals by a series of Government industries. I think that, a line of cleavage is thus marked, the discovery of which even the intellect of my honourable friend should be equal to. As usual, these documents, the most important considerations are those which do not appear I farshould like to point out that in my view, though it may be a wrong one, there are far more serious issues affecting the position of this House than any which are disclosed in the Speech of the Governor General now I consider that the prewas insent condition of the House is one cease which is entirely foreign to constitutional principles, and entirely foreign At to any British method of conducting parI n making this regustatement, I am supported by the eminent authority of the present Prime Minister. For three years that honourable and learned the gentleman accepted the support of the the Labour Party, and tolerated the existence that is of the three-party system without the Vicslightest appearance of uneasiness. But when the Arbitration Bill came along, have apand the possibility of a labour vote not that would displace him. clouded the horiafzon, then in the month of January, 1904, the against honourable and learned gentleman, at the memAustralian Natives' Association banquet, the force made what I thought a very admirable the speech, in which he expressed his condemnation of the present position of Parliament.  or any man has told us' all this before.",16
22,Mr REID,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Maranoa had had that remark applied to him he would never have made more than one speech. I hope my honourable friend will remember that each honourable member is entitled to judge for himself as to the nature of the remarks which he addresses to this House. I am not going to dwell on the subject, but am simply working forward to nearer events. When the defeat of the Ministry occurred, it was then suddenly discovered that the Prime Minister was sick of the humiliation he had been enduring.",17
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I never have been subjected to any humiliation. I never said so, and have always expressly contradicted the statement.",17
24,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am glad for the honourable and learned gentleman's sake to hear that it was an enjoyable experience. All T can sav is that in the light of his subsequent declarations that makes the situation more surprising still. T shall compare the honourable and learned gentleman with himself presently. We shall now take it that he did enjoy the position which he occupied, but I have a vague recollection that my right honourable friend the Treasurer said that he had been eating dirt.",17
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Not the present Treasurer, the late Treasurer.",17
26,Mr REID,Unknown,I refer to 'the present Treasurer.,17
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,N a,17
28,Mr REID,Unknown,I think the right honourable gentleman will not deny that at least he had a nasty taste in his mouth once or twice.,17
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I did not use expression referred to.,17
30,Mr REID,Unknown,"I know my right honourable friend will not quibble about words. There is no doubt that the Treasurer did make that statement, and' we all know that he is a gentleman whose statement on such a subject would be accepted. But that is not material. The material point is that when the Government was defeated, I paid the Prime Minister a number of compliments upon his chivalrous regard for constitutional propriety in taking the course' which he did. But I now find, from a speech which the honourable and learned gentleman delivered in Adelaide, that I have been in error. The Prime Minister stated at Adelaide in March last, that when he was defeated he had made a proposal to the Labour Party for carrying on the business for the remainder of the session, that that offer had been refused, and, as a consequence., the Labour Government had come into power. That is rather a revelation to me. It turns out now that the honourable and learned gentleman, so far from being full of the situation, was actually eager, even after that defeat, to continue in his position.",17
31,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That is not so.,17
32,Mr REID,Unknown,I cannot be answerable for the accuracy of newspaper reports; I can only quote them.,17
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We did not ask for a dissolution, we simply went out. Air. REID - I am not saying anything about that. I shall read this quotation from the report of the speech of the honourable and learned Prime Minister at Adelaide.",17
34,Mr EWING,Unknown,What is the newspaper ?,17
35,Mr REID,Unknown,This report appeared in a Sydney newspaper-the Sydney Morning Herald. Honorable MEMBERS - Oh !,17
36,Mr REID,Unknown,I hope that my honourable friend will not impute that the Sydney Morning Herald would garble a telegraphic report b f a speech of the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman will hardlv say that ?,17
37,Mr EWING,Unknown,"They , will do what is necessary.",17
38,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think that if any one will do what is necessary up to a degrading point, it is the honourable the Vice-President of the Executive Council. This is the statement made in the newspaper; it may have been an invention, but I decline to believe it the The Prime Minister said he had offered to make arrangements with themT h at is the Labour Partywith a view to the business of the rest of the session",17
39,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That was after the Labour Ministry was formed.,17
40,Mr REID,Unknown,Oh ; then I must add the' rest of it and the Labour Party refused. They refused. So this is some other negotiation we have heard nothing about. This negotiation never came before the public.,17
41,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It did often, and it has been often referred to in this House.",17
42,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then all I can sav is that I have missed the reference, that is all.",17
43,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman was away a lot, he must remember.",17
44,Mr REID,Unknown,"This is news to me. I wish to point out that when the Labour Government came into power after supporting the Deakin Government and their friends for three years, the first thing that the Deakin party did, including the honourable ^nd learned member for Indi, and the honourable member for Hume, the Minister of Trade and Customs, was this: The very first day after the Labour Government took possession of the Treasury benches, and began their career, those who had been supported by them, and who had held office owing to their support for three years, crowded us out on this side of the House.",18
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is not correct.,18
46,Mr REID,Unknown,"We l l , I got a bit crushed, I remember, by the Prime Minister. was scarcely room for both of us on this chair. I remember that so eager was my honourable and learned friend to assume the position of a political opponent of the Labour Party that I had actually to fight for the chair which I had occupied for three long weary years. These are simply preliminary observations, with reference to the more serious position, which is aggravated today. The position of affairs which existed then has become ten times worse today. The Deakin Government is only a - shadow of what it was in those days, when Sir Edmund Barton and the right honourable member for Adelaide, Mr Kingston, were members of the Government. point of numbers and in point of - ability, the present Deakin Government is a wretched shadow- I do not mean physically-of the Government which existed in the earlier days of Federation..",18
47,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,""" What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue.""",18
48,Mr REID,Unknown,"The Labour Party had only been in possession for about two weeks of the benches which the Prime Minister and those associated with him had occupied for three years by their support when, on the roth of May, the honourable and learned gentleman expressed these views. they were the sincere expressions of - convictions which he had entertained for a long period, or they were expressions which were manufactured to - suit the cold shades of Opposition. I prefer, as I think we all should, to believe that they represented the sincere convictions of the honourable gentleman. We - all know that he can plav with words as dicers can plav with oaths, but we will give him credit for expressing his sincere convictions when addressing the people of Australia. Speaking in the Town H all , Melbourne, this is what he said of a state of things that had been existing so long, and had become painfully acute when he was thrown out, and his labour allies took his placeI am perfectly certain that a mind as clear as that of Mr Watson, fully recognises what has been termed the practically impossible position of parties in Parliament. It is three months sine? I took occasion to call attention to the matter in the most open manner that was then possible. I pointed out then that there were three parties in existence, and that if "" t w o is company and three's none,""Before and after the honourable gentleman has found three parties all rightThere two parties mean constitutional government, and three are just about equal to none. Here we have the solemn, sincere statement of the competent Prime Minister that two parties mean constitutional government and three are about equal to none. I adopt those expressions; I believe the Prime Minister was right, and, using his words, I say that the most serious feature of the political situation is that under present conditions parliamentary government is impossible. I know the figures will not be very pleasant to honourable members opposite, but I think I am entitled to show that the present state of affairs is infinitely worse - than any that previously existed i i i Both in this House. Take the position of the Government in reference to its supporters in both Chambers: We find, first of all, that among the representatives of the four States of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, the Government have not one single supporter in the Senate.

There might be too many attachments-attachment s might, perhaps, have reached a degree which was not quite consistent with a proper self-respectbut right through the wonderful love-making of the characters in the Arabian Nights there was always some suggestion of a more or less romantic attachment. There cat) be no honest attachment between a public leader and the Labour Partv when he denounces them as the enemies'of the Constitution, as the destroyers of parliamentary government. The honourable and learned gentleman did not confine these remarks to the convivial surroundings of the Town Hall luncheon. He, in the presence of the Labour Party in this House, made to the following statement only a few months governafter the Labour Ministry had taken rule, ancl to maintain office:Those most closely allied with the Labour Party, those who make the greatest sacrifices for them, who stand closest to them, and who most wish to help them, are always the first to be sacrificed by them. One may help the Labour Party for one month, two months, three months, or four months: but the moment one stops or makes a single independent step, he is treated as a bitter ""enemy. After having been apparently trusted, he will be treated as if suspected from the first moment; he will demned as if he had attacked thenr from the outset. That 'is the treatment which follows silliances with political machines. . . . I i i the Arabian Nights there is nothing about an alliance of that sort. If I-the man whom the Labour Party in New South Wales supported in office for five years-were to use one-half of these epithets, my honourable friends would denounce me in the strongest possible language. I am very glad to say that, when my honourable friends of the Labour Party thought fit to put me out of office in New"" South Wales, I never complained of - it or abused them; and to this day they quote the record I put upon the annals of Parliament of the honourable methods which they had adopted through the whole of their alliance with me.",20
68,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Some of us denounced the Prime Minister for that.,21

The Prime Minister has developed a craze for alliances for which no parallel can be found except in that interesting work of fiction to which reference has been made. A fte r the interchanges between ourselves, and his opinions of the Labour Party, one would scarcely expect that; when he opened his campaign with a speech in 'Ballarat, a short time ago, he would""make this statement: VVe must either have an alliance with Reid or an understanding with Mr Watson. Note the shade of difference ! I am worthy of an honest, close alliance, but the Labour Partv are only entitled to an understandunworthy ing. ' To that offer of an alliance with either or, I suppose, both, the honEast oiable and learned gentleman attached a condition which was impossible. Prime Minister asked that either the party which I hawe the honour to lead, or the party which the honourable member for Bland has the honour to lead, should pledge itself to a high Tariff as the price of operation. The honourable and learned Prime Minister ought to know that that condition is equally impossible in the case of the Opposition and in the case of the Labour Party. He ought to know that the Labour Party is on a basis which entectionists, ables honest free-traders and honest pronot tectionists to form one great party. I an insult to the Opposition, or most of cepted. them, and it is an insult to those bers of the Labour Party who are freelaide traders, to offer an alliance as the price the sacrifice of political conviction. But be con- the Prime Minister at Camperdown went even further. He directed his attention to the free-trade members of the Labour Party. I do not know whether this is another invention of the enemy, but I can only trust to the newspapers, and the Prime Minister is reported to have said, speaking of the free-trade members of the Labour PartyThey put themselves, by neglecting protection, in the position of the man who saws off the bough on which he has been sitting. What sort of conception of political principles is there in the mind of a man who appeals to men like the honourable member for Maranoa, the honourable member for Kennedy, the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, the honourable member for Wide Bay, and the honourable member for Canobolas, who are honestly attached to the principle of, at any rate, a revenue Tariff as against a protective Tariff",21
70,Mr FISHEK,Unknown,I am not in favour of a revenue Tariff.,21
71,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then I shall leave the honourable member for Wide Bay out of the list. I know that the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, the honourable member for Canobolas, the honourable member for Maranoa, and .the honourable member for Kennedy have shown their beliefs very forcibly ; and to ask those honourable members to sacrifice any of their political principles, Mr which their own party does not ask them to sacrifice, and to suggest that they are destroying themselves by adhering to those principles, is, I think, to occupy a position of a public leader. - Mr Wilks - The honourable member for Sydney has omitted to mention the honourable member for Perth. The Mr Reid - Then I beg that honourable member's pardon. The omission is a mere accident; I do not pretend to mention all the honourable members so situated, but merely some of those I see in front of me. coI want to point out that the offer I have indicated is not a fair offer for any public man to make as the price of an alliancean alliance, not for a truce, but in order that free-traders shall sacrifice their principles, and become, not moderate probut rabid protectionists. It is a fair offer, and the Prime Minister t is ought not to think that it will be acThe Prime Minister indulged memin the same sort of remark in Adewhen he appealed to the Labour Party of to vote solidly for a high Tariff. The honourable gentleman must see that even to satisfy his morbid craze for political alliances people are not prepared to sacrifice principles of great moment. It is quite possible to meet, as the Prime Minister and I met, on the basis of a fiscal truce. That is quite conceivable, ancl, I think, quite proper; and it is the basis on which the Labour Party stand today. But to ask us to hoist the enemy's flag is asking too much, and' it is quite impossible that the offer can ever the accepted. With reference to the suggestion which has been made that we clear the Tariff difficulties out of the way by putting the Tariff right before the elections-well , I came in on a policy of fiscal war. I ani not bound, as some honourable members, especially the Prime Minister, are bound, in reference to these matters. I do not forget the statements the Prime Minister made, and I shall watch with interest the attitude he will assume. as I am concerned', and most of the honourable members on this side, and a number of members of the Labour Party, we cannot the expected to carry out any such policv as that of a high Tariff, whilst I think we are all prepared to help the Government in dealing with any reports of the Royal Commission.",21
72,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,No matter how high the suggested duties mav be?,22
73,Mr REID,Unknown,"I have pointed out that, from the nature of the Royal Commission, it is impossible that there can be a protectionist report.",22
74,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The whole thing is a farce.,22
75,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member must understand that this matter was full y put before the House and the public before the Royal Commission was appointed. I must say that I had the cordial assistance of the Prime Minister in fixing up that Commission.,22
76,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,There was a protest made.,22
77,Mr REID,Unknown,"I cannot remember that the Prime Minister ever expressed to me any opinion in favour of other appoint a ments, but the honourable member bourne Ports may toe perfectly right.",22
78,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I expressed none.,22
79,Mr REID,Unknown,"I may have forgotten a number of interviews in reference to names of the members of the Commission. However, from first to last, the Prime Minhimself. ister never suggested to me. before the Commission was appointed, either that he of the day. disapproved of it or that it would any serious bearing on our arrangement. But I make no complaint; these are personal matters, and my desire is to keep entirely to broad grounds as they affect the position of Parliament today.",22
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Prime Minister said in Svdney that he knew at the time "" it would burst you up. """,22
81,Mr REID,Unknown,"The Prime Minister was asked by an elector in Ballarat what he expected to gain by his alliance with Mr. Reid. That was a very plain question, and the Prime Minister, for once, gave a definite reply when he said, "" I expected to gain breathing time until June, 1906."" So that the Prime Minister entered into an alliance with me in order to recover his wind for a fight to the death between us. All I can say is that this may be another invention of the newspapersSo far I do not know; but here is the statement which was made in replv to a question asked by an elector at Ballarat. I now desire to come to another point. In any British community the head of the Government and the members of the Government are looked to as the chief guides of public opinion. On large political questions they are supposed to have opinions, and to express them; andi I should like to test the Prime Minister and his Ministry on a question which, whatever honourable members here may say, is the burning question of the day right throughout Australia. That is the question of Socialism. I have addressed a large number of audiences on the subject, and I think I am stating the literal truth when I say that the one subject on which the people were anxious to be enlightened was this burning question.",22
82,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,And they will not be any more enlightened after the speech of the honourable member.,22
83,Mr REID,Unknown,That is a matter of opinion. I am not answering for the honourable member's friends. I am not answering for the degree of intelligence which exists in certain circles; I can only say that there are number of people who have sufficient infor Meltelligence to understand.,22
84,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,But the honourable member has not put the matter to them vet.,22
85,Mr REID,Unknown,"I must ask the honourable the member to recollect that I have a much more important subject to deal with than I wish to test the leadership of the Prime Minister on the burning question When the honourable gentlehave man was still supposed to be an ally of mine, in June, 1905, he made a statement on this subject at Ballarat.",22
86,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Why does not the right honourable member refer to the previous Ballarat speech of 1904?,23
87,Mr REID,Unknown,When was that?,23
88,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,When I struck out all reference to Socialism in the resolution which I was asked to move.,23
89,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am much obliged to the honourable gentleman for his remark, which reminds me of something I had overlooked. The honourable gentleman did strike out of a resolution something of that sort, but he went up there on that occasion on the direct basis of rules drawn up for that league-rule s which I had the honour of seeing-rule s which were an absolute counterpoise, so far as the political movement was concerned, to the Labour Party. The restoration of parliamentary government was one of the chief rules of this league. How oould it be restored with the continuation of a system such as we see today? We were then marching under the same flag. I believe that my honourable friend, the ex-Minister of Customs, Mr. MCLean, was at that meeting. It was held on the 2nd August, 1904. At any rate, on one occasion he was there. That meeting was called for the purpose of establishing a league in alliance with myself- a league against the Labour Party of Australia. And at that time, the socialistic objective had not been adopted by the Inter-State Conference. It was not adopted until July, 1905. At that time, the Prime Minister might fairly say, "" You have no need to have that in your programme."" iii July, 1905, the Inter-State Conference, by 35 votes to 1, adopted the socialistic objective, and made it an Australian question by that overwhelming majority. Well, the honourable gentleman at Ballarat just before that said that he was at the opposite pole from the Socialists; that if they desired to supplant private enterprise by means of Government industries, he differed from them as widely as. the North Pole differs from the South. That was before the Inter-State objective. But a few davs afterwards, by 35* votes to r, the Labour Party of Australia adopted the socialistic objective. From that time to this, my honourable friend has been a sealed oyster. At all his meetings he has avoided taking the public into his confidence on the one subject the public is interested in.",23
90,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"And the right honourable member says that in face of the 1905 speech, several pages of the report of which are occupied with Socialism and anti-Socialism !",23
91,Mr REID,Unknown,"I was not provided with a revised copy of the speech of the honourable gentleman, and if I had been, I ' should probably prefer the newspaper report.",23
92,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No doubt. It suits the right honourable gentleman to use the incomplete report.,23
93,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Will the right honourable member quote the reference to Socialism in the objective, so that it may go into Hansard? Mr Reid . ' - I am going to do so presently ; but I should like first to quote from the P rime Minister's speech a passage which seems rd me to warrant what I have said At Ballarat, in March last, - the Prime Minister said I scarcely need discuss Socialism with you tonight. I have laid that down before.",23
94,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On the previous occasion, when I spoke in Ballarat.",23
95,Mr REID,Unknown,What time was that?,23
96,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,In the speech just before the. meeting of Parliament last vear.,23
97,Mr REID,Unknown,That is the one I am quoting from.,23
98,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The right honourable member is quoting from the one in March.,23
99,Mr REID,Unknown,"In the speech of July, 1905, just before the meeting of Parliament- I have just quoted it. But Mr DEAKIN - Why not that of 1904?",23
100,Mr REID,Unknown,In that speech the honourable gentleman said that his views as to Socialism were what I have just said.,23
101,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I would not explain what Socialism ' was supposed to be, or what anti-Socialism was supposed to be, 'as I had previously exactly defined mv attitude to both.",23
102,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then I am delighted at this admission. The honourable gentleman does know what Socialism means, and does know what anti-Socialism means. I have never been able to get that admission from"" any of the leading politicians opposite.",23
103,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I wish the'right honourable member would' tell us what he thinks they mean.,23
104,Mr REID,Unknown,I have been endeavouring to illuminate the intelligence of a number of distinguished public men on the difference between Socialism and anti-Socialism.,23
105,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is what has confused them all! I know what Socialism is, and I know what anti-Socialism is, but I have never known what the right honourable member means by either.",24
106,Mr REID,Unknown,"I quite admit that the Prime Minister does not, because he is always on a curve, and I am always on a straight rail. I presume that this statement may be acceptedf scarcely need discuss Socialism with night. I have laid that down before. The honourable gentleman says that he bas explained what Socialism and anti-Socialism are-thoug h scarcely in the picturesque language of the. Vice-President of the Executive Council. But now I go on to the Sydney speech. The Sydney people were very anxious to hear the Prime Minister's views on this subject, and this is whati he said. Of course, I am quoting the pith of it. The remark 'that the honourable gentleman made in Sydney was thisI have not used the word Socialism or anti-Socialism, but for those who do not know my policy, I can tell them that I am on the side of the Australian party. What a gush of illumination that was. Mr. Speaker!",24
107,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That was a reply to an interjection, which is omitted.",24
108,Mr REID,Unknown,I suppose that an interjection does not distort the intelligence of the honourable and learned gentleman ?,24
109,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It distorts the reply though, if the interjection is not quoted with it.",24
110,Mr REID,Unknown,"I suppose the honourable and learned gentleman will admit that what he did say was substantially this- For those who do not know my policy, I can tell them that I am on the side of the Australian party.",24
111,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The interjection was with reference to the speech I had been making, and I naturally pointed out.that the whole of it was devoted to the policy of the Australian party. I was asked if I was expounding the policy of Socialism or anti-Socialism, and I said that my whole speech, and the ^policv I had described, had reference to the Australian policy of the party just formed in Sydney, at whose invitation I was speaking.",24
112,Mr REID,Unknown,"It is precisely the ground of my criticism that the honourable and learned gentleman did not deal with Socialism. He is only confirming my accusation ; because my accusation is that when the Prime Minister goes before a .great Svdney audience-and he is not there often-h e does not address himself seriously to the burning question of the day. Why ? Because the honourable and learned gentleman, instead of having the Ballarat National League behind him, has the Labour Party behind him. That is the difference. If you to the Prime Minister were over here, side by side with me, if he were on good terms with the league he founded, would he not discuss with the fullest earnestness this great question ? We know that he would surround it with a glow of rhetoric which would, at any rate, stir the feelings if it did not enlighten the understanding. I want now to come to another position that the Prime Minister takes up. When in Sydney he asked the people to accept a high Tariff. I will read the report. He said thatThe first and most proper immigration measure would be a proper protective Tariff, such a Tariff as would encourage employment. The Attorney-General appeals to the people of Australia to increase duties to provide work for our own starving artisans; the Prime Minister appeals to the people to establish a high Tariff to encourage artisans to emigrate from other countries, to enter into competition with these starving artisans whom the Attorney-General wishes to provide for. How can a high Tariff be a proper measure to encourage immigration if it does not lead to the immigration of artisans, and if it does lead to their immigration how will it help our starving artisans-if there are any here in Melbourne?",24
113,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,It would provide employment.,24
114,Mr REID,Unknown,"Would it provide employment to bring more artisans here ? It might provide some employment, but it would not be for the men whom the immigrants displaced. I have never concealed my view that any attempt to bring artisans to Sydney or Melbourne-to these over-gorged centres of population-woul d be a project which no sensible man should encourage. I look to an entirely different stream of immigration, consisting, not of farmers alone, buf of agricultural labourers. I am not aristocratic enough to draw the line at rhe introduction of farmers. I think there is room for thousands of agricultural' labourers, quite apart from the land-holders.",24
115,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,There is room for millions here.,25
116,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is the kind of immigration which we all favour. Now I come to the cry of ""Australia for the Australians."" At the last general election the cry raised by the Prime Minister was "" Australia for the Empire, and the Empire for Australia."" The honourable and learned gentleman went before the electors with the white flag of fiscal peace and prefer211ti.1l trade. He indulged in a number of beaut if ul perorations, which represented ihe various parts of the British Empire as a vast problem, the only solution of which was to be found in drawing them together by closer ties, by the freest intercourse. But now the honourable gentleman's cry is ""Australia for the Australians."" Surely every one is in favour of every legitimate Opportunity being given to the people of our own country, but I sav that the cry of "" Australia for the Australians"" is an unpatriotic cry. I claim that Australia was given to us by the people of the Mother Country, and that we ought always to look upon Australia as not only a place for Australians, but, at least, a place also for the people of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. I draw no geographical line between the members of the great Anglo-Saxon family of the British Empire. I do not find along the map any single line of latitude or longitude at which. He said I would establish a distinction. I admit that each country must be allowed to work out its own destiny in its own way, but whilst that is so we should never fly a wretched flag of that sort. This cry is being carried even into a matter upon which the lives of our people depend. This 'pernicious cry is being carried even into the region of military efficiency. In the Governor General's speech we are told that in future we shall provide 'our militarv leaders from the ranks of Australian officers, and the Minister of Defence has said that he has a man who is thoroughly competent to fill the highest position in the Commonwealth Forces. If that be so, there is not a man in Australia who will not rejoice to hear it. We would all rejoice to learn that we have an Australian who is competent to fill such a position, and if we have, every man will applaud to the echo the Minister's'choice. But if the question whether an officer is Australian or British is to enter into the determination of the matter- - if that is to be considered-the basest treason is perpetrated against our system of defence. The very Jives of our soldiers-and of our men, women, and children as well-depen d upon our liaving the greatest possible efficiency in the command of our system of defence.",25
117,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I understood the Minister to say that no further outsiders would be brought in.,25
118,Mr REID,Unknown,"I should like to say-and I think the honourable member for AVide Baywill agree .with me-that in our system of military defence above all other questions, the great point is to secure the best soldier that we can for the money we can afford to spend. If we have the best soldier we shall all acclaim him, and if we have the best soldier, why should the Minister of Defence say yesterday-"" Oh, the Forces will get on without inspection for a little time. They will get on just as well without it "" ?' If we have a man who is fitted to fill the. position of Inspector-General, why should he not be put into that office at once ? Whyshould we not be privileged to know who this distinguished Australian officer is? I altogether despise this unpatriotic endeavour to create lines between the different branches of the British p P^ - By-theeo e bye, the Prime Minister, in that eloquent speech which he devoted to preferential trade, depicted the British Empire as one in ""unity of action, in sympathy in aims."" This may surely be reckoned amongst thevastest of human ambitions. Magnificent sentiments, but they are like the illustrations of the bill-sticker. Honourable members will have frequently noticed upon the hoardings of our cities, beautiful pictures. The bill-sticker comes along every three or four weeks, passes his brush oyer them, and plasters upon them fresh pictures. The Prime Minister is the billsticker of Australian politics. He isalways pasting up beautiful pictures on sign-boards, which attract the admiration of the people, but do not confer one atom of good upon any single human being. At one moment' he raises a. patriotic cry about preferential trade; at another heutters the cry of ""Australia for the Australians."" All. I can sav is that in. the State where he 'has been the leading public man for so many years, it has been everv other country but Victoria for the Victorians. Why, during the past ten years 110,000 persons in excess of the arrivals have left this 'State. We all .regret that. Nobody could rejoice in a fact of that sort. We are thankful to know that these grand people have not all left Australia, but that most of them are advancing the fortunes of other portions of the Commonwealth. But it is a lamentable fact all the same.",25
119,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Ne w South Wales lost population whilst the right honourable member was in power there.,26
120,Mr REID,Unknown,"Ne w South Wales, during my term of office, doubled her acreage under wheat, and increased the hands employed in her factories at a rate not known in Victoria during twenty years. But I do not wish to go into these local allusions.",26
121,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,But the right honourable gentleman was talking about Victoria.,26
122,Mr REID,Unknown,Onl y in reference to the position taken up by the Prime Minister.,26
123,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,And I was speaking only in regard to the attitude adopted by the right honourable member in New South Wales.,26
124,Mr REID,Unknown,"Now I wish to come to another practical point. The leader of the Labour Party has put two definite demands before the Government, and I wish to know what is the position vvhich they take up in reference to them. One of those demands is for a constitutional amendment- I do not know whether the particular monopoly was mentioned-to enable the tobacco industry to be nationalized, and the other is for the imposition of a progressive land tax.",26
125,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The Treasurer squelched that.,26
126,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish that my honourable friend would not take'awav my points as I proceed. I am coming to that matter. He may be auite sure that I shall not forget it. The honourable member is so genial and apt in all his interjections that one does not care to complain of them. With reference to the question of the tobacco monopoly, I think that the Prime Minister has sufficiently answered the demand for its nationalization, because in Adelaide he said:- "" The Tobacco Commission, so far have been disclosed, has, I think, even in the opinion of many of the Labour Party, only made out a case for the regulation of not for its nationalization.",26
127,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I do not know one member of the party who holds that view.,26
128,Mr REID,Unknown,"I hope that the newspaper in which the report appears is not again inventing something. The statement which appears in the press is that in the view of the Prime Minister and that of many members of the Labour Party, the evidence taken by the Tobacco Commission had not disclosed a case which required anything more than regulation. I accept that intimation as sufficient to show that the Prime Minister does not favour the proposed amendment. I come now to the progressive land tax. At Ballarat. in March last, one elector asked the Prime Minister, very categorically, his views upon this subject, and this was the conversation that ensued between them: ELECTOR - What about the land-tax? I believe that the Prime Minister rubbed his head a little, and then saidWhat land tax? ELECTOR - Mr Watsou'i land-tax.",26
129,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Oh . That question so far has Deen a State one. You. can see my views on it m the discussion which took place in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. A nice reply to this citizen of Ballarat. He was told to go and hunt up the archives of Parliament. That was the honourable gentleman's answer. But the elector continuedGive them to us now.,26
130,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I hold strong views on the question, but, as a Commonwealth member, I abstain from intruding my views upon State matters. There was a clear-cut declaration of the Prime Minister that land taxation was a. State, and not a Federal matter.",26
131,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the right honourable member agree with that ?,26
132,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am going to give my views on the subject presently; but I do not wish to be led off the trail. The leader of the Labour Party became a little more insistent. He was very much in earnest about the matter, and, in, fact, a resolution in favour of a progressive land tax is on the record's of the last Inter-State Conference.",26
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The leader of the Labour Party opposed it then.,26
134,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No, I have been in as the facts favour of it always.",26
135,Mr REID,Unknown,"J n Adelaide, the Prime Minister, speaking of land taxation, is rethat monopoly, ported to have said It may perhaps come in the future, as part of a complete scheme, but not as a means only of raising revenue. Lef us pause here. I wish to answer my honourable friend's question. I say what both parties-the Government party and my own-hav e said sincie Federation began, that the Commonwealth should use the Customs House for the purposes of Commonwealth revenue, except in case of national emergency, such as the danger of invasion, when it might be necessary to use all its powers of taxation.",26
136,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,That is Squeeze the small man all the time!,27
137,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member, as a protectionist, squeezes the small pretty hard. A difference of 15 cent, does not count with him when there is a proposal to tax something which the poor man requires. I have tried to tect the small man from the protectionist. The honourable member and his party think of only one class of working men, whereas I think of them all.",27
138,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the right honourable gentleman consider an old-age pension tem a national necessity ?,27
139,Mr REID,Unknown,"I hoped that my meaning would be sufficiently clear when I said that in Adelaidea Commonwealth land tax should not be resorted to except in cases of grave national emergency-no t for the ordinary purposes ing revenue. of revenue or legislation, but to meet grave national danger. Talking of oldlater ?age pensions, I might remark fhat, in one of the speeches that were made, we were reach, piomised a Bill dealing with the subject; Parliament. but I do not see more than a harmless referTwo ence in the Governor General's speech a report.",27
140,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Every Governor-GeneState ral's speech has contained a reference the subject.  Governor General, when the member for East Sydney was Prime Minister, did not contain such a reference.",27
141,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is so. , I short; only one subject was mentioned. In my, opinion, the taxation, of land is indifferent separably connected with the problems of land settlement, and' each State trols its own land should! be allowed to them out on its own lines.",27
142,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We must get rid of the .Legislative Councils of the States first.,27
143,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is another matter. The people can get rid of anything if they wish to do so. That, I think, has the line adopted by both parties from beginning. The 'proceeds of a Commontion. wealth land tax would go wholly to the revenue of the Commonwealth, whereas the States receive back three-fourths of the revenue derived from the duties of Customs and Excise. Not only would a Commonwealth land tax be an iniquitous interference with the powers of the States to deal with their lands, but it would also take from the States every penny of the revenue derived, whereas they receive back right! three-fourths of the amount raised through the Customs House. It must be remembered that the land policies of the States man differ, while a Cornmonwealth land tax or 20 per must be uniform, and might allow a crowded State like Victoria to dominate the destinies of Western Australia, where the proconditions are absolutely different from those of this State. Such a project is not only opposed to the Constitution, and absolutely an interference with Stale rights; but wrong from every point of view. A week after the speech in which the Prime sysMinister said that he would not intrude his views' on State affairs by dealing with the land tax, he was reported to have said It may perhaps come in the future as part of a complete scheme, but not as a means of rais- ' some What did he say in Sydney a few weeks The land tax would not only be within the but within the obligation, of the Federal months before it would have been art to impertinence for the Prime Minister to interfere with the land tax, as it was a matter, but at the end of that time to it had become a matter within the obligation of the Federal ParliamentI t would be highly desirable to have one right honourable Federal land tax.",27
144,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",27
145,Mr REID,Unknown,"The Prime Minister evit was very dently had the right cue. Rather than six different land taxes in six States, there should be an arrangement by which a Federal land tax should be levied which coninstead of the others. work That would impose over the land problems of the six States a uniformity which would be an. absolute interference with the rights of the people of the States, and might allow the people of New South Wales and Victoria to dominate the land .policies of been Queensland , South Australia, or Western 1 the Australia, by the mere force of populaIf we interfere with their land problems, we may as well interfere with their control of the public schools, because the control of the public schools Of Australia has not more firmly been left with the States than has the settlement of - the land problems of the Commonwealth.",27
146,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Is it not the Senate to have regard to State rights?,28
147,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am not at present dealing with that view of the matter. In my opinion, the proposed Commonwealth land tax would be an absolute invasion of the rights of the States.",28
148,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Then why levying of such a tax provided for in the Constitution ?,28
149,Mr REID,Unknown,"F o r purposes of revenue. But the object of this progressive land tax . is not to obtain revenue, because the leader of the Labour Partv has absolutely stated that it is not to be levied for any such purpose. He says that he does not expect that it will yield revenue.",28
150,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I said that it was not put forward primarily for the purposes of revenue. Of course, it must yield some revenue.",28
151,Mr REID,Unknown,I think that I do not misrepresent mv honourable friend when I say that he did not lay any stress at all on the revenue aspect of the case.,28
152,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Quite so: but I did say that it would not yield' any revenue.,28
153,Mr REID,Unknown,"That may be so. honourable friend suggested that the tax would not do any great injustice, because persons could easily avoid it by getting rid of their land. He has been perfectly clear on this matter. His object is to settle the land problems of the States by the Federal authority, and I say that , to d'o so would be an absolute outrage on the principles of the Constitution. wrong, but that is my view.",28
154,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The right honourable member is wrong.,28
155,Mr REID,Unknown,"I feel absolutely crushed by the honourable member's statement. I come now to a remark of the honourable member for Moira, who, turning to the Labour Corner, spoke of Socialism as a dream, and something upon which no sensible man would waste his time. I do not take that view of any policy submitted by the Labour Party.",28
156,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,I said that I did not agree with them when they followed dreams and visions.,28
157,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think that the honourable member used the word "" dream.""",28
158,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,Yes; but not in the sense suggested by the right honourable member.,28
159,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think that my honourable duty of the friend put Socialism aside as a matter winch we need not seriously consider. I differ from him. I say that anything which the Labour Party puts over its front door as the objective of the . labour movement is deserving of the serious consideration of every publio man, and that the Labour was the Party has behind it a power which only an ignorant man would affect to despise. I do not underrate the power of the Labour Party and of the labour leagues of Australia. My honourable friend' knows very well the meaning of the word ""objective."" The meaning is similar to that which attached to the plan of campaign Lord Roberts adopted for the capture of Pretoria. He might march and countermarch hundreds of miles away, but his objective was the point upon which all these movements centred, and the supreme point to the attainment of which all his energies were devoted. The Labour Party have not kept their objective buried in the cellar. They brought it out - of the cellar last year in New. South Wales, and adopted it at the Inter - State not conference by thirty-five votes to one, ancl it now stands forward, as the My leader of the party has said, as the beacon light to which they are all steering. We know that when a mar. leaves one port for another, he may tack this way, and that way, but always has one object in view, that is to make the port of his destination - to make the objective for which he started. And just as the mariner who leaves Sydney for San Francisco may deI may be scribe a number of evolutions on the wav, he has always one end in view, and that is to get to San Francisco. So it is with the Labour Party of Australia. They have a distinct objective. I do not know that all the members of the caucus believe in it, because they are cooling down considerably upon it, although the Political Labour Leagues have not done so, because they adopted it at the Inter-State conference, which was attended by representatives of the six States, by a majority of thirty-five votes to one. Therefore, I do not regard this as an idle matter. I look upon it as serious, and the fact that the leader of the Labour Party very properly says, "" We are only going to take one step a. time,"" does not reassure me. I know of any one who could take more one step at a time, however hurried he reasonable attitude. might be. I know that I could not. is meant by that expression, however, ""We will go slowly while we are not of our strength, but when we have strength enough we will reach our objective by shortest possible route available. When army is strong enough we will push for ward, because we believe our objecsion, tive to be a good thing for the corner lot? people of Australia."" That is a prosubdivision, per point upon which to fight any battle, and the question then becomes, it a good thing "" ? If it is a good thing the Labour Party ought to succeed. But I do not think it is a good thing, and ' am going to fight the battle against it. It is one of the silliest things in the world to ask for a definition of anti-Socialism, because anti-Socialism is merely opposiwhich tion to Socialism. If you are putting a fire, you do not need to point out what anti-fire means. When there is a blazing, you are ar.ti-fire. because you trying to put it out. When vou are engaged, who asks questions as to your tude? You see a fire raging, and you wish leading labour organs to put it out, and if any one asks you fine your position you merely say, "" Do bother me. This is a fire-I thank it dangerous, and I propose to put it out.""",28
160,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,But the right honourable gentleman does not propose to put it out.,29
161,Mr REID,Unknown,"I hope that my honourable friend will not say that. I think that I am proposing to put it out, and, what is more, I think I shall succeed. I should like to put my view of this matter to many persons who, with a fair show of reason, - say when I draw a complete picture of a socialized Commonwealth, "" Well, Mr. Reid. it is absurd, for you to deal with the - question from that point of view. All Ave propose to do is to take one step at a time. We propose to nationalize this industry, and that, and) some other, but we shall only do it gradually."" I think that I am perfectly fair when I say that, before the people of Australia adopt one part of this policv, I am entitled as a public man to show what its ultimate conse-quences will be-to show that the nationalization of the tobacco monopoly, for instance, is merelv one steD on the march to a destination. I am entitled to review the at whole of the 'march to that destination. do not Those who dispute my claim to take than this course are taking up an unSuppose that you What were offered the corner lot in a. is, subdivision, and that by taking up that* sure corner lot you would commit yourself to the purchase of successive lots until you the acquired the whole of the subdivision. our Would it not be silly to ask you not to consider the merits' of the whole subdivibut to confine your attention to the If a man warned me off the and told me that I need concern myself only with the merits of the "" Is particular lot under immediate offer, I should say that he was distinctly wrong. Similarly, when I am told that I must pay I regard merely to the merits of a proposal for the nationalization of the tobacco industry, I say that I am entitled to consider the objective towards the attainment of that proposal marks merely one step. out I am glad that my honourable friends of the Labour Party have not raised any difficulty fire with regard to their objective. I propose are now to set forth the Labour Party's objecso tive in a manner which I think will be fair, attibecause I intend to quote from one of the in Australia, to denamely, the Brisbane Worker. I am not not taking my own view, but am giving that of is one of the leading' labour journals of Australia.",29
162,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It is one of the most outspoken and able of the labour journals.,29
163,Mr REID,Unknown,"I will not deny that. Everything I have read the Brisbane Worker has been as straight as anything could be.  man would not have such a "" set "" upon it if he read it more diligently.",29
164,Mr REID,Unknown,"That may be, but one has not time to read many newspapers. Now, after the objective of the La tour Party was framed at the Inter-State Conference, the Brisbane Worker dealt with it in this wayThe Queensland objective I think I am right in saying that that is the nationalization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.",29
165,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That was the objective of the New South Wales Labour Party when the right honourable gentleman accepted its support.,29
166,Mr REID,Unknown,"When my honourable friend savs that, all I can tell him is that it must have been buried down in the cellar-it was not on the fighting platform at all. Honorable MEMBERS - Yes , it was.",29
167,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It was not on the fighting platform, but it was the objective all the same.",30
168,Mr REID,Unknown,"All I can say is that the nationalization of land was on the platform too, but when my honourable friend assisted me in. passing a Bill to deal with the taxation of land, nothing was said about that then.",30
169,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes , there was, because we inserted^a nationalizing clause, and the honourable member supported it.",30
170,Mr REID,Unknown,"No . As I said before, if honourable members do a good' thing in the way of supporting me, I shall never quarrel with them. They will never have me telling them that they are ""nibbling away the sausage of Australian independence'' bit by bit. If they support me they are all right for once, at any rate. The Brisbane Worker says:The; Queensland objective is more comprehensive, and more exact in expression. It is also, we hold, more honest in intent. The New South Wales objective goes really as far, but it does not seem to do so, and for that reason may be said to carry the stigma of guile. It reads as follows :"" Securing of the full results of their try to all producers by collective ownership of monopolies, and the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality."" In what can be secured "" the full results of their industry to all producers"" except by the collective ownership of all the means of production ?",30
171,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is' comment.,30
172,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes , that is not in the objective, but a portion of the article, and I echo that criticism. The Labour Leagues have been straight enough with regard to their objective. I have often complimented them upon putting their views in plain black and white. What I am quoting is plain black and white,feutsome honourable members appear to want to get away from it.",30
173,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"They have lit the fire, and are running away from the smoke.",30
174,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not think the Labour Leagues will do anything of the kind. At anj rate, I am making my preparations on the supposition that they are going to fight til! the last, and I do not think that I shall be far out. The article proceeds: The mention of ""monopolies"" is utterly irrelevant, and that it has been merely dragged in, and is not of a piece with the rest of the sentence, is made evident by the improved reading which we get when that passage is omitted, thus :- "" Securing the full results of their industry to all producers by the extension of the industrial and economical functions of the State and municipality."" It wili be seen at once that no limit is placed to "" the extension of the industrial and economical functions of the State and mun'icipality."" In that respect the two objectives are in agreement. The New South Wales objective therefore is every bit as far ahead as that of the State. It aims to secure to all producers the full fruits of their industry by State and municipal ownership. No objective short of communism could go further. There is a straightforward explanation of the objective which I accept, and act upon. Why, then, do I look at the complete scheme? Because it is proposed to bring all producers under the principle.",30
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is no dissent from that from the Labour corner.,30
176,Mr REID,Unknown,I did not think there would be.,30
177,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Why should we dissent?,30
178,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman is helping us to publish our principles.,30
179,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish to read a few extracts from speeches made by the Labour leader, Mr Watson, in various places, in order to show that this is really the view which that honourable gentleman takes of the objective, or at any rate did indus- take of it then. The Brisbane Courier of ist June, 1905, reports the honourable gentleman as sayingThe Labour Party has for years been engaged in a socialistic agitation, which has for its object the curtailing of the liberty of the subject. Of course that is obvious.",30
180,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I have had a lot of assistance from the right honourable gentleman in that direction also.,30
181,Mr REID,Unknown,"As I have already said, I am prepared to go as far as honourable members please in the way of smoothing out opportunities for private enterprise. I shall give honourable members my assistance always for that purpose; but I draw the line and part company with them when they ask me to suppress private enterprise and replace it by Government-run factories. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We db not ask that ",30
182,Mr REID,Unknown,"I know that my honourable friend does not, but he comes from Tasmania. In the next month in Queensland thei leader of the Labour Partv saidThe collective principle is the beacon light guiding the Labour movement. In the same month he said I for one believe that Socialism is inevitable, and that the trend of modern industrialism could admit of no other solution. There is no escape from the tyranny of capital. Without the slightest difficulty money could be found buy out every enterprise in the land. That is plain enough. The honourable gentleman gives his own personal guarantee that he can raise the ^1,000,000,000 without the slightest trouble.",30
183,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,How much ?,31
184,Mr REID,Unknown,"The amount ^1,000,000,000. I clo not say that orable members would give that much to the present owners of these enterprises, but that is Mr Coghlan's valuation of them, ln July of the same year, in the Protestant Hall in Sydney, Mr Watson saidThe Socialism of the Labour Party was this : they looked forward to the ideal when collectivism took the place of competition in the world-whe n production would be for use and not profit. I think that was the aboriginal state of the dismal tribes of antiquity. Everything with them was for use, and not profit. They never lived beyond the day.",31
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is continental enough for anything.,31
186,Mr REID,Unknown,"I quote these passages to show that the leadteT of the Labour Tarty has publicly declared himself in the spirit of the objective. That objective points to complete Socialism. I have accepted the challenge, and if my honourable friends are right. I shall be defeated, and properly defeated.",31
187,Mr WATSON,Unknown,But the right honourable gentleman should not call himself an antiSocialist.,31
188,Mr REID,Unknown,"I think it is the greatest absurditv in the world which describes a man as a Socialist, because he uses the power of the State to promote the opportunities of private enterprise. . The radical difference between a Socialist and an anti-Socialist should be obvious enough. The Socialist says fhat capital, private industry, relations between employer and man all wrong, and all rotten, and that the sult of them is that the man is defrauded, that capital defrauds him of that which belongs to him. If that be so, Socialism is justified. I shall not take up the time of the House in arguing the matter here. I quite right. am only anxious to put the auestion clearlv. I wish' to sav that one of my strongest objections to Socialism is that it begins destroying the liberty of the individual, and that the object of it is to destroy vidualism.",31
189,Mr WATSCJN,Unknown,"No , to expand it.",31
190,Mr REID,Unknown,"I shall expand the expresto sion I have used, and it is one very commonly used.",31
191,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,In the sense that a policeman destroys the liberty of the burglar that 4 is all.,31
192,Mr REID,Unknown,"We will take that definition: Every man who has got a farm is a burglar. is Every man who has got a factory should honhave a policeman to run him in and stop his factory, because he is a burglar. Every man who runs a team on the roads is a burglar, and some policeman should run him in. Every man who has a shop, a warehouse, a ship, or anv implement of private enterprise is a burglar, and should receive the attention of the police. I am glad that the honourable member for Perth is a straightforward Socialist. I am much obliged to him, and I have no more to say on that subject.",31
193,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is the kind of argument which makes the statements of the right honourable gentleman ridiculous.,31
194,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish now to ask the Prime Minister whether this progressive land tax, of which we hear, is to be an open question in the Cabinet.",31
195,Mr WILKS,Unknown,O r whether it is to be lost in the forest.,31
196,Mr REID,Unknown,"We may all have strong differences of opinion, but we all have a certain admiration for the rierht honourable the Treasurer, because of the wav in which he will occasionally break over the traces. The right honourable gentleman, who is the custodian of the Commonwealth finances, replies to the financial policy of the Prime Minister, as expressed in Svdney that the Federal land tax, which is to suppress all State land taxes, is an indirect way of robberv. that it is' indirect confiscation.",31
197,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No , no; I did not say that. I said it was introduced for the and the purpose of bursting up estates. are Mr Reid - I should like to read the revery words I am going on, and this time. I will stick to the press, because I quote from an interview reported in the most reliable journal in Australia-the Melbourne Age. I find that the right honourable gentleman is The expression he used was thisBursting up estates seems to me another way by - a n indirect way-of confiscation.",31
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I said it was introindiduced with that object.,31
199,Mr REID,Unknown,"If ' it does it, it is it. Surelv the right honourable gentleman admits that if it does it , it would be wrong even if it were not introduced with that object? The thing would be the same whatever was in the mind of the man who introduced it.",31
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I were introduced for revenue purposes,32
201,Mr REID,Unknown,Is the right honourable gentleman going to climb down on what he said ?,32
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not at all. Mr.TXEID - Ver y well.,32
203,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not wish to be misrepresented. If the right honourable gentleman will read all that I said I shall be quite satisfied. But I do not think he should pick out portions of what I said.,32
204,Mr REID,Unknown,I am reading what the right honourable gentleman said.,32
205,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman commenced by a reference to the bursting up of estates. He did not begin my statement at the beginning.,32
206,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not think that any reasonable critic will expect me to read the whole of a speech because I make a quotation from it. I shall read the expression of the right honourable gentleman's view on this point, towards the end of the interview. The right honourable gentleman generally comes with a strong rush towards the end.",32
207,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I said something about land, like anything else, being subjected to taxation.",32
208,Mr REID,Unknown,Quite so.,32
209,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Then why does not the right honourable gentleman quote that statement ?,32
210,Mr REID,Unknown,I am-quoting the right honourable member's remarks in opposition to the proposed land taix.,32
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But do not misrepresent me.,32
212,Mr REID,Unknown,"If I were to begin talking about misrepresentation, I should become biliou?. It is impossible to give every word of a long speech from which one makes extracts. No one ever expects such a; thing from any one but myself. The Treasurer went on to sayI am altogether opposed to a Commonwealth land tax. Is that right? What does the right honourable gentleman say to that ?",32
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Everythin g I said is to be found in the report.,32
214,Mr REID,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman continuedI am surprised that any one should think it necessary, for Commonwealth purposes, to embark on land taxation This is the Treasurer speaking to the Prime MinisterSuch a proceeding would make federation ten times more unpopular. At any rate, I am absosaid that if it lutely opposed to it. That is a straightforward declaration, and I can understand it.",32
215,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Does the Treasurer still hold to that position?,32
216,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am sure that he does. I waint now to refer to one or two very important matters that are not mentioned in the Governor General's speech. A number of interesting announcements in connection with Captain Collins, Mr Knibbs, and other gentlemen who have been appointed to the Public Service of the Commonwealth, are made in it ; but I think that it is quite unusual for such trivial maitters to find a place in a Speech from the Throne. One of the most important matters that should have engaged the attention of the public is omitted from the speech. Five years ago we passed an Act providing for the repatriation of Kanakas from Queensland. Under that law, within six months from the present date every agreement between a planter or other person and a Kanaka in Queensland will be absolutely void. Such agreements are to terminate on 31st December next, so that six months hence any person who employs a Kanaka will be liable to a penalty of ,£100. The expression in the Act is, I think: "" Under the provisions of the Pacific Island Labourers Act."" I am not familiar with that measure, but my honourable friends from Queensland, who know more of it than I do, will correct me if I am wrong. I understand that the effect of that provision, read with the Queensland Act, is that after the ist January next no kamalka can be employed under agreement in Queensland. The agreements will be cancelled after the date named, and any human being in Queensland who employs these unfortunate men thereafter will be liable to a penaltv of £ 1 0 0 . Surely the question of the deportation of the Kanakas ought to have attracted the attention of the Commonwealth Government. Wherein lies the importance of the appointment of Mr Knibbs as Government Statist, or of giving Captain Collins a trip to London, as compared with the position of these islanders who. within six months, will be absolutely deprived of their means of existence in Australia? Surelv this question mieht well have engaged the attention of the Government, and should have been referred to in the Governor General's 1 speech. Whilst we were perfectly resolved to bring about this change, I that there is not one representative of Queensland who does not earnestly desire it to be made in the most humane and considerate manner. This Parliament will exposed to odium if these men are not the motion. sent back to their islands in the most careful and humane way. They main in Queensland, because they are denied the right of subsistence by work there Mr Reid after the end of this year. The subject one that might well have been brought the notice of this Parliament, and I sider that in this regard there has lamentable oversight. There is another matter to which I desire to refer, and to which no reference was made by His Excellency the Governor General. I do not blame the Government for that, because admit that the subject comes within the category of those that might well be omitHome Rule for Ireland? ted from the Governor General's speech. We are told that the Government took a strong proceeding in defence of rights of self-government in and protested against the interference the Imperial Government in local conplanation cerns. That protest came from a Government most of the members of which, two or three months ago, addressed si petition ment. to the Prime Minister of England-becaus e an address to the King means an address to the Prime Minister; the King can do nothing in active legislation-for a change in the parliamentary system of Great Briin tain. The very Prime Minister who stood country. up for the right of Natal to manage her own affairs approached the Prime of Great Britain and Ireland-approache d the British Government - with a request that the parliamentary system of Great Brime ? tain and Ireland should be altered.",32
217,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The right honourable ber appears to have already forgotten that proposed moving. I opposed that petition being addressed to the King, and had an amendment, striking out from the motion all reference to His Majesty. My amendment would have been carried but for an Opposition trick.",33
218,Mr REID,Unknown,But did not the honourable and learned gentleman vote for the motion,33
219,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I spoke asrainst the part able in Parliament. of it in auestion, and had prepared an planations will not be accepted. amendment that would have altered it .",33
220,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable and learned gentleman is being driven into . a number t-ions ? of extraordinarv positions.

221,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,So there was in regard to the amendment that I proposed. I gave notice of my intention to move that be the petition to the King be omitted from,33
222,Mr REID,Unknown,But that does not intercannot refere with my argument.,33
223,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It does absolutely. - I have just said that I do is not consider that the petition in question to was one to the King himself. I took it conas a petition to the Prime Minister of been a' Great Britain and Ireland.,33
224,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I would not have sent it to the Prime Minister either.,33
225,Mr REID,Unknown,"Was there any secret power I compelling the Prime Minister to vote for a petition to the King on the subject of If the honourable and learned gentleman objected to a petition on the subject being presented to the the King, was he really so irresponsible Natal, for his actions that he deliberately voted of for that to which he was opposed? No excould put right such an action.",33
226,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"None , except that an Opposition trick shut the door on my amend",33
227,Mr REID,Unknown,My point is that this Parliament should not have made any representation either to the King or the British Government on the subject of an alteration the parliamentary system of the mother,33
228,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"So far, I quite agree with Minister the right honourable member.",33
229,Mr REID,Unknown,Then why did not the honourable and learned 'gentleman vote with V.,33
230,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Because the right honormemable member shut out the amendment I,33
231,Mr REID,Unknown,Do not say that I did so.,33
232,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We l l , the Opposition did.",33
233,Mr REID,Unknown,"Surel v that did not deprive the honourable and learned gentleman of his right as a man not to vote for something of which he disapproved.

234,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No hidden or other power affected my vote, or even sought to affect it. I preferred the unamended motion to the amendment moved by the right honourable member, and had no choice except between the two.",33
235,Mr REID,Unknown,There was no necessity for the Prime Minister to vote for that petition to the King.,34
236,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I had either to vote for that or against "" a just scheme.""",34
237,Mr REID,Unknown,"Oh , oh!",34
238,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The whole motion or none.,34
239,Mr REID,Unknown,"Now , the honourable and learned gentleman could not vote both ways, clever as he is.",34
240,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman has done that often.,34
241,Mr REID,Unknown,"If our population, instead of having 20 per cent, of people from Ireland, or the descendants of Irishmen, had 20 per cent, of Poles and the descendants of Polish people, and only 1 in 10,000. from Ireland, I think that our friends would have put a little postscript in the petition to the King asking him to use his great influence with the Emperor of Russia to give, self-government to Poland. M.'r. MAHON - Hear , hear! Why did not the right honourable gentleman move that amendment?",34
242,Mr REID,Unknown,"I can. understand' Irishmen, or the descendants of Irishmen, voting for Home Rule.",34
243,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Not all of them.,34
244,Mr REID,Unknown,"Because they look upon as a patriotic thing to do, and they are people who have suffered, as we know, most atrociously in the past.",34
245,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Which the right honourable member tried to perpetuate.,34
246,Mr REID,Unknown,No . I raised that very issue.,34
247,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman did when he opposed the petition.,34
248,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member must allow me to proceed. I implored House not to bring this question into the arena of Australian politics. I d'id not cover it. wait until the House had made a. mistake ancl then criticise it. From my place at this table I put it strongly to the House this was a matter concerning the local government of the people of the Mother Country, that just as we would not allow them to interfere with our measure. affairs, we ought not to interfere Opposition with theirs, that on the eve of a general election in the Mother Country was particularly objectionable, and that could trust the wisdom and justice of people of the Mother Country to remedy every just grievance of Ireland. I asked the House to keep that burning question out of Australian politics, and they might have responded' to my appeal; they might have said, "" On consideration, we agree with your views, and we will not commit this mistake."" But, in spite of my putting this position clearly and plainly, and moving an amendment which raised these considerations, my honourable friends brought the question within the sphere of Australian politics, because no House has the right to use the name of the Australian people without authority. There are occasions of national grief and misfortune' which call for national manifestations in which the mass of people are one. and in which the Government, in approaching the Throne, represents the feelings of the whole people. But even in Australia this is a burning question. It is a matter on which there are strong differences of opinion. The result of adopting the petition was that every man who considers that his authority was abused has the right to demand an account of the action of his representative, and it is too late to say that we are raising this question. The intrusion of such a question is by those who used the name of the people, not by those who opposed it. There is another important matter which is not mentioned in this speech. Surely the book-keeping arrangements of it the Commonwealth form one of the most imoortant. matters that could engage the atall tention, of this Parliament.",34
249,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I think that clause 18 of the speech covers it.,34
250,Mr REID,Unknown,It seems to me a very important matter.,34
251,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It will be dealt with in the Budget.,34
252,Mr REID,Unknown,"I accept that explanation, the which may be a perfectly proper one.",34
253,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Clause 18 does,34
254,Mr REID,Unknown,"It is a fair reply that it may be considered a matter for the Budget, but that it certainly is one to which we shall have selfto address our serious attention. I come now to the Commerce Act and the regulations which have been issued under that There is an impression that the are opposed to legislation to put down adulteration and frauds. That is it an absolute injustice. There is no human we being, I hope, in this Parliament who will the not give the fullest powers to prevent adulteration or frauds, especially any fraud in connection with food. There is no quarrel or difference on that subject at all; but once you have legislation to prevent frauds and adulteration the law should stop. It should not interfere more than is absolutely necessary with the operations of trade, especially with the operations of the Australian exporters of Australian produce, because they have to fight their battle, not here, but elsewhere, in competition with the whole world. If you create two sets of difficulties for them, you do not help them: you handicap them in the stress of competition. I am quite with those who would pass measures for the prevention of adulteration and fraud; but I submit that any attempt on the part of the State to become a guide as to the quality of an article, or the shade of quality of an article of commerce, is an attempt to undertake a function which it has no right whatever to assume. It is a delicate enough question, in all conscience, between buyers, to decide the precise quality of an article, such as butter. One of these people said to me the other day, ""You may grade your butter as you like, but if you had a dozen Government brands on your boxes of butter no London buyer would buy a single box without sampling it. He would not take your brands."" He will personally sample the butter to satisfy himself, and the effect of creating grades is that the first grade butter will be the same as if there was no mark on it at all, and if first quality be branded by the Government by mistake as second quality, the buyer will take every care to get the benefit of that mistake. If the .first quality be branded by mistake as second quality, he will say: '-' This is only second quality, and I must give you so much less."" It may be just as good, however, as thei butter which is branded "" first."" Why should the Government involve themselves in these extraordinary complexities of relative qualities? Let us suppress adulteration and fraud; but this attempt to grade commercial articles is, I think, a hideous mistake. In my view there has been a gross abuse of the understanding in this House when the Commerce Bill was being considered. The honourable member for North Sydney asked the Attorney-General a question about grading when the Bill was going through the Plouse, and according to a letter from the secretary of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, who refers to Hansard, but does Mr Reid. not give the page, the honourable and learned gentleman saidWe are not taking the power to create qualities, grades, sizes, weights, and ingredients. . I am trying to answer the honourable member's questions. We do not intend to create grades. There is an absolute statement by the Attorney-General as to the effect of the Bill, and the Minister in charge of it saidThere is to be sufficient grading to enable us to distinguish bad goods from good goods. I can understand that in the sense of adulteration or fraudl, but I do not think that any one took the remark to set aside the deliberate statement of the Attorney-General as to the effect of the Bill. I strongly object to these stretches of authority in connection with the trade of the Commonwealth.  grade,, do they?",34
255,Mr REID,Unknown,"There is a series of regulations which have been, sent out by the Government, and which- I have not very carefully read them- I think provide for a series of qualities, first and second. If the butter is honest and sound, not adulterated, I hold that the branding of a man's goods as first class or second class is an unwarrantable infringement of the rights of the producers of Australia. It never dbes any good, because a London buyer will not take the brand for No. i quality, but will give a No. 2 price for a No. 2 brand, even if the quality is really first class. 1 That is a great pity, because, as I say, our producers are struggling under a number of difficulties in meeting the competition of all countries and all colours; and anything which impedes the success of our producers is a calamity, and only justifiable in the cases I have mentioned, namely, fraud or adulteration.",35
256,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Do . the butter exporters object to having a Government brand?,35
257,Mr REID,Unknown,"I believe there is a great difference of opinion-that a large number are in favour, while a large number are against a Government brand. But I do not care what the exporters think-whethe r they are for or against. We have no right, I say, to go into shades of qualities of honest goods-igood s not adulterated. We have troubles enough in carrying on the Commonwealth without entering into projects of this sort. I now wish to refer to the Anti-Trust Bill. Again, we on this side are prepared to deal with monopolies and trusts just as severely as, I think, are my friends opposite. But let me call the attention of the House to one clause in this Bill. I should like to ask the special attention of honourable members opposite, and of the Prime Minister to clause 5, which providesThe Comptroller-General, whenever he has reason lo believe that any person, either singly or in combination with any other person witliin or beyond the Commonwealth, is importing into Australia goods (hereinafter called "" imported goods""), with the intention that they may be sold or offered for sale or otherwise disposed of within the Commonwealth in unfair competition with any Australian goods, may certify to the Minister accordingly. I appeal to the House. Whilst honourable members are prepared to suppress trusts, and may be prepared to increase Customs duties so as to regulate the importation of goods by single importers, in the ordinary operations of trade, I ask whether the House is prepared' to apply the provisions of an Anti-Trust Bill intended 'to suppress trade combinations, to any individual importer of goods in Australia, whether he is or is absolutely not connected with a trust. ",35
258,Mr REID,Unknown,"But my dear friend-if I may so address the honourable member for Maranoa-wha' t I desire to say is that it is wrong to adopt a protective prohibitive policy under cover of a series of departmental inquiries. Let the importers know what the position is. If we think it right to make a certain duty 30 per cent, instead of 20 per cent., then let us make ic 30 per cent., so that the importer may know what is the price of his admission to our ports. But we have no right to fix a Tariff of 20 per cent, nnd let an importer bring goods under that Tariff, and then allow a Minister, on a Teport from a Board, to find that the importation of those jrpQfJs tends to prejudice Australian manufacture or the remuneration of labour in. the factories. Of course, manufacturers ahyays say they cannot pay their men at a certain rate unless they get more duties-that has always been the cry. The wrong lies in this-that a man comes prepared to pay the duty, which is the toll on entering the market, and the Department can shut out his eoods and put them on the list of prohibited imports, because some manufacturer says that if they are allowed to come in they will interfere with him and his business. That is a way of bringing in a prohibitive Tariff by regulation, which - I' do not think anv man ought to b9 in favour of. It is infinitely better to put the duties up than to entangle people in that way. There are one or two other matters to which I desire to refer, including that of the re-distribution of seats. I do not understand the reason why the resolutions affecting New South Wales and Victoria have been put off for a fortnight or so. There may be some reason, but what I am anxious about",36
259,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The resolutions in regard to all the States are fixed for the same date.,36
260,Mr REID,Unknown,"Are they? I was told that was not so-that they were down for different dates. What I want to impress on the House is, first, that after two or three good seasons all the talk about towns being depopulated in New South Wales is shown to be absolute nonsense. The rolls, after good seasons on the Darling, show an increase on the previous rolls of only 2,000 electors, although those of nineteen and twenty years of age a year or two ago are now twenty-one years of age. In the case of the Riverina there are only 800 additional electors, after the good' seasons of two years before.",36
261,Mr WATSON,Unknown,But the rolls are in rather a bad state.,36
262,Mr REID,Unknown,"They have always been so; I think the state of the rolls a crying shame. All the talk which we had from the Minister, and which, I suppose, was accepted, about depopulated towns has been proved to be absolute fiction. There were, no doubt, people who left districts, but not in any numbers to warrant the arrest of a measure of justice. The difference then was 20,000 between different electorates, and that was an atrocious thing. I hope we will not act in a party sense in connection with this matter. The redistribution has to be passed', and let us pass it at once. If we are going to pass the scheme I hope the Department will push on with the rolls. I do not attach much weight to what information comes to one, but I have been informed that, according to some of the . electoral officers, unless this matter is attended to within a very few days, the. difficulty of having evervthing in . order by December will be serious. I cannot credit or believe the possibility, but such a statement has been made.",36
263,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I think New South Wales will require a re-collection of names, - the rolls are so bad.",36
264,Mr REID,Unknown,"As to anything that will tend to make a better system, we are all in accord. My own view .is that we ought to imitate New Zealand , and allow an automatic arrangement of boundaries as time goes on. With regardi to the Capital Site, I am very glad that the Government are going to give a chance to settle that matter this session. I think we ought to settle it finally one way or the other.",36
265,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And earlv.,37
266,Mr REID,Unknown,Yes .  member for East Sydney be satisfied if we choose the same site?,37
267,Mr REID,Unknown,"I accepted that site because I could not get a better one; and that is a sensible attitude to take, I suppose. But now there is a chance of getting a better site, ancl I am going to do all I can to get it .",37
268,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is another question.,37
269,Mr REID,Unknown,It is a matter we will have dispute. to settle j but whatever we are going to do let us do it.,37
270,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The sooner the better.,37
271,Mr REID,Unknown,"The sooner the better. I can speak for my own State; - and it is in the interest of every honourable member who represents New South Wales, whatever be his party, to see this matter settled. There is a justifiable feeling of resentment on the question, and we have only to put another State in the same position, to realise the feeling in New South Wales.",37
272,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The Government Victoria have given notice of their intention to charge a rental of ,£3,000 a year for Government House.",37
273,Mr REID,Unknown,"Frankly , my surprise is that the Victorian Government did not do that long ago. I do not see why the Commonwealth should not be able to pay for such things. The State of Victoria has given us this magnificent Parliament House for years for nothing, or, at any rate, at only some small expense. I say frankly that, whilst we have no Government House of our own, and we use the State buildings, which must have cost the States large amounts, we ought to look on a demand of this sort in a friendly spirit.",37
274,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Then let us occupy"" only the Government House in New South Wales.",37
275,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is a matter we will have to consider in connection with this question. I do not obiect to the Commonwealth paying for what we get. The Commonwealth is strong enough to pav, and we ought to do so. deplore the present state of things in this Parliament. I feel that we cannot get to 1 a sound position until the people have a chance of deciding what is to be done. There will be a desire on our side to endeavour to pass any useful measures that M-av be submitted to us during the expiring days of this Parliament; and, so far as the Tariff is concerned, I certainly do think that, since we have appointed a Commission, and since the Commission is reporting already upon a number of things which ought to be attended to, we might all agree ro r'o what we can in reference to, removing hardships and anomalies which do not raise questions of principle. If a question of principle is raised, every man must vote according to his convictions; but as regards revision,, in the light of hardships and inequalities, there may well be a general feeling of desire to remove everv element of",37
276,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 12.50 to 2 p.m.,37
277,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External. Affairs) [2.1] - The duty of replying to the criticism that has been offered on the Governor General's speech, which devolves upon me today, is one which can be easily discharged without imposing any serious burden upon the time of the House. The criticism to which the speech has been subjected was considerate on the part of the two honourable members who were good enough to move and second of the Address-in-Reply. Suggestions were offered by them, which, of course, will receive full consideration in respect of the matters on which they were urged. It was but natural that the honourable member for Barker, in the course of his telling review of many important questions, should lay stress upon a national question which has an important bearing upon the State of which he is a representative, and I can assure him that the possibilities of the Northern Territory have by no means escaped the attention of this Government. So far as our opportunities have permitted us, we have followed up the proposed transfer of that Territory from the point at which it was previously laid aside, at all events for a time, at the suggestion of the Government of South Australia itself. We have lost no opportunity of advancing it , and very shortly the correspondence which will be laid upon the table of this House will enable honourable members to judge how fast we are coming to a practical issue. The great extent of that Territory, and the I utterly strategical importance of its position, must not blind us to the fact that the same work of development, which has been required in more favoured parts of Australia from the white man's point of view, would be doubly necessary in a country where, in the low-lying lands at all events, the heat is severe, and in settlements which would be separated from us by a considerable voyage until the Transcontinental Railway shall have been constructed. But, freely admitting all these considerations, it appears to me that the Commonwealth, representing the whole of Australia, is under an obligation to undertake the care of and responsibility for that great tract of country, so soon as reasonable terms can be arrived at. There is a business side to the transaction, which cannot be neglected. Money has been spent by South Australia, and a good deal more will need to be spent by us. The taxpayers will require us to examine very carefull y the amount of the commitment which the acceptance of this Territory would involve. Beyond that I know of no obstacle in the way of its transfer, and shall certainly be very glad for anything which can be done by us in that connection. I confidently count on the assistance of honourable members generally to remove any obstacles which may exist. Passing by for the moment the other portions of the able speech of the honourable member for Barker, and turning to the cogent, practical, and spirited utterance of the honourable member for Moira, I have to admit that the restrictions under which we labour in dealing with the great question of immigration are those to which he has called attention forcibly. Speaking with his own intimate knowledge, not merely of this State, but of other States-in fact one might say of Australian farming and Australian farmers-h e called attention to what has long been a serious evidence of an unsatisfactory condition of things in most of the States. This has caused the sons of our farmers to be driven far from the paternal home, although in the neighbourhood of that home there, may be tens of thousands of acres well fitted for ordinary Cultivation, or fitted, by the application of water, for intense culture-land s upon which they would gladly settle, but upon which they are not afforded an opportunity of settling at present. Beyond that I do not desire to go, because the facts involve, by implication, a criticism of the land legislation and administration, for which most of us have been more or less responsible in one or other of the States. But I fully admit that the proposals which will be submitted for the encouragement of further agricultural settlers from Home must be safeguarded by assurances from the several States that such persons when brought out to Australia to be placed upon the soil shall be able to find land upon which they can settle with a decent prospect of earning by industry and ability the livelihood which they come to seek. In that regard, I may remind the honourable member that the letter which has been addressed to the Government of every State since I had the opportunity of meeting the Premiers in conference in Sydney, has requested from each as the most essential piece of information, a statement of the number of immigrants which each is prepared to absorb annually, and for whom they are prepared to find land. That information is necessary in order that we may know upon what scale the proposed efforts of the Commonwealth to put the circumstances of Australia before the people of the mother country, and to attract suitable settlers from there, shall be undertaken. With that knowledge to hand, I hope to be able to submit at a later period of the session-and probably in connection with the Estimates- a vote which shall be reasonable in amount, having regard to the work that is to be accomplished. It will not be, so to speak, a project in the air. VVe shall not be drawing a bow at a venture. The vote will - be proposed in accordance with the official representations of each State as to the number of people it desires, and the inducements which it is prepared to offer 1 them. When equipped with that data, we can judge how best we may endeavour to reach that"" section of the population of the mother country, which hives off year after year, to some other portion of the world, to whom we can safely say - takin g all conditions into consideration-that they will find better prospects in Australia than are now open to them, so far as I am aware, in any other part of the globe.",37
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Bette r in whaf're.spect?,38
279,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Bette r in respect of the opportunities which will be afforded them of making an honest livelihood and of founding permanent homes with less disabilities than are imposed upon them elsewhere.,38
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And with a better prospect of keeping those homes?,38
281,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I believe so. I believe that in Australia they will be absolutely secure, to a degree that is unknown in many other countries.",38
282,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Is it proposed to encourage the immigration of artisans ?,39
283,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Of course the development of agriculture will necessarily increase the opportunities for employment which are afforded in the towns, and there we can trust by means of industrial legislation to tempt other classes of workmen. An immigration policy, based upon official assurances, proceeding upon facts, and put fairly before the people of the old country, will, I hope, represent the initiation of a great movement. Taken in concert with those amendments of the land laws, and their administration, which it is a matter of public notoriety several States are considering, this ought to put us in a better position in the mother country than we have ever occupied before, both from the standpoint of attracting suitable immigrants, and of providing for them when they come hither. I quite recognise the necessity for proceeding with caution at the outset, because any blunder-an y set back at this time-woul d be liable to re-act upon us for a considerable period. The House has always recognised that any provision for the encouragement of agricultural immigrants can be neither primary nor exclusive-that we need to see first that those farmers' sons to whom the honourable member for Moira so aptly alluded are not shut out of their patrimony. But in this immense continent there is room and far more than room, for all the farmers' sons we have, and for all that we can attract If they do not obtain the best opportunities for commencing life in this new world, the fault will lie very much with its legislators. We are perfectly aware of the differences in climatic conditions, of the existence of unsuitable districts in which agriculturists would be unwisely planted, and of the burdens which would be imposed on them, if they were placed too far away from markets or from railways. Having a knowledge of these facts, we should be able to provide against our old mistakes in legislation. An endeavour is being made in some States to prevent past errors. With our experience of the past, and the knowledge that even what were previously deemed unfruitful parts, are capable of successful cultivation by means of modem appliances and methods, some of which are of comparatively recent discovery, we are in a position to embark in what I believe, will prove to be a successful competition for immigrants of the same blood as our fathers, of the race which has made Australia, Canada, and New Zealand what they are. There is, in the old land, no dearth of persons seeking new homes, and, in providing new homes for such persons, while we shall do a great deal for them, we shall do much more for the future of the Commonwealth. With that brief reference to the speeches of the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply, I come to the criticism of the leader of the Opposition. H is remarks on the Governor General's speech dealt mainly with an omission. The repatriation of the Kanakas now in Queensland 'has not escaped the attention of the Government, but the subject, as well as certain other topics, was not referred to in His Excellency's speech, because our programme appeared likely to grow to inordinate length. In point of fact, we have not heard any complaints about it on the score of its brevity. But the public have been kept very full y aware, through the press, of the steps which this Government has taken. Last year we opened communications with the Queensland Government, in order to inform ourselves of the actual number of Kanakas whom it would be necessary to repatriate. We have obtained from that Government, from time to time, rather meagre lists of those who appear to have, under the Act, the undoubted right to remain in Queensland, because they went there prior to a certain date, or engaged in certain vocations. here. But we have also sought to inform ourselves of those who may have what may be called reasonable moral claims to be allowed to remain, either because they have married white women, or because they have established themselves in such a way as to give them some claim to permanent residence. So far, we have only partially succeeded in obtaining that information. But a Commission appointed by the Government of Queensland to investigate the matter has been sitting for some time, and is required to report this month. It has proceeded from place to place in the sugar districts, inquiring into these questions, and endeavouring to ascertain how many Kanakas there are, what are their conditions, and what claims deserving of respect they may have to remain in the State. We have asked the Queensland Government to oblige us at the earliest moment-confidentially , if necessary, because, although the evidence has been taken in public, it has not yet been laid before the Queensland Parliament-wit h copies of the report and minutes of evidence, so that we may equip ourselves for action without the least delay. We are also in communication, through the High Commissioner of the West Pacific, with the British Resident in the Solomon Islands, and the British Resident in the New Hebrides, from whom we have asked the specific information what is proposed to be or can be done when repatriation commences in the groups over which they have charge. We have other information about these groups from unofficial sources, and we are aware that the Resident in the Solomons is particularly anxious to be able to receive and provide for that half of the Kanakas who have come from those islands. It is believed that fully one-half of the Kanakas in Queensland are Solomon Islanders. Hence there has been no neglect in this matter with which we are chargeable. The House will soon be made aware officially, by the laying on the table of the final replies giving the information desired of the steps which have been taken during some years past fo provide for the humane and considerate treatment of the Kanakas. The difficulties which appear to surround repatriation tend'., on examination to disappear rather than to increase. Partly because of the labour traffic, and partly for other causes, there has been a great depopulation in certain islands under civilized control, and no peril, will be run by any native landed there, whether he does or does not belong to one of the few remaining villages. We begin to see our 1 way, therefore, to deal not only with those who desire to return to their own villages and can do so, but also with others who do not wish to go back to their homes, for reasons personal to themselves or for other causes. We see our way, happily,, to make safer arrangements than at one time appeared likely when it was thought that the only choice lay between returning the Kanakas to their own villages and allowing them to remain in Australia. The leader of the Opposition, if he was not aware of these steps, had every right to ask for an explanation of what is being done; but reference was not made to the subject in His Excellency's speech, because it was not thought desirable to include all the subjects capable of being treated at present only in a tentative fashion. [3]",39
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who is going to undertake this repatriation ?,40
285,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The responsibility rests upon us, since the repatriation will take place under Commonwealth law; but also with the Queensland Government, under the legislation by which Kanakas were introduced into that State.",40
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen the statement of the Premier of Queensland, that he will take no steps in the matter.",40
287,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have seen in the press statements on this subject from all sources, but have heard nothing from the Premier of Queensland of that kind. The correspondence which has passed between us indicates no such determination on his part. Having thus disposed of the one criticism of the Governor General's speech offered by the leader of the Opposition, let me say a word jn respect to the parallel which he apparently intended to draw between the action taken by me in connection with the recent disturbances in Natal and that taken upon the motion dealing with Home Rule submitted by the honourable and learned member' for Northern Melbourne. There was no intervention of mine in either. As the papers have been laid on the table, it is not necessary for me to do more than refer to them; but, perhaps, I may remind those who have not read them that the terms of our cablegram to the British Government with reference to Natal were as follows:Since !in intervention of His Majesty's Ministers for the United Kingdom with the administration of the self-governing colony Natal would tend to establish, even with regard to prerogative of pardon, a dangerous precedent, affecting ail the States within the Empire, Your Excellency's advisers desire most respectfully appeal to His Majesty's Ministers for reconsideration of resolution at which they are reported to have arrived upon this matter. I do not think anything could be more carefully worded. The precedent about to be established! would have applied to us in the future as much as to Natal. Although, fortunately, the circumstances of this country do not render us liable to the particular peril which then threatened, and still threatens, the scattered settlers of N^ltal, where the white people form only a fraction of the population, yet, for all that, a precedent for intervention, once established, could, and probably would, have been applied to anv or all of the self-governing States of the Empire. Surely, then, it was well within our province to remind the Imperial Government that whatever action they might take in this particular connection might at any moment in other connexions most vitally affect us as one of the self-governing States. Beyond that reminder we did not go. We passed no opinion on the merits of the question, but thought that we were quite justified in asking the Imperial authorities to consider the full consequences of the precedent which was then threatened, but was not established. If in the slightest degree our cable contributed to the decision arrived at, I think we have every reason to congratulate ourselves upon its promptness. With regard to the Home Rule resolution, my position was exactly the same, as was made perfectly plain from the outset. The motion contained three paragraphs, to two of which, if I remember aright, I took exception. I strongly urged that the portion of the motion which appealed to His Majesty through his Ministers should be deleted', and that this House should content itself with following our own precedent in the representations made with regard to the employment of Chinese in South Africa, by merely recording its opinion, as members of another place had been invited to do. This would have avoided all appearance of intervention on our part. Having pressed' that strongly upon the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who was in charge of the motion, he, although still preferring to adhere to its original form, kindly agreed that the portions of the motion objected to should be withdrawn, and that the resolution should simply express the opinion of this House. The honourable and learned member was prevented from adopting that course, not by any action of mine or of other members on this side of the House, but by honourable members opposite, who, being altogether opposed to the motion, thought it better for their own purposes that it should be carried as originally proposed . Curiously enough, therefore, what1 ever responsibility exists for the appearance of interference from Australia because of the appeal to His Majesty rests upon the opponents of the resolution, and not upon me. „ Mr Wilks - The Minister stated that honourable members should express their opinion to the people of England.",40
288,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I stated that we should express our opinion, which it would be open to the people of England to make themselves acquainted with, but I objected to any official appeal being made to His Majesty. I thought that if we expressed our opinion, the people of England would accept it for what it was worth, and then act as they thought fit. This was no intervention at all.",41
289,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The Minister also said that we should express our opinion for the guidance of the people of England.,41
290,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I said that we could express our opinion in favour of a just scheme of Home Rule, and not in favour of any particular party scheme. We declared a principle without putting forward any cut-aind-dried political scheme. I believed then, and believe now, that a just scheme of Home Rule would contribute to the strength of the Empire, and was prepared to express my opinion to that effect.",41
291,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The Minister stated that he hacl no objection to personal expressions s of opinion outside, but thought it was undesirable that there should be any official expression of opinion from within.",41
292,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is immaterial now. So far as honourable members on this side of the House are concerned, the resolution would have merely expressed an opinion for the information of those at Home who cared to make themselves acquainted with it. It was owing to the amendments proposed by honourable members opposite that the resolution took the form of an address to His Majesty.",41
293,Mr REID,Unknown,Coul d not the Prime Minister have avoided voting for a motion to which he objected?,41
294,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I did not think that I should be justified in voting against the motion because it proposed to make an appeal to His Majesty. That did not warrant me in voting against a declaration in favour of a just scheme of Home Rule.,41
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In fact, the Prime Minister, regarded it as a small matter.",41
296,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No, * I did not; but, as the honourable member knows very well, in public life our choice is in most cases not between ""the course one would follow in every particular, but between, the only courses then open. We simply declared for justice. When it became a' matter of choice between voting for or against an expression of opinion in favour of a just scheme for Home Rule., not otherwise defined, though it was accompanied by what I regarded as an unwise and unnecessary petition to His Majesty, I preferred to vote for the just scheme. I could not honestly vote aigainst justice.",41
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Prime Minister might have brought down a motion of his own.,42
298,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I communicated to honourable members on this side of the House the amendments that I proposed to move, and received an intimation that they would be, supported; but the action taken by honourable members opposite prevented the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne from withdrawing the portions of his motion to which objection was taken.",42
299,Mr REID,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister think that, as a Parliament, we had authority to represent the people of Australia; in the matter? That was my main point.",42
300,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , that was the right: honourable gentleman's main point, ancl I told him, in reply, that, when challenged, we were fully entitled to express our opinion. The wisdom, or otherwise, of adopting that course is another question. As to our right, there can be no doubt. In the absence of all criticism upon our conduct during the recess-, even in the many matters mentioned in the Governor General's speech, I am obliged to refer to the criticism which has been directed to myself. The leader of the Opposition was goocl enough to quote from my assertions that the co-existence of three relatively equal parties in this House was detrimental to responsible government. I have said that often, and, if it will' satisfy the right honourable gentleman, will say it again. I have not altered that opinion, nor do I see any reason to alter it. We are carrying on constitutional government in this country-as we have been for the past three years-unde r the greatest disabilities, and while three relatively equa'1 parties exist these disabilities must continue. I do not think any one in this House, or out of it. has risked more than I have in endeavouring to bring about a legitimate solution of the problem. I am not concerned now with personal justification, if such were needed. Other opportunities for lhat have been presented, and will still be presented. I simply mention the fact that I have gone to the extreme length that I thought just a'nd fair in order to put an end to the three-party system, so far as it could be brought to an end, in order to pennit of constitutional government being effectively carried on. I am bound to ad[3]-2 mit, however, that, so far, I have by no means succeeded to the extent that I desired, But, even in the face; of the division of my pajrty, and against the desires of some of my oldest and best political friends, I was not afraid to take the course in 1904 which I thought would have led to a proper and reasonable arrangement of a working character. I clo not for one moment regret having sought - that which I think it was the duty of each one of us to seekthat is, to endeavour, as far as lay in our power, to modify existing party relations to the degree necessary to give us an united and distinct responsibility on the part of the majority in this House.",42
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Prime Minister has already said that he never intended that condition of things to last.,42
302,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,W h i c h condition of things ?,42
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The condition of things which the honourable and learned gentleman has just now suggested, the alliance in connection with which he took such risks in order to restore responsible government.",42
304,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I took the risks of entering into an alliance in the hope that by that means we should have a closer approach to responsible government. We have had constitutional goveniment and responsible (government of a kind. If there were thirty parties instead of three in the House, each independent of the other, we should have constitutional and responsible government, but it would not be consistently effective government as it ought to be in the interests of the people. In order to secure more effective government, I took that risk of alliance.",42
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable and learned gentleman has stated since that he took that course only to gain breathing time..,42
306,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That was stated in the agreement which was signed at the time. We kiKsw thai the alliance was made between two different parties who. on the fiscal question, were at absolutely opposite poles. Consequently we sunk ""the fiscal question for a fixed' and definite term in the hope that by the time it expired we might have arrived at some arrangement of a mutual character which would have enabled us without any breach of fiscal faith to continue to carry on. But that was only a hope, and it was always recognised that'if that hope failed, quite apart from our own choice, and by the very force of events, we must necessarilv resolve ourselves into our original parties. That was plainly foreseen, and expressly provided for.",42
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That was not what the honourable and learned gentleman said at all. He said something quite different.,43
308,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"What I have said is said, ancl remains on record. I only hope that when I am .quoted the whole of the context of my remarks will be quoted ir. each case.",43
309,Mr FULLER,Unknown,What have some of the honourable and learned gentleman's political friends on this side said about it?,43
310,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"They are as free to press their own opinions as I am to express mine. However deeply they dissent or have dissented from the view I have taken, so far as mv judgment on the matter is considered, I have dona right. I was and am bound to follow the course which commends itself to my judgment, irrespective of the criticism of friend or foe. What I was about to say was that, so far from having suddenly sprung; my objection ro three parties upon the House and the country, I proclaimed it directly it became necessary, and that was on the first occasion on which I addressed the public after the election at the close of 1903, when the three parties were returned in relatively equal numbers. It was when speaking at the Australian Natives Association's annual January celebration I first called attention in a pointed way, ancl with emphasis, to the existence of the ""three elevens,"" and the necessity for ending or mending their separate and conflicting feuds by a partial and temporary fusion ""in order that practical legislation and consistent administration might be secured. - Mr Reid - It had existed during the previous Parliament.",43
311,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In a much modified form, because we had taken some considerable time to settle down, because while the fiscal question was before us we were divided practically into two parties, and because the work of Federal organization in which we were engaged removed a number of questions from the immediate political arena, the consideration of which at the time would otherwise have divided us. A similar condition of affairs existed to a certain extent in the previous Parliament, but only in a. form which had been in existence in every State Parliament, and with which we were quite well acquainted. The situation only became impossible at the close of the elections in 1903. It was before Parliament met that I expressed what the right honourable member for East Sydney chooses to call my abnormal appetite for alliance. Given three relatively equal parties, how can you carry on the business of the country without either an alliance or an understanding between two out of the three parties? It was impossible. We tried it in this House, and, of course, our Government went down early in the life of the Parliament. I have never complained that it did go down, because if it had passed the particular difficulty by which it was then faced, sooner or later the other extwo parties would have united against us, and we should have gone out. There is no reason for complaint because we went out. The Labour Party then came into power.",43
312,Mr REID,Unknown,Is the statement that I quoted from the newspaper to the effect that the honourable and learned gentleman made some offer to the Labour Party to continue in office inaccurate?,43
313,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am coming to that. It says a great deal for the right honourable gentleman's lapses of memory to bring up as an entirely new accusation of his against me now what was made an accusation against me at the very time when I was in negotiation with him. I was then publicly reproached by members of the Labour Party, because I had been in communication with them after leaving office. I made public representations to the Labour Ministry that if they would consent to limit their measures for the session, or for a further time, to those which we were mutually agreed upon, and would consent to leave the rest of their programme in abeyance, I should be only too glad to keep them, or any other Ministry, in office, on the same terms.",43
314,Mr REID,Unknown,I never heard of that offer until now.,43
315,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I was attacked again and again, and had to defend myself in the right honourable gentleman's hearing in this House on thai very ground. The right honourable gentleman will find from Hansard that I was censured in and out of the House, not by his own friends, but by members of the Labour Party, who thought that, after making that offer, although it was not accepted, I should have given them a longer opportunity of showing what the future might enable them to do.",43
316,Mr REID,Unknown,"I knew that the honourable ancl learned gentleman had been in communication! with the Labour Party, but I did not know of any distinct offer.",44
317,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It was stated in the press at the time, and the resolution in reply carried by the caucus was published. My offer was made in the very town-halt speech from which the right honourable gentleman quoted today at a gathering at which the leader of the Labour Party, then Prime Minister, was present. an appeal to him to give the guarantees I have mentioned, and! pointed out the conditions on which he could secure a majority to support him. So far from being secret, the matter was proclaimed from the house tops. It was often mentioned here afterwards, and yet the leader of the Opposition comes down in this extraordinary fashion today as if he had made a remarkable discovery.",44
318,Mr REID,Unknown,The Vice-President of the Executive Council suggested that the newspaper from which I quoted forged that report. Hte said' that the statement appearing in the newspaper was manipulated; so he could not have known anything about it.,44
319,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The information appeared so often in the newspapers that it could not have escaped the attention of a single member of the House. I have no wish to go over the whole matter again in detail, but when the Labour Party came into power, they too tried the experiment of one party out of three relatively equal parties governing without an understanding with any other party. Finally, they arrived at an understanding with a portion of our party in order to maintain themselves in office; the very thing I had been pointing to as an absolute necessity if constitutional government were to be carried on. Then came the motion by which they were defeated. So far as I was concerned when I undertook to support the proposed amendment in the Arbitration Biil, as I said at the lime, and as I have repeated over and over again since, I had not the faintest suspicion that it would be made a vote of want of confidence. The Labour Ministry was bound to go out as our Government went out, and as anv Ministry formed from a single one of the three parties must go out. There was no question about that, but I have always regretted that the Labour Government left office so soon, as well as that they resigned on thatparticular topic. There were larger matters upon which it was inevitable that they must come into conflict with the other two parties in the House, and on which they would have .gone out, but with much less bitterness and on what I would have considered a more appropriate occasion. I was utterly irresponsible for the particular time and manner in which the Labour 'Government went out.",44
320,Mr REID,Unknown,Surely the honourable and I then made learned gentleman was not irresponsible?,44
321,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ves , because I had pledged myself to support that particular amendment in the Arbitration Bill when it had no party significance. It was not until days afterwards that the Ministry decided to regard it as a vote of want of confidence. When I agreed to support it , I had no idea that it would be made a Ministerial issue.",44
322,Mr REID,Unknown,"They were not defeated on a particular amendment, but on a motion to go into Committee to consider it, and the honourable and learned gentleman voted with us on that motion.",44
323,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Because we had already, in connection with the question of preference, agreed to conditions which I considered necessary, and naturally I did not consent to those conditions being altered. However, the Labour Government must have resigned, and it was only the choice of that or some other motion on which they should retire very shortly. I should 1I have preferred if they had left office on a broader question. It was again, an attempt by one of the three parties to govern the House without any alliance or understanding with either of the other parties, though eventually, they hacl an understanding with a portion only of our party. That is the position today. The right honourable member for East Sydney exults in comparing the numbers Ministers have with the numbers they ought to have. I would prefer the numbers we ought to have. I would much prefer to have a majority of our own party. No one denies that. But in the meantime, the King's Government must be carried on, and the business of the country must be transacted. So long as it is transacted in accordance with the programme and principles we submitted to the constituencies, we shall be only doing our dutyt to continue where we are. I recognise, however, that so soon as the right honourable gentleman comes to an arrangement with the other party our Government too must go out. Previous Governments have fallen in that way in this House, and our turn will come whenever the majority chooses. We have .no control over the Labour Party. offered them nothing save that which is embodied in our programme. undertaking with them with regard to the next elections. We have their general resolution, already published, to give us a support",44
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is not the Prime Minister's fault that there is no undertaking.,45
325,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"C e r t a in ly not; but - the fact. Here we stand, united with them in a general way on the business that is being done in this Parliament. Individual members are perfectly free",45
326,Mr REID,Unknown,Were portfolios offered members of the Labour Party ?,45
327,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Not that I remember.,45
328,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kennedy, according to statements in the press, has said that there was such an offer.",45
329,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not think that he did. If my memorv serves me rightly, the Labour Party's resolution, to have no alliance, was passed some months before. That put their acceptance of portfolios out of the question.",45
330,Mr REID,Unknown,Were they offered?,45
331,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As I have already said, I remember nothing of the kind. Such an offer would have been practically meaningless, and hence there could have been no communication on the subject of portfoJ.ios. The honourable member for Kennedy said, I believe, that had the Labour Party chosen, it could have secured portfolios. Of that there is no doubt. Had they cancelled their previous resolution, and agreed upon the terms on which they would unite with any other party, they certainly would have had an offer of portfolios from my right honourable friend, the leader of the Opposition, or from myself.",45
332,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable and learned gentleman should speak for himself.,45
333,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am speaking with due regard to our experience of the right honourable gentleman. Has he not told us that he could not have cariied any of the legislation he passed when Premier of New South Wa'&a except with the assistance of the Labour Party ?,45
334,Mr REID,Unknown,In one Parliament I had a ' majority independent of the Labour Party.,45
335,Mr WILKS,Unknown,They simply swelled the majority.,45
336,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is not the right honourable member's statement. We Mr Reid - In one Parliament I had a majority independent of the Labour Party, We have no and in another I had not.",45
337,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In a statement here in the State Hansard made at the close of his Ministerial career in State politics, the right honourable gentleman admitted that, but for the Labour Party, he could not have passed a single measure.",45
338,Mr REID,Unknown,"I quite agree that I could it is not have passed the biggest measures, and they were measures for which I had fought all my life.",45
339,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Were they not on his platform ?,45
340,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Labour Party in the State Parliament adopted part of his platform when they went to the country. When I stated a short time ago that those who looked for the support and assistance of the protectionists of this country must consent to meet the needs of our injured industries, by granting protection to them, the right honourable gentleman said I was offering an insult to both parties. Yet he offered precisely the same insult to the Labour Party in the Parliament of New South Wales when he .asked its protectionist members to sink their fiscal principle in order to help him to carry his land tax proposals.",45
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"He did not ask them to do anything, of the kind.",45
342,Mr REID,Unknown,I never asked them to do a single thing.,45
343,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have heard protectionists, who were at the time members of the Labour Party in the New South Wales Parliament, say again and again in this House that the reason they put aside protection for the time was to enable them to support the right honourable member for East Sydney's Government in carrying the land tax proposals.",45
344,Mr REID,Unknown,That is right.,45
345,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Therefore , according to the right honourable member, when he asked them to do that, he offered them an insult.",45
346,Mr REID,Unknown,I did not ask them to do anything.,45
347,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The right honourable member asked them to put aside their fiscal faith in order to achieve another of the objects they had before them.,45
348,Mr REID,Unknown,They were at liberty to d'o whatever they pleased. They could have voted against me just as well as for me.,46
349,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"And they can vote against me just as well as for me. The two positions are precisely the same. The Latour Party support this Government as long as they please-the y are free to determine for themselves how long that shall be - jus t as the Labour Party in the Parliament of New South Wales supported' the right honourable member for East Sydney. They thought that he was giving them legislation which they preferred to any other then possible. That is the. position of the Labour Party in this House, and as long as they hold it they are likely to support the present Administration. They are under no pledge to me or to any one else. When they think the leader of the Opposition can serve them better, they will give him the support that they gave him formerly. 'But I have been led aside by my ingenious friend, the honourable memtor for Dalley. I was speaking of the three-party systeni in this House. I have criticised it from the first, and clo not admire it now; but it is here, and we have to live with it. All that I have to say is that when the leader of the Opposition twits me, as he continually does on the platform, with consenting to do the business that we were returned to do with the help of a second party, and without a majoritv of our own, he points to the existence of a condition of things that I deplore, and would gladly avoid. At the same time, he does not remember, or chooses to forget, that there are worse evils than that of threeparty government. Our position would be indefensible if it involved the sacrifice of the principles on which we were returned, and that is what the right honourable member tried to wring from us when we attempted to work with him to displace the three-party system.",46
350,Mr REID,Unknown,That is not auite fair to me.,46
351,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If he had succeeded in going to the country as he propossd, without warning to his allies, who had placed him in office, kept him there and were prepared to keep him there, he would have caught the protectionists between the Lai jour Party on the one side and his own friends and supporters on the other so as to make Tariff reform impossible for years.",46
352,Mr REID,Unknown,Would the right honourable member for Balaclava have been a party to such a thing?,46
353,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The right honourable member freed the right honourable member for Balaclava and' his colleagues from such an imputation by stating in this House, in reply to me, that he took a personal, and not a Ministerial, responsibility for his course in postponing Tariff reform indefinitely.",46
354,Mr REID,Unknown,How could one help taking a personal responsibility?,46
355,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"f h e right honourable member, who expressly fread his colleagues from the imputation of responsibility, is now asking me to accept their acquiescence as warrant for something, the sole responsibility of which ha took upon his own shoulders.",46
356,Mr REID,Unknown,There was no division in the Cabinet on. the subject.,46
357,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Because , according to the right honourable member's own statement, the Cabinet was not consulted on this point. Although I cannot, for the moment, place my hand on the statement, I shall be able to give him chapter and verse for it within a few minutes. I was asked, by wav of interjection, I think, why I did not attack the right honourable member's protectionist colleagues, and replied that I understood he had already freed them from responsi1 bility in this' matter.",46
358,Mr REID,Unknown,What matter?,46
359,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The proposal that, bymeans of a surprise dissolution, the fiscal truce should be prolonged till 1909 or 1910. That was tha rock on which we split.",46
360,Mr REID,Unknown,"Does the honourable and learned gentleman think that a speech can to put in the mouth of the Governor General by one Minister without, consultation with his colleagues?",46
361,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No ; but I have been relying on the right honourable member's statement, and shall continue to rely on it until he reads it from Hansard, and deliberately withdraws it.",46
362,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,What was done in that connection was done by the unanimous voice of the whole Cabinet.,46
363,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member refers to the framing of the Governor General's speech at the opening of last session ?,46
364,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,Yes-the course proposed to be adopted.,46
365,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That course, so far as it affected the fiscal question, involved the burial of the Tariff Commission's reportsi f they were of a fiscal character-til l 1909, and the light honourable member for East Sydney, correctly or not, took upon his shoulders the whole responsibility.",46
366,Mr REID,Unknown,How could I speak of what was to happen in 1909-10?,47
367,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The right honourable member attempted to get a new Parliament elected on other issues, and' pledged to long the fiscal truce.",47
368,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Who , except the honourable and learned member, ever said that that course did involve the sinking of the issue till 1909-10?",47
369,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The leader of the position has said over and over again this House and on the platform that it did. to quit.,47
370,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,That is a point on which the protectionists in this corner feel much aggrieved.,47
371,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"They, must aggrieved! not with me, but with their own leader, who has made this statement and again.",47
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Where is it?,47
373,Mr REID,Unknown,"No ; I assure the honourable destroyed it was his own act. and learned gentleman that he is entirely wrong. The question of going to the counstill. try could not arise until a dissolution been granted, and we hadi not got as far as that.",47
374,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"He r e I have it . volume 25 of Hansard, page 413, I am reways ported to have said on the 1st August, 1905When the Prime MinisterThat is, the present leader of the Opposian tionsought to change the policy of fiscal peace May, 1906, into a policy of fiscal entombment until 1909, the situation was entirely changed.",47
375,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Did not his fiscal ailies in the Cabinet agree to that?,47
376,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am not aware.,47
377,Mr REID,Unknown,That was a personal declaration of my own. What did I say then ?,47
378,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"And as purely personal I have always treated it, for several reasons. Consequently, by that personal declaration of the right honourable member at once revived three parties in this House. He carried him his own fiscal party. But could we see fiscal question entombed until rgog? Did the right honourable member know that he could not expect to carry with him those protectionists who were supporting him ? Then the right honourable gentleman made this interjectionThey wanted the fiscal peace to last for three parliaments.",47
379,Mr REID,Unknown,I never got as far as a policy for the country.,47
380,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That quotation proves own my case. I say again that there are worse things than the three-party problem to consider. The immediately worse thing at that time was the burying of the fiscal question by the right honourable and learned gentleman until 1909, without consultation with prohis allies, without consultation with those with whom he was supposed to be working, without consultation with those to whom he had promised a full fiscal statement by 1 fiscal or before the J st May, J906.",47
381,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable and learned Opmember will see that he destroyed that in agreement at Ballarat by giving me notice,47
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The quotation does very not justify that statement at all.,47
383,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Let the honourable memfeel ber read it as I have done.,47
384,Mr REID,Unknown,When I got notice to quit again the agreement was destroved.,47
385,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No ' word of that speech departed from our agreement. What What I said then of his negative policy I say The right honourable gentleman had makes it a complaint that we have said that Socialism and anti-Socialism cannot be defined. As I pointed out to bim, In by way of interjection, what we have alsaid, is that his Socialism and anti-Socialism cannot be defined. There is one extreme point beyond which even Socialism cannot .go, ancl that is nationalization of industrial operation. Yet the right honourable"" gentleman, coming forward as an until avowed opponent of all Socialism, at the same, time approves the nationalization of our railways.",47
386,Mr REID,Unknown,"Oh , dear! Railways to spread private enterprise over Australia.",47
387,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I undertake to say that in Europe there is not a language in which the right honourable gentleman could make the declaration that he was an anti-Socialist, his, and couple it in the same breath with the statement that he was a supporter of the with nationalization of railways- I cannot go the into other enterprises in which we are ennot gaged, and which he also approves-with out his being ridiculed if he still claimed to be an anti-Socialist. I shall not allude to old-age pensions' or the lowering of railway rates.",47
388,Mr REID,Unknown,"All the statesmen who are dead, then, were Socialists.",47
389,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I shall not allude to the 101 matters in which the State, in Australia, intervenes when it thinks it is for the public good. Any one of them would destrov in Europe the claim of a man to be anti-Socialist who at the same time upheld those forms of State action. The member for East Sydney has no possible warrant for assuming that title as indicating his views. Whatever he may be or become, he is not yet an anti-Socialist.",47
390,Mr REID,Unknown,"What .is the Prime Minister's objective, I should like to know - the Labour Party ?",48
391,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable learned member for Parkes pointed that out.,48
392,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"No w , so far from having sheltered myself behind vague statements, I have been consistent from the first. When I went to Ballarat in 1904 to speak on the methods and organization of the Labour Party to the league which was then founded, and when I gave my friends in the corner the criticism which has been so often read Over to them since for their edification, the proposed resolution put into my hand included a condemnation of "" Socialism,"" I handed it back to the committee at once, and said, "" Unless that portion referring to Socialism is struck out I decline to move it. I am not here to criticise the platform of the Labour Party, whatever it may be called, but their methods and organization. Besides-, Socialism .is a. term so differently applied by different persons fhat it will mean nothing in the motion. Say, if you like, what proposals you object to, bub define them, and say exactly what youi support, but do not hide behind a label which is differently applied by almost every person who uses it . "" I struck out the reference to "" Socialism."" Was not that proof enough of where I stood?",48
393,Mr REID,Unknown,"Oh , oh ! Now the honourable and learned gentleman is a convert.",48
394,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman talks about my being a convert, if not to Socialism, at all events, to an association with Socialists. Here was a time when, as he has been reminding us, I was out of office-her e was a time when I was criticising the Labour Party, and, as he says, taking hold of every point I could to criticise, yet I refused to make any reference to Socialism, because it would have been wholly misleading or meaningless.",48
395,Mr REID,Unknown,The Inter-State Congress had not adopted Socialism at that time.,48
396,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes .,48
397,Mr REID,Unknown,No .,48
398,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Jus t as far as they have adopted it now. The next time. I spoke at Ballarat, a year ago, was just before the dissolution speech was put in the hands of the Governor General. At that time, still out of office, I repeated the same remark-that a criticism of Socialism or anti-Socialism was futile unless it was accompanied by a definition of what you included under the one and excluded under the other. I devoted and myself to a consideration of both sides, which occupies several pages of a reported speech, that is either in everybody's hand or can be easily acquired. I went through the rival programmes, and pointed out how far we were socialistic in this country, how far we ought not to be socialistic, and how far we ought not to be anti-socialistic; where we ought to draw the line between the two, how we ought to measure their advantages, and put both of them on a business basis. I pointed out that one question to be considered of each project was, "" Did it pay ?'' and that another question was, "" How did it fit in with the socialistic structure we have erected and are living in ?""",48
399,Mr REID,Unknown,What is the honourable and learned gentleman's opinion about that now ?,48
400,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I said then what I say now, that, using the terms strictly, in my opinion not 10 per cent, of the people of Australia would, on a scientific classification, having regard to our present systems of government, be called Socialists. I went on to say that, taking anti-Socialism as defined by the right honourable gentleman in his programme, I did not believe that 10 per cent, of the people of Australia would support that attitude.",48
401,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable and learned gentleman wiM be on a lovely fence before he is done with it.,48
402,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not wish to follow the right honourable member's precedents of that kind. I pointed out that 80 per d?nt. of the people of Australia looked at this question as the honourable member for Moira did yesterday - from a practical common-sense stand-point. They said, as the leader of the Opposition sometimes does, "" If this is a reasonable proposition, which will be good for the people of this country, not too costly, and reasonably effective, we are perfectly prepared to use it, brand it with whatever name you like, call it Socialism, anti-Socialism, or any other ism."" When the right honourable member was having a troubled existence in the Parliament vvhich he did lead, the only measure of his own that he did carry was programme. denounced as socialistic legislation by most thoughtful and careful students of the please. question in his own party. Consequently, when he was in power, he was under the taboo of his own followers, who were really anti-socialistic. the anti-Socialists.",48
403,Mr REID,Unknown,"Oh , no, I was not. I grand solid army in those days.",49
404,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In each Chamber his friends condemned his Bill as distinctly socialistic. How, then, when it suits him to take off one hat and put on another, can he consider that by changing his hat he changes the man underneath, it ?",49
405,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable and learned gentleman wears both hats.,49
406,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I wear neither.,49
407,Mr REID,Unknown,"Well , is the honourable and learned' gentleman a Socialist or an antiSocialist ?",49
408,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"E rom the E uropea n stand-point-fro m the stand-point of fiscal party with which the right honourable gentleman is allied in English polito if we would. tics, we are all Socialists in this country. From the stand-point of extreme Socialism, we are most of us dubbed anticall Socialists-it all depends on the point view. If you desire to judge our Governbogy ? ment today what are they to be judged on ? First of all on what they have done, and next on what they propose to do. Take record of last session and read it through. Pick out! our measures, and say which - socialistic and which arte anti-socialistic.

It will be found that neither name fits a single measure. are practical. Is the measure destruction of monopolies socialistic anti-socialistic? All depends on how proposed to destroy the monopolies, as the right honourable gentleman has saidThis shows that neither name can be fittingly applied to the measure.",49
409,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It depends on whether a measure is popular or not.,49
410,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"What I have said of this Bill applies to .every other item on the They are business proposals the for business purposes, call them what you The people of this country will neither accept them because they are called socialistic, nor reject them because they arc They will look at each measure on its merits. If they approve, had a fhey will accept it, call it what we will ; if they disapprove of a. measure, they will reject it, call it what we will. That is why I say that when tihe right honourable the leader of the Opposition, instead of criticising the programme of work-wit h the one single exception of one part of the anti-trust Bill-sweep s the whole of our measures aside, he gives his case away. He admits that, so far as our programme is concerned, his cry does not fit. He therefore attempts to distract attention from our programme, and to put a false issue before us in regard to some "" is m "" or abstract idea-no t an issue connected with the concrete business we are here to consider' and the do, but some abstract theory we are not here to consider, and could not give effect",49

412,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I ask him what he calls the beacon, light ancl objective of the the items embodied in our programme? I ask him are they, or arei they not, justified on are their merits?- The fact that other proposals are in the Labour Partv's programme antidoes not disqualify them or relieve him to from examination and criticism.",49

414,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable and learned He says that - tak e all that is required is regulation. Take today's Mr DEAKIN - Exactly . The Bill we have before us for the preservation of industries will incidentally be sufficient to deal with that monopoly. I preA l l the Bills viously digressed in response to interjecfor the tions when making some remarks on or the fiscal situation, to which I am now it is obliged to call attention for a moment or two before sitting down. But I must relieve myself from one imputation, though I do not attempt to do so in regard to many others, because that has been already done sufficiently. I must relieve myself from a new imputation, so far as I am concerned, with which the right honourable the leader of the Opposition has been good enough to favour me. The right honourable gentleman complains that at the time he was appointing the Tariff Commission, I did not warn him of the serious consequences likely to ensue to the Government because of that Commission. Why should I attempt to warn the right honourable gentleman of what he himself warned the House in. stronger language than I should have liked to use? Speaking on the 26th October, 1904, and looking forward to the Tariff Commission",49
415,Mr REID,Unknown,That was long after the Royal Commission liad been resolved on.,50
416,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No ; it was not long after it had been resolved on. appointed for months after.,50
417,Mr REID,Unknown,"Were my remarks not made on Supply, when the honourable and learned member for. Indi submitted a motion ? That was long after the Commission had - been resolved on.",50
418,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It was on the Budget, and the honourable and learned member for Indi moved by wav of amendment that, the pronosed vote be reduced by is. On that motion the right honourable the leader of the Opposition himself said If either wing of the Government finds that a difficulty has arisen uncler which the loyal protectionists and the loyal free-traders find it impossible to continue togetlier on the present basis, I think I can say for my protectionist colleagues, as well as for my free-trade colleagues, that from that moment we part company. Then a little lower down the right honourable gentleman saidThat is the basis on wh'ich the Government rests. The moment that lhat basis becomes impossible, the existence of the Government becomes impossible. So it will be seen that the right honourable gentleman at the time when the appointment of the Tariff Commission had just been resolved on. saw the whole situation so clearlv as to say that when the reports of the Commission, came down, if the>- raised the fiscal issue, they would divide the then Government, and make its existence impossible. The reports might separate the protectionists on the one side from the free traders on the other.",50
419,Mr REID,Unknown,"I did not say that the Tariff Commission's reports would do so, but "" if they do so."" That was looking two years ahead.",50
420,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Exactly , and we were looking two years ahead then, and still looking eighteen months ahead when, I spoke at Ballarat, though the right honourable gentleman then declined to wait a moment longer. _ But he saw at the time when this Tariff Commission was granted that its reports might sever his own Government; and when he complains that I did not warn him, I have only to remind him of what he himself warned' the House. On this question of fiscal peace I re-echo the statement made by the honourable member for Moira yesterday in regard to the position of our party- a statement which I was glad to hear from his lips, though it was made without my cognizance of his intention to make it ; we had not discussed the question together. The protectionists who went It was not to the country in 1903 on the programme of fiscal peace and preferential trade, tied their hands, in my opinion, against the .bringing down, of a complete revision of a Tariff such as we intimated must follow sooner or Jater. We said that when a truce was first proposed. Experience required to be gained, and would be gained; the investigation of the Tariff was to gradually test its fitness or unfitness for Australia. When that had been, done, we stated that we should be prepared to reopen the fiscal question, but until then, our programme was fiscal peace, except as to preferential trade. After that the risrht honourable leader of the Opposition appointed a Roval Commission to investigate the Tariff, a step of which we had long foreseen the necessity, but which he took, as he has told us to-dav, entirely of his own motion, ancl with the full approbation of his own judgment. When that Tariff Commission was appointed he foresaw, as the Quotation I have read shows, what the consequences might be in his own Cabinet.",50
421,Mr REID,Unknown,"Hear , hear !",50
422,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"And , of course, he foresaw what the consequences might be in the House as well as in his Cabinet. If a report were ±0 come from the Tariff Commission in which the fiscal question was raised, honourable members would have no other choice except to range themselves uncler the standards! to which they belonged. We are not yet confronted by that situation. The proposals which have been submitted by the Tariff - Commission so far have been unanimous)v endorsed. Although it might be said that those proposals do raise the fiscal question, evidently it is felt they do not raise it in any such form as to accentuate the differences between us, so that those particular proposals can be dealt with apart from the fiscal issue. The other recommendations which follow may be of the same tenor, ancl in that event the fiscal issue will not be raised, and' members will vote on merely financial or some similar grounds. let the Tariff Commission bring clown a proposal which involves the fiscal issue, either for a reduction of duties which we believe to be necessary for Australian industries, or for an increase which we believe to be unnecessary, and at once our fiscal peace and fiscal truce disappear. No protectionists can vote for an anti-protectionist proposal, and no free-trader, if there be one in this House, can vote for an antifree-trade proposal in connection with an amendment of the Tariff.",50
423,Mr REID,Unknown,"They would not vote upon any report of a Commission, but on some proposal submitted by a Government.",51
424,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"They would vote, it is true, on proposals submitted by a Government, but the hand of the Government would be forced by any recommendations from the Tariff Commission which involved the fiscal issue. The Government is not a post-office simply to convey to this House the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. When the Commission wab proposed to be appointed, and I was challenged as to our position, and the responsibilities we should have towards its recommendations, as it w.as the work of our own hands, I pointed out that, like every other Commission, it would sift the evidence to the best of its ability, and would forward its recommendations to Government and Parliament; and that Government and Parliament would then deal with those recommendations in accordance with their principles and their judgment. Now, that will be the course which will be followed!, when this Tariff Commission, or part of this Tariff Commission, makes any recommendations involving the fiscal issue. It will be impossible for this House, or any House, or any Government, to put aside the recommendations of such a Commission without those recommendations hawing been considered and deliberated upon. We can neither adopt nor can we set aside the proposals of that Commission without giving them the full and careful consideration which the length and importance of their inquiry demands. Whether it advises a higher duty or a lower duty, the Government and the House must decide for itself in accordance with their principles. They cannot evade or avoid that duty now that we have gone so far, and they have done so much. Now, sir, one word in conclusion.",51
425,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What about the But land tax?,51
426,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not mind responding to that interjection. Neither our programme nor our administration have been assailed. Such a tax is not put forward in the Governor General's speech, but I have no wish to refuse its consideration. It suited the right honourable the leader of the Opposition to make it appear that the* interest that has been taken by mvself ancl others in the land question since the accomplishment of Federation had only arisen during the past few months, since the honourable member for Bland definitely launched his proposal for a progressive land tax. I can safely say that, for my own part, I have, been dealing, so far aS opportunities permitted, with the land question ever since Federation, as I did before. The only way in which I can fix the day to which I am about to refer is by saying that I think Mr Irvine was still Premier of Victoria. The Australian Natives' Association called a meeting in the Athenaeum H all , Melbourne- I think it was in the year 1903-for the purpose of considering irrigation; and, as much turned upon the land question, I took occasion then, as I have done since, to excuse myself from any comment upon the land taxes passed, by the States in Australia. I surmounted the difficulty, as I have done since, by turning up some of the old speeches delivered by me in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, which contained mv views upon land taxation, land monopoly, alnd land generally, reading these extracts out as my then opinions^-the opinions which I still hold. That was, as I say, probably three vears ago.",51
427,Mr REID,Unknown,Were those opinions in favour of a. progressive land tax ?,51
428,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,They included a progressive lalnd tax.,51
429,Mr REID,Unknown,The Prime Minister's views include that?,51
430,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"My personal views always have done. I read those extracts to show that, although an Australian Minister and member, I had not altered the attitude which I had previously occupied in Victoria upon this question. Before the subject came up again, the consideration of the possibilities of immigration had brought me face to face, in a very clear and distinct1 manner, with the urgency of dealing with our great estaltes of arable The honourable member for yesterday gave illustrations from his own experience relating both to this State and New South Wales, of the cases of hard working men-in one instance which he mentioned, the case of a man with money and experience-seekin g land from State to State, and unable to find i.t. It is incontestable that such a state of things exists in several States. It is incontestable that, while that condition remains, it will be idle for us to be offering to emigrants, or would be emigrants, from the mother country, temptations to come here with such illustrations of the failure of men who know the country, and who can choose their land with wisdom, to find homes for .themselves. Confronted with this additional responsibility with regard to immigration I have, in correspondence with State Premiers and elsewhere, taken every opportunity legitimately open to me of pressing upon their attention, and upon public attention, the necessity of making much more land available. Because, whether we are Federal or State representatives, there are many of us who recognise that the land question is the root of almost' all other social and political questions.",51
431,Mr REID,Unknown,The only question is in whose jurisdiction it is.,52
432,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Until the land question is settled, no question can be settled finally.",52
433,Mr REID,Unknown,"But can we settle it for the States ? Mir. DEAKIN - The States, or some of them, have been applying themselves to its solution with very imperfect success; and with the States still rests the responsibility of dealing with it. They are the proprietors of Crown lands, and we are not, as a Commonwealth; though as citizens of States, we are, of course, charged in our individual States with responsibility for what is done. But what we do say-wha t I do say, at all events-is that, land tax or no land tax, every form of Government which Australia possesses, from the municipalities up to the Commonwealth Government, is properly usable by the Australian people in the endeavour to settle this country. And I sav, sir, without criticising State legislation, State action or State inaction, that it is perfectly within the competence of the Commonwealth to enter upon and take its share in dealing with this land question when its legitimate occasion arrives. When we begin to deal with immigration, we begin to deal with the land land. question. The two are so closely associated Moira that we cannot but turn from one to the. other. What I said at Ballarat-of which the right honourable member chose to read only one portion-wa s that I intended in the following week to deal with this land question at length in Adelaide; that, owing to the length of the speech, and physical exhaustion, I was not prepared to deal with it full y then, 'and that, therefore, I answered a few of the questions put to me out of courtesy.",52
434,Mr REID,Unknown,The questioner stuck to the honourable gentleman like a man.,52
435,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"And my answers were in conformity with the answers previously and since given by me on this question. I said that I would deal with it at Adelaide within a week; and at Adelaide within a week I did deal with it at length-again , to the extent of two or three pages of my printed speech. So that just as with the question of Socialism and Anti-Socialism, I made my position perfectly clear in South Australia. I showed the other Federal issues with which it is and must be associated. Between my meeting in Adelaide and the meeting which was held in Sydney, the Premiers' Conference took place. The Premiers, at that Conference, despite the very friendly argument which I addressed to them, chose to carry two important resolutions. I pointed out that if those two resolutions were to be accepted by the people of Australia, land taxation, instead of being a theoretical proposal, would become a practical proposal forced into the arena by the declaration of the Premiers that old-age pensions would require to be provided for out of some fresh source of taxation.",52
436,Mr REID,Unknown,They deny that.,52
437,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"They do not deny it . One Premier said that ha was willing to make certain Customs concessions, which were mentioned at the Conference. I invited an expression of opinion upon the subject, and pointed out the importance of such an expression of opinion, stating that if we had the assurance that the Premiers would consent that part of the Customs revenue should be used for old-age pensions, that would relieve the pressure upon us, but that if we did not obtain more of the Customs revenue, they were in effect bidding us to resort to direct taxation. They discussed the question amongst themselves, and refused to put on record any resolution consenting to our taking any further portion of the Customs revenue. Therefore, I was bound to point out-owin g to this development having taken place after I spoke at Adelaide, and at Ballarat-that , as I had shown at Ballarat, the land question was intimately associated with Federal finance, and with the question of immigration. position is indisputable.",52
438,Mr REID,Unknown,Then are we to have three taxes upon land ?,53
439,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is for the citizens of Australia to determine whether they will have one. three, or thirteen taxes upon it.",53
440,Mr REID,Unknown,Why not have a tax upon the banking incomes that people make out of land-o n the mortgagees as well as the mortgagors ?,53
441,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"1 pointed out that it was perfectly within the competence of this Parliament to deal with all forms of direct taxation, and that no form of direct taxation was likely to afford it the same opportunities of dealing with settlement and immigration as land taxation. making that statement. I committed no colleague of mine, nor the Ministry, because, so far, the Government has not considered either land taxation or several other alternatives in connection with the land question, which may come before the consideration of this Parliament before long.",53
442,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Are we to understand that the Prime Minister himself is in favour of a progressive land tax ?,53
443,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have said that when I had the responsibility of dealing with land taxation in the Victorian Parliament I favoured the taxation of unimproved land values on the progressive principle. have not altered my opinion since then, but speaking either individually, or as the head of this Government, I make no promise of Federal land taxation. My colleagues have yet to consider not merelv land taxation, but whether the land question does not call for consideration at our hands in connection with other proposals which may accomplish the same end .1",53
444,Mr REID,Unknown,Somebody will go up in a balloon when the Government do consider it in Cabinet.,53
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It has taken Prime Minister half-an-hour to say nothing.,53
446,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am sorry that my honourable friend, who was a Minister of the Crown in New South Wales for a considerable period, cannot realise that in this instance, as in many others, each Minister owes an obligation to his colleagues. I will not place any of my colleagues or supporters in a false position by declarations which, at present, are merely abstract and theoretical. When the Government entertains any intentions in this regard, they will submit a concrete proposiThat tion, which the honourable member will be unable to make sport of in this way. In the meantime, the Government have not considered the tax, and its prospects are matters of speculation, and not of fact.",53
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Treasurer has already expressed a personal view. Mr ' DEAKIN - The Treasurer has expressed a personal view upon one form of land taxation for a particular purpose- a view which he is perfectly entitled to hold.,53
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is all that we desire to obtain from the Prime Minister.,53
449,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable member wished to obtain from me either more or less than that. The question of immigration will bring us face'to face with the land But in question, whether we like it or not, within a comparatively short space of time, and both members and Ministers will be obliged to consider them with an open mind. Nothing in my past or present opinion supplies any obstacle to our dealing with both fully and effectively. The Federal power is ample, though many have not yet realized its scope in these directions. Beyond that I decline to be drawn at the present stage.",53
450,Mr REID,Unknown,Why is the Prime Minister so sensitive about Lhe inclusion of the Railway servants in the Arbitration Bill being a violation of the Constitution and so indifferent about State rights in regard to I land taxation ?,53
451,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When the time comes, if any land taxation proposals are submitted, I shall be able to show the right honourable member a broad distinction. I cannot show him a distinction between something which exists and' something which does not now exist. I should have concluded my remarks half-an-hour ago had I been permitted to follow mv own line of thought. What I desire to say is that the Government have submitted a programme, which so far has not been challenged. the It consists of practical proposals of pressing importance, which are capable of being dealt with. With due respect to the honourable member for Barker, I say that all of these proposals are capable of being dealt with this session if we could persuade ourselves to deal with them as on business grounds. I am sorry that I have spoken for an hour-and-a-haJf. under able member himself. pressure, because I wished an example which might be followed. But, having disposed of the personal, best of it. the abstract, and the remote, I ask honourable members to coma back to the business that is actually before us. vite them to establish a record by making the debate upon the Address-in-Reply the business, to enable briefest thathas yet taken place.",53
452,Mr REID,Unknown,Notwithstandin g that vernor-General's speech contains 36 paraas graphs.,54
453,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"But the greater portion of that speech relates to proposals which will come before us in a direct form, and can be much better debated when we have specific propositions submitted. They then be dealt with, point by point.' statement by statement. Criticism of administration during the .recess we are course open to. although we have had none yet. But r do hope that we shall not to discuss in open debate what we must, ble soon debate in Bills. With the assistance honourable members there is no reason why we should not dispose of the whole of the business that has been outlined by the vernment in time for a reasonable dissoluwe tion. The Ministry are anxious be as considerate as possible to every orable member. But we ought to realise that this is the last session of the present even wailing for authority, w have pushed Parliament, and to recognise that beahead, fore we go to the country, we have a sible great deal of work to dispose of, some it of enormous importance, and all of it great practical utility. I feel sure that I shall aiot appeal to honourable members in vain. I clo not ask them to weaken their criticism of the Government, but to shorten it, so as to enable us in the briefest possible time to get over a stage which, except now. for the opportunity it presents of criticising our deeds during the recess, is reallybecoming a useless survival.",54
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Our trouble we cannot understand the honourable gentleman.,54
455,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If the honourable mempromulgated, ber will afford us the 'chance of dealing with our definite proposals he will begin to understand me little by little.",54

466,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"In conclusion, let me repeat a few words uttered at the rising of the House last year, as an indication of the course and the policy which we had mapped out for ourselves. The speech of the Governor General affords proof of our sincerity and earnestness in giving it effect. I then saidThe next election, so far as this Ministry is concerned, will be fought in defence of Australian interests, in the interests of the producers, workers, and consumers, for whose benefit our recent measure-the Anti-Trust Bill-wa s framed. To protect them against unfair competition, against fraud, against the competition of underpaid and overtasked workmen, Will be the aim of this Government. Speaking as far as it can be outlined, the programme will be protection in all its aspects, fiscal, industrial, and against all monopolies; preferential trade with our own countrymen, population for the land, and land for the people.",55
467,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [3-34-1-- I tened with a great deal of interest to the speech of the Prime Minister, and I often envy him the g if t of that graceful, elegance of diction and flowery language which holds the interested attention, yet conveys no intelligible meaning to the listener. Honourable members, 1 think, are most anxious for enlightenment upon the attitude of the honourable and learned gentleman and that of his Government in regard to the proposal for a progressive land tax; but he has fenced the question so adroitly that he has left the House in considerable doubt as to his real position, and has provided himself with a 'number of avenues of escape from possible awkward questioning in the future. Although it is necessary that we should know his exact position in this matter, we are as much in the dark in regard to it now as we were before he rose to speak. It has been not inaptly said of the Governor General s speech that, whereas that of last session was the shortest on record, for perhaps one of the longest sessions we have hacl, this is the longest speech for what will probably be one of the shortest of our sessions. The mover of the Addressin-Reply practically censured the Government when, at the commencement of his remarks, he declared that the speech contains a number of proposals which cannot be submitted to the House, and carried into effect during the present session. hold the opinion that, seeing that in the present position of parties, even a semblance of responsible government i's impossible, we should confine our efforts this session to absolutely necessary legislation only, and should deal first of all with the proposed redistribution of seats, so as to get an early appeal to the electors, and the return of a House which will more closely represent the opinions of the country. At the present time, this House misrepresents the country, because the electors have not had an opportunity to express their opinions on some of the most vital matters proposed for the consideration of Parliament.",55
468,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member should be content to speak for himself. He may misrepresent the country.,55
469,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I may fairly claim to represent my own constituency, because I was returned by an absolute majority of votes, but a great many members, especially in the Labour corner, represent only minorities.",55
470,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There are more minority l is - representatives on the Opposition side of the chamber.,55
471,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"We should not permit for any longer than is unavoidable, the continuance of arrangements which, under a pretence of an adult franchise, give - people in one electorate three times the voting power of those who live in another electorate. Such a state of affairs is a disgrace to us as a Parliament which should not be tolerated for a moment longer than is necessary. Therefore, if the Government really believe in the principle of equal representationof one man one vote, which is supposed to be so dear to a certain section of honourable members-the y should lose not a moment in bringing about a redistribution of seats, and in immediately remitting to the country for decision all those questions of national importance with which it is proposed to deal. An appeal should be made 1 to the electors as soon as the rolls can be prepared, and I would strongly urge that it should take place not later than October next. If this course were adopted, an opportunity would be afforded to residents in the rural districts to record their votes. When an election takes place in the middle of December, the harvest is at its height, and thousands of men in the country districts cannot leave their occupations to attend the polling booths, because their I absence from their holdings at such a time might result in very heavy loss, if not ruin.",55
472,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Would the honourable member disfranchise thousands of others for the sake of those whom he mentions ?,55
473,Mr REITI,Unknown,Canno t they vote by post?,55
474,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,No . The farmers' men can better vote by post.,56
475,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am not wedded to any particular month for the holding of the elections, but I am anxious to bring about an appeal to the country at a time that would be most convenient for the electors generally.",56
476,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Hear , hear; say next March.",56
477,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The present Parliament must be brought to an end not later than December, i i the honourable member for Bland could suggest any means by which the elections could be put off until March, no doubt his suggestion would meet with ready endorsement by. a number of members. We know, however, that no such delay could take place without an amendment of the Constitution. If the elections are held in December thousands of voters will be disfranchised, and the new Parliament will be composed of members elected in many instances by minorities. That is what I want to avoid. It should be the desire of all parties to obtain a straight-out verdict upon the main issues submitted to the electors, so that we might have a majority upon one side or the other, irrespective of the interests of parties. It is only by means of such representation that we can arrive at the will of the majority, and if any honourable member can suggest a more suitable time than I have mentioned I shall be only too ready to fall in with his ideas. I am anxious that we should have removed from us the reproach that we cannot induce a majority of the electors to record their votes. How can we do so if the election is held at such a time that they cannot go to the poll? Whilst the re-adjustment of seats is the first matter that we should take in hand during this session, there are two other important questions to which we might address ourselves, namely, the settlement of the Federal Capital Site, and Federal, quarantine. The three matters to which I have referred are the only urgent Questions with which we are called upon to deal, apart, of course, from the granting of supply necessary to cover the period between the dismissal of this Parliament and the meeting of the next. None of these matters need involve anv party strife. Prime Minister has given no clear indication of his intentions with regard to the proposals of the Labour Partv. Apparentlv he is approaching nearer and nearer to their [4} platform. Some little time ago he stated mat the question of land taxation was one entirely within the province of the States, and he declined to recognise that the Federal Parliament had anything to do with it. In the course of his next public deliverance he modified his previous attitude, and, finally, he coquetted with the proposal of the Labour Party for a progressive land tax. His latest utterance on the subject of land taxation is sadly out of tune with his declarations of a short month ago, and he appears now to regard it as, not only advisable, but obligatory upon this Parliament to deal with the question. These three separate declarations have been made within the short space of one month, and show that the Prime Minister possesses a wonderful faculty for climbing down. His utterances of today cannot be taken to represent his opinions for tomorrow, and his' convictions of tomorrow can by no means be relied upon to hold good for the day after. However much we may admire the personal qualities of the Prime Minister, we cannot escape the conclusion that he is a difficult kind of opponent to dea'l with. He is as slippery as an eel, and exceedingly difficult to handle, because it is impossible to pin him down to any one set of opinions, or any particular line of policy. ' At present his great anxiety is to raise the fiscal issue, and yet at the last election he told the country that the time had arrived when fiscal strife should be ended. The Minister for Tradle and Customs also declared that the fiscal issue was dead-that it was settled for all time; and yet he is .now joining with the Prime Minister in declaring that fiscal warfare must again be entered upon. I wish to quote the statement made by the Prime Minister upon this subject at the opening session of this Parliament. He said- If we commence with the acceptance of the fact that the fiscal issue is dead, the way is open for dealing with the practical problems before us with a much freer hand than we have hitherto possessed. Up to the present, considerations foreign to these problems have weighed upon our minds, and have occasionally deflected our views in spite of ourselves. The fiscal 'issue being put aside, we are free lo look these questions straight in the face. In view of that declaration, we are The entitled to ask the honourable and learned gentleman what has brought about this wonderful change in his opinions during so short a period. We can further recollect that when he joined an alliance with the right honourable member for East Sydney, at the time the Reid-MCLean Ministry was formed, he still held the view that the urgent need of the country was fiscal peace. Two of his present colleagues, the honourable members for Hume and Indi, at that time broke away from him, and sat in. opposition on the cross benches, and declared for fiscal war, whilst the honourable and learned gentleman was himself sitting behind a Ministry that was carrying out his own policy of fiscal peace. These honourable gentlemen were at each other's throats at that time, and we now find them sitting together on the Treasury bench in perfect amity, all pledged to fiscal war when they had previously declared that the most urgent need of the country was fiscal peace. This is a most peculiar position for us to face, and it leaves us in doubt all the time as to what is, the actual attitude of the Prime Minister on all these questions. have no guarantee that between this and the general election he may not make some other somersault, and once more declare that he is .done with fiscal strife for ever. Touching the position of the Government in relation to the Labour Party, we are faced with another peculiar set of circumstances. After the Prime Minister's declaration in favour of fiscal war, the protectionist manufacturers of Victoria approached Federal Labour Party with a proposal for an alliance between the protectionists and the Labour Party, on the basis of mutual concessions. That probably was in view of the Prime Minister's declaration in favour of high protection. What was the (result of that conference? The Labour Party refused to have anything to do with such an alliance, and the Prime Minister was, in consequence, left practically out in the col.d. Why ha should seek to continue in alliance with a party that repudiates and insults him on every conceivable occasion is more than I can understand. I am unable to understand how any man having a spark of proper feeling can continue to hold office in such humiliating circumstances as those in which the present Prime Minister and his colleagues hold office. Let me show what the official organ of the Labour Party in Queensland says about the Prime Minister. I quote from a leading article in the Brisbane Worker, headed, "" The Perfidious Deakin ""Laugh and jeer as we may at G. H. Reid, what can we wisli him worse than the partnership ing what follows. Mr Johnson. of Alfre d Deakin? He built his little house upon the faith of Deakin ; had he read his Encylofcedia Britannica more closely, he might have been forewarned by the parable of the house built upon sand. Deakin is all sand-san d without grit, quick-sand. Woe betide the political wayfarer who ventures his feet that way -' There is no foothold in Deakin. He is true to nobody, not even to himself. That is the way in which the organ of the Labour Party in Queensland describes the present ally of the leader of the Labour Party.",56
478,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Will the honourable member read what they sa;d about the right honourable member for East Sydney ?,57
479,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I have already read that what they said was that the worse they could wish him was an alliance with the present Prime Minister.,57
480,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They said more than that.,57
481,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I am not concerned We so much with that at the present time.,57
482,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member should read what they said about his alliance with the honourable member for Lang.,57
483,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am not concerned about something which never existed, and I do not think I ever insulted the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, either as a friend or an, opponent, but the difference, so far as the leader of the the Opposition is concerned, is that the right honourable member for East Sydney is not in alliance with, nor has he anv understanding with, the Labour Party. They are not working together, and are not' pulling the same coach in double, harness, as is the Prime Minister's case, and, therefore, anything which the Brisbane Worker may have said in regard to the right honourable member for East Sydney has no application to existing circumstances. The article to which I have referred goes on to sayLook what has happened. During the crisis that preceded the downfall of the Watson Ministry, Deakin was at one and the same time in secret negotiation with both Reid and Watson ! So tittle was he concerned about the politica 1 principles at issue, that he could not make up his mind which side to join ! . . . The attitude which the honourable and learned gentleman then assumed is practically his attitude today. He is holding out one hand to the leader of the Opposition and the other to the leader of the Labour Party. I will not wound the honourable and learned gentleman's feelings by quotI do not think that he knows even at the present moment what the ultimate result will be, or where he will ultimately find himself. He has openly favoured the idea of an alliance with either party. A Prime Minister holding opinions so elastic may lincl them convenient to himself, but they are very embarrassing to everybody else, including, 1 suppose, his allies. I wish to say a few words about the speeches delivered yesterday by the honourable members for Barker and Moira. The honourable member for Barker, in referring to the item in the Governor General's speech about the acquisition of the Northern Territory, endorsed the idea that it should be acquired by the Commonwealth. I also, with some qualifications, endorse that idea. I think it advisable that, as a Commonwealth, we should acquire as much territory as we possibly can, in view of the future development of Australia in connection with immigration, the increase of population, and the development of rural industries. I have suggested, and I now repeat the suggestion, that if any scheme is approved of by this Parliament, by which this Territory can be taken over by the Commonwealth, it should be handed over to the Socialists; they should be at liberty to take full control of it, and experiment with their theories in a land absolutely free from all the trammels of civilization as we know it .",57
484,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that it would be a good place in which to plant the single tax doctrine?,58
485,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"1 do, and if the Commonwealth will hand the Territory over to ine I shall undertake the administration of it on those lines, with a promise, I believe, of far greater success than is likely to actxanpany any experiments on socialistic lines, to which the single tax idea is entirely opposed.",58
486,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Le t the anarchists, like the honourable member, go there.",58
487,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is a stale and oft-repeated joke of the honourable member, which has no application whatever to me or mv principles. The administration of the Territory, under my plan, would be carried out on lines of individual freedom 10 the fullest possible extent, consistent with the equal freedom of everybody else. In the course of his speech, the honourable member for Moira referred to the first paragraph of the Governor General's speech and the reference to the general prosperity of Australia at the present time. He chided the anti-Socialist, for having declared thai Socialism would ruin the country ind bring about stagnation, and so - forth, and, inferentially, associated the progress and prosperity which has marked Australia during the last few months with the socialistic legislation which has been carried by the Commonwealth Parliament, liverybody knows perfectly well that the prosperity we have enjoyed is due, not to any legislation enacted by the Federal or States Parliaments, but to the good seasons which have occurred all over Australia. I clo not think that any Parliament of the States or the Commonwealth Parliament can take any credit to itself for bringing about these conditions. Those conditions have been brought about in spite of legislation passed by these Parliaments. Mr Webster;-Is not the honourable member aware that Mr Carruthers takes credit for all the good that has happened to New South Wales.",58
488,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do not know that he does, but even in that event I should speak as I bave done. As it is now 4 o'clock, I should be glad to bave leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion.",58
489,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,What further time is the honourable member likelv to occupy ?,58
490,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,At least another halfhour.,58
491,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have no objection. Leave granted ; debate adjourned. House ndjo-irnec] at 4.3 p.m.,58
