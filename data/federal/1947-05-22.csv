2,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture is doubtless aware that farmers are being greatly handicapped in their production hy the prevailing shortage of tractors. Can the honourable gentleman indicate whether there are any prospects of an improvement of the position in the near future, and how soon can it be anticipated that Australian tractors will he produced in helpful numbers?  to industrial disturbances overseas, the number of tractors arriving in Australia is not nearly sufficient to supply tbt great demand for them. Keports received from overseas indicate that the quota for Australia for 1948 will be substantial. ""Within a period of twelve months locally made tractors will be coming on to the Australian market in fairly substantial numbers. Shortage of tractors, I know, is a great problem with agriculturalists. Honourable members frequently make representations to my department in respect of it . Those representations should be directed to the State departments of agriculture, because it is through those departments that distribution is made to the farmers in the various States. The Commonwealth authority is responsible merely for distribution to the States. INDONESIA. FORMATION OF TBADINO COMPANY.",11
3,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Replyin g to a question that I asked yesterday concerning the proposed formation of a company to exploit Australian-Indonesian trade, the Attorney-General said that before any such concern could be formed the Australian Government would have to be consulted. He also said that Mr Roach and Mr Healy had received no sponsorship from the Commonwealth Govern: ment, either directly or indirectly, .to attend a conference in Indonesia. I now ask the right honourable gentleman to state what action is open to the Commonwealth Government to prevent a company that is established in Singapore from registering in an Australian capital city, provided it complies 'with the company law in the State concerned. Were Mr. Roach - and Mr Healy given air priorities by special order by the Commonwealth Government toflyto Singapore by Qantas Airways on the 11th May to attend the Indonesian conference? Were two passengers off-loaded in order to make roam for them on the aircraft? if so, who authorized the issuing of priorities to them? Did these men have Netherlands East Indies vises entitling i-hcm to transit only through Batavia? If so, did they have the permission of the Dutch authorities to travel to In donesian territory?",11
4,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I stated to the House yesterday that neither Mr Roach nor Mr Healy had received any sponsorship, wither directly or indirectly, from the Commonwenlth Government. That is true. They received no endorsement. As a matter of fact, applications for sponsorship made both to the Prime Minister and to me were peremptorily refused.",12
5,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,What about priorities?,12
6,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I cannot answer in detail about priorities,.but I give a most emphatic and unequivocal denial to the suggestion that any Government sponsorship was given. In fact, they went to Indonesia at a time that' was very embarrassing to the Commonwealth Government, which had its own delegation there. The vises were given to them by the Dutch authorities, and . these enabled them to visit those parts of Indonesia which art-, controlled by the Dutch. That much I learned from the Dutch Charge d'Affaires in Canberra. That is the responsibility of the Dutch Government, and I have nothing to do with it. I do not think that the House will he satisfied any answer from me on a technical point of law. Since the honourable member for Wentworth. raised this matter yesterday in the House I have been in contact with two security officers, Colonel Brown in Canberra and Brigadier Gallagher in Sydney. Their reports are not complete; but, as so much publicity has .been given to the matter, I think I should tell the House that it seems pretty clear from the documents they have seen, and from the conversations they, have had, that the story about the formation of such a trading company is almost certainly part of a pretty elaborate hoax. ANTARCTICA. EXPEDITION FROM AUSTRALIA.",12
7,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"In view of the inthere creasing importance of the Antarctic, and having regard to the fact that anexpediof tion from Australia is to visit the intending migrants? Antarctic in the 1947-48 season, can the Attorney-General say what is the purpose of the expedition, and does it propose to winter in the south next year? Has the Government any plans regarding Macquarie Island, which lies to the south of Tasmania, and was recently surveyed from the air during a noteworthy flight by a Liberator aeroplane?",12
8,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"It has been arranged that an Australian expedition will go te> the Antarctic towards the end of this year. The drawing up of detailed plans is in the hands of a committee representing the various departments concerned, iucluding the Department of the Navy, the Department of A i r and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.. This committee will decide the length of time which the expedition will remain away, and I have no doubt, that some pari of the expedition will, remain in the south throughout the winter. A visit to Macquarie Island is included in the plans. I u the course'of the recent flight from Laverton to Macquarie Island, a distance of 2,100 miles, some - remarkable photographs were obtained. This island was visited years ago by Sir Douglas Mawson. The general purpose of the expedition is to maintain Australian and British interests in the Antarctic, interests based not only on the Australian expedition led by Mawson, but also on the share taken with by Australians in the great expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. FILMS.",12
9,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"In view of the fine work done by the officers of his department by making a film of talented aboriginal artists in Central Australia, will the Minister for Information consider sending additional senior officers to Alice Springs to report on the unique scenic, mining and pastoral area about 100 miles north-east of Alice Springs, near Mount Riddock, in the MCDonnell Ranges, with a view to reporting on the area as a suitable spot for the establishment of a little Hollywood, so that the natural and unique scenery and climate that exists may be capitalized and the films exhibited in Australia for the education our people and also shown overseas to",12
10,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I thank the honourable member for his - well-deserved tribute to the officers of my departments I shall give favourable and very sympathetic consideration to his request that the officers of my department should devote further time in that important portion of Australia in order to record its scenic and other beauties. We shall do it as quickly as possible. RATIONING. ALLEGED XRIUEO ULAKTTTES.,13
11,Mr EALSTELN,Unknown,"Recently the honourable member for Wentworth made an attack on the administration of the Rationing Commission at a time when the proceedings of this House were being broadcast. Yesterday the Attorney General, replying in part to this attack, listed a long record of criminal offences which had been committed by the honourable member's informant. As the proceedings of this House are being broadcast today, will the Attorney General again recite the list in order that his reply may be properly publicized, as it was not mentioned in this morning's newspapers?",13
12,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"Havin g made my statement to the House, to which alone I am responsible, this answer may be sufficient today as a record thereof. WHEAT. Mr RANKIN"" - In view of the announced increase of the price of cornsacks to 28s. and 28s. 6d. a dozen, which is equivalent to 10d. a bushel, will millers with a reply. now receive wheat in bulk less that cost, which means that they will buy wheat at 3s. lOd. a bushel when the real value is approximately 16s. a bushel? If that be so, does not the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture consider it is time for a review and a reasonable increase of the home-consumption price?  arrangements are being made whereby the increased cost of cornsacks will be passed on to the consuming public and the purchasers of grain. REPATRIATION"".",13
13,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"In view of the good work being done by repatriation coming, mittees, in iboth the city and the country, will the Minister for Repatriation consider increasing the originating grant to these committees from £5 to £100? Does not the honourable gentleman consider the initial £5 establishment grant too small to be effective? Is he aware that, because of the small grant of £5, many committees failed to survive and attract public subscriptions and support? As cases of distress among ex-service men and women are growing, will the Minister revise the whole scheme of repatriation committees financially so that the great work being done by public-spirited citizens on these committees can be more effective ?",13
14,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,I do not admit that the difficulties of ex-service men and women are growing. On the contrary. I believe we have now reached a stage where they are commencing to recede.,13
15,Mr HAEBISON,Unknown,What nonsense!,13
16,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"I have some knowledge of the facts and I do not speak without the book on this subject. There are about 480 repatriation committees in Australia. They have done excellent work on a purely voluntary basis' and have been of great asjUtnnce to the Repatriation Department, in looking at cases on the spot and expressing unbiased and considered views on them. I know that the amount of monev available for clerical assistance and the like is small. In view of the hoiorabie member's representations, I shall have tie matter examined and furnish him WHALING .",13
17,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,"In view of the considerable interest displayed in the whaling industry by other nations, will the Australian Government eive an early indication of its intentions in relation to that industry? As a former Commonwealth Minister stated last year thai, whaling would be under way by 1947 and that Tasmania would resume its rightful place as head-quarters of the industry, can the Prime Minister indicate whether definite steps have been taken to establish Australian participation in that valuable industry? If the Government has formulated plans to engage in whalwill he assure me that Hobart will receive every consideration as the tralian base for the venture? If the Gogrowers. vernment has no plans for its participation in the industry, will encouragement be given to any one else to establish it?",13
18,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"As I have indicated previously, the use of Hobart and Western Australian ports, which have been referred to in questions about v haling by other honourable members, be considered when the whaling industry is being considered. I will arrange a detailed reply to be furnished to the honourable gentleman. ORANGES. EXPOKT TO THE FAB EAST.",14
19,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"Gosfor d orangethe growers are anxious to export oranges Singapore and other places in the Far East, but owing to the uncertainty of ihe time the boats will been route and di facility of obtaining refrigeration space. Burns, Philp and Company Limited and shipping agents and authorities advise against an attempt to export fruit some months hence. They say that the Government is taking all the available frigeration space. It is feared that the ma.tter ? valuable markets now offering might be lost forever. What is the position? Will statement the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping inquire into the matter and take all necessary steps within the Government's power to ensure that the growers shall bp protected assisted to share in the lucrative prices now being obtained at Singapore and other places in the Far East?",14
20,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I appreciate the importance of the matter to the land honourable gentleman's constituents the attention that he pays continually to their needs. I understand that the Minister for Supply and Shipping has already taken the matter up with the shipping companies. I also understand that we no longer control overseas ping. Considerable space, particularly refrigeration space, is required for the shipment of food to Britain, 'but the Minister for Supply and Shipping has after World' War I . told me that he is discussing the matter with the shipping companies to ascertain if anything can be done to open up market, referred to by the honourable memRoyal Ausber for the New South Wales fruitRE-ESTABLISHMENT. LAKD SETTXBKEIJT OF EX-SERVICEMENRECONSTEUCTIOK TRAIXXXO.",14
21,Mr BERNARD OOBSER,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Post-war Reconwill struction seen the Queensland press reports that Mr Alan Filmer, a for returned soldier, claims to have contested 28 ballots for land since the end of the war and that the possibility of returned men drawing grazing areas is reduced to the category of a chance in the Golden Casket lottery? Has he seen Mr Filmer's further statement that since end of the war about 20 persons into Queensland had drawn blocks out of a total application list of about 4,000 and that fewer than twelve had been settled the on farming blocks under the land settlement scheme, which was a dismal record? In view of those statements does the Minister still consider that the Governuntil ment's plans for land settlement in Queensland are satisfactory? What does rethe Minister propose to do about the",14
22,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I have not seen the to which the honourable member referred, but he will realise that the problem of the land settlement of ex-servicemen is quite complicated, and can be handled only by co-operation between and the Commonwealth and the States. In pursuance of that, this Parliament passed a bill giving effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth and State Governments in order to ensure that the settlement of ex-servicemen should and be undertaken on a basis which would provide for the men concerned a reasonable income from their properties. I am not aware of the number of ex-servicemen who lave been settled in Queensland, but I can obtain the information for the shiphonorable member. When I examined the figures not so very long ago I found that land settlement had progressed much more rapidly after World War II . than",14
23,Mr LANG,Unknown,"On e of my constituents, Mr Cuttiford, of Merrylands, New South the Wales, who had been a member of the Australian Air Force, has informed me that he was discharged on the 1st May, 1946. Because of his war disabilities, be was notified that he was eligible for full-time training. He applied for a part-time course with the object of obtaining a diploma in mechanical engineering, but was told that the course was full. He then applied for training as a watchmaker, and was told that there would be no course in that trade for two years. Finally, he suggested that he should study accountancy. He began this course on the 13th January last, but now finds that his full-time course will terminate at the intermediate and not at the final stage. Ex-servicemen accepted for this course before June, 1946, are being allowed to proceed full-time to the final stage. Will the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction give sympathetic consideration to permitting ex-servicemen discharged after June, 1946, to undergo the same full-time course of study as those who were discharged prior to that date? Will the Minister examine the case of Mr. Outtiford in the light of these special circumstances?",14
24,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I shall give sympathetic consideration to this case, as I always do to any matter relating to ex-servicemen. As more than 200,000 ex-servicemen are enjoying the benefits of reconstruction training, I cannot possibly deal with individual cases. It may be that the trainee whom the honourable member mentioned was informed that he could not obtain reconstruction training in mechanical engineering. That matter is governed by the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act, which this Parliament passed as the result of an arrangement made by the Menzies Government in 1940. I do not know why this trainee was informed that he could not be given training in watch making for two years, but I am quite sure that the reason was adequate. I shall inquire into the case and if it is possible to do as the honourable member has suggested in regard to this trainee, I assure him that it will done. RAW SILK.",15
25,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Some time ago, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice, certain questions concerning the purchase of raw silk from Japan. My seventh question wasDoes the Government propose to accept the direction of General MACArthur's headquarters that all imports from Japan must be at price levels corresponding to those of similar commodities in the United States ol America V Only a part of my inquiry was replied to ; the remainder was evaded. I understand that the Government is paying £3 2s. 6d. per lb. for raw. silk whereas the current price cn the New York market is 18s. 9d. per lb. I have had a question on the notice-paper on this subject for some time and I ask the Minister whether he will soon obtain a reply to it.  honourable gentleman's previous questions irere answered evasively. I shall inquire from my colleague whether any additional information can be supplied. POPULATION.",15
26,Dr GAHA,Unknown,"Some time ago I asked the Minister for Immigration certain questions in regard to the population of Australia, and trends in relation thereto, which I regarded as highly unsatisfactory. I now ask the honourable gentleman whether he is in a position to give the House any information on the subject.",15
27,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The Commonwealth Statistician, after collaboration with officers of the Department of Immigration, has recently furnished me with the desired information, which I shall have incorporated in Hansard if the House will accord me its gracious permission. When the honourable member for Denison asked me if I could supply answers to questions dealing with certain aspects of population trends, I informed him that I would get the information and give it to him later. The honourable gentleman has now asked me again if I have the information.",15
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I take it that the Minister now has the informabe tion for which he was asked.,15
29,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"That is so. The questions asked by the honourable member dealt with five aspects of population trends and raised issues that are very important and vital to Australia. He drew attention to a state of affairs which had been causing every thoughtful Australian grave concern for some time past. The honourable member asked me for figures concerning the number of people aged 65 years and over in Australia. Briefly the figures are as follows:-1901 , 150,051; 1946, 580,026. The number of such persons per million of population has increased from 39,761 in 1901, to 77,870 in 1946. The second question the honourable member asked me dealt with the average issue of married women who bore children in Australia over certain periods.",15
30,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I rise to order. 1 listened carefully to the question asked by the honourable member for Denison. It was couched in broad terms and referred to certain trends of population in Australia as being unsatisfactory. The Minister is giving specific answers. The honourable member for Denison did not ask specific questions such as the Minister is answering. I take it, therefore, that the Minister is attempting to evade the forms of the House in answering in the manner that he has adopted.",16
31,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Honourable members will be aware that I questioned the Minister for Immigration on this point. To use the vernacular he is "" running very close to the wind "". For many years it was the practice in the House if objection were not raised for Ministers to reply to questions asked on a previous day and, without their being provoked to do so by the honourable members who have asked the questions. That occupied a lot of the time which should have been devoted to questions without notice. I theref ore ruled that if an honourable member did not make a fresh request for the information, the Minister would be obliged to obtain the leave of the House to give the answer. I clearly understood that the honourable member for Denison had drawn attention to a question he had asked some time ago, and had sought to learn whether the Minister now had the information.",16
32,Mr HOLT,Unknown,He provoked the Minister ?,16
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Actually , that is the position. The present case is not exactly in line with that of a Minister who answers a question without being provoked into doing so. Although the Minister is "" sailing close to the wind"", I am prepared to allow him to continue. -] Population.",16
34,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I shall continue from the point at which I was interrupted. The average issue of married women who bore children in Australia in the period 1908-10 was 3.42. The figure fell to 2.38 in the period 1941-45. The third question relates to childless marriages; as a percentage of all marriages in Australia these increased. from 13.3 per cent, in the period 1911-15 to 22.3 per cent, in the period 1936-40. The next question concerns the fertility of marriages in Australia; these fell from 4.05 in the period 1901-5 to 2.18 in the period 1936-40. The most disturbing figure is that which occurs in the answer to the fifth question asked by the honourable gentleman, concerning the percentage to the total population of children under the age of fifteen years and persons aged 65 years and over. In respect of children, the percentage was 35.1 per cent, in 1901 and 24.4 per cent, in 1946. Persons 65 years and over constituted 4 per cent, of the total population in 1901, and 7.8 per cent, in 1946. On the basis of the population trends, the figures in 1975 will be: Children under fifteen years of age, from 20 per cent, to 22 per cent., and persons aged 65 years and over, 12 per cent. The information furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician discloses a truly alarming position. Whilst we shall be in a better position to gauge the population trends after the completion of the 1947 census, I , nevertheless, intend to discuss the matter without delay with the Minister for Health and Social Services, who has also been giving consideration to the problem. The sad truth is that Australia, as we know it, is only 150 years old. We are slowly bleeding to death as a nation and, unless the present position is rectified, there probably will not be any Australian nation in another 50 years. The complete statement is as follows:1. Persons aged 65 years and overAustraliaPersons Aged 65 Year* and Over. Total Year. Population. Number per Actual Million of Number. Population. 1901 3,773,801 150,051 39,761 1911 4,455,005 190,429 42,745 1921 5,435,734 240,820 44,303 1933 6,629,839 429,690 64,812 1946 7,448,603 580,026 77,870 It will be noted that the proportion of persons aged 05 years and over in the population has almost doubled over the past 45 years. Estimates of future population indicate that even if the gross reproduction rate rises slightly, the proportion of persons aged 65 yen is and over will increase to 85,000 per million by 1050, and to 120,000 by 1!!T5. The migration factor was omitted in preparing these estimates because of the difficulty in forecasting' tin; number and age-groups of migrants. 2. Comparable figures showing the number of children per family are not available. However, the following table indicates the downward trend in the size of families:NA Cirir.nHE.v-AUSTRALIA . I'eriod. UI08-10 1011-15 . . 1910-20 .. 11)21-25 1920-30 11)31-35 1930-40 . . 1041-45 The above- (inures represent the average size ""i* families of muri-ied women who bore children 'hiring the periods specified. Figures for years earlier than 1008 are not available. Coincident with the decline in the average number of children born to productive marriages, mentioned in 2 above, there has been air increase in the proportion of marriages which have produced no children at all. The percentage of childless marriages can be calculated from animal tables showing first births, dissected according to duration of marriage of parents. Over a. series of years, first births can be credited to the year in which the parents were married, thus giving the number of productive marriages, and hence the number which were unproductive. As 98 per cent, of first births occur within five to six years of marriage, the proportion of marriages which have proved childless can be estimated without serious error up to 1940. Figures in live-yearly periods, commencing with 1911-15, are given in the following table:CHILDLESS MAHKIAC.ES AS A PER CENT, OF AL L MARRIAGES-AUSTRALIA .

The decline, in the fertility of marriages if. further illustrated by the following table, in which the figures represent the number of children born per marriage. The results were obtained by dividing the total number of nuptial children born during one five-yearly period by the number of marriages registered during the previous five-yearly period. This is a reasonably accurate method of comparing fertility over a number of years. .FERTILITY OK MAUMAOES-AUSTRALIA . rcriod in which uiiir.iiijrcs wui'L' No. of children registered. per marriage. 1901-05 4.05 1906-10 3.79 1911-15 3.05'* 1916-2(1 3.25 1.921-25 .. .. 2.88 1920-30 . . 2.54 1031-35 .. 2.44 1930-40 2.18 * The pronounced drop in fertility shown for marriages registered rluring 1011-15 is explained hy the absence of husbands on war service. 5.

Competent and practical men who have used it have . . 22.3 expressed the opinion that it proTides the best means of combating the arsenic-resistant tick and the spread of the buffalo fly, but at present, unfortunately, it is in - short supply and is very highly priced. Will the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research take steps to determine, through that body, whether this preparation may be made more readily available and at a more reasonable price?",16
35,Mr DEDMAN,CHILDREN AGED UNDER FIFTEEN YEARS AND,"The honourable gentleman's question is based on an entirely erroneous assumption in regard to the activities and responsibility of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The function of that body is solely to undertake scientific research. It is not at all concerned with the production of materials for either primary producers or secondary industries. It has an understanding with State departments of agriculture that it will confine its vities to research which may be of advantage to both primary and secondary industry, the field application of the research being left entirely to those departments. If there is responsibility at all in connection with the matter which the honourable gentleman has raised, it rests on the Department of Agriculture, in Queensland; that is, to ensure that adequate supplies of the material mentioned shall be made available to the primary producers in that State. NA WAR. RE-ESTABLISHMENT IN INDUSTRY.",18
36,Mr MCLEOD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Can the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether the Commonwealth Employment Service has endeavoured to ascertain how former Australian prisoners of war are being re-established in industry? Is there any follow-up or after care, with a view to noting the manner in which they are settling down? What does the follow-up reveal? Does the Government intend to continue to exercise supervision until permanent security has been ensured?",18
37,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"The answer to the honourable member's series of questions is "" Yes "". Because of the desperate experiences which Australian prisoners of war had had, it was recognized that their re-establishment would present an almost insurmountable problem for some years. Consequently, orders were given to officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service throughout Australia to keep a careful record of all Australian prisoners of war. and, by means of the follow-up system, to note how they were accustoming themselves to work which was at all comparable with that which they did before the war. I am very pleased to be able to inform the honourable member that the fears that were held have not been realized. In each State, the information gained by means of the follow-.up system shows that there are very few problem cases. The view of the experts is that the youth of the great majority of them has enabled them to regain their normal condition quickly. That view-is strengthactiened by the fact that all the problem cases are in the 35 to 45 year age-group. The department intends to maintain the follow-up system until permanent security has been assured. The Repatriation any Department, acting under the instructions of its Minister, is making a complete survey of the whole of the ex-service personnel, with a view to ensuring that all of those who have any mental or physical disability shall be permanentl.v established in industry, and toassign reasons for any failure to do so. The evidence collected through labour bureaus all over Australia is to be dis-. sected, with the assistance of officers of the Repatriation Department, so as to make absolutely sure that these men will be permanently established in industry. JUTE.",18
38,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Has the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping seen the report published in the Melbourne Age last Tuesday, to the effect that the Commonwealth Jute Advisory Committee had informed the Government that it could no longer accept responsibility for the supply of jute to Australia? Has the Government rejected the recommendation of that committee that its chairman should proceed to Calcutta ? Was a Mr Tomlinson, of the Australian Barley Board, a person who is unknown in the jute trade and who is not in close touch with jute control, selected instead? As stocks of jute goods are of the utmost importance to Australian primary producers, and in view of the unsettled conditions in India, will the - Government review its decision and - accept ihe advice of the Commonwealth Jute Advisory Committee, or .arrange that a person who is conversant with jute problems and who has authority to make decisions shall accompany Mr. Tomlinson to India?",18
39,Mr BOLLARD,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"""Wit h a view to overcoming the difficulty that has prevented Australia from obtaining satisfactory jute supplies to meet requirements during the forthcomingwheat harvest, the Government has arranged that Mr Tomlinson, a most competent officer and the chairman of the Australian Barley Board, shall proceed to India. It is true that there has been in existence for some time a Jute Industry Advisory Committee under the chairmanship of Mr Stevenson, of the Department of Supply and Shipping. The functions of the committee are solely advisory. The fact that Mr. Stevenson is chairman of that committee in no way commits the Government to select him to go overseas on such a mission as that undertaken by Mr. Tomlinson. In the circumstances the Government will adhere to its decision. CIVIL AVIATION. SERVICE TO DARWIN.",19
40,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"It has been reported that Trans-Australia Airlines proposes to establish a service between Darwin and southern Australia, and it has been suggested that Melbourne will be the terminal of the proposed service, instead of Adelaide, which has been the terminal of air services from Darwin for the the past ten years. Will the Prime Minorder ister ensure that full consideration is given to the claims of Adelaide in this respect, and that at any rate, it continues has to be a point of call ?",19
41,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"J know that consideration is being given to the matter mentioned by the honourable member, but I do not know the details. I will consult with the Minister acting for the Minister for Air, under whose jurisdiction Trans-Australia Airlines operate. The matter will be examined with a view to ensuring that no injury is done to any place. QUESTIONS. MR, A. J. DALZIEL-PERMISSIBL E FORMS.",19
42,Mr BLAIN,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"I desire to make a personal explanation regarding the question, which I asked on Friday last in reference to Mr A. J. Dalziel, and regarding some remarks which you, Mr Speaker, afterwards made reflecting upon me and my conduct. You said, after I had asked my questionThe Clerk of the House spoke to you regarding a question which I had ruled out of order. No Speaker would have tolerated the question you sought to have printed on the notice-paper. With all due deference, sir, I am sure, especially after having referred to my papers, that your memory is at fault in the matter, owing to the lapse of time. The question to which I referred was noi railed out of order by you. It was part of another question, and I myself removed it on the assurance of the Clerk that the man concerned was ill . And so. instead of its being a question which no Speaker would have tolerated, you yourself tolerated it last week in almost exactly its original form. You did later rule out of order two questions, one partly regarding Mr. Dalziel, and another regarding the conduct of the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) in a. matter of grave importance to the reputation of the Government. These were the only question; which I proposed to plaee on the notice paper, and which you, sir, ruled out of order. I have your own typewritten note on the matter, and this is what you wroteI have examined the questions submitted by honourable member for the Northern Territory, and have directed that they are not in in their present form for several reasons. The main reason is that they seek to give information, and what information is sought nothing to do with the administration of the Minister to whom the questions are addressed. When I received this communication from you, I asked you in what particulars these questions were out of order, so that I might recast them. You refused to indicate your reasons. You did not then, or at any time, suggest that they were improper in tone, or that they were such as no Speaker would allow. I do not think that this House would regard ihem as in any way offensive. Except for one or two paragraphs, they are not open to the charge that they give information. They were certainly not pleasant questions for an honourable member to have to ask; but they were questions which I thought it my duty to ask, and I still think so. I repeat that I made no reflections on the Clerk of the House.",19
43,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS OF,"Hon. J. S. Rosevear). - The complaint implicit in the honourable member's personal explanation appears to be that I had told him in very mild terms what I expressed in somewhat stronger terms last week regarding the question which he sought to ask. I hope that the honourable member is not encouraged by the fact that last week he asked, without notice, a question which he was not. allowed to put on the notice paper. The honourable member was allowed to ask the question without notice because I cannot very well rule a question out of order until I have heard it. Had I known the nature of the question prior to its being asked, it would have been ruled out of order. It was my resentment against the honourable member's reflections on an officer of the House, when I was responsible for the action taken, that brought about the rebuke, and similar action will be taken if the honourable member again a.ct3 in the same way. NA BILL 1947. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 21st May (vide page 2723), on motion by Mr. CHAMBERSThat the bill be now read a second time.",20
44,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Balaclava) [3.14] This bill, as the title informs us, is to establish from the profits and other assets of canteens conducted within the defence forces during the time of war which commenced on the 3rd day of September, 1939, and from other sources, trust funds to be administered in the interests of ex-servicemen and their dependants. All honourable members will agree that this is a necessary work. The funds which accumulated as the result of sales in canteens, and in the various messes of the services, are now to be co-ordinated and distributed. The bill is contentious in parts, and I hope that the Minister, who has been at great pains to bring down a satisfactory bill, will admit that there is room for a difference of opinion about it, and that he will accept suitable amendments. The Minister very fittingly paid a tribute to the Australian Imperial Force Canteen Committee, which, ever since ""World ""War I . , has dealt with funds which accumulated during that war. I commend the report of that committee to the Minister and to honourable members. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) was evidently not aware of the existence of such an. organization when he spoke last night, or he would have praised it also. The committee was charged with the responsibility of dispersing £751,000 of surplus canteens funds, and also a legacy of £703,000 from the late Sir - Samuel MCCaughey, who stipulated that the money should be devoted to the education of the children of ex-servicemen, particularly those who were not in receipt of pensions. The committee did its work so well that it has assisted to full citizenship 9,45S girls and 9,026 boys, among whom were twelve Rhodes scholars. It has the requisite machinery for, and is carrying out, the disbursement of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Military Forces and the Royal Australian Air Force children's educational funds. I trust that the Minister will enlist its aid. Provision is made in the bill for the appointment of trustees who are to be the heads of the services and four others. The trustees will not be able to deal with individual oases, and it is to organizations such as I have mentioned, and to the Legacy Club, that much of the work of distribution of these moneys should be handed over. The welfare branch of the Air Force Association should also share in it. The trustees should include among their membership the representatives of the ""War ""Widows Craft Guild, who have the particular interests of war widows at heart. As honourable members are aware, a deputation from the Opposition recently waited upon the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) to discuss with him the difficulties confronting war widows, particularly young women with children, who are unable to work and are compelled to exist on a meagre pension. The help and advice of the Legacy Club and the other organizations to which I have referred should be sought. Members of the Legacy Club are all ex-servicemen. The - club was formed in Melbourne in 1923 as iin organization supplementary to the then Returned Sailors and Soldiers [mperial League of Australia. The organization was established specifically to assist the children of ex-servicemen and of deceased members of the forces. Like the other organizations to which I have referred, it has assisted thousands of boys and girls, provided the means for technical and university education, and has found them useful employment. Its record is a laudable one. The bill proposes the establishment of four bodies, a major trust which will have control of the expenditure of approximately £4,500,000, .and three minor bodies, each of which will have £60,000 to commence with. Of the £4,500,000, an amount of £2,500,000 is to be devoted to educational purposes and the remainder to other work, such as benefits to men who are in indigent circumstances. Let us consider the three minor bodies first. It is proposed to take from the total of the services trust funds an amount of £180,000 to be apportioned equally between army, navy, and air force funds. In his second-reading speech the Minister stated that that money is to be expended on behalf of men who are already in the forces, in other words, those who are now serving in Japan. The honourable gentleman 3aidThese separate service funds will be able for members of the forces who served prior to the war or who joined the forces subsequent to the prescribed date. That does not appear to be provided for in the bill. I support the contention of the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett), that as £4,500,000 resulted from profits made on the sale of goods' in canteens and in certain messe3 to volunteers who served in the three arms during the war, such profits should be distributed to those ex-service men and women as are in necessitous circumstances and to their children. How can the Government justify subtracting £180,000 from the funds in order to benefit members of the forces who did not serve in the war? Responsibility for their welfare rests upon the Government itself. Apparently, much of the money will be expended on welfare facilities for members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force of Japan. During the war there was posted up in every Air Force canteen a notice,' the substance of which was that the money made in the canteen would be returned post-war to the troops. Facilities for the members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force should be charged against the defence vote. I trust that the Minister will explain this proposal more fully.' I draw attention to the following words in the Minister's second-reading speech, with which I am in entire accord:No provision from public funds, however benevolent it may be, can afford adequate compensation to those who are bereaved or who are suffering from serious wounds or sickness as a result of the hazards and privation of war. If we believe that, as I am sure we all do, we should not countenance any subtraction from canteens funds. The profits derived from the canteens during World War II . were very much greater than, those in World War I . During World War II . there were serving in the forces 52,000 in the Navy, 735,000 in the Army and 218,000 in the Air Force, a total of over 1,000,000. The serving members of the forces in World War I . numbered approximately 425,000. Consequently, a very much larger sum is now available, but our liabilities to ex-service men and women are also correspondingly greater. avail- Of the £4,500,000, the Government proposes to set aside £2,500,000 for the provision of educational assistance, including professional and trade training for the children of deceased servicemen, incapacitated servicemen, servicemen who are in needy circumstances, and other children of servicemen who are, in the opinion of the trustees, particularly deserving of assistance. The Minister indicated that £2,500,000 is a minimum amount, and that if it appears to the trustees to be desirable they may allocate further sums for the provision of educational assistance to children. After setting aside the amounts for the education of children, the balance of the services canteens trust fund is to be applied by the trustees for the benefit of eligible ex-serviceinen and their depenants and the dependants of deceased eligible ex-servicemen in necessitous or deserving circumstances. We are also informed that the trustees are to have power to provide relief or benefits to eligible ex-servicemen or their dependants in such other cases as they think fit. The bill specifies who will disburse the fund. There will be a senior Army officer, presumably the Quarter-MasterGeneral, a senior Navy officer, presumably a member of the Naval Board, and a senior Air Force officer, presumably the Chief of the Air Staff, and there will be four men who served in the ranks. I do not know why a specific reference is made to the ranks Most Air Force officers went through the ranks and that probably applies equally to the Army and the Navy. I think that it places unnecessary emphasis on the ranks, hut I take no real exception to the provision, .because thousands of men who served in the ranks could help to administer the trust fund. The trustees will have to deal with the multifarious cases that will come before it. I hope that the Minister will call into assist him not only the organizations I have already referred to but also members of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which is represented on the Australian Imperial Force Canteens Trust, and other ex-servicemen's organizations, including the A ir Force Association, which has a large membership covering men who served in Australia as well as overseas. The Air Force Association has a welfare branch, which operates extremely well and is doing the kind of work contemplated for the Services Canteens Trust Fund. Those people would be helpful to the Minister. He will have had conversations with them, but he should associate them with the organization provided for in the bill. I should like the Minister totell me whether any of the money will be allocated to the Repatriation Department.",20
45,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Non e of it will be.,22
46,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I am glad of that. We now know that all this money, except £180,000, will be disbursed for benevolent purposes. Under the bill people eligible for benefit will be members of the naval, military or airforces of the Commonwealth; members of any nursing service or women's service attached or auxiliary to any branch of the Defence Force of the Commonwealth; or members of the canteens staff of any ship of the Royal Australian Navy and any person, duly accredited to any part of the DefenceForce - who has served in an official capacity on full time paid duty.. That does not include worthy members of field' units of the Salvation Army, the Australian Red Cross Society and theYoung Men's Christian Association, some of whom were taken prisoner in Singapore and suffered all the rigors, of imprisonment and. at the same time had to pay income tax, whereas soldiers on equivalent pay were exempt. The Minister should look at that matter, because he would not be happy if any one who should be included among the beneficiaries were excluded because of a drafting error. This measure will be of great importance not so much financially as from the humanitarian point of view. It will have a. great influence on the contentment of ex-service men and women. They are. not looking for charity and do not expect much from the promises that were made to them when they joined the services, but, later, as we in the Legacy Club and other organizations know from our experience after World War I . , as they become older their capacity to earn may grow less. Then, or if illness befalls them, they or their dependants may have to turn to the Services Canteen Trust Fund for help. The fund will settle many domestic and industrial problems. With the limited criticism that I have offered, I give this bill my blessing. Let it operate under good management. Let the people chosen as the trustees of the fund be the best and most impartial obtainable. When it. has operated for a year or two the Government will know to what degree it needs improvement. When the time comes for improvement I hope the Government will not be so perverse as it has been about needed alteration of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, by refusing to make them because: a committee considered repatriation, in 1943!-as if 1 times have not changed ! I hope that in committee the Minister will accept the amendments foreshadowed by Opposition members and that later, if further - changes should 'be found necessary, those changes will 'be made, regardless of the political colour of those that suggest them. Mr - SHEEHY (Boothby) [3.33] - On this measure we have had a discussion rather than a debate. As the honourable member for.Balaclava (Mr White) said, the Australian Imperial Force Trust Fund after World War I . ' did a .grand job. It looked after the educational and other needs of about 20,000 children of ex-servicemen. I do not doubt that the Services Canteens Trust Fund will operate equally well or even better, as - the result of the experience gained from the operations of the Australian Imperial Force Trust Fund. Since his appointment to the Ministry, the Minister for the Army (Mr. 'Chambers) has applied himself to his work with energy 'and enthusiasm and has demonstrated his sympathy for servicemen and ex-servicemen. He has been - commended all over South Australia, at least. I hope the Tight people are selected as trustees so that ex-servicemen and their dependants who apply to them for assistance shall be assured of support. As the Services Canteens Trust Fund will handle about £4,500,000, it has a 'big task ahead of it, because more than 1,000,000 men and women were in the Australian armed forces and they and their dependants will make a much larger number of people to be dealt with than were 'assisted by the Australian Imperial Force Trust Fund. I pay tribute to the Minister for consolidating the funds of the canteens of the Army, the !N*avy and. the A i r Force. Undoubtedly, this money must be expended in the interests of ex-servicemen and their dependants. I emphasize that this bill will consolidate canteens profits, surplus mess regimental amenities and other benefit funds of the three services, which accumulated during World War II . This clarification is necessary because some ex-servicemen's organizations do not appear to be aware of the position. In South Australia, the Minister for the Army and I were approached by one ex-servicemen's organization which desired to be given full control of its share of the proceeds from the fund. From a private discussion with the Minister, I have ascertained that the profits of canteens available to members of the occupation forces in Japan will be paid into the Services Canteens Trust Fund. Another matter which I discussed with the Minister was the selection of trustees. The bill provides for trustees of the Services Canteens Trust Fund and the service funds to be established on the recommendation of the Governor General in Council. It is proposed that the trustees of the .Services Canteens Trust Fund shall consist of a chairman, representatives of the Naval, Military and Air Boards, a business man, an cx-servicewoman and four .representatives who have served in the ranks of the Navy, Army and A ir Force and who are nominees of ex-servicemen's organizations. The Minister for the Army, the Minister for Air, and the Minister for the Navy will be responsible for the selection of suitable persons. The trustees should have sympathy for, and understand the needs of ex-servicemen who have served Australia so efficiently. On more than one occasion, I have met members of the executive of the South Australian War Widows Guild, and they have expressed to me their fears for the future of war widows. They consider that they have every right to be represented on the Services Canteens Trust. The Minister has assured me that every consideration will be given to their requests, and has pointed out that an ex-servicewoman will be appointed a trustee. After all, the war widows have paid a heavy price so their interests should he preserved. The war widows will have the Minister's full sympathy and co-operation. He will see that they are not obliged, as they fear they will be, to plead extreme poverty before they can secure some of the benefits of the fund to which, they rightly claim, their husbands contributed. I commend the bill. I am certain that it will be administered efficiently. The Minister himself will ensure that it shall function in the manner in which he expects it to-in the interests of those who built up the profits which it is now proposed to disburse.",22
47,Mr HOWSE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Calare) [3.43] - The honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett), the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), and other honourable members have spoken so eloquently and analysed so thoroughly the provisions of this bill that they have left me little to say. However, I shall make a few points which require emphasis. This bill is an honest attempt to distribute these surplus canteens funds. During I he war, I frequently wondered how the money would be allocated. Ex-servicemen consider that the money belongs to them, because it was derived from them, and, therefore, should be expended to serve their interests in the best possible way. However, I was not able to evolve a suitable plan. While the bill meets the requirements up to a point, I .'hall later suggest some amendments which I hope the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) will accept. The success of the scheme will depend upon sympathetic consideration and the ability of the administrators of the Services Canteens Trust Fund. Therefore, the representation should be as wide as possible, withfor. out making the administration unwieldy and top-heavy. The Minister should include on the trust the representatives of organizations which have a practical knowledge of serving the needs of ex-servicemen and their dependants. The Australian Red Cross Society is one body which comes readily to mind. The Legacy Club has done extraordinarily good work since World War I . , and has the machinery and the practical knowledge to assist ex-servicemen and their dependants. It has proved that it is able to look after them. Such an organization should not be overlooked when trustees are being appointed. The War Widows Guild also has a strong claim for representation, because war widows have a vital interest in the distribution of these funds. The honourable member for Balaclava stated that an amount of £120,000 will be allocated to the occupational forces in Japan. In my opinion, the requirements of those forces are really the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. The money in the Services Canteens Trust Fund was provided by servicemen who participated in World War II . , and should be returned to them or to their dependants. The Minister should not allocate £120,000 to the occupational forces in Japan, but should return it to the fund, and use it for the purposes provided in the bill. The Minister spoke also about amenities for British forces in Japan. 1 should like him to explain whether the Commonwealth Government proposes ""to supply amenities for all British forces in that country. As much as I believe that we should contribute towards a communal British centre, or amenities, I consider that this fund should not be used for that purpose. Another section of the people who should participate, and I have not heard any previous speaker refer to them, is the workers associated with the Young Men's Christian Association. Many of them were taken prisoners of war, and their fellow prisoners will vouch for their extraordinarily good work. They shared hardships with the men, and were strenuous workers.",24
48,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,They are provided ,24
49,Mr HOWSE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I thank the Minister for that assurance. In my opinion, the fund should not be used to assist persons whom the Repatriation Department should help. Some honourable members fear that at least a part of this money might be used for that purpose. Finally, I emphasize the need for effective administration of the fund, and the necessity to appoint to the trust representatives of such organizations as the Legacy Club, which have had practical experience in this field. The services of these organizations should be used, because they know what problems arise, and can make valuable contributions to this work.",24
50,Mr JAMES,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Hunter) [3.50] - I support the bill and congratulate the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) upon having introduced it. I have no doubt that the funds will be used faithfully for the purposes set out. I notice, however, that no provision has been made for the grauting of assistance to legacy clubs Every one knows that the legacy clubs have done a wonderful job in helping the orphaned children of men of both world wars. This was the case particularly during the depression years and in the early 'thirties. Officers of. legacy - clubs were able to approach employers in such a way that their appeals were rarely if ever rejected. Seeing that this institution has the confidence of the community in such a remarkable way, I consider that some of the funds available for - distribution from canteens profits should lie allocated to legacy clubs to assist emergency cases. I wish to refer now to the project for the establishment of the Lake Macquarie .=oldiers convalescent home which has bceu receiving the wholehearted support - of ex-service men and women from Oosford. right up to the Queensland border. The organizing committee has been appealing for funds for this purpose for years, and it is receiving regular contributions from many people, including - coal-miners, who are paying a voluntary levy fortnightly. The accumulated funds so far raised total some thousands of pounds. Representations were made to the predecessor of the present Minister for Repatriation for a grant to the funds for the construction of this home, but without success. In my opinion, the provisions of paragraph c, of sub-clause 2 of clause 22 of this bill are such as would allow the trustees to make a grant towards this specific fund, for the paragraph concludes with the words, "" and such other cases as the trustees think fit"". The Lake Macquarie home will not be an institution under the control of the Repatriation Department, but it is intended to be made available to all ex-servicemen who need a place of convalescence. The building will lie situated on the shores of Lake Macquarie, the largest lake in Australia, which has a foreshore of 365 miles. The committee hopes to raise as much as £60,000 for this most deserving cause. The home is to be used as a convalescent institution for those who may not be sufficiently incapacitated to require treatment from the Repatriation Department's doctors, but who, nevertheless, are not sufficiently well to follow their normal calling. The plan provides that the home shall be provided with all kinds of sporting equipment and have facilities for bowls, cricket, tennis, swimming, boating, fishing and the like. I had the honour to introduce the Mayor of Newcastle, Mr.  previous Minister for Repatriation, Mr. Frost, in the interests of this proposed home, and I also have had quite a deal to do with the arrangement of sports, lotteries and the like, for the purpose. Up to date, however, the Government has not seen fit to make any funds available to help with the construction of this home. I consider that the organizers are entitled to consideration in this respect. ""We all are well aware that the men and women of Australia who were prepared to risk their limbs, health and life itself in the interests of the nation in time of war, were promised all kinds of assistance on their return to civil life. Similar promises were made to their dependants. I consider the Government is under an obligation to assist such projects as I have described. I listened last night with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn). I am of the opinion that although specific reference is not. made in the bill to women who served in the forces, it is undoubtedly intended that benefits from the surplus canteens funds shall be made available to them. I congratulate the honourable member upon her speech, and although women may already be covered in the definitions in the bill, I consider that the matter should be placed beyond doubt. The women of .Australia rendered marvellous service in the forces during ""World ""War II . Many thousands of them served in battle areas and did wonderful work. One wonders sometimes whether the war has actually ended. I do not desire to discuss the possibilities of still another world war. We must trust in God and hope that, for the sake of humanity, wiser counsels will prevail and that war will not recur. The Minister will, I hope, give favourable consideration to the submissions that I have made to him, particularly in regard to the legacy clubs, the Lake Macquarie soldiers convalescent home, and the need to ensure that women are definitely included among those who may benefit from a distribution of the funds referred to in the bill. I am sure that the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) is acquainted with the proposal to build the Lake Macquarie soldiers' convalescent home, because he has attended meetings in my company at which the matter has been considered. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) also is aware of the project. There is not an honourable member from New South ""Wales north of Sydney who has not been approached in connection with it. The opportunity is now presented to them to endeavour to have it assisted. I know that the honourable member for New England definitely promised that he would lend his aid, and I anticipate that the right honourable member for Cowper also did. should now like to have their support. Those associated with the project have worked very hard, and have received very little encouragement from any government. I hope that the Minister will state clearly whether the trustees of the fund will be able to make a grant under the provisions of clause 22. ' Sir EARLE PAGE (Cowper) [4.2] -- I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the appeal of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) that consideration shall be given to the Lake Macquarie soldiers' convalescent borate. Every one must be in favour of the primary purpose for which the appropriation provided, for in the bill is being made, namely, to provide ""educational assistance, including professional mid trade training (o) for the. children of deceased or incapacitated eligible serviceiiaien or of eligible servicemen who are in needy circumstances, and (6) for the children of eligible servicemen other than those mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub-section who are, in the opinion of the trustees, particularly deserving of assistance by reason of exceptional circumstances "". Those were mainly the purposes to which the canteens fund was devoted after World War I . The money was then expended wisely and with a good deal of discretion, with the result that, considerable benefits were conferred. Ft will thus be seen that there is a precedent for such action. There is great need for convalescent hospitals for both civilians and ex-servicemen, not only in New South Wales but also in every other State. I appreciate the point that has been made by the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn)', but I believe that it is met by the definition of "" member of the forces "". Because of theacute shortage of hospital beds, many men and women are compelled to leave hospital immediately the most serious stage of their illness has passed, and their convalescence in many instances is retarded by their domestic conditions. It cannot be questioned that they would completely regain, their health much more quickly if they could become inmates of a well-situated institution such as it is desired, shall be established at I Lake Macquarie. They would then again become productive units in the community, and the time that would elapse between recurrences of their illnesses would be lengthened. Therefore, no better purpose could be served than by either making a capital contribution towards the cost of this building or devoting a proportion of the interest derived from the fund to the maintenance of the institution when it had been established. If such, a contribution were promised by the Minister on behalf of the Government, the donations from many other sources would be increased, and the institution would be enabled to commence its operations much earlier. It is anticipated that when established it will give service to all those ex-servicemen who live in New South Wales north of Sydney, as well as to many of them who are residents of Sydney. The Minister, because of the nature of his profession, must be aware of the need to establish an institution of. this sort for the benefit of not only ex-servicemen, but also the civilian population. If the terms, of ihe bill are not sufficiently wide to permit the funds to be used in the manner suggested, I hope that he will have it amended so as to enable that to be done.",24
51,Mr RANKIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Bendigo) [4.7] - 1I have no complaint to make in regard to the purposes to. which the money in these funds is to be devoted; but, as it was taken from service men and women by means of overcharges for goods which they purchased, they and they alone should determine the maimer in which it shall be expended. The members of the trust are to be appointed by the Governor General, which means by the Minister, a:nd I have no doubt that he will appoint 1 men and women who are representativp of the services. The service organizations should be entitled to make the selection. I have in mind the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, the Legion of Ex-servicemen, the Air Force Association, the War Widows Guild, and the organizationwhich represents the women's services. Many ex-service men and women will not be able to participate in the benefits; consequently, their dependants are entitled to some assistance. I raise the matter of the distribution of the difference between the pay of servicemen who worked on the wharfs during industrial disturbances, and the payment for that work which was made by shipping companies to the Government.",26
52,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! matter is outside the scope of the bill. Mr RANKIN"" - Wit h due respect, 1 do not think that it is. The predecessor of the present Minister promised definitely that the money would be devoted to the provision of amenities for servicemen. Mir. SPEAKER - Order ! The bill deals solely with canteens funds.",27
53,Mr RANKIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I believe that the £1,250,000 involved should be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the bill. Surely, we are entitled to a statement by the Minister as to what the Government intends to do with it.",27
54,Mr SPEAKER,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! The Standing Orders provide other means for raising the matter. It cannot be discussed under this bill, which relates solely to the disposal of canteens funds.",27
55,Mr RANKIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I urge the Government to reconsider the matter, and to give service organizations a voice in the selection of those who will administer these funds. The Government is being relieved of a heavy obligation in respect of men who have served this country. The amount of £4,500,000 is to be expended on ex-service men and women and their dependants. It is not the responsibility of the ex-servicemen to make that provision, but the responsibility of the Government and of this country. For that reason, it will be most unjust if service organizations are not allowed to have a voice in the selection of the trustees.",27
56,Mr HAMILTON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Swan) [4.11] - The measure has my wholehearted support. I should like the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) to explain the position in relation to paragraph / of clause S, which provides for the appointment of regional committees with such powers and functions, and upon such terms and conditions, as are prescribed: Is it intended that, in each State, there shall be an advisory panel of trustees, to advise the principal trustees of the fund? Such panels would be in closer contact with those who require assistance from the fund. It would be a waste of money to send trustees to Western Australia to investigate a few small matters. They could be investigated by a local panel, and the recommendations of that panel should be accepted by the principal That trustees. I am certain that the Minister, having heard what the various speakers have had to say, will give some consideration to the representation of war widows on both regional committees and the trust. The number of trustees is not specified, and the Governor General may appoint whatever number may be considered necessary. We. shall go a long way towards easing the conditions of war widows by giving them representation on such a body. All ex-service men's and women's organizations should be approached before a definite decision is made as to who will administer the fund.",27
57,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [4.14] - in reply- I thank those honourable members who have discussed the bill, for their very fair criticism. Evidently, they realise that the committee has spent a considerable time in an endeavour to produce a measure which will provide for the distribution of this huge amount in the best interests of all concerned. Earlier, the Government promised that the profits from the various canteens funds would eventually be distributed among servicemen and their dependants. I confess that I was somewhat anxious because the title to the bill does not include the word "" servicewomen''. However, it is made clear in the definitions in clause 4 that servicewomen are covered by the bill. In addition, section 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act specifically provides that "" in any act, unless the contrary intention appears, words importing the masculine gender shall include females "".",27
58,Mrs BLACKBUBN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Then why should it have been necessary in clause 4 to define the phrase "" member of the Forces "" ?",28
59,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"As I have pointed out, it was unnecessary to include the word "" servicewomen "" in the title of the bill. There appears to be a misunderstanding in the minds of some honourable members as to why members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces should derive any benefit from the Services Canteens Trust Fund. Perhaps honourable members have forgotten that practically the entire original Australian occupation force, and a high percentage of those still in Japan, went direct from Morotai. Many of those now in the occupation force haA'e served in the Army, Navy or Air Force for five or six years. It was part of the MACArthu.r-Northcott agreement that Australia should provide canteens and other amenities. Moreover, not all the money in this fund was derived from men who served in World War II . Before 1939, there was in existence an Air Force Welfare Fund, and there was also a Royal Australian Navy Fund Then again, various public subscriptions and donations had been received, which go to make up the total amount now in the general trust fund. Some honourable members have expressed concern about the membership of the trust, and they have asked whether there will be an opportunity for local or regional committees to carry on in the States. I propose now to give a list of members of the trust, and I am sure that honourable members will accept them as suitable. The list is as' follows:Chairman-Brigadie r A. S. Blackburn, V.C., barrister. Served in 1914-18 and 1939-45 war. Ex-president of Legacy. Present president of South Australian Branch Beturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. Brigadier A. S. Blackburn, V.C., is a past president of the Legacy Club ol Adelaide, where he has a record of years of personal service on behalf of orphaned children of those who laid down their lives in the service of their country. Representative of Naval Board-(Not yet nominated). Representative of the Military BoardAdjutant-General (Major-General W. M . Anderson). Kepresentative of the A i r Board-Air Marshal G. Jones. Business Man- Mr S. B. Holder, formerly Paymaster-in-Chief, Australian Military Forces, with rank of Brigadier. Mr Holder was a Major in Pay Corps during 1914-Ifi war and as a member of David If ell and Company has audited accounts of Australian Imperial Force Canteens Fund Trust which was created at close of 1914-18 war. Representative of ex-servicemen nominated by Returned .Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia- Mr J. A . K . Wicks, secretary, 13 iEsscx-roacl, Surrey Hills. Victoria. Ase 26, served as VX20343, private, 2/29th Battalion, Malaya. Kepresentative of Australian Legion of KxServicemen and Women- Mr B. J. MCDonald, LL.B.

Ex-Serviccwoninn-Mis s Clare Stevenson, formerly group officer, Women's Australian Army Auxiliary Forces. The Government also intends to appoint a representative of the Disabled Soldier;; Association, which includes blinded, limb less, permanently incapacitated, tubercular and partially blinded men.",28
60,Mr BLAIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,In what capacity will Mr. Dalziel serve?,28
61,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,He will represent the Ex-Navalmen's Association.,28
62,Mr CONELAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Why is there to be no representative of the Disabled Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association ?",28
63,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"That organization was considered, but we found that it functioned only in Queensland, whereas we wish members of the trust to be representative of Australia-wide organizations. Several honourable members have expressed their desire that the Legacy Club should be represented on the trust. I know that in South Australia, and, indeed, throughout the whole of Australia, the Legacy Club has done good work, and its claim, to representation was considered. I believe that the Legacy Club will find an opportunity to serve in connection with the regional committees which are to he set up in the various States.",28
64,Mr CONELAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Coul d that not also a pply to the Demobilized Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association?",29
65,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"No , because it is a single-State organization.",29
66,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,What about the War Widows' Guild?,29
67,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"That organization Memorial Hospital. was also considered, and many representations were received with respect to i When I was last in Adelaide, the honorsentative able member for Boothby (Mr Sheehy) soldiers ? introduced a deputation to me which made representations on the subject, and I said that I would refer the include matter to Cabinet. In my opinion, the comments which apply War Widows Guild apply also to the Legacy Club; it will have an opportunity ro be represented on regional committees. Moreover, the guild will be represented through various service organizations. wish to pay a high tribute to the work done by the War Widows' Guild. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) referred to Mrs Vasey. I have the highest admiration for her, I. should like to see her on the trust, honourable members will agree that if every worthy organization that worked on behalf of ex-service men and women and their dependants were represented the bill. trust would be unwieldy.",29
68,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Would it not be a more workable body if three high officers trustees. representing the services were replaced by representatives of some of these other organizations?,29
69,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"No . We had a very special reason for placing on the trust high-ranking officers representing the three services, because they would have ready access to the records of ex-servicemen when necessary. It was be-lieved that they could, in this way, be great service to the trust in the making of investigations. Representations have been made to me, as Minister for the Army, and to other honourable members, seeking a grant of money for a proposed Lake Macquarie fund Memorial Hospital. Provision is made ties? in the b i ll for allocating mopey from the trust f u n d for this and similar purposes if the trust thinks fit. Clause 22 concludes with these words. . and in the provision of relief or benefit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as the trustees think fit. The Parliamentary Draftsman assures me that under that provision an amount of money may be allocated to an undertaking such as the Lake Macquarie",29
70,Mr LANG,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Can the Minister say what t . is holding up the appointment of a repreof the limbless and blinded,29
71,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,The decision to a representative of the Disabled Soldiers Association has only recently to the been made. The association has been asked to nominate a representative. All ex-servicemen's organizations were given the right to nominate persons for appointment as trustees. The nominees of the I organizations have been accepted by the Government. If these funds are administered carefully great benefits will s. flow to ex-service men and women and their dependants for many years to come. and The trustees appointed know the needs but and desires of ex-service men and women and they will administer the f u n d under their control in accordance with the desire of the Parliament as expressed in this All requests for grants or pensions which come with in the responsibility of the Repatriation Department will be passed on to that department by the Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee : Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3 (Parts).,29
72,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Barker) [4.34] - Did the Minister answer the query raised by the honourable member of for Henty (Mr Gullett) last night as to whether this money will be used for the provision of amenities for the troops in J apan ?,29
73,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I dealt with that.,29
74,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Will the be used for the supply of such ameni,29
75,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [4.35] - The troops in Japan will have the benefit of the £60,000 set aside for members of the forces who served prior to the war or who joined the forces subsequent to the termination of the war. Thus, the troops who enlisted for the interim force and who are now serving in Japan will derive benefits from this special fund.",30
76,Mr HAMILTON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Swan) [4.36] - I am in accord with the suggestion that each service should look after its own members. I do not think honourable members can quibble with that. It is only reasonable that the Iroops now in Japan should benefit from the expenditure of some of this money. I assume that if any surplus exists at the termination of our occupation of Japan, it will be placed to the credit of the central fund.",30
77,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,That is so. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 (Definitions).,30
78,Mrs BLACKBURN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Bourke) [4.37] En view of the provision in the Acts Interis pretation Act that the term "" servicemen and ex-servicemen"" shall include "" serMalaya. vice women and ex-service women "", I am at a loss to understand why it was sary to define the term "" member of the forces "" in the bill.",30
79,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Wentworth) [4.38]. - The Minister should satisfy the I"" movecuriosity of the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn). At least should pay her the courtesy of replying to her question.",30
80,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [4.38] - It is necessary define "" member of the forces"" in this bill in order to describe the persons titled to benefits from the funds conis stituted by the bill. Clause agreed to. Clause 5(1.) The Governor General shall appoint, respect of each fund, trustees of such number as he thinks fit and a chairman of trustees.",30
81,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Wimmera) [4.39] Last night I foreshadowed an amendand ment; but I indicated at that time that, if the Minister would assure me that all the trustees appointed would be ex-memrest bers of the forces I would not submit it. Having received such an assurance from the honourable gentleman, I do not intend to proceed with my proposed amendment. The Minister has been good enough to recite the names of the persons who are to be appointed as trustees. I compliment him upon their selection, especially on the choice of Brigadier Blackburn, V.C., as chairman of the trustees of the central fund. A more suitable person could not be obtained. The persons to be appointed to represent other ranks include Mr J. A. K . Wicks, of the 2nd/29th Battalion. Those of us who have studied the history of the war know the splendid achievements of the 2nd/29th Battalion in Malaya. I am not sure whether I know Mr Wicks, whose name has been mentioned. Whilst we were prisoners of war, both the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Blain) and I knew a man named "" Jock "" Wik, who was a resident of Horsham, in Victoria.",30
82,Mr CHAMBEES,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The person selected Mr J. A. K . Wicks, of Surrey Hills, Victoria. He was a prisoner of war in",30
83,Mr TURNBULL,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I do not know neceswhether he is the same man. The other names are unknown to me, but they appear to be satisfactory.",30
84,Mrs BLACKBURN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Bourke) [4.41]. That, after sub-clause (1.), the following he new sub-clause be inserted:"" (IA . ) The trustees of each fund shall include at least one war widow."" I am pleased that the list of names furto nished by the Minister includes at least one ex-servicewoman. However, I do not enbelieve that that representation of women sufficient. I promised the war widows that I would press for their representation on the trust. Every article purchased by the troops in the canteens was charged at the full retail rate or more. in The Curtin Government assured the troops that they were paying high prices for their requirements so that the profits would be available for themselves, their wives and children after the war, for the benefit of their dependants if they fell in battle. As honourable members know, there was a great deal of unamong the troops over the prices charged. Members of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in Victoria-including, I believe, Mr Holland-informe General Vasey's widow that, in their opinion, these funds cannot be properly administered unless a representative of , per the war widows is included among the trustees who should benefit by her advice and help. That opinion was also held by my late husband some years ago. I mentioned last night that I thought Mrs Vasey would be a suitable person for such an apbe pointment. All of the trustees should be persons who, through their own firsttime, hand experience, have an intimate ledge of the needs of ex-service men women and their families. The list names furnished by the Minister indiwhy cates that the persons selected possess this qualification. However, the need for the appointment of a representhe tative of the war widows as a trustee is desires. imperative because the sole woman so far appointed is unmarried. What could she know of the sufferings endured by war widows, of their very desperate struggle to live on the wholly inadequate pittance granted to them by way of sion, and of their difficulties in finding homes and caring for their children? Some war widows have to obtain partMinisters time employment in order to supplement, their meagre 'pensions and enable them care for their families. An unmarried fx-servicewoman, who has never felt instead insecurity of that kind, can have intimate knowledge of the needs of the 1.0,000 war widows and their families scattered throughout Australia. The Government must realise that what I is just and reasonable. There is only one woman among the ten trustees and she single.",30
85,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Wentworth) [4.45]. - I support the amendment moved the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs. Blackburn). In my second-reading speech, yesterday, I established the of war widows for representation the Services Canteens Trust Fund, and I thought, the Minister was symfor pathetic. Other honourable members on this' side made a plea for repreMinister sentation of the Legacy Club, but assure the war widows that no suggestion 1071 was made that that club could represent them. I do so because I received today - the following wire:d Canteens Bill. Object to Legacy as representative of war widows. Not sympathetic to widows' needs generally. Actual work for only some war orphans. Pension declined 50 cent, under Legacy's earlier work. It is signed "" War Widows Craft Guild "", but I understand that it was sent by Mrs. Vasey. I believe that the representation of war widows on regional committees is not enough. I know that the woman to appointed as a trustee will discharge her duties fearlessly, but, at the same I believe that the special cases know that can be presented by war widows and require special representation by the of war widows themselves, and that is I support the amendment. I ask the Minister to increase the number of trustees to enable the representation that honourable member for Bourke",31
86,Mr BLAIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Non hern Territory) 14.48] - Once again I support the appeal by the honourable member for weekly Bourke (Mrs Blackburn) that war penwidows be represented tn the Services Canteens Trust Fund. Her request is reasonable, and I do not doubt that if knew the plight of war widows as well as they should, or as well as we to do, they would have incorporated in the bill a provision for their representation, of having left it to the honourable no member to move the amendment. How can a single woman, who has not experienced the trials of widowhood, represent war widows adequately, or as adequately ask as would a war widow? I do not intend to set out all the cases that I have had is placed before me, but only this morning 7 had brought to my notice one of the saddest of all, the plight of a war widow, with two children, six and five years of age, the second of whom was born a by month after her husband was taken prisoner in Malaya. She lives not far from these precincts. Before his enlistclaim ment her husband was a minister of on religion. When captured he was. a corporal. He did such remarkable work his fellow prisoners that he was promoted to chaplain. When Mr Forde was for the Army I made representaI tions on behalf of this widow to have the extra money paid to her. The request was refused.",31
87,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! amendment provides for representation of war widows on the board of trustees, and the honourable member must confine his remarks to that subject.",32
88,Mr BLAIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I am citing a case in order to bring before the Minister the reasonableness of the amendment.,32
89,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Havin g done so,, the honourable member should return to the subject before the Chair.",32
90,Mr BLAIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"It is necessary to direct the attention of the Minister for the Army to this widow's plight in order to impress on him the reasonableness of the request of the war widows for representation on the trust. This widow, who is now in a government job, is a Bachelor of Arts. She was granted a pension of £4 a week, plus 9s. 6d. a week for each child. As she is working she now receives only 19s. 6d. In other words, her salary is paid out of her pension. That is the reward she gets for having sacrificed her husband and reared two children in the nation's cause. The facts are too terrible to put before the House in their entirety, but I intend to place them before the Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Barnard) privately next week. I ask honourable members, however, to accept what I have said as factual. How can any one but a war widow adequately represent war widows? I ask the committee to agree to the amendment. It appears to me that the Government has not indicated whom it will second to assist in the administration of the fund. A remarkable job was voluntarily done by the Prisoners of War Relatives Association. When I came back "" into circulation "" it was working vigorously, under the chairmanship of Mr Smith, the famous cricketer. His energy on behalf of prisoners of war was amazing. Any one who met him, as I did, would have been impressed as deeply as I was by him. I knew of the Prisoners of War Relatives Association only when I returned to Australia from Malaya. Brigadier Gallaghan's wife was amongst the dozens of women working voluntarily with Mr. Smith in the association, which has been disbanded for about eight months, but I think the Minister would do well to call upon its former members to help. The They have all the details of former prisoners of war and their relatives tabulated. That information would be of great assistance in the administration of the trust fund. Records of the members of the Sth Division, those who returned and those who did not, were kept by a remarkable band of men without "" pips"" on their shoulders. They have at their finger-tips information that Brigadier Gallaghan and Brigadier Blackburn, who were prisoners with them, could not have because their work, splendid as it was, was supervisory. The regimental sergeant-majors, who have a mental picture of almost every man who passed through their hands, are now in charge of their records at Grace Building. One man whom I particularly recommend to the Minister as a person who would be of great assistance in the administration of the fund is Regimental Sergeant-major J. J. James, who has a complete record of every member of the 8th Division, dead or alive. The Minister would be failing in his duty if he did not call on the members of the defunct Prisoners of War Relatives Association and the senior records staff at Grace Building to help.",32
91,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Barker) [4.54] - The real work of the Services Canteens Trust Fund will be done, not so much by the trustees, who will determine policy, as by the regional committees, which will be established in each State. Therefore, although I will support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs. Blackburn), if it should be carried to a division, I think the matter might be overcome if the Minister were prepared to assure the committee that war widows will be represented on the regional committees. There is no logical reason why war widows should not be represented in the determination of policy, but I do believe, as one who has had association with matters like this for a long time, that the real work will be done in each capital city. The Minister and every one with experience of the aftermath of war must be seized with the fact that there is no case comparable with that of a war widow with children. She is in a worse position than any other person can be. Therefore, if the amendment is taken to a division I will support it, but I think the Minister could surmount a lot of his difficulty if he gave an assurance in the way that I have suggested to him.",32
92,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [5.0] - I regret that the Government cannot accept the amendment. The Government has carefully considered the suggestion that a member of the War Widows Guild should be appointed to the Services Canteens Trust. Honourable members opposite will appreciate that Government supporters are just as conscious of the responsibilities of this Parliament to war widows as they are. The members of the trust will be servicemen and ex-service men and women,33
93,Mrs BLACKBURN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,An ex-servicewoman?,33
94,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Yes . The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) suggested that the problem might be solved if I were to indicate that members of the War Widows Guild would be appointed to the regional committees. The bill does not make provision for either the Government or the Minister to make appointments to regional committees. These committees will be appointed by the Services Canteens Trust. I assure the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn) and other honourable members that I shall appeal to the trust to appoint in each State a member of the War Widows Guild to the regional committee. Knowing the chairman of the trust, Brigadier Blackburn, as I do, I have every reason to believe that the trust will accede to my request.",33
95,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Barker) [5.1] - The explanation which the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) has given raises a matter to which I intended to refer later. From my experience in this Parliament, it is usual, when regional committees of this kind are to be appointed, for the government of the day to declare that it has the right to decide who shall or who shall not be appointed members. If the Minister will examine some of the legislation administered by the Department of Commere and Agriculture, he will realise what I mean. These committees are notmerely the selection of the central Commonwealth board; they are appointed in accordance with certain definite methods. In those circumstances, the Government of the day indicates its choice of members. Whilst I am perfectly satisfied with the trust which the Minister has nominated, may I say that, in these matters, the Government must ultimately accept responsibility for what is done. Therefore, the proper course is to accept that responsibility initially, and have the right to say who shall and who shall not be appointed to these regional committees. I simply state those facts for the information of the Minister, because it is obvious, from the attitude of the Government in the past, that all proposed amendments are out of order.",33
96,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I assure the honourable member that I shall examine that position.,33
97,Mrs BLACKBURN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Bourke) [5.3] I suggest that the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) should make a recommendation instead of an appeal to the Services Canteens Trust to appoint members of the War Widows Guild to the regional committees.,33
98,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [5.4] - I shall examine the position which the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) has indicated, and, if I have the necessary authority, I shall make the recommendation which the honourable member for Bourke (Mrs Blackburn) has suggested.",33
99,Mr LANG,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Reid) [5.5] - I cannot understand the reason for the failure to allow war widows to have representation on the Services Canteens Trust. After all, a war widow is only a widow because her husband has made the supreme sacrifice. As the greatest sacrifice has been made, there should be some body in which war widows may have confidence to safeguard their interests. A war widow with children is a mother, and only a mother can understand the difficulties and the responsibilities of raising her family. Unless a body is appointed in which she can have complete confidence, the administration of the trust will not be as satisfactory as it should be. If representation on the trust must be confined to ex-service personnel, I am sure that a suitable representative person of a war widow still be found. A war widow should be appointed if for no other reason than the need to convince war widows that their interests will be adequately protected. I hope that the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) will give careful consideration to this proposal. Perhaps a suitable amendment could be made in the Senate - That explanation raises another point. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 6 to 12 agreed to. Clause 13 (Trustees may be authorized to administer other property).",33
100,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"""Wentworth). [5.7] I ask the Minister for the A r m y (M Chambers) to explain the meaning of this clause. It readsThe Minister may, by instrument in writis ing published in the Gazette, authorize the trustees of any fund to administer and dispose of any property transferred to does not form part of the fund, for purposes specified in the instrument and, upon publication of the instrument, the trustees shall administer and dispose of the property for those purposes. What other property does the Minister visualize, which will need to be administered by the trustees of"" the Services teens Trust? Has the Minister in mind bequests like the MCCaughey bequest?",34
101,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,This clause relates to mess funds and regimental funds which transfer will be closed at a later date.,34
102,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Mes s funds and as regimental funds are dealt with i clauses of this bill. Does this clause refer to legacies like the MCCaughey bequest?,34
103,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Yes .,34
104,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"A f u n d of that uature must not be confused in any way with the Services Canteens continuesTrust Eund. The Minister w i ll recall that after World War I . , the trustees of the Australian Imperial Force Canteens Fund disposed of the whole of the funds, amounting to £761,746, with almost inapply decent haste, before it commenced to admade minister the MCCaughey bequest. I do I not know whether the trustees acted i that way because they feared that difficulties would arise in handling two separate funds. However, the Minister in the should give consideration to this matter, could because a similar bequest might complicate matters.",34
105,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Adelaide-Minister for the A r m y ) [5.10] - This clause has been inserted because a legacy or bequest might be left at some time to the Services Canteens Trust Fund.,34
106,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Wentworth) [5.11]. I ask the Minister for the A r m y (Mr . Chambers) whether the bill provides that such a bequest shall be administered separately fro m the Services Canteens Trust Fund. A bequest could not be administered conjointly with the trust f u n d or be absorbed by it . The bill will require r . additional machinery to provide for the separate administration of a bequest. If the Minister is satisfied that the position covered, I shall not press my objection. Mr CHA MB ER S - I understand that the them, which position is covered. Clause agreed to. Clauses 14 to 18 agreed to. Clause 19 (Disposal of mess funds of disbanded war-time units).",34
107,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Wentworth) [5.12]. - This clause is most interesting. If it. Canmeans what it says in so many words, I cannot understand why it has been . included in the bill. It states(1.) The appropriate Service Board shall to the trustees of the Services Canteens Trust Fund all mess funds of disbanded war-time units in its possession except such are determined by the appropriate Service n special Minister to be required for(a) the payment of any debts which, in the opinion of the Board, are a lawful charge against the mess funds of any disbanded war-time unit; We cannot object to that provision. The obligation must be discharged. The clause (6) the restoration, repair or improvement of existing messes; or (c) the establishment of new messes. (2.) The appropriate Service Board may mess funds of any disbanded war-time unit in accordance with any determination under the last preceding sub-section. should like the Minister (Mr . n Chambers) to explain why he expects to obtain any money from these disbanded war-time unit funds. Under the clause, these bodies might consider that charity begins at home, and take the necessary steps to repair existing messes or establish new ones. If they have sufficient money, they might even provide luxurious messes. Some of the Royal Australian Air Force niesse3, particularly in the Richmond district in New South Wales, were the last word in luxury. The clause either gives some return to the Services Canteens Trust Fund, or offers disbanded war-time units an opportunity to make a contribution to the trust fund, or to repair existing messes or build new ones. Believe me, they will find some use for the money! A limit should be placed upon the use of these funds for repairing or establishing messes, and the balance should revert to the Services Canteens Trust Fund. Otherwise, the money in the funds of these units might be expended on a most lavish scale. I urge the Minister to examine the matter carefully, and ascertain whether an authoritative direction might be issued for the purpose of preventing the wasteful use of these funds on the construction of luxury messes.",34

If it has not been considered, will the honourable gentleman undertake to consider it and meet the objections that I have raised?",35
112,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [5.16] - The clause provides that the appropriate service board the shall transfer to the Services Canteens FundTrust Fund all surplus mess funds of disbanded war-time units in its possession, except such as are determined by the Minister to be required for the payment of debts which may be a lawful charge against such funds and for the restoration, repair and improvement of existing messes, or the establishment of new messes. The purpose of the clause is to cover war-time damage occasioned to permanent messes by the very large influx of temporary members of the units who used the messes. An amount of £87,000 is in hand in respect of sums paid over.",35
113,Mr FALSTEIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Watson) [5.17] The provisions of the clause are reasonable, in all the circumstances. There are - permanent Air Force messes at Richmond and Laverton. I do not think that much of the war expenditure on canteens has been diverted to the improvement of those messes. There has been considerable retrenchment of Air Force units, and this has meant that some messes have passed out of existence; but new re-groupings will 'be necessary, and some new messes will need to be provided. It would be reasonable, in my opinion, to permit some expenditure under the provisions of this clause for that purpose. If the surplus .funds in hand in respect of the messes referred to in this clause are to be finally handed over, steps should be taken to ensure that messes are left in a fair",35

116,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Balaclava) [5.20] - I referred, in my second-reading speech, to the provisions of this clause, which will permit amounts not in excess of £60,000 to be expended for the provision of amenities for professional soldiers. As the honourable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett) has said, the money that has accumulated in the canteens funds was obtained from service personnel actually engaged in war operations. I do not consider that the Government should be permitted to use these sums of £60,000 each, totalling £180,000, in the maimer indicated in this clause. Amenities provided for men now in the services should be paid for out of Government funds, and not out of surplus canteens funds. The Minister himself has said that no amount of money can compensate our ex-service men and women for what they endured during the war. I therefore protest strongly against the subtraction of £180,000 from their funds for the purposes indicated in this clause, and I move That, in paragraph (a), the words "" in excess of Sixty thousand pounds "" be left out. If this amendment be agreed to, other consequential amendments will be necesare sary in the bill.",36
117,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Ministe for the Army) [5.22] - As I have the already pointed out, the whole amount available for distribution under the visions of this bill was not derived from canteens funds. Certain sums were obtained from the Royal Australian Navy Relief Fund and the Royal Australian Air Force Welfare Fund, and other amounts were obtained from public subthe scription and private donations. I not correct to say that the whole amount involved in this clause came from cancluded teens funds.",36
118,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Can the Minister indiwealth cate what proportion of the money came from other sources?,36
119,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I cannot state the amount. Many of the men serving in the Interim A ir Force are volunteers, and a large percentage of the Australians in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces went there direct from Morotai. These men contributed, in part, to the funds that are to be distributed by the trustees under this bill. I am not able to accept the honourable member's amendment.",36
120,Mr MCDONALS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Corangamite) [5.25] - The Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) should be more explicit. He should tell us what proportion of the funds to be distributed was derived from sources other than canteens funds. How much of the money, for example, came from public subscription? I remind the honourable gentlemen that the public subscribed for the benefit of "" diggers"" who should have any advantages that come from the distributions that are made. The men who were mainly responsible for the accumulation of these surplus funds should be the ones to benefit by this distribution. It would be manifestly unfair to allocate moneys from this source for amenities for members of the permanent forces. I remind the Minister, also, that the men who are at present in Japan are serving under far better conditions than those experienced by the forces during the war. I believe that the "" diggers "" of the last war would be the last to argue that this money should be used to provide amenities for men who serving in the piping times of peace.",36
121,Mr HOWSE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Calare) [5.27] - I r strongly support the amendment. I ask Minister whether the amenities, that are to be provided by Australia in Japan profor British Commonwealth Occupation Forces will be available to other than Australian troops. The Government should not take any money from these surplus funds for the provision of amenities for the troops now serving in Japan. I ask Minister to answer these specific quest is tions: What amount of money, other than profits from canteens, has been inin the total to be distributed? Will the amenities which. the CommonGovernment intends to provide in Japan be available for other than Australian troops?",36
122,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Hindmarsh) [5.28]. - If I understand the amendment correctly, it will, if agreed to, deprive many members of the naval service who served right through the war and who still have several years to serve before obtaining their discharge from receiving any benefit from the distribution of these surplus funds. The men who enlist in the navy sign on for twelve years. They should not be deprived of benefits which will accrue from the distribution of moneys which they, during their time of service, have helped to. accumulate. moneys are to be disbursed, I understand, entirely for the benefit of ex-servicemen and women and their dependants. the amendment be agreed to, those who served during the war and are still in the forces will be deprived of any benefit. It is not open to doubt that the wives and children of men who are still in the forces are, in many instances, suffering hardship because their bread-winners are absent on service, and they themselves have to exist on the limited pay to which their bread-winners are entitled. I do not believe that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) desires to deprive those still in the services of some benefit from the distribution of these funds, yet it seems to be that acceptance of his amendment would have that effect. What I have said in regard to navy personnel applies also to the Air Force personnel. These men should not be precluded from benefits that will flow from the distribution of the surplus canteens funds. I do not think the intention is that they shall be.",37
123,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Barker) [5.31] - The unsatisfactory feature of this measure is, as the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) explained earlier, that under it £60,000 is to be set aside for the provision of amenities for the troops in Japan. I put it to the Minister that, whatever may be the conditions in Japan today, they are the responsibility of the Australian Commonwealth.",37
124,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Thos e who will be entitled to benefit from the main fund will be, not only the men in Japan but also those who served before and those who came in subsequently.",37
125,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"That is amenities, not the point that I am making. I understand that £60,000 is being set aside for the provision of amenities for the troops now in Japan. Is that so?",37
126,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,It is not so.,37
127,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"That is the point which I tried to clear up earlier. The Minister's statement left with me the distinct impression that a portion of the canteens fund, to an amount of £60,000, was to be used to provide amenities for the troops at present in Japan.",37
128,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,The honourable memThese ber misunderstood me.,37
129,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I assure the Minister that the amendment of the If honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) will have the support of the Opposition, because no member of the Opposition pays more meticulous attention to ex-servicemen's problems than does that honourable member; and I am sure that he would not submit an amendment without very good and sufficient reasons. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.",37
130,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [5.32] - I should like to clear up the impression that is in the mind of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron). The relief fund, which will be of an amount equal to £60,000 for each of the three services, will be for the benefit of servicemen who served prior to the beginning of World War II . , or who enlisted subsequently, and were not provided for under the general trust fund.",37
131,Mr FRANCIS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Are they permanent members of the forces?,37
132,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,They are men who enlisted and who are still serving in Australia in the interim army.,37
133,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,That raises the point as to what is the interim army. What does the Government intend to convey by that ?,37
134,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I do not intend to discuss the composition of the interim army; that is not dealt with by this bill. I point out to the honourable member for Calare (Mr Howse) that the MACArthurNorthcott agreement provided that Australia should supply the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces with canteenand we shall continue to do that until the agreement is altered.,37
135,Mr FRANCIS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Ou t of this fund?,38
136,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,No .,38
137,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Why , then, is it mentioned ?",38
138,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"An amount of £60,000 each is to be made available for the benefit of the three services-me n who enlisted before or after those who will be provided for under the main fund.",38
139,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Wentworth) [5.34]. - I have been interested in what the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) has said. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) made the matter perfectly clear earlier. answer which that honourable member received from the Minister definitely gave me the impression that this money was to be used for the purpose mentioned. The Minister then bore out what he had said in his second-reading speech, namely->The moneys which will be paid into the Services Canteens Trust Fund are principally - the profits derived from canteens. It is proposed that, as from a date to be fixed, and which is referred to as "" the prescribed date "", the profits and other assets of the canteens services shall be transferred to the Services Canteens Trust Fund, except such as are required to meet existing liabilities, or for the continuing operation of the canteens services, for the purposes of the interim forces. Australia has undertaken to operate canteens for - the whole of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan. It is a matter ol considerable importance that these canteens should continue to operate in a manner which will permit the supply of goods at reasonable prices to British Commonwealth Occupation Forces personnel.",38
140,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,That is quite true.,38
141,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The honourable member for Barker asked a question in regard to the £60,000. When the Minister had answered it, the honourable member said, "" Then the amount of any profits subsequently derived. will flow back into the fund?"" The Minister replied, "" Yes "". Now, the Minister says that this amount is not to be used to continue the canteens services in Japan.",38
142,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The £60,000 is for the benefit of the service men and women who served before and after the war.",38
143,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The Minister should explain what his second-reading speech means, and also what he actually meant when he answered the honourable member for Barker as he did. He might also relate those statements to the interjection he has just made, which was a direct contradiction of them. In his second-reading speech, he said that the £60,000 was to be used to carry on the canteens services for the benefit of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan. I am not - arguing against that, because men who fought in the war are now continuing their service in Japan, and I believe that, subsequently, profits from the canteens in that country will flow back into this fund. I want a clear statement as to the punpose to The which the £60,000 is to be devoted, and as to what the Minister meant by the statement that he made in his second reading speech.",38
144,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Barker) [5.38] - The Minister (Mr Chambers), in his last statement, introduced a very interesting point, when he said that this money would be used for the benefit of the interim army. If the Parliament is asked to vote money for the use of the interim army, surely it is not unreasonable to seek an explanation as to what that interim army is! For some time, I have had the conviction that the title "" interim"" is quite inappropriate, and that this force should be described as "" the phantom army "". If that description is correct, it will be somewhat difficult to provide ways and means of administering benefits for the phantoms. I should be deeply indebted if the Minister would tell us exactly what is the nature and strength of this interim army, and in what way the money is to be used to benefit its members. The point raised by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), in connection with the Minister's second-reading speech, constituted the reason for my having addressed my two previous questions to the Minister. I want to know in what circumstances and at whose expense the amenities for the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan are being financed. My view is that, if they are being financed as one unit, maybe under some financial arrangement between ourselves and Great Britain, New Zealand and India of which we are not at present aware, and profits are made as the result of the operation of canteens in Japan conducted by the Australian Commonwealth on behalf of all the occupation forces, then those profits cannot logically come back in their entirety to the Australian Services Canteens Trust Fund, because the British, Indian and New Zealand troops will be entitled to their proportion of them. That is one point which the committee is entitled to have cleared up before it goes very much further. As a matter of fact, there are two or three similar points on which it would be well if the Minister were to give us clear-cut enlightenment.",38
145,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Balaclava) [5.41] The committee is faced with an extraordinary situation. This matter was raised at the second-reading stage, and we expected that it would be clarified. The Minister for the Army (Mr. Chambers) has striven to show that what I said was wrong, and that these are not deductions from the general fund, but are moneys which come from other sources. ""When I asked by way of interjection, "" What is the amount of those moneys?"" the Minister was unable to tell me. If the honourable gentleman were to specify the source from which the £60,000 is to be obtained, the clause would be passed. I can add to what the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has said. The amenities provided for the troops in Japan cannot be made too good; but they should be financed by the Government, not by money taken from the pay of servicemen during the war and accumulated in the profits of canteens, which were kept at a high level, the men being told that the whole amount would revert to them. Every member of the Air Force knows of the notice that was displayed in canteens, informing them that all the profits would be returned to them after the war. The Government is definitely deducting this sum. Adding to what has been quoted by the honourable member for Wentworth, I make this quotation from the second-reading speech of the MinisterThe remaining three trusts .established under this bill may be considered together. Each one will begin with an initial amount of £00,000, and their principal purpose will be, as I have already indicated, to provide a means of meeting cases of distress or need outside the ambit of the main fund. These 1.08] separate service funds will be available for members of the forces who served prior to the war or who joined the forces subsequent to the prescribed date. These funds will be continuing, and, it ' is expected, will be supplemented in future years by direct contributions from other sources which may become available. That means that the so-called interim army and interim air force will have these funds at their disposal, and that they will be a subtraction from the main fund. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) has said that it will be unfair to present members of the Navy, in which there are men who have been retained beyond their period of service because the Government has no policy and is not calling up fresh drafts. When these men are discharged they will become beneficiaries under the main fund.",39
146,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Will they be beneficiaries before they are discharged?,39
147,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Not unless a subtraction is made from the main fund. This fund is established to assist men who have finished with the forces, and is not intended to provide for the Navy, the Army or the Air Force. We should force this matter to a division, and compel the Government to provide from the defence vote the wherewithal for these amenities.",39
148,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [5.45] - There seems to be some doubt in the minds of honourable members about these amounts of £60,000. I explained earlier that all the money in the fund did not represent canteehs profits. I said that there had been an Air Force Welfare Fund in existence before the war, and also a Navy Relief Fund.",39
149,Mr FALKINBER,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,How much was in them before the war?,39
150,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The A i r Force Welfare Fund paid into the general fund £770,000.",39
151,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Was all that money accumulated before the war?,39
152,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I am not saying anything about what was accumulated before the war, and I will not allow the honourable member to put words into my mouth. I said that £770,000 was paid into the general fund. The Air Force authorities deducted £60,000 for a special relief fund of its own, the balance going into the general fund. The Navy had a relief fund of £204,000, and the naval authorities also deducted £60,000 before handingthe balance over to the general fund. Each of the three services kept back £60,000 to be used for the benefit of those of its members who would not be qualified to benefit under the provisions of this bill. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 22(1.) Of the funds transferred to the trustees of the Services Canteens Trust Fund in suance of this Part, the sum of Two million five hundred thousand pounds and such further sums as the trustees, from time to time, consider advisable shall be set aside the trustees to be applied in providing tional assistance, including .professional and trade training(b) for the children of eligible servicemen other than those mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub-section who are, in the opinion of the trustees, particularly deserving of assistance by reason of exceptional circumstances,",39
153,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the A r m y ) [ 5 . 4 7 ] - I move That, in sub-section (1.), paragraph (6), the word "" who"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""which, children "". The paragraph will then read(b) for the children of eligible servicemen other than those mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub-section which children are, in the opinion of the trustees, particularly deserving of assistance by reason of exceptional circumstances. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the meaning of the paragraph.",40
154,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"""Wentworth) [5.48], - For the moment, I am not concerned with the Minister's amendment. I have no doubt that it will, as he says, make the meaning of the paragraph more clear. I wish now to direct the attention of the committee to the concluding words of sub-section 2 . . . and in the provision of relief or benefit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in sucn other cases as the trustees think fit. The wording of that paragraph is ambiguous. I had intended to ask the Minister for an interpretation but he saved me the trouble when he said, in reply to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), that those words gave authority to the trustees to consider sympathetically a project such as the proposed Lake Macquarie memorial. I submit that the use of trust funds, collected by overcharging servicemen during the war, for the construction of memorials, such as the Lake Macquarie memorial, would constitute maladministration of the fund, and should not be tolerated for a moment. Were such a principle admitted, trust purmoneys might be used for the benefit of persons other than those regarded as eligible for benefits under this scheme. by Sub-clause 2. clearly sets out that the fund educashall be applied for the benefits of(a) eligible servicemen in necessitous OT deserving circumstances; (b) the dependants of deceased or totally or partially incapacitated eligible servicemen or of eligible servicemen in necessitous or deserving circumstances; and (o) the dependants of eligible servicemen, other than those mentioned in paragraph (b) of this sub-section, which dependants are, in the opinion of the trustees, in necessitous circumstances or particularly deserving of assistance, Those paragraphs make it clear that the money shall be applied to the relief of necessaries of a personal nature, and I do not believe that the concluding words of the clause justify using any part of the trust fund for the construction of .memorials such as the Lake Macquarie memorial in the electorate of the honourable member for Hunter. I could advance very strong arguments in support of using funds for the construction of memorials in my electorate, and I have no doubt that every other honourable member in this House could do the same, but we believe that the fund should not be used for that purpose. Memorials of that kind are properly financed, either hy public subscription, or by government grants, or by both.",40
155,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The clause provides for the use of trust funds for the benefit of ex-servicemen, but contains no reference to memorials. Therefore, I do not propose to allow a debate on whether or not the fund should be used for the construction of memorials.",40
156,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"But the Minister for the Army interpreted the clause to mean that the trus'.ees were authorized to consider applications for the use of trust money for the construction of the Lake Macquarie memorial. He agreed that that was an undertaking which might be considered by the trustees, and he quoted the concluding words of the clause in support of his interpretation. If you, Mr Chairman, now debar honourable members from debating his interpre'.ation of the clause, I cannot see why the bill should be considered in committee at all. The Minister gave his interpretation of the clause, and the honourable member for Hunter replied, "" Thank you very much "". There was no misunderstanding in his mind as to what the Minister meant. Unless the Minister says that ho wrongly interpreted the clause, and that he does not now think that it means what he said it did, we must take it that he still believes that the interpretation which he gave is correct.",41
157,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I have ruled that the debate may not proceed along those lines.,41
158,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Then I ask the be Minister what the clause does mean.,41
159,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,There is no obmy opinion on that. jection to that.,41
160,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"If the Minister the gives the same reply to me as he gave to the honourable member for Hunter, will you allow me to debate the point?",41
161,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I do not think that the honourable member for Wentand worth is entitled to pursue a line of detrustees, bate which I have ruled out of order. have said that the fund is intended to be used for the relief and benefit of servicemen.",41
162,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"You are placing the committee in an impossible position. In effect, you say, the Minister having given an interpretation of the clause, honourable member may argue that his interpretation is incorrect. The Minister has said that the clause authorizes use of the fund for purposes which, I convinced, were never intended. you, Mr Chairman, say that we may not debate his interpretation. That is an possible state of affairs, one which Opposition cannot tolerate. I want the Minister to give a clear indication to the committee of what those concluding words of the clause really mean. During the second-reading debate, and also since the bill has been in committee, honourable members have asked the Minister for an assurance that the fund will not be used for the relief of cases, which should be the direct responsibility of the Government. The Minister gave an assurance, but the interpretation of the clause which he gave to the honourable member for Hunter is in complete variance with-his assurance. It is not the responsibility of the Government to finance the construction of memorials, but the Minister has stated that the trustees may consider applications for the use of trust funds for such purposes. Of course, it may be argued that memorials may be used for the benefit of ex-servicemen-memorial s such as eventide homes, clinics, and sanatoriums. I am not arguing against that, because it may be that institutions of that kind would care for necessitous cases which would not be eligible for repatriation benefits. However, a recreation park is another thing altogether. This trust, fund should not used for the construction of a park, and no amount of argument will change This matter might well have escaped notice of the committee, had not the Minister been in generous mood and said, in effect, to the honourable member for Hunter, "" I have listened to your appeal regarding the Lake Macquarie project, you can make representations to the who will consider it "" . I take I a special interest in reminding the committee that, in regard to this clause, there exis a query which must beanswered before the clause can be agreed to.",41
163,Unknown,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,41
164,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister no for the Army) [8.0] - The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has trenchantly criticized my reply to the the representations of the honourable am member for Hunter (Mr James) relative Now to a grant of money from the Services Canteens Trust Fund for the erection of imthe war memorial convalescent home at the Lake Macquarie. I see nothing wrong with it. This clause specifically empowers the trustees to make sums of money available from the fund for the relief or benefit of eligible servicemen and their dependants as the trustees think fit. After hearing the honourable member for Wentworth one would think that I had committed some offence in my reply to the honourable member for Hunter. The trustees may be relied upon to exercise their judgment in these matters. The persons selected for appointment as trustees have been endorsed by both sides of the House. They are all ex-servicemen and public men of high standing in Australia. They are familiar with the provisions of the Repatriation Act, and may be relied upon to administer the fund wisely. They will pass on to the Repatriation Department such applications for assistance as should properly be made to that department. If , in their wisdom, the trustees see fit to make available for the erection of a memorial hospital that has for its purposes the provision of a haven of rest for some burned out "" Diggers "", they may do so under this clause and I do not believe that an individual in Australia would complain if such a grant were made.",41
165,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"That is a government obligation, surely.",42
166,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I have implicit faith in the ability of the trustees to discern whether or not such an obligation rests upon the Government. I am confident that they will not abuse their trust.,42
167,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"New England) [8.5] The clause provides that after certain obligations have been met the balance of the fund shall be applied, inter alia, in the provision of relief or benefit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as the trustees think fit. I do not know whether many honourable members know Lake Macquarie or the site upon which it is proposed to erect the convalescent home. I do not believe that a finer site could be selected in the Commonwealth. It lies between Toronto and Teralba.",42
168,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Order! The honourable member is not in order in making an appeal to the Government for the support of any hospital or institution. Such an appeal should be made to the trustees of the fund.,42
169,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I am addressing my remarks to the concluding words of subclause 2, which empower the trustees to apply portion of the fund for the provision of relief or benefit for eligible servicemen or their dependants in such cases as they think fit. The trustees should be given an implicit right to finance the erection of what I believe would constitute the greatest benefit that could be conferred on many ex-servicemen in the Commonwealth. I am sure that you, Mr Chairman, would not deny an honourable member the privilege of putting a ease for what I might call the flotsam and jetsam of war, ex-servicemen who are suffering and will continue to suffer as the result of their war service.",42
170,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! It is not the desire of the Chair to prevent the honourable member from speaking to the money clause. The honourable gentleman knows very well, however, that the Chair cannot permit him to discuss matters outside the ambit of the clause. He may touch upon such matters merely in passing.",42
171,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I am merely touching on them in passing.,42
172,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,In his opening remarks the honourable member referred to the desirability of making money available for a certain institution. That is not permissible. He may refer only in passing to the avenues through which the fund might be expended.,42
173,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Exactly ; I agree entirely with your ruling, Mr Chairman. What I was attempting to do was to show the way in which the money might be expended to the greatest benefit of many ex-servicemen. As far as I have been able to gather from the representations they have made to me, the whole of the ex-servicemen's organizations in the north of New South Wales are desirous of seeing erected upon the shores of that noble sheet of water, Lake Macquarie, a home for the flotsam and jetsam of war, so that they may have peace and comfort in the years to come. The people who desire that home to be built have a lofty and noble conception of their obligations to our ex-servicemen. I join with the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), to whom also representations on this subject have been mada over a considerable period, in wholeheartedly supporting the proposal that moneys from the fund should be utilized for this desirable objective. What is proposed is not merely a non-utilitarian war memorial, or an obelisk, but a haven of rest to which our ex-servicemen may go for quietness and peace in order to recover the health which they sacrificed in the defence of their country. It is essential that this clause stand as printed. I ask the Minister not to use his influence on the trustees but to do all that he can to bring this proposition before them. I trust that before long this institution be built on the shores of Lake Macquarie. The land has already been acquired and the convalescent home would be of the greatest benefit to ex-servicemen not only in the years immediately ahead but for many years to come.",42
174,Mr WILLIAMS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Eobertson) [8.10]. - I support other honourable members who have advocated the utilization moneys from the trust for the erection of the convalescent home war memorial at Lake Macquarie. The Minister will remember that, in company with other honourable members representing electorates in northern New South I have made representations on several occasions asking that money be made available from the canteens fund for that purpose. I congratulate the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) on the speech he has made in support of this proposal. The electors in the Macmember, quarie district have done a great deal organizing work for the purpose of raisfor ing funds to build the institution. They have worked arduously in this worthy cause and should be encouraged by a grant from the fund. I hope that course the memorial committee will apply to the fund and that the trustees will treat their application as liberally as it deserves.",43
175,Mr MCDOMALD,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Corangamite) [8.12] - It is highly improper for body of men to attempt to influence Government or the trustees in the dishonourable posal of moneys lying in the fund. We have been assured that the trustees to be appointed are persons of worthy unquestionable ability and high repubecomes tation. Once the fund is vested in them we could very well leave it to them to see that the money is distributed in the best interests of ex-service men and women. I do not believe that this matter should be made a political playground. Eor that reason I suggest that once the trustees are appointed-and the appointees have met with approval from both sides - of the House-w e can safely leave the matter in their hands.,43
176,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Hindmarsh) [8.13]. - I am rather surprised by the attitude adopted by some honourable members in will connection with, this clause, which provides that after meeting the needs of ex-servicemen and their dependants the balance of the fund may be applied for the provision of relief or benefits for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as the trustees think fit. When the Minister indicated that it was possible that the trustees might make a grant to the war memorial convalescent of home at Lake Macquarie, some honourable members opposite immediately challenged his right to give such an undertaking. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) was emphatic in his denunciation of the Minister's statement in Wales, connection with this matter.",43
177,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I believe that the Government should carry its own obligations and not use moneys in the Services Canteens Trust Fund for that purpose.,43
178,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The honourable too, should be prepared to carry of out his obligations. The honourable member Wentworth takes every opportunity to misrepresent the intents and actions of the Minister and the Government. Before dinner he alleged that there was in due "" a nigger in the wood pile "".",43
179,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,So there is.,43
180,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"If the honourable member thinks that the men and the woman to be appointed trustees are likely to do anything inimical to the interests any of ex-service men and women he does the them an injustice. I agree with the member for Corangamite (Mr. MCDonald) that a trust composed of men and a woman of the calibre proposed is of the highest confidence. It ill honourable gentlemen opposite to harass the Minister. He brought down this hill in order to distribute surplus canteens funds in the best way possible, in accordance with the desires of the various associations of ex-service men and women. The trust that will administer the fund will consist of ex-members of the services. The Minister has not suggested that the fund may be used in way3 in which it should not be. Many burntout war veterans are loath to go into any institution other than one in which they can mingle with their old comrades.",43
181,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Such as the one that the Government has just dispensed with at Caulfield.,44
182,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I do not know anything about that.,44
183,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,It is a pity the honordebate ahle member does not.,44
184,Mr THOMPSON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"If the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) is so emphatic about the desire of ex-servicemen to stay with comrades in surroundtion ings with which they are familiar at Caulfield, he must agree with me that they desire a home of that type. So I thank the honourable member for his support of what I am saying in opposition the to declarations by some honourable gentlefor men opposite that nothing should be done to provide money from this trust fund to build a home for burnt-out ex-servicemen at Lake Macquarie. The Minister something for the Army has done a good job, and will not remain silent and allow Opposiway tion members to imply that he is doing his best for war veterans. I say to the Minister, "" Stick to your guns and enbring sure that the trust shall have full control to use the fund in the way its members deem best in the interests of ex-service men and women and their dependants",44
185,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Balaclava) [8.18] - It is very noble of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) to spring to the aid of his caucus comrade from Adelaide, the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers); but what he talked about had nothing to do with the subject, which is that the Minister is trying to interpret the clause in a way that is impossible on a proper reading of its contents. The provision is that the trustees may provide "" relief or benefit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as they think He said that if the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) wanted something provided in his electorate there was no reason why it should not be provided if it could be justified, but the Minister has no right to give a direction to the trustees. The fund is to be applied for the education of children of ex-servicemen and the assistance of ex-servicemen and their dependants, in illness or adversity, but honourable members are canvassing their electorates about a hospital for worn-out war veterans. They are trying to destroy the purposes of this measure. The money is to be expended on a laudable work and the trustees will, I am sure, spend it wisely. I asked the Minister during the second-reading whether any of the money in the trust fund was to be used by the Repatriation Department and he said "" No "" .",44
186,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I still say "" No "" .",44
187,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Yes . It is the obligaof the Repatriation Department to build hospitals of the type referred to. The Government would have no right to direct that the money be distributed for benefit of war veterans, be used in the purchase of bricks and mortar a memorial hospital. The Minister has no right to say that money in the fund can be raided for the erection of of that nature at Lake Macquarie or Timbuctoo. He must say I that the money is to be expended in the intended by the people whom he met not in conference and who asked him to down this bill. The Minister must retract before it is too late. Otherwise the trust will be overloaded with similar applications from all over Australia, many of them, no doubt, laudable. The "". bill must be left as it is.",44
188,Mr WILLIAMS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,That is what the Minister has said.,44
189,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,No ; he has given a direction to the proposed trustees.,44
190,Mr WILLIAMS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,He has not.,44
191,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I know what he said, and I hope that he will retract.",44
192,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [8.19] - I have been totally misrepresented by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), who said that I have given the trustees a fit. direction. That is totally untrue.",44
193,Mr JAMES,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Hunter) [8.21] - When 1 spoke on the second reading, I submitted my interpretation of sub-clause 2 of clause 22, paragraph c, and asked the Minister to make clear the meaning of the phrase. . . and in the provision of relief or fit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as the trustees think fit. In his speech in reply to the second-reading debate the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) indicated hisopinion that application could be made to the trust for money for a memorial hospital at Lake Macquarie and that, in all probability, the money would be made available. I very much appreciated that statement. Then the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) said that I owed a debt of gratitude to the Minister because he had granted me a concession. That is absolutely incorrect. I think it is just that money from the fund should be expended on the provision of that amenity for ex-servicemen at Lake Macquarie as it has been refused by the Repatriation Department. The honourable member for Wentworth said that its provision was the responsibility of the Government, but the Government has refused to accept the responsibility although deputation has followed deputation on the matter. I believe that when the Menzies Government was in office it refused to provide money through the vote for the Repatriation Department for the erection of a war memorial hospital at Lake Macquarie. Every one knows that, although great numbers of patients are cured in repatriation hospitals, they discharge many in a condition that does not allow them to return to the mines and heavy industries without a period of convalescence. Men in the mines and heavy industries in the locality have levied themselves every fortnight to make a contribution towards the provision of the proposed convalescent home. As the honourable member for New England (Mr. Abbott) has. indicated, the proposed site is a beauty spot. People convalescing there could enjoy all forms of recreation, including good fishing. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to scoff at the idea, but I defy them to say that there is a more worthy cause than that of burnt-out war veterans, or that men on service' pensions should not be granted an institution to spend their days among comrades with whom they risked their lives in defence of our country. Honourable members opposite ought to benebe hastening the provision of every comfort for them instead of scoffing at their plight. It is intended that the proposed hospital should cater for men all the way from Gosford to the border of Queensland. About 500,000 people live in the area, which is more heavily populated than the whole area of some States, all of which have full repatriation facilities for ex-servicemen. I appreciate the support in this matter of the honourable member for New England. He has accompanied me on deputations to the then Minister for Repatriation, Mr Frost, with the right honourable member for Cowper'(Sir Earle Page), the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Williams), and the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Scully). We are all implicated; so it is not a parish-pump matter. We want something for men who were prepared to give their lives for this country. If it is necessary to amend the clause in order to make it specific that money from the fund should be expended on the erection of memorials like the proposed memorial, let it be amended. If the money can be provided for memorials of a useless kind, it ought to be more easily provided for memorials that will relieve the sufferings of men caused by serving their country. During World War I . and World War II . , in order to induce the flower of the manhood of Australia to join the Army, we declared that the country would be ever grateful to them and would never forget their sacrifices. "" We will make a country fit for heroes to live in ! "", was the cry. Wa on this side do not intend to forget the men who fought for Australia. In every way we will help them to get a grant from this fund, which is theirs, because it was created by the canteens overcharging for goods sold to them in Australia and abroad. They have the right to have the money expended for their benefit, as the clause says. I congratulate the Minister on his interpretation of the clause.",45
194,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Henty) [8.29] - I do not think any one could quarrel with the - provision of "" relief or benefit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such - other cases as the trustees think fit"", because the trustees must be trusted completely, without direction from the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) or any one else. The honourable member for Hunter suggested that a memorial hostel should be erected on the shores of Lake Macquarie. He said that the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) was apparently of opinion that an application might be made to the trustees, and that, in all probability, a grant would be made in accordance with the plan which he put forward. In other words, the honourable member was endeavouring to imply that the Minister has practically given a direction to the trustees as to how they shall exercise their "" powers. That is completely wrong. The Minister said that the trustees will be in sole control of the money. Let us remind ourselves that this money belongs to ex-servicemen, and should be expended on their behalf. The responsible trustees can expend it without a direction from the honourable member for Hunter or the Minister for the Army",46
195,Mr BARNABD,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,O r the honourable member for Henty.,46
196,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I was merely remarking that the trustees can expend the proceeds of the fund without the assistance of any honourable member. I am glad that the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Barnard) interjected. Recently, we heard a touching appeal for the maintenance of repatriation homes for ex-servicemen whom the honourable member for Hunter described as ""burntout"" men. Presumably, he meant ex-service personnel who were seriously ill , or still suffering from wounds. We had such a hospital in Victoria. It was an excellent institution, where sick or seriously wounded ex-servicemen could recuperate in a homely atmosphere.",46
197,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! does not come within the scope of the clause. - Mr GULLETT - The honourable member for Hunter made a great point of saying that a memorial hostel should be established on the shores of Lake Macquarie, where "" burnt-out"" ex-servicemen could recuperate. The institution in Victoria, to which I referred, was ideal for this purpose. The Minister for Repatriation closed it, and patients must now go to what is at the moment a military hospital.",46
198,Mr BABNARD,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,It is not closed.,46
199,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The Minister knows perfectly well that, for practical purposes, it is closed.",46
200,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! If the honourable member for Henty persists in disregarding the direction by the Chair, I shall order him to resume his seat.",46
201,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,The Minister for Repatriation was interjecting.,46
202,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Order! The Chair has ordered the honourable member for Henty to direct his remarks to the clause.,46
203,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,The honourable member for Hunter spoke of the possibility of using the Services Canteens Trust Fund for the purpose of erecting war memorials.,46
204,Mr JAMES,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I did not mean statues. I had in mind a convalescent home.,46
205,Mr GULLETT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The money in this fund belongs to persons who served in the armed forces during World War II . , and should be expended on them or their dependants. If the Repatriation Department desires to expend money on these people, and if we consider that certain amenities should be provided, let the Repatriation Department provide them! Similarly, if the country expresses a desire to erect suitable memorials to the servicemen who died during the war, let us by all means build them, but let us not appropriate money which belonged to ex-servicemen for either of those purposes! We were told that any of the money which is expended on memorials should be expended on the utilitarian kind. In my opinion, this money should not be expended on memorials in any That shape or form, but should be disbursed as a benefit to ex-servicemen or their dependants. If this money is to be expended on memorials, I see no reason why they should be purely utilitarian in character. This money should not be expended on projects which merely absolve the Government of responsibility for repatriation and re-establishment. The honourable member for Hunter spoke at length about ""burnt-out"" ex-servicemen, and made sentimental appeals on their behalf. For my part, I have never heard a more nauseating and more bogusly sentimental statement in regard to ex-servicemen than that which the honourable member made.",46
206,Mr SHEEHY,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Boothby) [8.35] When the Minister for the Army (Mr. Chambers) replied to what was termed an "" appeal"", the words which he used were, "" such people could appeal to the trust"". The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) and other honourable members stated that some of the members of the Services Canteens Trust had been prisoners of war in Japanese camps. I have no doubt as to what is in the Minister's mind, namely, that members of the trust will do the right thing in distributing the funds. The "" burnt-out"" digger, as I understand the meaning of the term, is an ex-serviceman who has reached the age of 60 years but is not receiving a pension for his war disabilities. Some of the proceeds of the trust fund might quite properly be made available to such ex-servicemen. In my electorate is the Myrtle Bank soldiers' home, which accommodates many "" burnt-out"" diggers. Under this clause, some of these men, where the circumstances warrant, should receive assistance. The trust, under the chairmanship of Brigadier Blackburn, V.C., can be safely relied upon to distribute the funds to the best advantage.",47
207,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Barker) [8.37] - Muc h of the discussion on this clause would have been obviated if honourable members had carefully examined clause 8, to which the committee has already agreed. It is futile for the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) to say that the Services Canteens Trust can expend this money in any way it thinks fit, because clause 8 prescribes the limits beyond which the trust may not move. Other clauses, which the committee has yet to consider, provide that every account of the trust must be submitted to the Auditor-General, who will annually to the Treasurer, and this document will be laid upon the table of the House. If honourable members will examine clause 8, they will see that the trust has power to use this money for the "" due administration of the funds "". The limits are very narrow indeed. The trustees will have power to receive and consider applications for benefits from the fund, and to invest any part of the fund in securities of the Commonwealth, or on fixed deposit with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, or in securities which are trust securities according to an act of the parliament of any State. The trustees will have power also to realise and convert into money any property forming a part of the fund, but honourable members opposite may search this bill from beginning to end without finding one word which will allow the trust to convert any of the money into landed assets. Whatever the feelings of honourable members may be regarding a memorial hostel at Lake Macquarie, I warn them that the moment the trust attempts to spend money on memorials, the Auditor-General will notify it that such expenditure is not within the scope of its powers. Honourable members are guilty of self-deception of the worse type if they believe that the trust will have complete and absolute powers. Clause 8 provides, very clearly and definitely, what the trust may do. Beyond those things, the trust cannot step. The moment it does so, it will break the law, and will be "" pulled up "" sharply by the Auditor General. So much for clause 8. Subclause 1 of clause 22 reads(1.) Of the funds transferred to the trustees of the Services Canteens Trust Fund in pursuance of this Part, the sum of Two million five hundred thousand pounds and such further sums as the trustees, from time to time, consider advisable shall be set aside by the trustees to be applied in providing educational assistance, including professional and trade training(a) for the children of deceased or incapacitated eligible servicemen or of eligible servicemen who are in needy circumstances; and (6) for the children of eligible servicemen other than those mentioned in paragraph (o) of this sub-section who are, in the opinion of the trustees, particularly deserving of assistance by reason of exceptional circumreport stances, Honourable gentlemen opposite cannot construe that sub-clause to mean that trust is empowered to invest in bricks and mortar. After having examined stance. clause 8 and clause 22, the Minister should explain to the committee the powers of the trust, in view of the limitations which have been imposed, apparently with the full knowledge the Government and the consent of committee, upon its authority. The trust Facing-Both-Ways"". cannot do the things that some honourable gentlemen think it can do.",47
208,Mr HAYLEN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Parkes) [8.43] - Th reason why the committee is in diffion culties at the moment is that the honormatter. able member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) ""clowned"" this clause before the suspension of the sitting at 6 Having been a Minister, the honourable member knows enough about this subject to realise that the statement of ister for the Army (Mr Chambers) was sincere; but, with frenzied rhetoric, he leapt to his feet, referred to memorials ing erected at Lake Macquarie, and this as a medium for some fierce expresMCDonald) sions. We are still experiencing the sult. It is regrettable that this subject should be made an object of misrepresentation by the honourable member, and that some honourable members on both sides the chamber should use it to canvass the measure for something which should be done in their electorates out of the trust finances. Both are wrong, and I disapimportance prove of their action. The sincerity of Minister is obvious. He considered that he could, within the limits of the clause, say what could be done. This was seized upon by the experienced honourable ber for Wentworth who knows the sibilities of the Repatriation Department for providing hospitals for ex-servicemen. How many hospitals could be built with the'sum of £4,000,000 in the how much would be required from the fund for their upkeep? construction and upkeep of hospitals requires many millions of pounds. As these facts are so obvious, the honourable member for Wentworth has clearly attempted to launch a campaign at the expense of this bill which provides for ex-servicemen. I deplore these tactics. Let us proceed to consider the remaining clauses of the bill. The honourable memis concerned. ber for Wentworth-the cause of this disthe turbance-know s perfectly well that his criticisms and fears are without subHe has sat grinning at the table since 8 o'clock, as if enjoying a joke.",48
209,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"New England) [8.45]. - I deplore the tone of the speech of the of honourable member for Parkes (Mr. this Haylen), who reminded me of "" Mr. The honourable gentleman condemned the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) in one breath, and complimented him in the e next. The proposed convalescent home Lake Macquarie is not a sectional",48
210,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I shall not allow a discussion on the Lake Macquarie p.m. convalescent home to continue. Honourable members may refer to that project in passing, but it cannot be the the Minmain subject of the discussion.",48
211,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I entirely agree with beyour ruling, Mr Chairman. The honorused able member for Corangamite (Mr. referred to the right of the retrustees to deal with such a subject, and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) discussed quite freely the proposal to build this convalescent home, of which he termed a memorial to ex-servicemen. I shall abide by your ruling, Mr Chairman; but I point out that the erection of this building is of very great to ex-servicemen in northern the New South Wales. It is not a parochial matter. I am not suggesting that the memorial should be built in any particular electorate; but the site on Lake memMacquarie is undoubtedly the one on responwhich it should be built.",48
212,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! If the honourable member does not change his line of debate immediately I shall ask fund, and him to resume his seat.",48
213,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Then I shall immeThe diately change my line of debate, sir. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Thompson) said that there was a ""nigger in the woodpile"". That, of course, can have nothing to do with the proposal to build a war memorial on Lake Macquarie. I do not know anything about a "" nigger in the woodpile "" insofar as the Lake Macquarie convalescent home",48
214,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Order! honourable member for New England will resume his seat.,49
215,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I am entirely changing my line of approach, sir.",49
216,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Order ! If the honourable member does not resume his seat, immediately I shall name him.",49
217,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,What have I to resume my seat for?,49
218,Mr FALSTEIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Watson) [8.4S] - I direct attention to one "" furphy "" of the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), who stated that the trustees of these funds would have no - authority to hold real estate. I refer the honourable member to sub-clause 1 of clause 6, which providesThe trustees of eacli fund shall be a corporate with perpetual succession and common seal and may hold real and personal property and may sue or be sued in their corporate name. That provision effectively disposes of honourable gentleman's argument. The seeking objects of the clause are quite clear. The trustees may set aside an amount of £2,500,000, and even additional sums, for the purposes of providing educational assistance, including professional and trade training(a) for the children of deceased or capacitated eligible servicemen eligible servicemen who are in needy sibilities. circumstances; and (6) for the children of eligible servicemen other than those mentioned in paragraph (a) of this sub-section wlio are, in the opinion of the trustees, particularly deserving of assistance by reason of exceptional circumstances. There can be no doubt, therefore, about the purposes for which this money may be used. If the honourable member for Wentworth had studied the clause closely he would have understood the situation more clearly. We are dealing with the machinery which the trustees will need to operate in order to make their disbursements, and it is essential that machinery should be provided to enable them to deal with any amount that remains unexpended after the principal purposes of their trust have been discharged. It has been suggested by some honourable members opposite that the Government is seeking to give the impression that paragraph b of sub-clause 1 will The allow some of the surplus canteens funds to be diverted to purposes such as repatriation, the cost of which should be met from Consolidated Revenue. Nothing could be further from the truth than that the Government desires to use any of this money for what are properly the responsibility of the Repatriation Department. Only a warped mind could read that intention into this clause. The fact is that whatever is done under the provisions of this bill will be complementary to the purposes of our repatriation legislation. Honourable members are well aware that there will be many individuals who served in the war, who, in the years to come, will not be entitled to repatriation benefits, but may still need substantial assistance because of the difficulties body in which they find themselves. Neither a this, nor any other government, could honestly accept responsibilities of the kind that I have in mind, which may not arise until many years after the cessation the of hostilities. The Government is not to evade its obligations, and I do not think that we should restrict the trustees of these surplus canteens funds from using the money in an appropriate manner. The trustees should be left as unfettered as possible, so that they may dispose of the funds as they think best. inThey will, undoubtedly, be persons who or of are capable of discharging such respon",49
219,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Wentworth) [8.54]. - I listened with great interest to the remarks of the .honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein), who declared that the statement of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) concerning clauses 8 and 22 were unfounded. If honourable members will look at this clause they will find that it has absolutely nothing to do with the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Watson. The honourable gentleman claims some legal knowledge,_and he should be able to understand the"" meaning of the clause which he quoted, and which providesThe trustees of each fund shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal and may hold real and personal property and may sue or be sued in their corporate name. That has nothing to do with the argument of the honourable member for Barker. However, I take exception to the views of the honourable member for Barker on entirely different grounds. Clause 8 providesThe trustees of each fund may, from time to time, do all such acts and things as appear to them necessary for the due administration of the fund and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall have power(e) to make payments or grant benefits from the fund, either directly or through the agency of any person or association of persons, to or on behalf of any beneficiary or group or class of beneficiaries in such manner as the trustees think fit; and That makes it perfectly clear that the trustees, in their wisdom, may grant moneys for such specific purposes as have heen outlined this evening. I shall not mention the Lake Macquarie convalescent I said that. home, but I have no doubt whatever that when an application is made to the trustees of these funds to invest moneys in such a project they will refer to the final provision of sub-clause 2 of clause 22 and it will be argued that the trustees may provide for "" relief or fit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as trustees think f it "" . That is specific enough for anything. I have no doubt that when the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) made his appeal a in relation to a certain project he had in mind those words. If the honourable gentleman had left the matter there might have helped the Minister for Army (Mr Chambers) to some degree; but he added that the Minister had told him that in all probability a grant be made.",49
220,Mr JAMES,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I did not say me so.,50
221,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"I took the honorwith that. able gentleman's words down, and they were that "" in all probability the Minister had said that a grant member would be made"". He attributed the of remark to the Minister. That was a serious statement to make, and it the more serious because, so far, the ister has not contradicted the honourable gentleman. The honourable member for Hunter stated that the Minister had said it was refused. that the trustees in whom he had infinite confidence-and of course we all have infinite confidence in them-coul d use their discretion with regard to the manner in which they applied these funds. But this is my point, and honourable members generally will appreciate it I am sure: When the honourable member for Hunter, the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott), the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), and probably the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Williams), may subsequently come before these trustees with a request for a grant for a specific purpose which I shall not name, the honourable member for Hunter will doubtless say that the Minister had told him, when the matter was being debated in the Parliament that in all probability a grant would be made for specific purpose.",50
222,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,I do not think that,50
223,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"In twelve months time, after the heat of this discussion has cooled, and an application is made to the trustees for a grant from these funds, I have no doubt that reference will be made beneto the reports in Hansard in order to ascertain the spirit and intention underthe lying this clause, and the honourable member for Hunter will doubtless say that the Minister said to him that in all probability a grant would be made. Such statement might be expected to influence the trustees in the exercise of their discretion to make grants from these funds. he The point that I make is that the funds the should be used for the benefit of ex-servicemen, and they should not be used to defray a charge that it is the obligawould tion of the Government to meet. The Government has a duty to perform to ex-servicemen, and particularly to that he told "" burnt-out"" soldiers.",50
224,Mr CHAMBERS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Every one agrees,50
225,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"But the honourable for Hunter is asking that a part these funds shall be used to discharge what is really a responsibility of thp is Repatriation Department. He has told Minus that he asked the former Minister for Repatriation, Mr Erost, for a grant for the purpose that he has in mind and that",50
226,Mr JAMES,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,That is true.,50
227,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"That being so, it is necessary that we should impress upon the Government that it must discharge its duty. As the Government has refused to do so in this particular instance ex-service men and women are being required themselves to pay for their own institution. .1 do not think that that is the procedure that should be supported by any honourable member of the House. The Furlough House scheme, which was of a similar character, was instituted by means of public subscriptions.",51
228,Mr ABBOTT,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,That applies also to the Lake Macquarie soldiers' convalescent home.,51
229,Mr HARRISON,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"If that principle can be maintained, I shall be in accord with the project. Why should the funds of ex-servicemen be used to supplement those that are raised? That is the only point that I make. A high principle is involved. The honourable member for Parkes said that I "" clowned "" this clause. I will not be intimidated by personal abuse by the honourable member. His record while he was editor of the Standard will bear no investigation. Therefore, I take no notice of what he has said in that regard. I have proved that a high principle is involved. If the Government has obligations to discharge, let it discharge them, and not promise honourable members that in all probability it will direct that the funds of ex-servicemen shall be used to build institutions for ex-servicemen. That is a government obligation. Honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber could not support such a proposition. The Minister's duty is to sav to the honourable member for Hunter, "" I did not say to you that, in all probability, a grant would be made, because I can give no assurance in that regard. What I do say to you is that the trustees, in whom the Government has complete confidence, will exercise the powers that are laid down in this bill. We believe that any application made to them will be considered on its merits."" Unless the Minister is to be empowered to give directions to the trust, he has no right to give such an assurance.",51
230,Mr JAMES,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The Hansard report will show what was said. Mr HARRISON"" - The words were written down not only by me, but also by other honourable members. I was particularly careful to be accurate, because it appeared to me to be definitely wrong that the Minister should promise an honourable member that the funds of ex-servicemen would be used to discharge an obligation which obviously rests on the Government.",51
231,Mr WILLIAMS,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Robertson) [9.3] In the concluding lines, the clause provides that the trustees may expend money "" in the provision of relief or benefit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as the trustees think fit"". There would have been no trouble had not the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) imported into the debate a bitter, vitriolic argument. This afternoon, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) asked the Minister for the Army (Mr. Chambers) whether, under this clause, a memorial hospital committee could apply for some funds, and the Minister replied that any application for assistance would have to be considered by the trustees. The committee in charge of the arrangements for the projected convalescent home could apply to the trustees, who would have the last say, and could either make or refuse to make a grant. That is as far as the matter would have gone had not the honourable member for Wentworth argued bitterly not only against the allocation of the fund in the proper way upon application having been made to the trustees, but also, apparently, against the building of this institution. The matter can be viewed in a most advantageous light when it is known that the committee which is raising funds for this memorial hospital",51
232,The CHAIRMAN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,Order! The honourable member is not entitled to canvass that matter.,51
233,Mr BLAIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Northern Territory) [9.6] - It would appear that whenever an honourable member expresses his views in regard to the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen he lays himself open to the charge that he is speaking to his own electorate. I have no wish to engage in the squabble in regard to the Lake Macquarie soldiers convalescent home. As far as I can see, it should be sponsored. The trustees should look around to ascertain who are already doing something in the way of self-help, or by public subscription in a suitable area, for the purpose of rehabilitating burnt-out ex-servicemen.

234,Mr BLAIN,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"The dominating words of the clause are, "" in the provision of relief or benefit for eligible servicemen and their dependants in such other cases as the trustees think fit"". In elaboration of my theme, I mention that, some time ago, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), as Minister for Works and Housing, did a remarkable job at Mount Keira, above Wollongong, when he assisted old "" diggers "" in their efforts to rehabilitate "" burnt-out"" ex-servicemen, by allowing them to purchase war-time buildings at Mount Keira. The value of his assistance was not lessened because he had to charge them £1,800. On ANZAC Day of last year, I delivered the ANZAC Day address at Wollongong, where I met Mr Gargett, secretary of the Wollongong sub-branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, Mr Dawson-the mayor-and his brother, Mr Morton, and many others whose names I have forgotten.

237,Mr WHITE,SERVICES TRUST FUNDS,"Balaclava) [9.10] is a great pity that there should be misunderstanding on this late clause, in view of the considerable degree of unanimity that exists in regard to the bill generally. The Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) definitely stated that, in all probability, a grant would be made in connection with a project at a place that I shall treat as nameless. Those were his words; they were written down by several honourable members. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) made it perfectly clear that there is no provision in the bill which will permit an instruction to be given to the trustees. I do not agree with the honourable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein) that, because the trustees of each fund are to be a body corporate with perpetual succession, and may hold real and personal property, they will be empowered to buy and sell property. That is merely a formality. The actual instructions are contained in clause 22. It is most unfortunate that the Minister should have mentioned the permissibility of the trust to invest in bricks and mortar. I accepted his assurance that he did"" not mean his remarks to be regarded as a direction to the trustees. Nevertheless, they are entitled so to interpret them. The trustees will be empowered to give an educational endowment, if necessary, because of their responsibility in respect of education. They could make gifts to the Australian Red Cross Society, whose work is to assist the ex-service inmates of hospitals. By so doing, the point raised by honourable members in regard to the building of hospitals could be overcome. If the Minister will say that he will not endeavour to direct the trustees in any way, that will satisfy the committee. The Mr CHAMBERS (Adelaide-Minister for the Army) [9.13] - I merely say that I gave no assurance to any one that I would direct the trust.

Debate resumed from the 25th March (vide page 1120), on motion by Mr. CHIFLEY - 1 That the bill be now read a second time.",52
238,Mr MENZIES,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [9.16] - This bill was introduced to the House by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) on the 25th March. Shortly put, it provides for the appropriation and payment out of Consolidated Eevenue of an amount of £25,000,000 for the purpose of a grant to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. Oddly enough, the bill goes on to say that this grant is made as a contribution towards war expenditure of. that Government incurred by it in respect of operations in and around the Pacific. As yet, I do not fully appreciate just why those words were added, but, at any rate, they do not alter the net result that a grant of £A.25,000,000 is to be made to the Government of the United Kingdom. In the course of his second-reading speech, the Prime Minister referred to propositions that had been put to him to the effect that it would be hetter to make a gift of food and other commodities to the United Kingdom instead of a money grant of £25,000,000. Hfe did this, I have no doubt, partly in order to open the door to a discussion of a matter which has exercised the minds of most honourable members for some time past, namely, should we confine our actions to a money grant, or should we, either in substitution for that or in addition to it, take steps to increase the supply of food passing to Great Britain from Australia? I want to direct myself to that problem very briefly. Everybody in this House, and everybody in Australia, will agree that the need of Great Britain at this time is obvious; that, indeed, it presents one of the important facts in the world in this year. Those who have had an opportunity to read the White Paper circulated recently by the Government of the United Kingdom, with a foreword by the Prime Minister of that country, will not fail to notice the extraordinary gravity of the document. I cannot myself recall, nor can other much better informed observers, any previous document issued by a government referring to the state of economic affairs which was so candid, so disturbing, if you like, and so calculated to make everybody feel that the problem is one which can be solved only by all the people of the British race all round the world taking a hand in its solution. It is quite unnecessary to stress in this House, and particularly at this time, the sense of gratitude and obligation to Great Britain that exists in the Australian mind. These are, I am happy to. say, the commonplaces of public and private thinking in Australia. Great Britain, as that White Paper indicates, has a great need to increase its exports. I need not go into the reasons for that, nor need I discuss the volume by which its exports should be increased. The fact remains that there is a profound and urgent need for a great productive effort in Great Britain. Side by side with those problems, which are themselves grave enough, the world is presenting problems to Great Britain on the political plane; and presenting them to Great Britain, not only in its own right, but as the country which is still the principal spokesman for the great family of British nations all over the world. That means that, in this year, Great Britain needs, perhaps as never before, a strong and vigorous foreign policy. If Britain is to give effect to its foreign policy, if its voice is to carry weight in international discussions in a work-a-day world, it must continue to carry great burdens in armaments. All those things Britain is doing.",53
239,Mr CHIFLEY,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Will the right honourable gentleman express an opinion, not only on the need for Britain's export trade, but also as to where that trade should go? That is an important point.",53
240,Mr MENZIES,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"I do not propose to go into that now, because it would lead me into a discussion of another matter already listed on the notice-paper. I am not touching upon the subject now in any controversial sense. I assume that there is unanimity among all members on the point. I refer to these great problems because, if Britain is to tackle those great problems, internal and external, it must have a vigorous people. It must, in plain terms, have a well-fed people. Therefore, the feeding of the people of Great Britain, the. making available to them of some of the abundant food resources of the world, has a direct bearing on everything discussed in the British White Paper. The question then arises, how are we to give our help ? We are exporting food to Great Britain. We have been told more than once in this House that we cannot, as circumstances are, export more than we are now exporting. It is occasionally suggested by people who, no doubt, intend to do the right thing, that some of the food which, we send to Great Britain should be a gift. I mention this in order to point out that, as an analysis of the problem up to that point, I agree with what the Prime Minister said in his second-reading speech, assuming for the moment that his first promise was correct. He also saidWe are already sending all available food to Great Britain. I do not agree with that. That is where I quarrel with his statement. He addedThe only way to increase these exports would be to intensify food rationing drastically. To make a g if t of food would not increase the quantity reaching the United Kingdom. It would, in fact, do exactly what the Government proposes-that is, make a money gift . It is quite true that, unless we increase the present flow of food to Great Britain, all the changes we make in the existing procedure will come down to a gift of money, and nothing else. Therefore, the major problem is, can Ave increase our exports of food? The Prime Minister said that we could not do it without additional drastic rationing. Therefore, I want to say a few words about whether that is a correct summary of the position; whether rationing is the remedy; whether rationing is effective: and whether rationing can be made more severe without imposing any real hardship on the people of Australia, and so give greater assistance to the people of Great Britain. What I have to say on those points can bp sv.nrmpd up pretty briefly. I am sorry that, even at this moment, there are far too many hundreds of thousands of us in Australia who do not have in their Mr Menzies. minds a clear picture of what the difference is between the British ration and the Australian ration, but if we take a few vital items in the food regimen of each country we shall be able to make a comparison. In Australia, we have double the butter ration of the average citizen of the United Kingdom. In Australia, cheese is unrationed, while in the United Kingdom the ration is 2 oz. a week. On a previous occasion, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) stated that the Australian meatration, according to the quality of the meat, varied between 2$ lb. and 2% lb. a week. It is well known that the meat ration in the United Kingdom is measured in terms of price, but in terms of quantity it probably does not exceed $ lb. a week, and certainly does not exceed 1 lb. a week. Eggs, which are not rationed in Australia, have become so rare on English tables as to be a curiosity. Eats, which are of vital importance for the maintenance of vigour, are unrationed in Australia, whereas in the United Kingdom, the ration is 1 oz. per week of cooking fat, and 3 oz. of margarine. Keeping those figures in mind, we should ask ourselves if there is any perceptible shortage of food in Australia, and the plain answer is that there is no perceptible shortage. We have full and plenty, and we are looking across the world at another country where people are living on the bare minimum of subsistence, and living on a much smaller variety of food than the normal. It is a meagre and a monotonous diet. I said a while ago that the meat ration in Australia had been stated by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to be somewhere between 2^ lb. and 2-J lb. a wee'k. Let us see whether that measure of rationing is effective. All we have to do is to take the figures, as I have taken them, for the year 1945-46, which is a good year to take because rationing of meat began on the 1st January, 1944. The year 1945-46 is the last complete year of record, and I take the items beef, veal, mutton and lamb. Of these, the total consumption in Australia was approximately 565,000 tons, which represents an average per head of 169.9 lb. a year, or 3.27 lb. a week. That increase does not necessarily tell the true story, because we all know that a great deal of meat goes into actual consumption in Australia which does not come into these records at all. Private killing occurs in various parts of Australia. Not every abattoir has the machinery for keeping complete records and consequently a great deal of approximation is resorted to in the compilation of returns. All the chances are that the true figure, far from being 3.27 lb., would be 4 lb. n week or more. But I shall take the necessarily conservative figures returned in these days because all the inducement is to understate them. Call it roughly 3£ lb. What was the ration; was it 2| lb.? If that be right, 1 lb. a head each week is going into consumption in Australia outside the ration scheme, and that, by itself, is more than double the ration available to the average citizen in the United Kingdom. That is a very formidable fact. I have referred to the problem of meat rationing because, whatever may be said about small itemsand there was a great deal of talk a little while ago about small items-her e we deal with one of the big vital items in the food problem, and we have been able to test it in the way I have suggested. There are many causes that contribute to the difficulty of food export to the United Kingdom. We have a shortage of shipping. We have aggravated the shortage of shipping by the scandalously slow turn-round of ships in Australian ports. We have here and there, it is true, and sometimes in a fair number of places,, bad seasons. We have had stock losses. Important factors of that kind have made their contribution to the shortage of exports. We have also had industrial stoppages. But none of these things will explain away, or make us any more proud of, the fact that, after allowing for all of them, we are managing to eat four times as much meat per head in Australia as is allowed to the people of the United Kingdom, and in these circumstances for us to say, "" We are sorry, but we cannot do any more for you"", is to ignore the vital fact that if the United Kingdom fails we shall fail also, whatever our ambitions and our pretensions may be. All I want to add to that is this: There are two possible courses, and because I lack the expert knowledge to determine which of them is the right one I mention them both. One course is to face up to this rationing problem and say, first of all, "" We shall reduce the r at i o n and , secondly, "" We shall enforce the rationing scale. We shall police this matter and make a real drive against the black market in meat That is one possible course. All I say to the Minister is, that if that course is a practicable one, and if it succeeds in reducing the average consumption of meat in Australia by even 1 lb. a week, it will have the superb effect of adding to our supplies to the United Kingdom, on my own calculation, more than 170,000 tons a year, and it will still leave us with a ration more than twice the size of a ration which does duty in Great Britain at the present time. The other view-it is one well worth investigating, and I have heard it put forward by men of close expert knowledge-is this: Can we maintain rationing at all? There is a great deal to be said for the view- I do not necessarily accept it because I do not speak with expert knowledge-that the issue of coupons for meat has increased the consumption of meat. Coupons achieve a sort of new standard in the community, a new form of currency. People more or less instinctively say, "" I have my coupons; I must use them up "". It has been known that arrangements have been entered into between housewives and butchers, and I believe that if we were to look into this matter closely we would find on the whole that many people are getting supplies of meat today beyond their true requirements because they live up to the coupon standard. It is a great paradox that a measure designed to reduce consumption sometimes does nothing but increase it. In addition, pressures are set up by controls of that kind which take people in the direction of black markets and devious processes, and all these things tend to increase consumption. I do not know what the answer is. If we are to continue to have rationing, let us face up to the fact that the present meat rationing in Australia does not represent a real contribution to the United Kingdom at all. It imposes no real restriction upon us; it involves no real sacrifice by us. I should like to say to the House, and, if it were possible, to every one in Australia, that Great Britain will not go through its trials of the next two, three, four or five years without a great spirit of sacrifice among its people. If there be one thing that leaps to the eye in a perusal of these grim official documents it is that Great Britain in its testing time will need as great a spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as it exhibited during the war. If our contribution to that is to be better than a mere distant applause, we must determine to share in that sacrifice and make it a common one. I refuse to believe that there are very many people in Australia so mean in their outlook on this matter that they would hold it against a government that that government reduced the rations of the Australian people in order to increase the rations of the people of the United Kingdom. But if there are such people, if they make venomous attacks, I say to the Prime Minister once more that we on this side of the House will accept with the Government the fullest responsibility for any unpopularity involved in that course. I do not believe there would be any unpopularity involved in it. Every reason that exists, every emotion that exists in the Australian mind and heart, will be in favour of placing strict rules upon ourselves in order that we may help the United Kingdom at this time, not only with money, but also with something it needs more than money, namely, more food for its people, more variety in its people's living, more vigour in its people's bodies and, as a result, more power, more enterprise, and more achievement.",53
241,Mr BEAZLEY,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Fremantle) [9.40] The bill before the House makes payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £25,000,000 as a contribution towards war expenditure incurred by the United Kingdom Government in respect of operations in and around the Pacific. In his opening remarks the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) stated that he could not understand why the Government had chosen to insert in the bill the words "" as a contribution towards war expenditure of that Government incurred by it in respect of operations in and around the Pacific"". I am surprised that the right honourable gentleman cannot see that such a gracious step is necessary. Would he have the bill described as one authorizing a gift of £25,000,000 and ignore altogether the fact that there had been an immense contribution by Great Britain to the defence of this country in the Pacific ? I hope that in future bills brought down repeating this gift the £25,000,000 will be similarly described as a contribution towards the British war effort in the Pacific. At a time when Great Britain is appealing for help it is most embarrassing that any assistance given to it by those whom it has defended should in any way be described as a gift. In putting these words into the bill the Treasurer showed a more gracious instinct than did the Leader of the Opposition in suggesting that there was something improper about them. The right honourable gentleman adroitly evaded the question of British exports. This subject of food for Britain has been used politically. It was so used before each State election. It has been used politically in statements by Opposition members that food and not money is what Great Britain needs. That statement was repeated by the Leader of the Opposition.",56
242,Mr FADDEN,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,The honourable member for Fremantle said that the British people did not want food.,56
243,Mr BEAZLEY,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"I have not said anything of the kind. I shall analyse the statement that this bill does not mean food, but money. Honourable members interjecting,",56
244,Mr SPEAKER,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,Order ! The Leader of the Opposition was heard in complete silence. The next honourable member to interject will be named.,56
245,Mr BEAZLEY,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Is it seriously suggested that a monetary gift of £25,000,000 means that £25,000,000 worth of Australian currency is to be sent to Great Britain? Obviously, it means no such thing, and any person with the slightest, knowledge of international trade knows that it could mean no such thing. The Treasurer made it clear in the House in an answer to a question that the £25,000,000 gift to Great Britain would constitute for Great Britain a claim on £25,000,000 worth of foodstuffs in Australia, but, notwithstanding such categorical statements, we have had persistent jibes that it is like sending diamonds to a man on a desert island. The Leader of the Opposition skilfully evaded the question of British exports because the whole crux of this bill is that it exempts the United Kingdom from sending to this country £25,000,000 worth of goods to pay for £25,000,000 worth of goods in this country. Those goods could be used by the United Kingdom or be sent anywhere to purchase additional food. The Leader of the Opposition has spoken to us with real feeling about meat and meat exports from Australia. At the present time the Commonwealth is endeavouring to increase these exports. Insofar as Great Britain does not have to pay with goods for £25,000,000 worth of goods from this country, it can send those goods to Argentina and obtain meat from there. So this monetary contribution, as it is called, exempting the United Kingdom from exporting to this country, releases exports to other sources of food supplies and in that respect increases the stock of food in the United Kingdom. The position of the United Kingdom in relation to this country should be analysed realistically. First we had developed in London a sterling balance of £170,000,000-it now exceeds £20'0,000,000. That balance has accumulated because we have sent goods to Great Britain that, at the moment, it cannot pay for with goods sent here. It has been accumulated in London because we transferred to London our holdings of £113,000,000 worth of dollars. That enabled the United Kingdom to buy goods in, and charter ships from the United States of America. That is a real additional contribution to the United Kingdom's stock of goods because, if there is one thing that it has .rightly insisted upon, it is that, in its predicament, trade should not be two-way trade as between single countries, but that its problems should be looked at in relation to other sources of supply. By that I mean that it has excluded from the United Kingdom Australian wheat which it would be to the satisfaction of many of us to send there. It has wisely decided that our wheat shall go to India, and that Canada shall supply Britain with wheat which otherwise would have been sent to India from Canada. The shorter distance between Great Britain and north America saves the additional ships that would be needed to take our wheat to the United Kingdom over the longer route. That is sensible. The gift of £25,000,000 releases for export to other countries goods that the United Kingdom would otherwise have to send here. That is another contribution to it in its difficulties. The sterling balance presents us with another factor to consider. This country has £4S9,000,000 sterling worth of British investments on which we pay annually about £A.25,000,000 in interest. That £A.25,000,000 constitutes a claim of £25,000,000 worth of goods in' this country. So there is a claim this year on £50,000,000 worth of goods in this country that do not have to be paid for with exports from Great Britain. That, of course, is not a solution of the enormous economic problem of Great Britain. For instance, in eight months of this financial year, Great Britain obtained from this country £58,000,000 worth of food and goods, which means that the £50,000,000 involved in the gift and the interest has already been exceeded by £8,000,000. Further assistance, which I hope will be contemplated by the Government, can be given by exempting Great Britain from payment for the goods that we export to it in excess of the payment for £50,000,000 worth of goods that the £25,000,000 gift and the £25,000,000 of interest, give it a claim to. That is, if , in the whole year, the value of our exports to the United Kingdom totals £80,000,000, a debt of £30,000,000 accumulates to Australia in London. Additional assistance could be given by exempting the United Kingdom from exporting goods to us to meet the deficit. I do hope that the problem will be looked at realistically. The decrying of the grant of £25,000,000 as a mere monetary grant ignores that it can be translated into a gift of goods. It has no other significance. The decrying of the gift is a means of confusing the Australian public. I feel that the desire of the people of Australia to assist Great Britain is widespread and I am certain that it is shared by the Opposition; but no help is given by confusing the people about the effect of the monetary grant and by pretending that it has no significance in the movement of goods to the United Kingdom. We ought to recognize that the great source of supply and the only power than can really solve the problems of the United Kingdom is the United States of America. Since so many honourable members opposite have seen fit to decry the United States of America because, in the natural course of events, it has taken the dominant economic position, it is necessary to stress' how generous it has been in its treatment of Europe and Great Britain. In the first year of peace it made a gift to Europe of 6,250,000,000 dollars. If that be not generosity, then at least nothing like that generosity has been seen in history. It made a loan to Great Britain of 3,750,000,000 dollars, on which no interest is to be paid for five years. That means goods that the United Kingdom can send to the United States of America without buying goods in return. It maybe true that, in making a loan instead of a straight-out gift, the United States of America has not met the challenge of the situation as it should have. I do not argue that that may not be true, but, at least, it has been more generous than any other nation has been in history. We have destroyed our capacity to assist the United Kingdom further by transferring to it our stock of £113,000,000 worth of dollars, which rnables it to buy goods and charter ships from the United States of America. That, I have no doubt, has helped it. The Leader of the Opposition, in stressing our need to concentrate more effectively on the physical movement of goods, has said something with which we all agree and which, I am sure, the Government will take into consideration. The policy of the Minister for Commerce  panding meat exports shows that it has already received consideration. ever is to be said in the course of this debate about food exports to Great Mr Beazley. Britain, I hope that we refrain from bedevilling the public mind about the mone. tary grant, which gives the United Kingdom a claim on food that it will not have to pay for with exports.",56
246,Sir EARLE PAGE,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Cowper) [9.58] I do not propose to reply direct to the attack on the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) by the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Beazley), but I propose to prove that Australia can and ought to make a gift to the United Kingdom of, not merely £25,000,000 worth of its sterling balances in London, but also of £25,000,000 worth of food. Britain is desperately short of food and money to pay for its external debts. Britain is short of food because it generously divided what it had among the starving European nations. Its peace-time diet is lower than in the worse days of war. Britain is short of money because, with its dominions, it fought alone for a year for civilization. During the whole war it bought goods from other countries on a f.o.b. basis and shifted them mainly in its own ships. I regard this bill as a gesture of kinship, admiration, gratitude, goodwill and sympathy to our Mother Country. It is, as well, an act of self-preservation to Australia, and of vital importance to the world. If Britain falls, the world and western civilization will go down into anarchy, and Australia with it. Britain will fall if it is not properly fed and nourished, and helped over its financial crisis. The cancelling of debts is like paying the doctor's fee for treatment. Feeding Britain is keeping the patient alive until fully convalescent.",58
247,Mr CALWELL,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,It is more important.,58
248,Sir EARLE PAGE,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Yes . This measure raises the manner and degree to which Britain should be aided by Australia in this crisis. Help can be given in both finance and food. The double gift will help psychologically and physically. Quick action will double the actual worth of the gift. Australia can afford to forgo £25,000,000 of debts and provide £25,000,000 worth of food, which is, as the honourable member for Fremantle said, What- as good as an additional £25,000,000 off the debt3, because it will save Britain's purchase of food elsewhere. I purpose examining why the position is so desperate in Britain , the steps necesGreat sary to save it , and what it the most stantial and practical contribution Australia can make immediately and the next two years, a period which necessary for Britain's complete restoradamage tion to bodily health. The immensity Britain's war effort, and the losses it sustained are seen in every way that the position is examined. is worth placing on record, first, a. comparison of the man-power that become Britain and the British Empire had endeliberate gaged in the war. The severity of fightmost vital repair and ing is determined by the number of alties. The British Empire had, roughly, 1,300,000 casualties. The United States of America had 1,100,000 casualties. I the casualties of India are deducted, the to disappear. United Kingdom and British dominions had casualties of 1,100,000 out of their population of 80,000,000, or practically the same number of casualties as America had with its population of 140,000,000. Britain , herself, with 45,000,000 people had a casualty list of 800,000, with 333,000 deaths. The United States of America had, out of its 140,000,000 people, a casualty list of 1,100,000, 300,000 deaths. The shipping effort of Great B ritain was tremendous and, as with manpower, its losses were great. At the outbreak of war in 1939, Great B r it a in had 22,000,000 tons of shipping. During the over war, it lost 18,500,000 tons, but rebuilt 15,250,000 tons, and today has approximately 16,000,000 tons. From those figures, honourable members will see that Great B r it a in has lost more than quarter of its pre-war shipping fleet. value of its exports declined from £471,000,000 in 1938 to £272,000,000 in 1945. It s gold and dollar reserves had dropped from £864,000.000 in August 1938, to £453,000,000 in June, 1945. During the same period its exterequivalent nal liabilities increased from £476,000,000 to £3,355,000,000. The capital loss in its overseas financial position totalled £4,17S,000,000. This loss was made up ties, totalling 800,000. of £1,118,000,000 from the realization external capital assets during the war, and an increase of external liabilities .t'2,S79,000,000. That was not the only damage which B r it a in suffered. During the war, sub4.000,000 houses were damaged, of this that number 460,000 were totally destroyed over or rendered uninhabitable. Estimated is at current replacement costs, the total to property was £1,450,000,000. of Much of the property destroyed consisted of industrial plants, which were the special objective of the enemy. Apart It from the losses from actual destruction, the loss of industrial capacity, which had less efficient and run down by the policy of deferring all but the maintenance casuwork, was equivalent to an additional £SS5,000,000. Consequently, the United Kingdom lived by selling its external f capital and permitting its internal capital According to estimates, the total losses reach the following heights:-Physica l destruction on land, £1,500,000,000; shipping, including cargoes, £700,000,000; internal and external capital losses, £5,100,000,000; making a total of £7,300,000,000. As the national wealth of Great B r it a in was estimated to be £30,000,000,000, this loss is roughly 25 per cent, of the total. This estimated loss omits any deterioration of private with dwellings, reduction of household inventories and losses of private investment, for which no estimate can be given. During the conflict, war expenditure took 53 per cent, of the national income every year. The national debt more than trebled from £7,000,000,000 to £23,000,000,000, whereas our national debt practically doubled from £1,295,000,000 to £2,794,000,000. Having made those statements of one Great Britain's losses, I shall compare The briefly the relative losses sustained by Australia. Honourable members will see that we fared much more favourably than did Great Britain . Our casualties totalled 100,000 for our population of more than 7,000,000. That would be to 650,000 casualties for a population of 45,000,000. Consequently, our casualties, proportionately, were only slightly less than Great Britain's casualWe had our of share in the fighting from the beginning to the end of the war, in respect of manof power, but not in other respects. Therefore, we should be prepared to give substantial aid to Great Britain in its hour of need. The number of bouses in Australia which were rendered uninhabitable, or damaged in any way, as the result of enemy action was negligible compared with the figure of 4,000,000 houses damaged in Great Britain. Total damage to property in Australia was also negligible compared with the total damage to property in Great Britain, totalling £1,450,000,000. The Commonwealth War Damage Insurance Fund has a credit balance of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000. The industrial capacity of Australia was greatly improved by our war effort. In fact, Australia made definite progress in technical equipment and the mechanization of industry. It is true that because of the shortage of man-power our roads and transport system have deteriorated, but not to a degree comparable with the physical destruction and loss that Great Britain suffered. When Great Britain's exports fell so disastrously, the value of Australia's exports rose greatly because of rising prices due to war-time conditions, even though the volume of exports was not so great as in pre-war years. For example, oiir exports of butter declined from 120,000 tons to between 40,000 and 50,000 tons, but the price of the commodity increased. The price of wheat also rose. The value of our exports in 1946 was £196,000,000, compared with £122,000,000 in 1938. In addition, Australia benefited from the fact that many hundreds of thousands of American, British and Australian soldiers were located and spent much of their money within our borders. This record of the damage to Britain, and the comparative escape of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, India and the other sterling creditors gives point to the statement of Dr Dalton, the British Chancellor of the'Exchequer, on the 8th May, 1947, when he said that the ""mass of debts of Britain must be scaled down. These debts formed an unreal, um'ust and insupportable burden."" He showed that of the £3,000,000,000 sterling debts, one-third was owing to India, £405,000,000 to Egypt and £225,000.000 to Australia. Most of this money was spent in assisting the defence of those countries. . Dr Sir Earle Page. Dalton pointed out that this enormous war debt had accumulated, first, because Britain had put all its resources into waging and winning the war and, second, because most of Britain's military effort was made far afield. He said that, at home, they ha/d next to nothing to spare for exports, as almost everything was turned into war machines and fighting men. Abroad, Great Britain,' for a long time single handed, maintained arms in the field and built aerodromes, docks and barracks from Gibraltar in the Mediterranean, down the coast of Africa, {strategic points in the Indian Ocean to south-eastern Asia. All that work involved local expenditure which could not be met with either gold or exports. In safe-guarding many countries against invasion, Great Britain accumulated heavier debts. The value of Australia's exports, however, instead of decreasing by two-thirds, as Great Britain's did hecause of the nature of its war effort, increased by 50 per cent. Our total exports in 1938-39 were valued at £122,000,000 and in 1945-46 at £196,000,000 and our credits in London today are £A.225,000,000, compared with £A.40,000,000 to £A.50,000,000 at the beginning of the war. Obviously, Australia could afford to make a gift to Great Britain of at least £50,000,000, especially as Great Britain has paid Australia higher prices for nearly all our products. The fact is that Great Britain has paid more than it paid in 1938-39 for a much smaller total quantity of goods.",58
249,Mr BLAIN,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,Grea t Britain has also shipped those goods at its own risk.,60
250,Sir EARLE PAGE,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Yes , and paid higher prices f.o.b. for them. In 1942, without any request from Australia, Great Britain increased the price of wool by 2d. a lb. That is worth between' £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 a year for every year since 1942, or a total of between £25,000,000 and £30,000,000 in the last four years. Britain voluntarily increased the price of butter, as the Vice President of the Executive Council (Mr. Scully) announced last December, by 4d. a lb. over a period of three years, and - was willing to meet the subsidies that Australia was paying to Australian producers for the purpose of maintaining the purchasing power of the basic wage. In addition, Great Britain paid high prices for our meat and voluntarily increased by 45 per cent, the price which it paid for Australian meat. The food position of Great Britain is desperate. I have already pointed out the extraordinary heavy losses that that country has suffered, and the serious position regarding its external indebtedness. At the same time, Great Britain is paying unprecedentedly high prices for food. For example, it is paying to Denmark the unexampled price of 242s. sterling a cwt. for butter, which is equivalent to nearly 3s. Australian per lb. Great Britain has made a five-year agreement with Canada to purchase wheat at a minimum of 7s. 8d. and a maximum price of 9s. 8d. a bushel f.o.b. Montreal. Great Britain is using its own ships to transport food to its people and to the people of starving Europe. About ten weeks ago, it made a contract with Argentina. for the purchase of 18,000,000 bushels of wheat at £A.l a bushel in order to feed its people. In July, 1946, it reduced the bread ration by 10 per cent - it did not have to do that during the war. Great Britain is so desperately short of food that it pays these increased prices. ration of bacon - and ham has been reduced from the war-time quantity of 4 oz. to 2 oz. a week. The meat ration has been reduced. Although Great Britain won the war, its people now have less food than they had during the war. We in Australia are relatively well off for food. Anybody with any moral sense, or any sympathy, or any real feelings for their kith and kin, would surely agree that we should do more, and should ask what more we can do, to help Britain in its present food crisis. According to the best medical advice that c a n the first essential in the ultimate restoration of Great Britain is to ensure that the British people shall be better fed, with a more varied diet, for at least two years, until they can regain something approximating a normal physical condition. During that period the British people need, at the very least, \ lb. more meat per head weekly. They also need more eggs, bacon, sugar, fats, and especially butter. If shipment is at all possible, we should also send to Britain more fresh fruit, canned and dried fruit in order to provide a very necessary variety in diet and to relieve the monotonous diet on which the British people have had to subsist for nearly eight years. If we do what we should do in this regard we shall be able to restore the physical strength of the British people, so that they will be able to undertake the huge task of increasing their exports to a level which will enable them ultimately to meet their debts. In my opinion, more will have to be done by America to assist in the unfreezing of sterling. I consider that America will be required to make available another £1,000,000,000 to help Britain through the present crisis, and to save the British people from perishing through starvation. If we assist Britain-and I refer not only to Australia, but also to America and other countries which have any capacity in this regard-it will ultimately be for our own good, for I have not the slightest doubt that Britain will soon regain its position as a great trading nation. I believe that this could occur within the next five years. Britain is capable, in my opinion, of again becoming, within that period, a great The importing country and an exporter of special manufactures which other countries will require no matter how industrialized they may become. But we must first provide the means for strengthening the British people to resume their place in the world. We must provide all the butter and meat possible, and we must, by every means in our power, assure the British people Of our desire to help them. If we make a generous gesture now I believe that other countries will follow our example. It is essential that Britain shall be provided with additional he obtained, food immediately, and we should exert ourselves to maintain an increasing volume of supplies as time goes on. We should not delay until prices can be arranged which may be regarded as quite satisfactory. What we need is an increase of production, and any measures that will stimulate production will be beneficial to both Great Britain and Australia. If by prompt action at present we can increase food supplies to Great Britain substantially in the next three months, six months, or nine months, it will be all to the good. An immediate improvement, even if small, combined with the assurance that the improved diet that will thus be possible will be progressive, will put new heart and body into the British people, who, although they won the war, have seen their diet steadily deteriorate. I am glad that after the previous discussion of this subject in the House, the Government introduced a plan for improving food supplies from Australia. It is true that the Prime Minister stated that nothing very substantial could be done for some months, but when I urged the Minister for Commerce and Agricul to certain authorities in that department to take steps to improve the position, and he accepted my advice, the Australian Meat Board immediately came forward with a definite proposal. As a result ' of this, action was also taken in an organized way in hotels and cafes with the object of introducing one meatless day a week. I understand that as a result 3,500 tons of couponed meat have heen made available to Great Britain and also about 1,200 tons of butter. It has been stated by persons associated with the meat trade that black-marketing operations in Australia arc responsible for the loss of from 80,000 to 100,000 tons of meat a year which otherwise might be exported to Great Britain. Something should be done as quickly as possible to remedy this state of affairs. I have previouslv shown by statistics that Australia could do more to provide essential food-stuffs for Britain, and I believe that the Australian Government could have given a better lead in this regard by direct governmental action. The diffusion of effort that must result from leaving any action in this regard on practically a voluntary basis, and in so many different hands, will greatly limit results. Quick and substantial results on the other hand, could be obtained from prompt governmental action and leadership. ""We could at once substantially increase our exports of sugar to Great Britain if Sir Earle Page. we would decrease the Australian ration by 2 oz. a week. That would still give us 14 oz. a week which is 6 oz. higher than the British ration, and this would result in from 30,000 to 40,000 tons more of sugar being made available to Britain. The advantage of making sugar available in this way is that it could be transported by tramp steamers, and there would be no need for refrigeration space. I urge the Government to consider carefully the proposals of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). If it is decided that better results could not be obtained from an open market in meat, our ration rate should be reduced so that more foodstuffs could be shipped to Eritain. It is more important that we should increase our exports immediately than that we.should delay action in order to secure better prices. An increase of production is absolutely essential, and it would be good for the economy of this country. I have made a case good, I believe, for financial and food aid for Britain without delay. What we have read in the newspapers about the terrible conditions that the British people have had to endure recently in consequence of blizzards, floods and the like, with the consequentloss of stock, and the flooding of farms, which has resulted in retarding cultivation for many months, should surely spur us on to strong efforts immediately. We need concerted government action, for the Government, by the adoption of a nationwide policy, could take control of the whole situation and increase our exports of food immediately. This would promptly improve the diet standard of the British people.",60
251,Mr FALSTEIN,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"Watson) [10.24] In the guise of supporting the second reading of this bill to make a monetary grant of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom in order to help in the adjustment of sterling balances, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has taken the opportunity to attack our meat rationing plan. While the right honourable gentleman was citing his figures, I made a few quick calculations, the result of which I shall place before honourable members. Taking the returns from the abattoirs as a basis, the right honourable gentleman said that our total meat production to cover coupon requirements plus an additional 1 lb. per head per week allegedly to supply the .black-market would provide only an extra 500,000 tons of meat for shipment for Britain. Even assuming that the right honourable gentleman's submissions were correct, and that what he had to say in regard to the black market was also not open to question, such action would not provide say 50,000,000 people in the United Kingdom with an increase of as much as i lb. of meat a week.",62
252,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,Would not that be worthwhile?,63
253,Mr FALSTEIN,UNITED KINGDOM GEANT,"I expected such an interjection. It will add force to the other statements that I intend to make. The fact is that on the figures which the Leader of the Opposition gave it would not help the British very much if the Australian people were to forgo the whole of their meat ration so that the meat could be exported to Britain. Leader of the Opposition failed .to take into account the vital importance of transport in meeting the present situation, but even if transport difficulties could be overcome and that would be quite impossible, and if Australia surrendered the whole of its meat, the British consumers would benefit very little indeed. This leaves out of account, also, any consideration of the question whether Britain desires Australia to take action of this kind and whether the British authorities would not desire to obtain meat from Argentina, because of its closer proximity to the British market. Even though the Australian people were to surrender the whole of their meat ration, the British people could not benefit fully, for many of the cuts which are used in Australian households are not suitable for export, as they are of a poor quality compared with the meat that is usually carried abroad in the refrigeration space that is available. The attack of the Leader of the Opposition on the Government in connection with this bill was extremely ill advised. The right honourable gentleman's case has no real merit. The British Government should surely be left free to determine how best it can use the grant of £25,000,000 which this Government is making. The money will absolve the United Kingdom from the necessity to pay for imports of that value from Australia. The British Government may be relied upon to judge how the money can most wisely be expended. Everyone knows that in the process of international trade imports are paid for by exports, but the making of this grant will enable the United Kingdom Government to divert £25,000,000 for exports to non-sterling countries, and the grant will thereby serve a double purpose. It has permitted the United Kingdom Government to say how the amount shall be expended on what is most needed, and has enabled it to transfer exports to non-sterling countries and thus build up badly-needed credits. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) has said that Great Britain is short of money, and that the The Commonwealth Government is endeavouring to assist it. Every one must have read only yesterday that the national debt of Great Britain has been reduced by £139,000,000 in the last week. That, statement was published on the authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Dr Dalton, and gives the lie direct to the statements of the right honourable member for Cowper. Recently I was in the British colony of Hong Kong. There, Australian meat was being served to those who could afford to pay for it. That meat had been allocated .to the colony at the direction of the British Ministry of Food. If Great Britain really wanted more meat than it was receiving from this country it could have diverted a large quantity of that which was going to Hong Kong because it was being eaten not by British people, but by Chinese merchants, who could afford to pay the high prices that were ruling for meatmeals, and who could consume as much as they wished, because there is no rationing of meat in Hong Kong. That further illustrates the totally unwarranted nature of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition in connection with meat planning. The real problem which Great Britain will have to face is that which will commence to be felt after the 15th July. when, under the arrangements that were made with the Government of the United States of America, all sterling balances in Great Britain will have to be convertible into dollars. I should not imagine, nor should any other honourable member, that the problems of Great Britain in respect of the feeding of the community, or of stabilizing and again balancing its economies, will be resolved by a gift of £25,000,000, or even of £125,000,000, from this country. The honourable member for Eremantle (Mr. Beazley) correctly stated that the only solution of Great Britain's problem in the present circumstances ofglobal economy is that which will have to be applied by the United States of America. Even if we were to make available to the United Kingdom the whole of the nonsterling credits created by the export from this country of our primary and other products to the United States of America and other hard currency countries, that would cause the merest flutter in helping to right the British economy. Whilst I , and, I believe, most, if not all, other Government supporters consider that this bill, which provides for the transfer of £25,000,000 worth of credits, should be the forerunner of others, as far as this country is able to make gifts within its national economy, no one should be misled into believing that whatever is done in that connection can constitute more than a dominion gesture. To say to the contrary is to ignore the facts of the situation. The Government is to be commended upon having taken this action. It has inspired the dominion of New Zealand to follow suit. I should like not only that the Government should make a further contribution of this sort to the United Kingdom, but also that the other dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations would emulate it.
