Upon which Mr FISHE R had movedThat the following words be added to the proposed address:- - but regret to have to inform you that your Advisers deserve censure for having failed to safeguard the interests of the people of the Commonwealth.""",11
1,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth-Assistant Minister of Home Affairs) [ 3 . 3 ] - I propose to address myself almost entirely to the Teesdale-Smith contract, and to the debate on the public platform and in this chamber bearing directly or indirectly upon it . Before dealing with the papers connected with the contract, I wish to explain why it is necessary, occasionally, in all railway construction, to go in advance of rail head to secure the even continuity of formation work. up-to-date track-laying machinery, such as we have on the transcontinental line, and with sufficient engine power-which , through no f a u l t of - our own, and because of the sins of our predecessors, we have not yet got-trac k laying can be proceeded with afc a uniform daily mileage, but a peculiarly difficult section of country retards, not only formation work, but also the track laying for which that work is a preparation. The Engineer-in-Chief and his Department have long recognised that the success of the construction of the transcontinental railway will depend almost entirely upon organization, fchere being practically no engineering difficulties, except in two sections, throughout the whole length of 1,060 miles. These difficulties are to be met with in the neighbourhood of the Pines, South Australia, at a point about 100 miles from Port Augusta, where the line has to get up on fco the tableland, and in a district known as the Sandhills, some 200 miles still further west along The Engineer-in-Chief attempted, by pressing ahead with the track laying, without completing the ballasting and otherwise finishing the line, KEN- to get up to the first difficult section, which commences at a point 92 miles from Port Augusta, and ends afc a point 106 miles from that place. In that 14 miles will be the only cuttings of any i m portance, with the exception of a few difficult miles a little further on along the route until the Sandhills section is reached. As the representatives of South Australia are aware, the quality of the water is always troubling the Railway Department of the State by reason of the mechanical defects which it creates on its northern system, and the difficulty is doubled in ohr case, because we have had to try to carry on the work of railway construction with very ancient engines left to us by our predecessors. ' Consequently we have not been able fco' get along as fast as we wished to, although we have known that with the new plants for haulage and other transport purposes coming to hand, and now being put into commission, there was serious danger of the track laying machine catching up with the formation work, and, therefore, of the track laying being stopped, and the men employed on it being thrown out of Work, whilst the difficult section to which I have reWith ferred was being traversed.  known for the last two years.",12
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"They have been known to this Government only since we took office, and we attempted at once to grapple with them. Had our predecessors done the same, two years ago, the difficulty would not have arisen. I come now to the actual terms > of the contract with Mr ' Teesdale Smith and the correspondence oufc of which it has arisen. I must weary honourable members by readNofc ing the actual records, because, as they will see when I have finished, gross i justice has been done to me, and, through me, to this Parliament, by one feature the public criticism to which I have been subjected. The first paper which I read and the labour, too. is a telegram from Mr Teesdale Smith the Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth railways. Ifc is dated the 3rd February, 1914, and saysLearn from resident engineer that the Supervising Engineer, Saunders, was referred toyou will entertain proposal construct earthperience works 02 to 106 miles. I am prepared accept petty contract for same at same rates I am now getting for the extension Yeelanna-Mantings, nipa railway, namely, 4s. Gd. cuttings, 2s. hanks. That is the offer to which I direct ticular attention. It was represented to me that the country in connection with which the South Australian Government had made a contract was similarfcofchafc with which we have fco deal, and the South Australian contract having been let after tenders had been publicly called for, the paymenfc by the Commonwealth of the same prices as were agreed to by men, the Government of South Australia guarantee that the contractor was not making too good a bargainor will examine country, with your engineer and fix rates on the ground. Time, three months. Deposit one thousand. and so forth. I did not see the teleplant, gram when it came fco the office, but, the 6th February, the Engineer-in-Chief, accompanied by the supervising engineer at Port Augusta, and Mr Teesdale Smith, called to see me. Mr asked me if I had seen his tion with regard to the letting of the contract to Mr Teesdale Smith, which he had sent up the previous night. saidfchafcI had not seen it, and he got it in my office, and submitted it in person. The exact terms of that recommendation are theseBetween Lake Windabout and Bucolo the line goes over tablelands. The the tablelands nnd the descent on the other side involve earthworks of considerable nitude, possibly 100,000 cubic yards of cutting at each end.",12
3,Mr WEUSTER,Unknown,Earthworks ?,13
4,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . This matter it has been proposed by Captain Saunders to work by day labour with small jilant for which tenders have been with the day labour he had, because this contract did not displace a single man n - working under that system for the Commonwealth, nor did it throw idle one of pennyworth of plant. For a plant, in addition, would have had to be obtained I ask honourable to members to bear that point in mind when fchey read the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Deane continuesI am not at all satisfied that this is the best way of doing it, but I do not want to Captain interfere with his arrangements. 1 suggested, however, some time ago, to some men of exthat they sliould go to Port Augusta and inspect the work, with a view to submitting a price. This they did, and concluded they would want 5s. a cubic yard for the cutand, as they had no plant themselves, 6d. the Government to supply plant, tools, water, and so on. parNow we are getting to the contractMr Teesdale Smith, the well-known contractor, has been to Port Augusta and talked the matter over with Captain Saunders, and yesterday he came here to see mc. He is just finishing a contract in the Eyre Peninsula, namely, the extension from Minippa to Streaky Bay, for the South Australian Government, and he has a large quantity of plant, tools, and horses at his disposal. He submits an offer to do the work, and I wired his terms was a to Captain Saunders for his opinion. Then comes the telegram which I had better read in order to put it on recordThe wire was as follows:- "" Smith offers take piece-work from 92 to 106 miles. Cuttings, 4s. Cd.; banks, 2s. 6d. He will And water, explosives, horse feed. Completion in on three months from acceptance. Do you recommend acceptance?"" This was to the man who otherwise would have to do the work himself, and that . Deane Captain Saunders is no loafer, I would recommendaremind honourable members",13
5,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,He was the better of I the two.,13
6,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"E x a c t l y . When it is a question as to his ability to do work, or of getting somebody to do the work in place of himself, his opinion is well worth Creek having, as. the honourable member for ascent to Melbourne has pointed outCaptain Saunders now replies as undermag- ""Ee Teesdale Smith's offer. I consider the time stated to complete work warrants paying prices stated. Panldingham stated he wanted 5s., and we were to supply plant, tools, water, and pay men. I cannot do the work in three months."" the Now the Leader of the Opposition r i d i called. culed Captain Saunders' telegram, and said, "" What sort of a recommendation is that ? "" All that I have to say in reply to his comment is that the Supervising Engineer waited in my room on the 6th February, and himself to my face recommended the giving of this contract to Mr Teesdale Smith. If that recommendation is no good, why did the right honourable gentleman appoint Captain Saunders to that highly responsible post in South Australia? Mr Deane continuesI t will be seen that, in Captain Saunders' opinion, no better arrangement for carrying out this work properly can bo made, and I nsk the Minister to allow me to enter into a contract with Mr Teesdale Smith on these lines. Mr Smith is quite agreeable to paying a deposit and entering into a contract according to our specifications. The valuo of the work at each end would probably be between £20,000 and £30,000, and he offers to pay a deposit of £1,000 right away. The right lionorable gentleman opposite has been going round the country speaking as if this contractor had obtained a contract for both ends of the work, whereas he has only offered to do one end, namely, a section of 14 miles.",13
7,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Is that each end of the cutting ?,14
8,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No ; there are cuttings going up on to the tableland, and 7miles of cuttings going down from the tableland farther on. All that Mr Teesdale Smith undertook to do, and was allotted, was to carry out 14 miles of cuttings going up on to the tableland, and the engineer's estimate of - the cost on this approved recommendation was between £20,000 and £30,000, uot £60,000, as the Leader of the Opposition has been saying throughout the country.  work out at that?",14
9,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I will give the absolute facts which I have had taken out.,14
10,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Any that document must come to the conclusion that it is a contract for each end.,14
11,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not think so; no officer in the Department read the document in that way. The facts are all stated in the papers, and the honourable gentleman can come to his own conclusion. Continuing, Mr Deane saysThis is an urgent matter, and I think the chance, which has been quite unexpected, is a good one, and should be seized with the object of carrying out the work effectually promptly. Here is the point to which I ask honourable members to pay particular attentionMr Smith has to dispose of his plant from the Minippa-Streaky Bay contract, and he cannot hold his offer open for more than a day or two, otherwise, the plant, horses, and men will be dispersed. I strongly recommend the serious consideration of Mr Smith's offer, and shall be glad to have the Minister's approval with the least possible delay. What I did-and I take full responsibility for my action-wa s to approve of this contract on the data submitted to me., These data were first! that the price was safeguarded owing to it being based on the result of public competition in South Australia for similar work in similar country. What I submit is that on these particular data it was clearly my duty to take this expert advice so strongly given to me. I am not in a position, nor is any Minister in a position, to go round and take out quantities, and translate himself like a hero in the Arabian Nights over the country to spy out the land, and see if the recommendations given in regard to it are accurate in all particulars. I am only there to weigh carefully in the public interests the recommendations made to me. On the data submitted here, and the very strong recommendation, not only of the Engineer-in-Chief, but of his own lieutenant, who, the honourable member for Melbourne tells us, is a very excellent officer, it was my duty, I say, to give the utmost weight to this recommendation, and I approved of the contract.",14
12,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Why did you not call for tenders, though ?",14
13,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"A difficulty in calling for tenders, my honourable friend will see, was that the whole essence of this one reading contract was the time consideration, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out.  offer in?",14
14,Mr KELLY,Unknown,There was no other offer before me.,14
15,Mr WEST,Unknown,Y o u did not give any one an opportunity to make an offer.,14
16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I believed in the absoand lute exactness of every one of these recommendations and figures, and if I did not, my honourable friends over there know as well as I do what would have been my duty in the circumstances. had no reason to doubt the absolute accuracy in any particular of this recommendation.",14
17,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,Who suggested that?,15
18,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We l l , we are agreed. The point is not that I took Mr Teesdale Smith into my private sanctum and disbetter cussed this matter with him, or, as honourable member for Yarra said the other day-and I hope he will take the first opportunity of correcting the statethat ment- Mr Deane, Engineer-in-Chief, said that a yard was a fair price for the work, but Teesdale Smith got 4s. 6d. a yard, and 2s. a yard, in addition, for taking the material a chain and a half outside the railway cutting.",15
19,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Mr Deane swore to that in the Chinn inquiry.,15
20,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Why the Chinn in quiry took place three months before matter came up !,15
21,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Mr Deane swore to that.,15
22,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I think ib is infinitely to be regretted that an ex-Minister of the Crown should fish in such muddy would waters with so littl e justification.,15
23,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I will give ib bo you out of the evidence if you like.,15
24,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not want the substantially evidence given before the Chinn Commitstipulated tee. ' I am dealing with this particular contract,' and if the honourable gentleman cannob dissociate the two things in his deposit. mind, how are we going to get on with the consideration of this matter?",15
25,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,Mr Deane said that any rock-cutting could be done for nothing further to add. 3s. a y a r d ; why go back on that?,15
26,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am not attacking Mr Deane. I am explaining my own particular action in this and taking full responsibility for it . I have a great deal to say today, wards and I ask honourable members to allow I me to' go ahead. The next thing I month. wish to draw the attention of my honorThe able friends to is that there is a good sufficient answer to the ridicule which Leader of the Opposition has cast upon the penalty provision in this contract, the' actual terms of the reccommendation Crown Solicitor which I approved. What I approved of was a penalty of £1,000, plus other penalties, on a contract of the value of beI tween £20,000 and £30,000, to be completed with in three months.",15
27,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,"Was that one penalty of £1,000?",15
28,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I know m y honourable friends are not all students of the law, but some of them, at any rate, are much as paid agents in the Arbitratio n the Court than as interpreters of a legal document. I regret having to take a man who occupies so important a position as of the Leader of the Opposition, into what I might term the mere kindergarten 3s. of common sense, but so that there may be Mr no excuse for any honourable member 6d. again showing this lack of knowledge in regard to the penalty conditions of the contract, let me quote the opinion of the Crown Solicitor, to whom I referred this matter only this morning, in order that there might be no further doubt in re- gard to it . I wrote this minute to the this Crown Solicitor this morningIn approving this contract being allotted, I recognised time as being its essence, and was of the opinion that failure on the contractor's part to complete witbin the stipulated time justify forfeiture of the £1,000 deposit agreed upon. The. question has now been raised that the only penalty against delay in completion is the £5 per diem penalty provided in the contract form, and I accordingly would be glad of your opinion whether failure to complete the contract within the time would justify cancellation of the contract and forfeiture of the deposit.",15
29,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,You cannot for f e it the,15
30,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"A not h e r lawyer gives his opinion in regard to this matter. If the honourable member is acting as attorney for Mr Teesdale Smith, I have The Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth saysI think the time limit of three months, with a penalty for non-completion within the time, means completion, within the throe months or matter, a reasonable time afterwards. What would be a reasonable time afterwould depend on the circumstances; but think it would not extend to an additional Leader of the Opposition was tryingand to make this contract appear as if it the might be spun out for years, and I am giving in reply to the honourable member's in opinion the view of the Commonwealth",15
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I still think so.,15
32,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is impossible for the honourable member to change his mind. The Crown Solicitor's minute continuesIf the contractor failed to complete the within three months and a .reasonable time Afterwards, the Minister would clearly right to cancel the contract, and if he failed to substantially complete the work within the three months, and there was no reasonable possibility of his doing so, say, within a month try! more, I think also that the Minister would be entitled to cancel the contract.",16
33,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,He only thinks so.,16
34,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"What else can he do hut think ? The only person who can be sure is the person who has no data to go upon. Here is the language of the Crown Soliwould - citor in the clearest possible formThe penalty of f5 per day is a penalty for - exceeding the three months, and is not, in opinion, the only penalty against reasonable delay would involve cancellation of the contract, and the deposit would be able to make good any damage suffered by the - Commonwealth by reason of the non-fulfilment of the contract. I have explained to honourable members the actual position in regard to the penalty provisions. As I approved of the for cuttings? - contract-that is, on the recommendation-the penalty was £1,000 on a £20,000 or £30,000 job. In other words, it was a great deal more than the penalty imposed in the average contract for supplies and work done for Commonwealth Departments as a whole- I speak of the average contract, not of the contracts my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition, because he never Australian Government? thought of penalties; he did not bother about them-and that forfeiture of £1,000 is a very considerable penalty so small a contract. If my honourable friend wishes to arrive at a fair analogy would like him to refer to New South ment. Wales, where the Caucus Government sought, after mature consideration, enter into a oontract of £3,000,000 with - a private contractor without asking more than a bond of £50,000.",16
35,Mr WEST,Unknown,That contract was never made.,16
36,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I say that Cabinet sought to enter into such a contract, the Parliament of New South Wales feated it - Mr Hobler, Deputy Engineer-in",16
37,Mr WEST,Unknown,"You sought to behave - yourself, but you could not.",16
38,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"A great exponent of that, - dignity is on his haunches again. I - deal Hater on with the further questions penalties, but, as I have already said, I made this incursion into the kindergarten of common sense in order that my honwork orable friends opposite may not be able to further mislead their dupes with referhave a ence to these penalties. Mr .WEST - That is a nice way in which to insult the workers of this coun",16
39,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am absolutely taking ful l responsibility for approving of the contract on the facts submitted to me. If I had had any reason to believe that any one of the matters in the recommendation put before me was not correct, I not have entered into the contract.",16
40,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Would you have made my the contract if the railway had been your delay, as unown private concern ?",16
41,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes , on the recomavailmendation, I would, because if any man runs a private concern he must reasonably trust his experts.  whether South Australia is paying 4s. 6d.",16
42,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am taking steps to obtain that information. In regard to the question of price, I said to Mr Deane at the interview to which I have referred, ""Have you satisfied yourself that these prices are as stated?"" in other words, are they the same, with deductions, as the of price for which this contractor did similar work in similar country for the South Mr Deane told me that he had satisfied himself of that fact, and I then approved of the on contract. Honourable members will find in the file which I am laying on the table I today ample substantiation of my stateI have explained to the House exto actly what I did. I gave instructions v to Mr Deane then to be very careful for when the Crown Solicitor was drawing up the contract, that Mr Teesdale Smith was to complete the job within the stipulated period of three months, and some time afterwards, about but the .end of February-the actual date may debe seen by reference to these papers Chief, came to see me in regard to a proposal from the Engineer-in-Chief in addition to this 14 miles of counwill try, Mr Teesdale Smith should be given of a further section of '7 miles further along the line, and all the country in between. I said immediately to Mr Hobler, "" This is. an absurd proposition. I cannot tolerate anything of the k in d . ""  by then.",16
43,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No , the Leader of the Opposition did not appear on the scene for monthsafterwards ! I refused to give to this man whom I am accused of befriending this further section of line because I am a strong believer in the principle of calling for tenders, and the laughter on the part of honourable members opposite is surely most amazing, seeing that they are the party that does not believe in tendering at all, but believe in doing everything by departmental labour, not allowing the public the safeguard of public competition. However, I told Mr Hobler that I would not consider the proposition; whereupon he said, "" I am afraid you will have to . "" I said "" Why ? "" and he replied, "" Because Mr . Deane has written a letter on which Mr . Teesdale Smith will rely for getting a further extension of this section.""  your sanction ?",17
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Absolutely , and I am about to explain what action I subsequently took. I turned up that letter written by Mr Deane; and having found that the Crown Solicitor had in cluded this section in the unsigned contract, I immediately took steps to have the matter remedied. On the 7th February Mr Deane wrote to Mr Teesdale Smith as follows:Your OITCT is hereby accepted, subject to your leading the material from the cuttings into the embankments for l i chains, measured from the mouths of the respective cuttings, for which no payment will be made for that portion of the bank so constructed. . . . No extras will be paid for unless ordered in writ- dersing by the Minister or Engineer-in-Chief, nor yet will any claims for delays be entertained. . . . In case of any dispute, my decision' is to be absolutely final. And this is the dangerous paragraph that I discovered only at the end of FebruaryIn the event of your carrying out the going work to my satisfaction, it is understood that that portion of the line between 122 and 12!) miles will be carried out by you under the s:\mo conditions. I knew nothing of that letter or of that paragraph, but immediately I heard of it I said to Mr Hobler, "" This sort of thing cannot be tolerated.""",17
45,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Did you not smell a rat then?,17
46,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member may deal with smells, bu t at the present moment I am. dealing with facts. From this moment onwards the public records show-althoug h the Leader of the Opposition had not then come on the scene at all-that the Minister did not accept the recommendations of his officers with regard to this particular contract. Mr 'BAMFOBD - Why not?",17
47,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Because I did not think they were sound in the public interest. Any one with common sense in a Ministerial position is bound to accept the judgment of his experts on data, submitted when he has no reason whatsoeverto doubt the genuineness of it .",17
48,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,That was not an expert question.,17
49,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It was altogether outside an expert question. It was a legal question.,17
50,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Did Mr Hobler recommend it ?,17
51,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No .,17
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I remind honourable members that there is a time l i m it to speeches, and that every honourable member will have an opportunity of speaking and replying to any arguments or statements made. I ask honourable, members, therefore, to remember this, and refrain from interjecting.",17
53,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Immediatel y I got the recommendation before me, I sent for Mr Deane's letter to Mr Teesdale Smith, and my subsequent action is found on the public files. I found correspondence had ensued between Mr Deane and Mr Teesdale Smith. The following telegram had' been despatched by Mr Deane on the 19th February to Captain SaunIn the event of my at once letting Teesdale Smith that portion of the line between 122 and 129 miles, ascertain can he finish it in three months from this date. This was sent, no doubt, because I had impressed on the Engineer-in-Chief the absolute necessity for getting Mr Teesiale fore- Smith off the job in the three months. Mr Teesdale Smith replied on the 21st FebruaryIn reply to your telegram, I am prepared to carry out the second portion of the proposed work, finishing within the three months, provided you let me have the work on the top of the tableland, between the two points, at tbo prices already arranged. Whicli is easy country, I may say. I first of all took action to put the matter right so far as the Commonwealth was conminute cerned, telegraphing to Mr Teesdale Smith as follows on the 26th FebruaryRe Engineer-in-Chief's letter to you, dated 7th inst., which first came to my notice yesterday. Desire inform you concluding paragraph written without my authority. It was on the 25th February that I discovered this matter.",17
54,Mr FISHER,Unknown,A fortnight after the contract was signed.,18
55,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Mr Deane also wrote to Mr Teesdale Smith as followsI have to confirm my telegram of even date reading- "" Find that concluding paragraph of my letter of 7tli inst., in connection with section between 122 and 129 miles, was not in accordance with Ministers approval, and is hereby withdrawn."" Then Mr Teesdale Smith telegraphedI formally protest against withdrawal. This work was mentioned at interview.",18
56,Mr WEBSTEK,Unknown,Ah !,18

Three additional waggons, making total eight; sixty additional draught horses, making total 110; additional scoops, drays, harness, ploughs, &c. Without prejudice, however, I am willing agree withdrawal referred to by you, provided you give me the work from 88 to 92 miles, in exchange, and accept my tender for Gibson's tank. This was my replyBe your wires of yesterday to myself and Engineer-in-Chief, the final paragraph in Engineer-in-Chief's letter to you, dated 7th inst., was entirely unauthorized, and accordingly invalid. Consequently it is not a question of your making terms, but of your accepting a ""fact, of which I now give you formal notification. So that, owing to my action, the only result of this unauthorized letter is that Mr Teesdale Smith has not received a penny piece more of Government work. I may say for the benefit of the House that I had an inquiry into how the letter of the 7th February came to be written, and I found that Mr. Teesdale Smith had suggested it.",18
58,Mr HOWE,Unknown,He evidently got hold of you.,18
59,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Her e is another honourable member at the same thing, so dead to decency that he will not hear an official explanation of these things. This is a initialed by Captain SaundersOn their return to the office of the Engineerin-Chief, after a draft had been prepared of the Enginecr-in-Chief's letter to Mr Teesdale Smith dated 7th February, Mr Teesdale Smith asked that an undertaking with regard to the second portion of the line between 122 and 129 miles should be embodied therein, provided he carried out the first work to the satisfaction of the Engineer-in-Chief. "" Mr Teesdale Smith appealed to me, saying, ' That was arranged in the Minister's room.' He did not say, ' by the Minister.' I assented to this, and, in due course, the letter in question, with the condition asked for by Mr Teesdale Smith, waa despatched to him."" He certainly never said anything of the kind to me in the Minister's room.",18
60,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Who was in the Minister's room?,18
61,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth Bailways, the Supervising Engineer at Port Augusta, and also, during a portion of the inquiry, the Acting Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs. That was the first and last time. I ever saw Mr Teesdale Smith, This and yet we have this mountain of cowardly insinuation raised on so flimsy",18
62,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Then the paragraph in the Argus was wrong?,18
63,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall deal with that in a very few moments.,18
64,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Bette r deal with it now.,18
65,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the honourable member deals with it as the Leader of the Opposition dealt with it the other night, he will break a record that has stood for 2,000 years-the record of Ananias.",18
66,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It was sworn evidence.,18
67,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The next proposal of Mr Teesdale Smith was that he should be given work between the beginning of his work and our rail head; and that proposal I also turned down. Mr Teesdale Smith appears to be a very clever gentleman. I was given to understand that on that occasion he had the Commonwealth in his hands; but, on looking into the matter, I found that, so far from his having the Commonwealth in his hands, it was a case of Mr Teesdale Smith being in the hands of the Commonwealth. Mr Teesdale Smith had bought over our heads the camels which we had hired; and, under the circumstances, we could not get camels; and Mr Teesdale Smith said that he could not carry our culverts up to his work-that he was not in. a position to do so, for he put the matter, politely-unles s we gave him the particular additional work he required. This proposal was recommended to me very urgently by the late Engineer-in-Chief in a report, on which I put the following jhinute:- Plcasu let me have results latest costing Under Saunders' management for 5 miles of similar country. Iu the meantime, failing transport, so exercise.your powers because all Mr Smith's work has to be done under the direction of the Engineerin-Chiefunder contract that culverts, &c, may be put in later, by Department; Teesdale Smith being required to so order his embankments as to readily permit , of this being done. The effect of this on the operations of Mr Teesdale Smith and of the Commonwealth was that, instead of Mr Teesdale Smith having a line of communication, so to speak, for his material and water carts, he was required, under the powers of the contract, to heap up the earth on each side of the places where we expected the culverts to be placed, and to leave that earth there ready for us to f ill in. when transport was provided. This further apparent difficulty was surmounted ; and I again take full responsibility for, surmounting it .  do!",18
68,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If that is true, I am justified in thinking that the honourable member could not have done it . I remind honourable members that Mr . Deane's recommendation, as approved by me, referred to the value of this contract as between £20,000 and £30,000. , Mr FISHEU - At each end.",19
69,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Mr Teesdale Smith got only one end.,19
70,Mr EISHER,Unknown,"The letter to me spoke of 200,000 square yards.",19
71,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"E x a c t l y ; and the right honourable gentleman was not able to take out the simple arithmetical calculation which has been taken out by the officers of the Department. The schedule showed 107,279 cubic yards at 4s. 6d., or £24,137 15s. 6d.; banks, 134,744 cubic yards at 2s. 6d., or £ 1 6 , 8 4 3 ; and surface forming, 297 chains at 45s. per chain, £645 15s. So the actual cost of doing the 14 miles, instead of being, as represented to me, between £20,000 and £30,000, came out at £41,626 10s.6d. This I submit is a matter for which I cannot personally be held responsible.",19
72,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Minister, relied on the figures of others?",19
73,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"E x a c t l y ; and anybody with an atom of justice in his composition must see that a Minister is, perforce, compelled to rely on the official figures of his experts. Mr Hobler, who was on leave at the time, had nothing to do with the recommendations, but, on the contrary, was subsequently opposed to them. When Mr Hobler came back from his leave, he told me that he did not like the business; and this is what he had to say about it The portion of the line which is covered by Mr Teesdale Smith's contract is a series of hills rising to a tableland, and bore indications of being one of the most expensive parts of the railway to construct. The estimate of the cost of performing the work by departmental day labour is approximately 2$ per cent, less than the amount being paid to Mr. Teesdale Smith. . . . Consideration was given to the whole matter, and as it appeared probable that the departmental estimate, based on conditions applying nearer to Port Augusta, might'be slightly exceeded in respect of this particular work, and as, moreover, the utilization of Mr Smith's plant immediately available made it possible to complete much earlier than the Department by its own organization could, it was assumed that the 2$ per cent, difference, even if realized, was not sufficiently great to offset the advantage of an early completion The plate laying would, it was anticipated, be extended to this portion of the railway at a very early date; and the view was taken by the Engineer-in-Chief that if this excavation were not pushed on with forthwith, the plate laying would be liable to come to a full stop. He goes on to say. . . . and the interruption to operationswould cost the Department far more than it might possibly have saved by doing the 14 miles of earthworks itself. He (Engineer-inChief) regarded it as essential that this work, should be done, and done qtiickly, and considered that this was a favourable .opportunity of advancing the progress of the line.  spect this piece of work?",19

75,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes ; the report is dated 20th A p r i l , arid it has come from South Australia. Mr Bell saysAs instructed by the Minister, I lfave obtained a report from the Deputy Engineer-inChief (who is now at Port Augusta) as to the nature of the material which is being excavated by Mr Teesdale Smith under his contract. Mr Mobler's wire reads as follows:"" Your wire re contractor Smith's earthworks.

90,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I recognise immediately what my honourable friend has pointed o u t: that this is not the sort of think joke that an honest Caledonian Would care to make. This was merely an implied been charge of corruption. It was not a public straightforward calumny, such as a burglar of credit might have indulged in ; but rather a whispering, insinuating suggestion, such as might be made by a of public reputation, or a man to who had not the courage to come into the open and say clearly what he meant. At the very outset I challenged the right honourable whisperer. I analyzed his language, and challenged it. I am not going to take the House through the whole of these insinuations; but in its issue of 17th March the Argus reported the Leader of the Opposition as having said in the Melbourne Town HallI t was stated in the newspapers the other day that Mr Irvine, the Attorney-General, and Mr Kelly, the Acting Minister of Home Affairs, had a secret conversation, or interview, with prominent contractors, and that they discussed the probability of a contract being let in connection with the construction of the Western Australian railway. Later on, Mr Kelly is reported to have made a - statement to the press that let to Mr Teesdale Smith for the construe- tion of a portion of the transcontinental That is what the right honourable member said in Melbourne. Later on, in Sydney, when he had the official papers dealing with this matter, and knew that the contract was entered into on 6th February, three weeks before this alleged interview, he repeated this insinuation and attempted to connect the alleged interview with the contract. He knew in Sydney, even whilst he was talking to his dupes, that the date of the alleged interview, as given in the Argus, was the 23rd February.",20

Shades of Ananias! I have quoted the press, and he himself has quoted it as giving the first indication, of this matter in Melbourne long before he came upon the scene. There were in the press two references to this contract. One clearly emanated from me, and the other was stated to be an interview with me. They were published long before the right honourable member came upon the scene. And yet he said that we were tryin g to keep this matter secret. He had, further, the temerity to tell his audience that he could uot get an answer from the Department in regard to it . This file of papers will show that the Leader of the Opposition's letter was received in the Department of Home Affair s on Saturday, 14th March, before his Melbourne speech.

106,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It may be; but it is a very disreputable one. It is one which reflects not only upon the man attacked, but upon the institution of Parliament, and upon this country, of which this Parliament is a reflex. I can imagine no greater slander on the honesty of our people than to make these insinuations all round Australia t h at Ministers of the Crown are corrupt, and have secret dealings with private contractors, from which the contractors derive great benefit. It is obvious, therefore, to the whole House, although possibly half the House will not publicly recognise it , that these insinuations have no more solid foundation than that ' of party bias, and that my real f a u l t is that I occupy a place on this bench, and by so much stand in the right honourable gentleman's way.

I am not a suspicious person. I do not imagine that any one who knows me, at any rate, will believe that I am capable of being bribed; but I submit that on the facts that I have given to the House I could only regard in one light the continued insinuations and in nuendoes of the righ t whisperer, and was entitled when we came into this House to challenge him to formulate his insinuations or withdraw them.

127,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The r e is one rather amusing aspect of this affair. The righ t honourable gentleman has sought to flagellate me for seeing contractors. An y one who is in charge of a public Department doing public works, must necessarily from time to time see the persons with whom he does business. The ex-Minister of Home Affairs, the honourable member for Darwin, recognises that fact. never attempted to charge him, and God forbid that I should do so for a moment, with any suggestion of improper action in seeing contractors. He saw them. The only difference between myself and my predecessor is that for purposes of record - I put it on no other grounds- I prefer to see them in the company of other people. My honourable friend, properly no doubt in his own eyes, and acting without any idea that blame would'attach to him for doing so, used to see these contractors from time to time alone.

Mr Gorton, of the Powellising Company, a very good business man, called upon him and they did some departmental business together. No one will suggest that anything i m proper occurred, but if I am charged with want of business capacity, let me show that the ex-Minister who is admittedly the best business man that the Labour Pa.rty ever had, could make occasional mistakes.",23

132,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am as open as daylight, and I want my remarks regarding honourable the honourable member to be taken literally. I am not making any attacks whatever on his integrity.  He this.",23
133,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We did alter it too. W it h this one exception, where on the officers' recommendation there was particular reason for not calling for tenders, we have called for tenders for every important work for which tenders could be called, and that is a new thing in Australian politics during the last few years. Let us take the big Western Australian sleeper contract. The Fisher Government accepted the highest tender instead of the lowest. The ex-Prime Minister said, "" We called for tenders."" Is that to be merely an opportunity for. accepting the I highest, and not the lowest, offer that comes along ? They accepted the highest tender, and they told the House that they were dealing with the State of Western Australia. The Leader of the Opposition repeated this statement in his speech the other day. As a matter of fact, the persons who are making the most profit out of this are a private firm - the Powellising Company-the managing director of which, in the ordinary, course of business, called to see the ex-Minister. This is one of the astonishing results. I am quoting now from the agreement between the Western Australian Government and the Powellising Company-the head company. It provides the following payments-for all timber treated for the use and requirements of the Government of Western Australia within the State, 9d. per 100 super, feet; for all other timbers that they are to treat, and we are, of course, in that category, 2s. per 100 super, feet. That 2s. was reduced to Is. 3d. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I down.",23
134,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"My honourable friend did, but I am amazed that he did not challenge the agreement, as. a Commonwealth Minister should have done, on the ground that the Commonwealth was being plundered by having to pay a great deal more royalty than the State of Western Australia was asked to pay. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We know the other.",24
135,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What business men ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - That secret agreement.,24
136,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Whateve r else this agreement meant, it amounted to a g if t by the Commonwealth to the company of a large sum, because if 9d. was a fair price for supplying to the Western Australian Government, it ought to have been a fair price against us.",24
137,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Where is that company operating?,24
138,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is the head company in Western Australia, of which Mr Gorton is the most active agent, I understand, throughout Australia. The difference as between 9d. and Is. 3d. for powellising amounts to £13,125 on the whole contract, which we would have been presenting as a clear profit to the company under the agreement.",24
139,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,On how many sleepers?,24
140,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"On 1,400,000.",24
141,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,It would come to more than that.,24
142,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Thos e are the figures I have had worked out. There is a further thing. My honourable friend was not a rubber stamp;,24
143,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,We got a good bargain in the transportation of goods from the Western Australian Government.,24
144,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"-The honourable member says he did, ,but what does it work out at? He was working on a basis of 25s. per load for sleepers. We have got that price down now to. 23s.",24
145,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The royalty on the whole 1,400,000 sleepers would come to £35,000.",24
146,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am talking of the prices actually arranged. another point in connection with this Powellising Company which is interesting, in view of the talk which has been indulged in concerning admission by the side door. That company is not only a got him powellising company corporately, but in dividually its members are interested in the development of our rural industries by reason of their having taken up certain areas of land. It is also interesting to know that a gentleman in another place, who was recently chairman of a Select Committee, is similarly concerned in rura l industries along the route of this railway, and that the late Supervising did not Engineer of the Western Australian section of the line-no t in his own name, I understand-as o took up 1,000 miles was a of country in that same district. It is a further evidence of the business-like activity of this particular powellising industry, that it entered into contracts with the late Government-withou t any specifications whatever, and without any deposit-for the supply of 100,000 powellised mountain ash and messmate sleepers. Fortunately, it did not wish to go on with the contract, which was thereupon cancelled.",24
147,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,They said that they had taken the contract too cheaply.,24
148,Mr KELLY,Unknown,They agreed to supply the sleepers at 7s. 6d. each.,24
149,Mr BOYD,Unknown,It is only fair to say that the late Government had a man on the works for the purpose of inspecting every sleeper.,24
150,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is quite true. There were conditions imposed in that sense.' But I am speaking of the free criticism in which my lionorable friends opposite have indulged during the past few days, and I say that that contract was let absolutely on letter.",24
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What about the side door now?,24
152,Mr KELLY,Unknown,- I do not suggest anything about the side door in this connection.,24
153,Mr BURNS,Unknown,Who is the chairman of that company?,24
154,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Bles s me, my honourable friends now want to know everything! To go a stage further, the late Minister difference in of Home Affairs will recollect buying a certain amount of machinery, for which obviously tenders could not be called. Take, for instance, the Castle excavaThere is tor. That was bought without any tenders being ""invited. Being a patent, of course he could not invite tenders. Tliat excavator was bought without any tenders being called, and in the particular country in which it has been employed it has not proved a great success. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It s was rotten business.",24
155,Mr KEELY,Unknown,"So we can all make mistakes occasionally. Then at the Eederal Capital, the late Minister of Home A f fair s - in opposition to the advice of his expert advisers-purchase d an o il tractor, which has not been able to tract since.",25
156,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"S h e did good work, but they ran her through the river and spoilt her.",25
157,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That tractor cost £1,000, and her traction loads also cost three or f o n r times as much per ton as did those of the other tractors up there. Generally speaking, the purchase of this tractor was a rank bad bargain. It was bought on the engineering certificate of the late Minister of Home Affair s himself.",25
158,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,It was a good engine.,25
159,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The u what about all the contracts which were made by our predecessors i u office for the supply of wireless material ? I would like the Leader of the Opposition, my right honourable whispering friend, to inquire most carefully into the expenditure of £24,000 odd of public money with one company without any tenders being invited, and without any public competition whatever. In regard to the contract question as a whole, honourable members opposite must not be afraid that the Ministry will accept every tender which comes along. We use the tender system as a safeguardnot as a means for losing public money. Where any tender is too high by contrast with the official estimate, I have always made a point of refusing it , and of calling for fresh tenders.",25
160,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,In this case the Minister did not do that.,25
161,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"F o r the obvious reason that, according to the recommendation, tliere was not sufficient time.",25
162,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Undoubtedly , the M in ister was got at.",25
163,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What does the honourable member mean?,25
164,Mr HOWE,Unknown,That the Minister paid too much.,25
165,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The r e are two senses in which the statement that I have been got at might be construed.,25
166,Mr HOWE,Unknown,I did not intend the statepurchase ment in the personal sense-mos t certainly not.,25
167,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"W h e r e a tender is too high, I have' invariably called for fresh tenders. A case of this kind occurred at the Federal Capital the other day. The tenders received were too high, and I would not accept any of them. Two contracts for two small post-offices were announced yesterday. Both of them were considerably under the departmental estimate.",25
168,Mr WEST,Unknown,Were any restrictions i m posed in the specifications?,25
169,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No n e whatever.,25
170,Mr WEST,Unknown,I was told that there were.,25
171,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The r e were not. The first tenders were too high, so we called for fresh tenders, and we got better prices than were disclosed in the official estimate. Consequently, we accepted one of those tenders. So far as railways are concerned, I am having prepared-for confidential purposes-a n official estimate of the cost of constructing that line, so that we may be able _to gauge the value of the tenders we receive for general line construction. W it h us, calling for public tenders, I repeat, is a public safeguard, and we have instituted this practice for the first time for three years, and have departed from it in only one instance, in which time prevented the adoption of that safeguard. I can only sav that the reference to the Queensland system which was made by the .Leader of the Opposition was a little b it faulty in two particulars. In the first placealthough the information was contained in the report from which he quoted-the figures which he gave in regard to day labour entirely ignored the. circumstance that a great deal of up-to-date machinery is used in Queensland today, whereas none of this machinery was employed at the time the works of which he spoke were constructed by contract. Moreover, the country in which works were carried out under the contract system was entirely dissimilar in character from that in which similar undertakings were constructed by day labour. I would further point out that the so-called system of day labour which was employed there was not the day-labour system we understand it. Engineer-in-Chief for a this matter, and I propose to conclude my remarks by quoting from that document. This officer, it must be remembered, was Engineer-in-Chief in Queensland u n t i l he accepted his present position under the Commonwealth. Mr KINOO ' MALLEY - Is the Minister referring to Mr Bell?",25
172,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . has reported as followsAs desired by the Minister, I have to advise that the method under which railways have been constructed in Queensland for a number of years has been by a combination of day labour with small contracts, butty-gang, or piece-work. * Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Now , about the statements that made in this House ?",26

177,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Mr Kernot, the Engineer-in-Chief for this State, told me that it doesI t has been almost the invariable custom to let the erection of timber bridges by those methods, also side-cutting, side drains, surface forming, and clearing, and frequently erection of fencing, erection of telegraph line, culverts, getting and filling ballast, &c, &c., and occasionally plate laying and centre-cutting. That is distinctly the opposite of what we have been led to believe by my honourable friends' opposite.",26
178,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,To what lines does Mr Bell refer?,26
179,Mr KELLY,Unknown,To those upon which he has been working for years.,26
180,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Then he is wrong.,26
181,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Mr Bell is wrong in saying what he has been doing?,26
182,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,What Cloncurry and Richmond lines?,26

184,Mr KELLY,Unknown,So much for the figures quoted in this connection by the right honourable gentleman.,26
185,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The honourable member has not read the whole of the report. He should read it all.,26
186,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have no objection to That gentleman read it all. Mr Bell further says The letting of this was left in the hands of the engineor-in-chargc of the work, who was supplied by me with a schedule of quantities and prices to work to. Exactly the same principle as we are working on the transcontinental line in Western Australia to-daywhat These small contracts and piece-work parhave been ticulars were shown on separate pay-sheets, and were carefully scrutinized in my office each month, the pays being made every four weeks. This is the man who did not know what he was doing!

187,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Leader of the Opposition said it was day labour.  The transaction was direct between the Government and the man. That is piecework.,26
188,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"My honourable friends opposite had better settle it amongst themselves. The Leader of the Opposition says it is day labour. The next man to him becomes furious at the idea of describing it as day labour, and says thab it is piece-work. The Engineer-in-Chief, who had charge of it , describes it practically as petty contract work. In the face of this report, the figures upon which our honourable friends opposite have been relying throughout the country are shown bo be, to the extent indicated, bogus and misleading.",26
189,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Minister did nob intend to read that last paragraph. He about the - was going to omit it until he was challenged.,26
190,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"What next? Ifc is the best paragraph of the lot. I have now to read the last paragraph of the reavailable; portWork for which a reasonable price could not be obtained or which could not be veniently or expeditiously done in this was carried out by day labour. When men were employed by small contracthe Department. tors, their time was taken by the departmental time-keeper, and they were paid the rates arranged for between them and their ployer, the latter being paid the difference between the value of the work done by him the month and the amount due in wages his men. Whafc we are proposing in connection done. with the transcontinental railway is to endeavour to secure satisfactory tenders for the completion _of the line. We want to know where we stand. That is the main the line. reason for doing work by contract. We cannot know where we stand if we do the work by departmental labour. At Capital, in connection with the Militar College, last year, the accounts of the Home Affairs Department got hopelessly astray, so that we had to find an immense sum of money this year, the necessity for which we did not know anything about it until the Estimates were being prepared.",27
191,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,The honourable gentleman means to refer to the Defence Department ?,27
192,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"- No ; to the Home Affairs Department employed in construcreally tion for the Defence Department. It has been clearly shown fchafc, in connection with the expenditure of public money, the Commonwealth is to run its projects upon anything like safe business lines, we must adopt better methods. We propressing pose to get the benefit of public competinecessary tion in order that we may contrast tenthe derers' prices with our own estimates. I we see any justification, and I have the slightest doubt that it will be readily forthcoming, we can adopt the wise and sensible course in the construcmen tion of the transcontinental line, knowing before we start exactly how much it going to cost.  wish to preface the remarks I intend to make by saying that it must be clearly understood that I impute no motives to either past or present Ministers. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has stated the case for the Government. Roiled down, the justification for the - adoption of the contract system is based' . upon two considerations-first , the time and, secondly, the nature of the material in the cutting to be made, which is held to j u s t if y the fabulous prices toconbe paid for the work. Surely this is a way grave censure on the administration of Could there be a graver censure upon the administration than that it should be left t ill the eleventh emhour to make this particular contract for when it was known to every man in the to Department, and particularly to Mr . Deane, that this difficult work had to be It was urged upon him by theSupervising Engineer that it was necessary to make ready for this work, or there would be a block in the construction of The matter was left t ill theeleventh hour, and the Minister has said that it must be settled today. The fact the that cuttings would have to be made at y Lake Windabout, which is, roughly speaking, 100 miles from Port Augusta, in country I have been over scores of times, was well known to Mr Deane from the very inception of this great work. Yet is lef t t ill this year before any attempt is made to prepare for it . It is a singular fact that in connection with everything with which Mr Deane has been associated there has been procrastination and blundering to such an extent as to hamper the whole work of the construction of this line. I think it is time that the blame should be laid on the if proper shoulders in connection with this particular matter. In the early stages of the work the Supervising Engineer was the Department to obtain the plant of small trucks to handle sand in connection with the depot f where the station yard is at present. F o r not months and months this man, whom we very were paying £1,800 a year, turned down the representations made to him, and theengaged upon the work had to barrow out the stuff on planks, because there is were no other means provided for the purpose. Again, he is responsible for the excavator that is referred to. It was I used for a section of the work, and was proved to be an absolute failure. If any one wishes to know where it is today, I can tell him that it is on a scrap-heap 50 or 60 miles from Port Augusta. For that thing the Commonwealth has had to pay something like £3,000. Again, I lay the blame at the door of Mr Deane, the exEngin'eer-in-Ohief for Commonwealth Eailways. We have another example of his want of capacity in the fact that while he knew that engines would be required to carry out the construction of this great work, he had some f a d in his head about some other kind of motive power, and he procrastinated and delayed calling for tenders u n t i l the men had to endeavour to carry out the work with engines which should have been on the scrap-heap.",27
193,Mr KELLT,Unknown,"I do not think the honourable member is quite correct in that, as Mr Deane strongly recommended Baldwin engines six months before the late Government went out. I am speaking from memory. ",28
194,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I know he made a recommendation which was not accepted.  the men had to slave along as best they could, and I saw the in coming back from a trip , and having to draw the fires in order to repair engines while they were almost red hot. Let us look at this question of the want of time. Surely there should have been time enough to put down a few trial holes. Is the Prime Minister aware that no tria l holes were sunk before entering into this country? Some have been sunk since, but only two of them proved the existence of hard material. My information, like that of the Minister, is second-hand, but it is to the effect that most of the work can be done with scoop and plough. Por this work the contractor is to get 4s. 6d. a yard, and we are told that the price was based on that paid by the South Australian Government. The Minister would have strengthened his case had he ascertained from the South Australian Government that the facts were correctly reported.",28
195,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Instruction s were given last week to do that, and the complete schedule is coming over.  should have been here today. It came as a revelation to rae that the South Australian Government is paying 4s. 6d. a yard for ordinary excavation on the Mannipa line, where there is hardly any stone cutting. I think that the Minister - will find that he has been misinformed on the point. It is said, too, that 2s. 6d. a yard is being paid for the banks. What is meant by ""bank""?",28
196,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The material taken out of the cutting has to be removed, without cost to the Commonwealth, 1£ chains from the mouth of the cutting.  little greater than the length of this chamber. In addition to what is paid for excavation, the contractor is to be given 2s. 6d. for putting the earth on the bank. I challenge the Minister to find a parallel for the cost in South Australia.",28
197,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I was assured by the Engineer-in-Chief that he had checked the figures.  found that other statements which he was assured were correct are not correct, and he will find to his sorrow that South Australia is not paying 2s. 6d. for work such as the Commonwealth is paying for at that rate. I have had something to do with constructional work. A certain amount is always paid for making up a bank, but the contractor has to remove the earth from a cutting in any case. The Commonwealth is paying this contractor 2s. 6d. a yard for the removal of the earth. The contract which has been let means an expenditure of about £ 3 , 0 0 0 a mile for earthworks alone. Most of the country through which the line goes can be excavated with plough and scoop; there are no waterways to be bridged, and consequently no culverts to be made. The contractor has merely to take out so many cubic yards of earth and put it on a bank, and for this the Commonwealth is paying nearly £3,00 0 a mile. I venture to say that the cutting at Port Augusta is larger than any otlier in the contract.",28
198,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"That cutting is practically through pure'sand.  it was through stiff clay, and made with obsolete machinery. At the beginning they had to cut a gullet into the middle of the cutting and to carry out the earth on drays over a heavy sand track. Yet the whole cost was only Is. 9d. a yard. The. Minister did not tell us that this contractor is getting £ 2 5s. a chain for construction formation under a foot in depth. For any formation where the cuttings are less than a foot in depth the price is £ 2 5s. a chain. For practically 60 miles of similar country, the Governmeut itself did the work for 15s. lOd. a. chain. The earth has merely to be scooped up on each side of the track to form a bank to carry the sleepers and rails; for this £'2 5s. a chain is now to be paid. It was alleged that a prime factor in determining the contract was that the contractor had a plant close at hand. It was stated at first that this plant was at Port Augusta; as a matter of fact it was from 250 to 300 miles from the place, and the contractor had another 20 miles of construction work to finish with it there. The first thing he did was to buy, over the head of the Government, 'camel teams and other teams which came tliere loaded with Government requirements; that showed his gratitude. He also bought up all the water, right on to Tarcoola, again showing his gratitude. But I am assured today by the Assistant Minister that he has not gained anything by that, because, under the Commonwealth law, we have power to resume. Another reason that has been urged why this contract was let was because of the difficulty of getting water there. Surely to Heaven this great Commonwealth, if it had at the head of affairs the men whom it ought to have, could get water for this work as well as Mr Smith could. He soon made an arrangement for bringing water on to the work by carrying pipes from some water supply he has at a distance. It was quite easy for the Commonwealth to make similar provision.",28
199,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Does not the fault lie rather with the Engineer-in-Chief, who recommended all this?  to make that point? Not only was the present Minister deceived regarding matters put before him in connection with the contract, but his predecessoi also deceived, although he very nobly accepts all responsibility. Who was redifficult sponsible for the contract for supplying 100,000 mountain ash powellised sleepers Primarily it was the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, Mr King O'Malley; but, in my opinion, he was as innocent in that matter as the Assistant Minister today is.",29
200,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"And equally guilty, if guilty at all.  is a limit to the sheltering of public Departments from the responsibility of their action. It is about time, significance. I think, that somebody spoke up and exposed the man who is responsible for this great blunder.",29
201,Mr HOWE,Unknown,We ought to get the Public Service Commissioner out of the road and shift a few of them.,29
202,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,He did not appoint Mr Deane.,29
203,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I do not know; but some of the officers want shifting.  to that point. The Assistant Minister is not referred to. We paid about £5,000 to Lawrence and Chalmers, of New South Wales, for a permanent survey of the line from Port Augusta to Tarcoola, and part of their duty, I am informed, was to show when the sections came out the nature of the country to be passed through. I understand that the present Government got that survey made for the purpose of letting this work on contract; but again I would point out that there wa3 not a trial hole put down in these banks.",29
204,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not think that you are right there. I think that that work was done because it was a question, of expenditure.  know",29
205,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,The engineer's report states the borings in those particular cuttings. ,29
206,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The engineer referred to in the papers that the Minister read today.  not read anything of the kind. I can the assure the honourable member that not a trial hole or a boring was put down in was any part where the cutting was to be made. It was represented that it was and hard country, but not a trial hole was put down. We paid a high ? price for a permanent survey of the section, and I want to know whether it is true, as I have been informed, that deviations have now been made in the survey, and that they .are distinctly in favour of the contractor.",29
207,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,Where is the Minister? This is a very serious thing to say.,29
208,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,What is the significance of the heads of that statement? ,29
209,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,A r e you sure that a deviation was made after the contract was let?  rny information is correct.,30
210,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Messrs. Lawrence Chalmers were engaged to survey, I think, 120 miles of line, which had to be done, quickly, and that was about six months ago.  their work.",30
211,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"But it was not in relation to any contract at all.  finished their work, for which paid £4,000 or £5,000.",30
212,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,They were last Government first.  the Government about that at all ; am I imputing anything to them. My information is that deviations have been made which give scores of thousands yards at this fabulous price to Mr Smith.,30
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is the serious part of the thing.,30
214,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"If that deviation been made, the contract is practically broken, and the contractor can do what he likes.",30
215,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,He will take material out by the yard.,30
216,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"But he will get yards to take out.  ister has admitted that, instead of £20,000 to £30,000, the contract repreness, sents £41,000, again showing that he been misled by his advisers. I venture to say that when the contract is finished the cost will be between £50,000 £60,000.",30
217,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"There was one small viation recommended by Mr Deane, and I referred the matter"" to the new gineer-in-Chief. Speaking entirely memory, it was a deviation which, I think, shortened the length of the line very materially, but added to the extent of the excavation. It added, roughly, think, to Mr Smith's total contract, it decreased the cost of rail supplies about £1,000. It was recommended Mr Bell, the new Engineer-in-Chief, I accordingly approved of it . That is the were. only deviation.  been made. It has increased the number of yards that Mr Smith is to but, on the other hand, it is claimed by the Department that the shorter haulage and reduced rail material will compensate.",30
218,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Will that deviation break and the contract?,30
219,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No .  way, I think, of clearing up this matter. The Assistant Minister has made his statement in good faith, but he has been deceived, if he has not been sold.",30
220,Mr HOWE,Unknown,Bough t and sold. have Mr MCWILLIAMS - That is a very i m we have proper remark to make.,30
221,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I did not mean a perengaged by the sonal reflection.  nor that, because the Minister representing my party was misled by the same man. The present Minister has made a statement tp-day regarding the nature of this of country, the quantity of earth for removal, and the total cost. T predict that most the cost will be considerably more than he has stated. I assert that, with the has exception of two tria l holes, it was all soft, ploughable, and scooping country. The Minister has admitted that there were from twenty bo thirty-five scoops the working when his own officer went up, who, he said, saw only scoops on top. He more could not know what was below if they were only scooping on top. Unless there n - is an inquiry held into this matter by from men who know something about the busii t will be a question of my word had againsb the Minister's word. I do not wish to make any imputation. I believe that the present Minister is as innocenb and as any man can be. That he did not show enough business capacity is clear defrom the fact that he did not insist on brial holes being pub down, or object to Enthe contractor getting 4s. 6d. a yard from from an open cutting and carrying the stuff a chain and a half, getting an additional half-a-crown on the 4s. 6d., making a total of 7s. per yard. He shows I want of practical knowledge in connection but with that work; but, far be it from me to by say that he has been in any other way by more culpable, or deceived, than honour and able members of the previous Government",30
222,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Y o u say it is costing the Commonwealth 45s. for what we cam take out, get done for 15s. lOd. ? 9  prices-4s . 6d. a yard for cuttings, 2s. 6d. on the bank for earth removed from cuttings over \ \ chains at each end, £ 2 5s. per chain for formation which is not more than a foot in depth, and 4s. 6d. a yard for formation which is over a foot in depth. My opinion is that Mr . Teesdale Smith is getting £ 2 5s. a chain for work similar to 50 miles of work done by our people at an approximate cost of 15s. lOd. per chain. All these facts can be verified by an inquiry on the spot.",30
223,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"They have not given a contract for 50 miles of that work.  extent of country there is . at £ 2 5s. per chain. I do not think there is ""a great deal of it .",31
224,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"It is roughly only £ 1 2 0 more per mile.  the cuttings, and the 2s. 6d. for carting out on the banks.",31
225,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"As blue metal can be taken out at 2s. 6d. a yard, why does this cost 4s. 6d. ?  cessity for Mr Deane to be placed in the position which he represented himself to the Minister to be in when he said that he was pressed for time. Every man who was about the job knew that these cuttings had to be made. They knew that, not twelve months ago, but two years ago; and I want to tell the M in ister that practically the same procrastination is going on today in connection with waterworks. No provision is being made for the water supply, and presently we shall be told of some other contracts being let, and in connection with which it will be said, again, that time is the essence. The work is advancing into the dry country, and yet no provision is made at all for water supply. Ha d Mr . Deane so desired, he could have procured a plant and carried out these cuttings long ago, as has been done on other jobs. Twelve months ago, if necessary, he could have had a gang of men engaged in making the cuttings and preparing for the laying of the rails when they came along, but nothing was done until the eleventh hour, and then Mr Deane went to the extent of saying that Mr Teesdale Smith's offer was only open for the day, because the contractors' plant would be moved away. Mr Smith had no plant within 250 or 300 miles of the spot. If ever there was anything that looked like deliberate misrepresentation it was the statements made in connection with this contract, and the blame ought to be sheeted home to the person responsible. I do not think it is for the Minister, or for Parliament, to shoulder the blunder, if it is not worse than a blunder, in connection with this job.",31
226,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Hav e you any explanation of Captain Saunders' attitude?  Captain Saunders' position was not put as clearly by the Minister as it might have been put. Time after time, Captain Saunders has brought before the Department the necessity for getting this particular work done ahead of him, so' that when the plate-laying gangs came along there would be no block. He received a telegram while we were sitting on the Royal Commission in Adelaide, and he said then, "" I cannot do this work in three months."" He knew fro m previous experience that he could not get the plant.",31
227,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"He said that he could not get a wheelbarrow without reference to Melbourne.  the essence of a contract, we expect to pay more for the work.",31
228,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Why did the Department want it done in three months?  Deane said so.,31
229,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"What was the hurry?  made to within a few miles of this, spot, and u n t i l thiswork is done, it blocks the plate-laying, and will throw out the other construction gangs. These cuttings, and all the work preparatory to plate-laying, ought to have been done six or twelve months ahead. Captain Saunders made a truth f u l statement when he said, "" I cannot do the work in three months, and if you want to make time the essence of the contract, you must pay more for it . "" He has not said that in any document, but he knew well the difficulty of getting additional plant. Time after time he asked to have this work done, and Mr Deane blocked it on every occasion: In the end, Captain Saunders said that if the Department must have the work done within three months, an extra price would have to be paid, and having regard to that fact the price obtained by Mr Teesdale Smith, might be within the mark. The surveys were carried out by the one Department, and Mr Deane absolutely took over the control of them. I venture to say that Captain Saunders was under the impression that the Department had the details of the shaft sinking and boring in connection with these works.",31
230,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The price was quoted to Captain Saunders, and he again expressed approval; that is what I cannot get over.  orable member see that there is a catch in that? What does Captain Saunders mean by 4s. 6d. in the cutting, and 2s. 6d. on the bank? different propositions in the ordinary application of work, but in this particular job the earth taken out of the cuttings is placed on the bank, and 2s.' 6d. extra is charged for it . I do not think Captain Saunders had that in mind. His reference was to works in which the earth is taken out of a side cutting, and it is necessary to get the material from beside the roadway in order to build up the bank.",32
231,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The telegram does not say so ?  state much in a telegram, and nothing was done u n t i l the very last moment. The Minister was told, practically with a pistol at his head, that unless he accepted this contract that very day, the offer would be no longer available; and Captain Saunders was in the same position. One thing that was particularly noticeable this afternoon was that the Minister never attempted to justify the contract. The whole of his speech was to clear himself of any imputations. Prom the very first I made no imputation, because I know that his predecessor was put in the soup in the same way by, the same gentleman.",32
232,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"He a r , hear.  blame was placed on the proper shoulders. T say one thing, and the Minister the opposite, and the only way to clear the matter up is to have a special inquiry on the ground. One of the primary faccause tors in the price should be the nature the material to be removed. it is hard material, while others say i soft. I maintain that the only way to A u d it Bill . get evidence is on the spot. The very fact merely in name. that there is practically £3,000 a mile paid for mere earthworks without culverts, side drains or waterways, just merely dealing with the earth, 'gives an idea of the price the Government are paying for this contract. However, I shall occupy no further time in dealing with that matter. I understand that at Mount Gambier the Prime Minister made the statement that Ministers had tried to pass through the House measures of a non-contentious character, but that when they were sent to the Senate they were treated as party matters. He went so far as to mention three Bills-the No r f o l k Island Bill , the Pine Creek-Katherine Eiver Bill , and the amendment of the A u d it Act There are two and he led his audience to believe that these Bills had been rejected.",32
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I did not.  member said that they were treated on party lines.,32
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I did .  they get through the Senate if they were treated on party lines. Is it not a fact that two of them are now on the statute book without amendment?,32
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes .  come about?,32
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Because senators dared not stand to their arguments, and had to knuckle down.  member did not tell the people at Mount Gambier that these measures were now on the statute-book without amendment ",32
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I was referring to the Public Works Committee Bill and to the Committee of Public Accounts Bill .  No r f o l k Island Bill , the Pine CreekKatherine River Bill , and the A u d it Bill .",32
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , I went into details, and showed what the Senate tried",32
239,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I oansays not allow this dialogue.  out that these Bills had been rejected beof a party fight, but every one of knows that they passed without amendSome say ment. What was the only non-cont is tentious Bill that was rejected? The It was an A u d it Bill It certainly altered to be the date of the financial year, but it also provided for a Supply and Tender Board. Was it not said on this side of the House, "" Put these matters in two measures, and we will pass both of them ? """,32
240,Sir JOHN PORREST,Unknown,"Why the need do that?  can we find the Tender Boards in such a hours. position as provided in that Bill . South Australia the Tender Board is under the Public Service Commissioner; it is the same in New South Wales, and I understand that it is the same in Victoria. Therefore, when it came to appointments and making appointments by regulation, as provided in the Audi t B i brought down by the right honourable the Treasurer, we drew the line, though we offered to pass both matters if they were put into distinct measures.",33

If the Ministry desire a test, let us go to the country at once. It has been said that the Liberals have my constituency of Grey "" in their pocket.''",33
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Who says that?  Liberals say; and I am ready to try conclusions. There is no doubt that the Attorney-General desires a fight; he does not believe in sticking here doing nothing, and for him the present Ministerial inaction has no attraction. doubt that the honourable gentleman sacrifices thousands of pounds by remaining in his present position in this Government; but he is a man of action, and does, i think, desire a double dissolution. As for other Ministers, I do not think they would welcome .a dissolution, double or single. If they are in favour of a double dissolution, why do they insist on having new rolls, and thus putting off the possibility of a contest for six months, even if the two test measures are not passed ?",34
249,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Does the honourable member wish to go to the country now ?  go now, and I am prepared to accept the challenge of the Ministry tomorrow. I shall, I suppose, have the hardest fight of any candidate in South Australia; but that does not deter me; and I certainly do not wish to remain here indulging in a faction fight all the year. If Ministers are in earnest, let us go to the country, and then, perhaps, they will have a chance to carry out their great programme. should think that the Government's first experience of contract work will be a warning to them. The plea, of course, for having this work done without tenders was want of time. I may say that I am credibly informed that there was another tender, and I should like to know whether the Prime Minister knows anything of the matter.",34
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is not so.  fchafc it is so. I am told fchafc Mr made an offer to dofchiswork; and I ask the honourable gentleman to find out ther that is a fact. It is said that Timms put in an offer, and was prepared fco enter into negotiations. I do not that the matter went to the Minister, I venture to say that support of my ment will be found in the Department. The contractor whom I have named came beat fore the Commission and offeredfcodo work at £1,000 a mile; he wished to have a "" cut-in,"" and, naturally, he was "" on the job "" as soon as possible. Mr Baxter, too, was on the spot; and I feel sure that in twenty-four hours the Government could have got tenders. Mr Baxter's visit showed that the Government were in favour of tenders, and Mr Timms was in communication, it is said, with the Engineer-in-Chief. This, however, has There is no been kept in the background by the Government.",34
251,Colonel RYRIE,Unknown,That is a serious charge to make.  and I stand by it.,34
252,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"W as that offer made to the Minister?  liament does not like to take undue advantage of his privileges; but there are circumstances in this, and other contracts, that have a very ugly look, and every one of them can be traced fco one man. If Mr Timms was in negotiation, and made an offer, I wish to know what that offer was. Mr W . H . IRVINE - To whom was the offer made ?  in-Chief, as was the offer of Mr Teesdale Smith.",34

I am not making any charges against the Honorary I Minister, whom I believe to be as innocent of any wrong-doing as any man in the House, but I do not say the same of all. There is indication of something very "" crooked"" about the business. When I interjected today, the Honorary Minister said he had never seen any offer; and I believe that is true; but, still, I think he knows something about it.",34
254,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Why were Mr Baxter . Timms and Mr Sadler not asked to tender?  wheinspect the work, and that is how Mr . Mr Teesdale Smith got to know this nice little job was going. As I said before, I say am as eager as the Attorney-General is bufc to appeal to the electors, and to learn statewho have to rule this country. I have no hesitation in saying that as things are present nothing can be done in this the Parliament, just, as we know, nothing was done last session. If the Government had introduced a policy of non-contentious measures we could have done work this session and last session that would have reflected credit on the Legislature. ""We might, for instance, have dealt with the Northern Territory, where inoney is going to waste. But there is no policy, and there never has heen one, in regard to that portion of Australia. Even if this particular legislation occupied us for three years it would be work well done; and it could have been performed entirely free from party lines. We might have found Liberals and Labour men taking sides, and, perhaps some scrambling amongst the States as to the routes of the railways, and so forth; but we could have had a settled policy gard, not only to railways, but also to water conservation and mining.",34
255,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"There are railways required where there are people; and what is the use of providing lines where no people are?  ber does not know what he is talking about. The Northern Territory will in the future carry millions of people. Why does the honourable member not go to the Northern Territory? Simply because there are no railways. The striking requirements of the Territory are railway construction, water conservation, and the encouragement of mining; and all these should be pushed on concurrently. At present, however, we are going on this session as we did last session, fighting over twopenny halfpenny Bills like that relating to preference to unionists. there one unionist less in the Government service today as the result of the MinisEngineer-in-Chief terial minute? Will there be one less as the result of the proposed Bill, even if it be passed? Not one. The Honorary Minister has, I see, now entered the Chamber, and I should like to repeat that a contractor named Timms made an offer to do the work which has been under dis- not. cussion this afternoon.",35
256,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No such offer was before me at the time the contract was signed. I can assure my honourable friend that I am having the fullest inquiry made into the circumstances.  Minister also inquire whether the offer I have referred to was received in the Department ?,35

My information may be wrong, but I was told this week in Adelaide that Mr Timms was in communication with the exEngineer-in-Chief. If he was, then the Minister should have known of it ",35
258,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Certainly .  things of which the honourable gentleman on his own showing, was not aware.",35

He was quite capable of undertaking this work, ancl I fail to understand why he was not permitted bo put in a price. Had he been allowed bo do so, the Minisber would have gained a better idea of whebher the prices offered were reasonable. Ib is rumoured that Mr Timms made an offer, and,that he was in communication with the labe Engineer-inChief, bub I cannot say whether or not an actual concrete proposal was made. It was Mr Timms who, when before the Royal Commission, stated that he was prepared to take a contracb for all the earthworks on the line at the rate of £1,000 a mile and to complebe the work Is in two years.",35

261,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member's knowledge of contractors should be sufficient to satisfy him that what they oiler to do when before a Committee ie not always what they will do when they are asked to set out on paper the price at which they will undertake a work.  like to ask the Minister whether any t r i a l holes were put down. - Mr KELLY - As a matter of fact It h i nk there were trial holes.  - down after the contract was let. .

Did the Minisber think, when he let the contract at 4s. 6d. a yard for the cuttings, that he would have to pay an extra 2s. 6d. per yard for carting earth up to the bank?",35
262,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That was only bo be paid afber the first chain and a half.  length of this chamber.,36
263,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It depends upon the size of the cutting whether it is a fair thing or not.  Minister imagined he would have to pay in addition to the 4s. 6d. a yard for scooping out. the earth, 2s. 6d. a yard for carting it on to the bank. His experience in this instance should be a warning to him in dealing with future contracts. Mr W . H . IRVINE (FlindersAttorney-General) [5.26] - The Teesdale Smith contract has already been referred to at length in this House, but I feel that I cannot allow it to pass without a few words from myself. It is fortunate for us in Australia that hitherto there have been but few charges or insinuations of corruption in connection with our. parliamentary life. Mr ..KING O'MALLEY - There is no charge of corruption now. Mr W . H . . IRVINE - And it is in the interests of not merely the side to which an honourable member who is as attacked belongs, but of every side, and of every man on each side, that such charges, if made, or insinuated, should be either proved or disproved. The corporate honour of this House cannot afford to allow even the slightest shadow or slur cast upon the personal honour of its members to remain uninvestigated or unexamined. The ex-Minister of Home A f fairs says that no such charge has been made - We are accustomed, as all who enter public life must be, to stand hard I obtained knocks. We must be prepared to receive them. ' We sometimes give them, and none of us can complain so long as they are delivered face to face and above the belt. But where we find a man, occupying this position of leader of one of the great parties in this Commonwealth, not having the courage to put forward a direct charge, but spreading abroad the subtle poison of insinuation, which is in finitely more dangerous, then not for a moment can those who are directly or indirectly touched, afford to take no notice of it . It is said that no charge was made. No direct charge was made, but may I ask honourable members what is intended to be conveyed when reference is made to a secret conversation, or interview, with contractors. In the first place, this interview was not a secret one. But what is the object of saying that an interview was "" s e c r e t "" unless it be to convey the impression that there is something that will not bear the light of day?",36
264,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"And there is, too.",36
265,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Does the honourable member now make a charge of corruption ?,37
266,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I do not make anything of the kind.,37
267,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Does the honourable member insinuate corruption?,37
268,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,No .,37
269,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Then the honourable member had better hold his peace in this connection. Those who attempt to take away the honour of other men who are as honourable as themselves tread upon very dangerous ground.,37
270,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The whole business is very shady.,37
271,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I heard a few moments ago the word ""fishy "" proceed from over there. Are these interjections intended to refer entirely to those who have dealings with the Government? Are they not intended to have some references to the conduct of Ministers themselves? When the ex-Prime Minister refers to the "" uprightness "" of the Attorney-General, does he not convey the impression that there is in this transaction something inconsistent with it? When he says that this Government ""came into bring about clean government,"" what meaning has that remark in relation to this transaction, if it is not intended to convey to those who have no other means of knowledge than what they hear from him as their leader, the impression that there was something unclean in the transaction into which the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs entered? The ex-Prime Minister, then, is the man who makes this charge. He is the man who spreads abroad these poisonous insinuations. I am not going to make innuendoes. I propose to make a direct charge. I assert that the Right Honourable Andrew Fisher, who ventures to go about Australia spreading abroad these vile insinuations against the public credit and honour of his opponents, is the man who, or whose Government, is responsible for first of all introducing into Australian public life the spoils system of the United States.",37
272,Mr FENTON,Unknown,You have said that before; it is not new.,37
273,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I have said it before, and I shall say it many times again, because it is true. We have all wondered-at least, I have, and I am sure many others have-ho w a great country like the United States of America, one of the greatest peoples in the world, full of energy and intelligence, leaders of thought in many directions, have so long endured a method of administering public affairs in which the spoils system is so prevalent. We now find for the first time that they are beginning to cast it off as an unclean, unwholesome thing. We find that Governors are elected in various States on the ground that they will put an end once for all to this uncleanness in public life. We find the last and most striking example of this change in the election of a man, by the greatest city in the United States of America, by a huge majority to give Tammany its deathblow. Yet the man who is responsible for the introduction into this country of Tammany methods, above all others, is the Leader of the Opposition, who is apparently willing to bind these broken fetters that the United States of America are casting aside round the clean, young limbs of Australia.",37
274,Mr HOWE,Unknown,The honourable member is a liar. I will say it.,37
275,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.,37
276,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I withdraw it, but I think it.",37
277,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is that a withdrawal?,37
278,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member should withdraw without qualification.,37
279,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"A m I not entitled to my thoughts? If I am not, I shall bow to you, and not to the Attorney-General.",37
280,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"When you come to think of the party that occupy the Opposition benches, and the meaning of the policy which their Government adopted, we find that they have copied the tactics of that body which has earned the contempt of all civilized countries under the name of Tammany. Do they not say to their members exactly the same as the Tammany Association says"" If you come here, if you join us, if you subscribe to our political funds, if you become one of us, we shall secure to you, not only all the jobs, all the business, all the work that we can, but we shall make the lives of all who do not join us a hell upon earth ""-to use the language of a man connected with them ? We can condemn them from the very lips that have been casting abroad these insinuations against us as "" The sneaks of society."" They say, "" We shall not only do that, we shall do more. We shall say that the law will be called in aid to give preference to all of you who join us and subscribe to our political funds. You will be made a privileged class, for the law itself will come in and condemn as unworthy to earn their livelihood in this community those who do not join our association."" Is not that Tanimany? As soon as ever they are intrusted with office, we find them, instead of exercising, the power which is handed over to them for the benefit of the whole people, saying, "" We are going to administer the public funds and the public trust of our Departments for the benefit of those who subscribe to our political funds."" I shall have something more to say upon that subject a little later on, when I deal with the test Bills that are to be submitted to the House. I propose, in the meantime, to deal with some of the statements made by the honourable member for West Sydney, who, I am sorry, is not in his place today. I am not going to attempt, because it would be impossible for me to do so, to enter into competition with him in the realm of rhetorical debate. He is, I think, a man who excels all others in this Parliament, and probably in most other Parliaments, in the brilliancy of his rhetoric. I give him the fullest credit for it , and have no time, even if I had the particular talents, for entering into a contest of that kind with him. I propose, instead, to deal with the more solid - matter of his address. He did me the honour of devoting at least half of his speech to myself personally. He charged me with being one who.saw the light but yet was afraid to follow it , and in that he referred mainly to my attitude upon constitutional reform. He cited a number of passages from my previous speeches, and I felt very much flattered. I thought the passages he read out sounded very well, if I may say so, and I entirely agreed with every word which he said I had uttered. I have never, so far as I know, varied one inch from the statements which I made before this House, both in 1910 and in 1912, but I am accused of doing nothing. Upon what is that charge based ? Upon my not having voted for those six constitutional monstrosities that were brought forward under the name of amendments of the Constitution by the other side. The Leader of the Opposition has, time after time, both here and outside, urged that matters of constitutional amendment ought to be dealt with as matters aloof from party politics. Have they been so dealt with by those on the other side? I venture to think that, from the first moment they were introduced, they have beeii treated, both in this House and in another place, as purely and essentially matters of party politics. You have only to examine their form to see that they were begotten in party prejudice, and that they bear on their face all the marks of that origin. I have no time today to go into a minute analysis of those six propositions for .constitutional amendment which I am accused of inconsistency in not voting for, but I have time to deal with one or two of them, and propose to do so.",37
281,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"They will be down here a little later. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I intend to give my honourable friends an opportunity of amending them, and of, put t in g them into decent shape before they reach this Chamber.",38
282,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The force of public opinion is something, even to the At torney-General ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The force of public opinion is something to all of us.  of the Opposition are where they are.",38
283,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Yes . I was remarking that we had put before us a f a m i ly of six deformed, misshapen, and misbegotten amendments of the Constitution. Let me deal with the first-that which proposed to increase the commerce power of this Parliament. Every speech made in favour of that Bill was entirelY in favour of enlarging, almost without restriction, the power which this Parliament possesses over the general trade and commerce of the Commonwealth. But what was the proposal which was placed before the people by the late Government? They proposed to omit the words ' ' with other countries, and among the States."" In other words, they proposed to omit the Intra-State restriction on commerce, and in the very same Bill they asked that the Constitution should be amended by adding to paragraph 1 of section 51 the words "" not including trade and commerce upon railways the property of a State, except so far as it is trade and commerce with. other countries or among the States."" Whafc would be the effect of that? Did the honourable member for West Sydney himself know what would be its effect, or was he ignorant of it? I suppose there is not an honourable member of this House who does not recognise that of all the trade within the"" boundaries of any State, afc least nine-tenths of it is trade which is carried on the railways? Yet this Bill , which was put before the country avowedly for the purpose of endowing this Parliament with power to control Intra-State trade, exempted from fchafc power at least nine-tenths of that trade. Was that explained by the Leader of the Opposition, or by the honourable member for West Sydney? tell the people that, they were giving them a stone when they asked for bread-that they were offering them only the shadow of a sham ? I might say, with Bassanio, "" I thank the, Jew, for teaching me that w o r d ."" Was not that Bill the shadow of a sham ?",38
284,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Why fight a shadow? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Why did honourable friends spend three or four weeks in fighting a shadow ? they ever explain the meaning of the that Bill to the electors? fchink that they did not. provision inserted exempting trade and commerce upon railways, the property a State, except so far as it. was trade and commerce with other countries or among the States? Because, during the period of gestation of this hopeful offspring-i a fit of terror on the part of the Caucus - it s members thought that they would have all the State Governments arrayed against them unless they exempted all freights and fares on the railways from the trade and commerce power with which it was proposed to vest this Parliament. This particular child, therefore, was paralyzed from its b i r t h - it was hopeless. Had that amendment been carried, i would have vested this Parliament with pendent. power to control only so much of the i ternal commerce of a State as is carried along its roads.  General tell the people that?",39
285,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I analyzed each private firms? of those Bills, and told the electors all about them.",39
286,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable gentleman did not tell them that during his election campaign.,39
287,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that I did. But whilst my honourable friends were timorously afrai d of touching State in terests in that respect, they laid their axe at the very root of State independence by their next proposed amendment of the Constitution, namely, in the Bill relating to the control of State railways. They sought to enact that the whole of the control of the terms and conditions under which persons shall be employed on the State railways should be subject to a Eederal tribunal. I do not suppose any one will dispute that one may enterD i d they tain a proposition-and it would not necessarily be an unfederal one-that the whole of the State railways should the handed over to the Commonwealth. However, nobody has proposed that, and I do not suppose it is yet within the range of practical politics. Such a proposition, however, would not necessarily be of an unfederal character. But to propose that the States should hand over to the Commy monwealth control of the conditions of service of the men employed upon their Did railways, whilst leaving the States with obligation of financing those underI venture to takings, is absolutely absurd. Why was a  of to every private employer.",39
288,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I have heard that statement over andover again. It it quite true that it will apply to every n private employer if Parliament has the power to determine the conditions under which that employer shall work. In that case, the employer becomes the subject of Parliament for that particular purpose. Similarly, if this Parliament has power to say to a State Government under what conditions it shall work, that Government becomes subject to this Parliament, arid if it be subject to this Parliat ment, it necessarily ceases to be indeI f we are to maintain the n - sovereign independence of the States as members of the Federation, they cannot be subjected to that kind of legislation by this Parliament.",39
289,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Hav e not railway employees the same rights as the employees of Mr W . H . IRVINE - I often wish that some kind power would endow the honourable member with the faculty of understanding what he hears. H is statement is substantially a repetition of that made only a minute ago by the honourable member for Grey. I have just said that if Governments are made the subjects of a particular Parliament there is no reason why the terms and conditions under which they shall work should not be determined in the same way as are the terms and conditions which are laid down for the guidance of private employers. But if we bring the State Governments into that category we shall destroy Federation. I come now to the proposed amendment of the Constitution relating to corporations. We know the origin of that proposal, but I need not refer to it now. Let us consider rather its effect.",39
290,Mr CONROY,Unknown,That proposal goes a lot further than the Attorney-General said.,40
291,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"It s effect would be to give to this Parliament a general power to make laws with regard to corporations. Municipal corporations and those for charitable purposes were to be exempted. Now, it has already been pointed out by Mr Justice Higgins, for whom I am sure my honourable friends opposite feel some respect, that if any such law were passed it would lead to the ridiculous result that we should have one code of laws made by the Federal Parliament for hotels kept by companies, and another code of laws made by the States for hotels managed by individuals. We should have a Federal law of libel for newspapers owned by companies, and another law of libel for newspapers owned by individuals. There is only one other proposal to which I desire to refer-that contained in the Bill relating to monopolies. Have any honourable members on the other side anything whatever to say in favour of that proposed amendment ? They cannot define a monopoly. In the debate, the honourable member for West Sydney admitted that he could not do so, but he cut the Gordian knot. So far as I know, Alexander the Great and Mr Hughes are the only persons in history who have cut the Gordian knot. This is the way in which he cut it . He said, "" I cannot tell you what a monopoly is."" Once you get away from a legal monopoly, which every one knows as an exclusive right to something, to the exclusion of all others, such as the exclusive enjoyment of the occupation of a [6 ] piece of land, a patent right, or other legal monopoly, you cannot define any person's business as a monopoly, except by the terms, more or less. The more successful a business is the. greater the monopoly. If it is very successful, a man may monopolize the whole of his particular business in a particular district. The way in which the honourable and learned member for WestSydney got over the difficulty was by asking this House to pass the Bill , which provided that whenever a chance majority or party in this House declares the business of any person, or company, to be a monopoly, it is a monopoly; there is an end to it , and it should be taken over. Let me tell bonjrable members that if it had not been for an amendment which was moved by myself to include the words "" on just terms,"" and which, if I had not moved it , would not have been in cluded in the last Government's proposals, the monopoly would be taken over without compensation.",40
292,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The amendment was accepted immediately, as we were prepared to accept any amendment of the kind to allay the public feeling of apprehension. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not like to hold my honourable and learned friend the ex-Attorney-General responsible for these proposals. He is a lawyer, and an able man, and I do not care to impose upon him the whole responsibility for the paternity of these things. I do not know how they were created. I think they may be regarded as the illegitimate offspring of a political syndicate. However they saw their birth , here they are, and, in the language of Gloucester's description of himself, they may be described asDeform'd, unfinish'd, sent before their time Int o this breathing world, scarce half made up.",40
293,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"And they are coming again. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes , we shall see the wretched things walk in here again, and will have to deal with them still in the same deformed condition. I am giving honourable members on the other side an opportunity of replying to some criticisms of these things, and I hope that when they bring them in again they will find some answer to these criticisms. Now, I wish to deal with another matter.",40
294,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Is the honourable gentleman leaving that question ? Does he not propose to add anything to what he has said ? Does he not propose to set before Parliament what the Government intend to do in this connection ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - This session?,41
295,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Yes ; or at any time. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No . honourable member has reminded me of another charge made by the honourable member for West Sydney. my notes, and intended to deal with it . The ex-Attorney-General's first charge was that I voted against the proposed amendments of the Constitution, and the second was that the Government are not prepared now to bring in their own constitutional amendments. The honourable gentleman referred to it as a scandal, a shame, an outrage, a crime or something of the sort, that the people should not at the next election have an opportunity of dealing with our proposed amendments of the Constitution. Let me join issue at once with him on this point.",41
296,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I have no desire to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but I thought that perhaps he would put forward his own proposals. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Q u it e so. As the honourable member for West Sydney referred to the matter I am glad to say that it has already been publicly indicated that we shall be prepared, at the proper time",41
297,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"""Not now, not now."" Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am now going to tell honourable members what the proper time is. I have always maintained that the power to refer amendments of the Constitution bo the public is one which ought not, except so far as is absolubely necessary, to be exercised at the time of an election. separate these things entirely from party issues. They never have been and they never will be entirely separated from party considerations. They ought to be, so far as possible, divorced from party issues when the people are asked bo vote upon bhem. They oughb never in any circumstances to be left to the people to decide upon during the heat and turmoil of a general election. If any one considers the vote taken a short time ago at the referenda he can come to only one conclusion, and that is that that vobe was a purely parby vobe. Honourable members on the other side will admit that. It was natural that it should be. When a conflict is going on amidst the intense excibemenb of a general election all over Australia it is almost impossible to conceive that the citizens will not follow their political leaders in the referenda as well as in other matters.  question. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have always I had it in believed that this great power vested in the Australian people should be exercised wisely and sanely, and, so far as possible, at a time when they are not subjecbed bo the excitement and inflammation of a general election. I have always said that. The first referendum was held by the late Government when there was not a general election.",41
298,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,You get the full play of vested interests then.,41
299,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is what the honourable gentleman is here for. Mr W . H . IRVINE - We find that, when honourable members begin to impute motives without any substantial reason in support of them, they have the weaker end of the stick. That is always the case when men are driven to make personal attacks.",41
300,Mr ABCHIBALD,Unknown,"It is a phase of civilization, and the honourable gentleman knows it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable gentleman does not know much about the 0 Lord, phases of civilization.",41
301,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! I ask honourable members to refrain from continuous interjections. The Attorney General can scarcely complete a single sentence without a chorus of interruption. I again remind honourable members that there is a time l i m it to speeches, and, in We cannot fairness to speakers, other honourable members should refrain, as far as possible, from unnecessary interjections. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I am going to answer directly the question put to me. The proper time, and the time when this Government will bring forward their constitutional proposals, will be the time when they go before the country.",41
302,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"He a r , hear ! Let that be soon. Mr W . H . IRVINE - And the sooner the better. The honourable member for West Sydney said a good deal about the Beef Trust. I have always observed that when the members of the party occupying the Opposition benches in their platform utterances give prominence to the question of trusts and combines-whic h constitutes the main portion of their political capital, I may say-the y love to deal with the subject in an abstract form. They have occasionally had concrete examples, usually one at a time, and it must always be a new one, because no sooner is one investigated than it turns out to be unsuitable for their purpose. Honourable members will recollect the tremendous agitation there was some time ago to nationalize the sugar industry, and they know the result. A Royal Commission, appointed by the Labour Government, found out that it would not do to nationalize the sugar industry, because the Government could not sell sugar as cheaply as could the Sugar Monopoly. Then there was the Tobacco Monopoly, about which we heard a great deal some time ago. What about that? We are now told that it is a purely beneficial and philanthropic institution.",41
303,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Who said that?,42
304,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I said that it was a very good monopoly for the employers, and the employees; that it was exceptional in that respect; but that the public had to pay the piper. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No one minds the public! So long as an enterprise gives the employer good profits, and the employees good wages, who is concerned with the poor public? We were told by the honourable member for West Sydney that the Beef Trust is upon us, and asked ""Why do you not do something?"" What are we to do ? The honourable member for West Sydney says, "" Amend the Constitution."" Thafc is his only suggestion. He tells us fchafc the trust is a huge, dangerous creature, which is slavering us over, preparatory to swallowing us. His knowledge of serpents seems as defective as my knowledge of ostriches; we should both go to school to learn natural history. He points out that there is this fearful monster ready to devour us, and he asks "" Why do you not amend the Constitution at once?"" What good that would do, I do not know. This particular combination would not be affected by any of the proposed amendments of the Constitution. Assuming that the trust exists, and that its operations are calculated and intended to be as injurious to Australia as its worse enemies declare that they will [6]- 2 be, none of the proposed amendments of the Constitution help us to deal with it . We have already abundant constitutional power to deal with this combination. I have often said, and I repeat now, that under the Constitution we are hampered in dealing withcombinations of certain kinds which may exist among us. But the Meat Trust is not one of them; in the first place, because, if there is a combine, it is a combine which exists altogether outside Australia; and, in the second place, because its operations in Australia, so far as there may be need to control them, can be controlled by the exercise of our power in regard to exportation. Therefore, the honourable member for West Sydney must suggest some more practicable and immediate way of dealing with this terrible bogy.",42
305,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Would not the imposition of an export duty on meat be an interference with the trade of the States ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Constitutionally, we have unlimited power to control exportation, to impose duty on exports, or to deal otherwise with them.",42
306,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Coul d we distinguish between the products of Swift and Company and those of, say, Angliss and Company? Mr W . H . IRVINE - My honourable friends are so intelligent, and in such a hurry, that they anticipate my statements. We cannot condemn a man who is conducting a perfectly legitimate business because he happens to have done sojnetliing wrong in some other country. Let us look at the matter with eyes cleared of the film of prejudice. If we find a man spending £200,000 on the erection of a thoroughly up-to-date meat works, intending to buy up cattle for the purpose of exporting meat, can we say to him, "" What you are doing is what we should thoroughly approve of and encourage in any one else. But, as you are named ' Swift, ' and in combination with others have done certain very wrong things in America and the Argentine, we intend to stop your operations here "" ? The ex-Minister of Trade and Customs will agree with me that that is impossible. Mv. TUDOE - I have said that we cannot take action while the works are being erected.",42
307,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Can we take action when the person concerned pro^ceeds to buy meat at the ordinary rates? I have gone pretty full y into this matter, which the Minister of Trade and Customs has had, and continues to have, under careful observation. We can attack this company only as we could' attack any other company, namely, on the ground that it is doing something wrong; that its methods or operations are calculated to injure the public of Australia. We have not yet had in Australia any judicial inquiry into the operation of meat trusts in other parts of the world; but, for the purposes of my argument, I assume that what has been said against this company is true; that, in combination with others, it obtained a large control of the meat industry of the TJnited States of America; that the combination was prosecuted; and that, although the prosecution failed, the combination had to be dissolved, and subsequently continued its operations in the Argentine. I shall, moreover, assume that in the Argentine the company joined with others, not merely in what we may call a legitimate combination, but also in an improper combination. I wish that I had time to cite the eloquent language that has been used by the honourable member for West Sydney in praise of trusts and combines. I have often pointed out, in my feeble way, that trusts and combines are usually beneficial, and that it is only when they adopt particular methods that they become injurious, and require control; but I have never done so with .one-half the fire and eloquence of the honourable member for West Sydney. I have one or two passages here in support .of my statement; but as they are pretty - well known to honourable members, I refrain from quoting them. We may take this as true, that you may have combinations to prevent cut-throat competition and to regulate trade, which are beneficial to everybody. Up to a certain time in the Argentine, the seven companies operating there, including the two American companies, were carrying on business on proper and legitimate' trading lines. Mr KINO O'MALLEY - They had honourable understanding.",42
308,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"There was a written agreement. They determined the total quantity of meat to be exported each month, and the quantity that each was to send away-the arrangement being based mainly on the proportions of their working capital. Combinations of this kind exist everywhere, and must increase, because they are combinations for protection and defence against what is fairly called cut-throat competition. They are combinations of which the public cannot complain. There was a special investigator sent out by the London Times to go into that matter, and in regard to that combination, although he condemns ultimately its proceedings very strongly, he saysIt is fair to poiut out that while the agreement was in force neither the market conditions nor the profits earned by the companies gave any grounds for the charge of cornering; at the same time the policy effected a steadiness in the price of cattle and beef in this country which was of benefit to the trade at large. He goes on to point out that Swift and Company and Morris and Company were not satisfied with that, and that they served the other companies with an ultimatum, saying, "" You must give us 40 per cent, more, else we will go to war with you and cut you out."" That is the point at which there was an attempt which, for all that I know to the contrary, may still be going on, and a very dangerous attempt to "" corner"" the meat market in the Argentine. It is, of course, a matter which we may regard with some suspicion when we find the same people coming here, and, though not as yet having it in their power to adopt the same practice, establishing large meat works. The Argentine has dealt with them by passing certain measures. I will not go into the measures particularly, because that would take too - long, but the Executive was given power to control the operations of that trust, provided that its operations were of a kind that were quite inconsistent with normal conditions. Now we find this thing taking place here. As I said before, they are a very huge concern, and are beginning to buy. I believe that if there is to be a danger to the Australian stock producer from the Beef Trust here, it is not a danger in Australia, but a an danger to their market in London. That is where the trouble may come in.",43
309,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"You do not know all about it, not by a long way.",43
310,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I do not, and I admit that I do not. I admit that there are very few subjects under heaven or earth that I know all about, or even as much about as my honourable friend knows about any, but I am giving the House the best of my knowledge and belief after making some inquiry into the matter. I have been assured that, as far as Australia is concerned, provided that the London meat market is unrestricted or unmonopolized, the stock-raisers here will probably be strong enough at all times to make their own market.",43
311,Mr RILEY,Unknown,What about the general public; where do they come in?,44
312,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"As far as the general public in Australia are concerned, the companies have not yet had any effect whatever.",44
313,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Hav e they not? If you were a working man buying meat, you would know the difference.",44
314,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"It is very easy for my honourable friend-nothin g is easier-to go on a platform and say to a large crowd of unthinking people, "" Meat has gone up in price; it is due to the Meat Trust""; but the statement is just as false as it is easy to make. Honourable members ask me what we propose to do. We do not propose to wait to amend the Constitution. We propose to act as a reasonable Government, and that is to ask a reasonable Parliament to invest ns with the powers necessary to deal with these companies, should they adopt illegitimate methods, at the earliest possible moment. We have two Bills mentioned in the Governor General's Speech which we are prepared to submit to Parliament, and the only thing that the honourable member for West Sydney or the Opposition does to facilitate their submission is to move a vote of want of confidence' in us, and to adjourn the Senate for three weeks. That is their way of assisting us to carry through the measures to deal with the Beef Trust. Now I come to another subject. The honourable member for West Sydney held up his hands in horror at my venturing to say a word against the representative character of the Senate. He exclaimed, "" A Senate that is elected on the same suffrage as the people's House."" Is this the same Mr Hughes who has so often referred to the entirely undemocratic character of the Senate? Is this the same Mr Hughes who originally spoke of the Senate in such strong terms ?",44
315,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Oh , conditions have altered; do not trouble to quote it.",44
316,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"My .honourable friends know it all by heart, and so I do not think I need quote it all. But, in dealing with the Financial Agreement three years ago, my honourable friend saidThis infamous attempt to fasten this fetter on our limbs for all time is inexcusable. Were the Constitution before them today, the people would spit upon a provision for equal representation. I could quote a good many other remarks, too, but I shall.not waste' time by going into them. The honourable member has pointed out; over and over again, not once, but a hundred times, that the Senate, which he now relies on, which he holds up as a sacred body, which must not be spoken of disrespectfully,, is a body based on a principle which is absolutely undemocratic, absolutely unrepresentative of the people.",44
317,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,How do you propose to alter it?,44
318,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"-We will tell you presently what we intend to do. ,1 agree with a good deal of what the honourable member for West Sydney said about one matter-and it is a very important matter-and that is the position of the Senate in relation to the . constitutional position of this Parliament. He said that now industrial questions loom very large, and he used very strong expressions in his references.' To a large extent, I agree with my honourable friend, and if you include in the words "" industrial questions"" the regulation of all those social and industrial matters which are involved in production, interchange, commerce, and trade, a complete change has come over the face of the Federation of Australia during the twelve years it has been in existence.",44
319,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And of the world.,44
320,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"And possibly of other parts of the world, but here, at all events. Under the original frame of the Constitution, where the Federation was, to a large extent, a kind of partnership of States, and nothing more, equal representation, perhaps, had many things to recommend it, but ib has ceased very much to possess the foundation for it at that'time; in fact, it is almost impossible to conceive of this Parliament proceeding and developing. As an Australian Parliament, dealing with huge industrial and commercial problems, we find that the widest problems that engage the in genuity of mankind in every department of life are forced more and more into this arena. The people are coming more and more to look to us, as the Parliament to give the guidance in these matters. Since that is the result, it becomes more and more impossible to conceive that a body, not representative of the people of Australia in any true sense, in respect of which a voter in one State has nine or ten times the voting power of a voter in another State, can be allowed for an indefinite time to impose bars or blocks to the wil l of the people being carried out. I have suggested a remedy. For these blocks, no redress is apparently possible at first sight, but these impossibilities tend to fade away. One thing, however, is i mpossible. TJnder the existing Constitution, it is practically impossible t a change equal representation, it is impossible to suppose that every one of the smaller States would consent. On tihe other hand, it is not at all impossible to conceive that we may have an alteration power of dealing with these deadlockswhich will be based upon a principle that will ultimately, and after due consideration, give effect to the desire of the whole people of Australia, irrespective of State boundaries. That is a matter of constitutional amendment. This Government dare not put off the immediate responsibility that lies before us u n t i l we can get an amendment of the Constitution under which we live. We have to deal with these matters now. people have intrusted us with the power and the duty of carrying on the government of the country. They have given us a majority , certainly not a very large one.",44
321,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Where is it ? - Mr W . H . IRVINE - I thought our honourable friends would at least be ready to admit that if there is a majority of only one elected by the constituencies, the party which has that majority has not only the right, but also the duty, of carrying on the government of the country. Do honourable members opposite say that the power of the Government to effectively carry on the affairs of the country is to be blocked by the will of a Chamber that does not represent the people, or, at any rate, represents them only in a lop-sided and unequal way?",45
322,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Pu t the question, and we will decide it afterwards.",45
323,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Will honourable members listen to what the honourable member for West Sydney stated just prior to Federation ? At that time the honourable member published a pamphlet from which this quotation was taken, and republished in one of the Liberal publications. I presume it is correct.",45
324,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It is bound to be correct.,45
325,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"It can always be denied if it is not correct. The honourable member said in that pamphletIn the first place, it is an utter abandonment of the bedrock of Democracy which places the government in the hands of the majority of the people. No matter how ingeniously this may be cloaked by plausible and enticing arguments, nothing can hide the fact that what these gentlemen really propose is government by a minority. Not a minority because of intelligence or worth, nor even of social position, but merely - a minority which is located in certain portions of the continent. A system which gives to the Tasmanian voter nine times as much effective voting power as to his fellow colonists in New South Wales made- a will be extremely popular with that favoured individual. And, away in the distant and arid wastes of Western Australia, where, in some electorates, thirty-nine votes return a member of Parliament, the idea of having an equal voice with great colonies like New South Wales is, doubtless, regarded with intense enthusiasm. Apparently the honourable member for West Sydney has never changed his views in that regard. What is the position that the Senate claims to hold, and is asserted by members of the Labour party to hold, The in the Constitution?",45
326,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"What did you say about the constitution of the Senate at that time? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not remember; I was younger then, and I may have said a great many wrong things. In the course of my l if e I have said very many things that were inconsistent. Hon orable members can make what use they choose of this fact, that I do not kuow at the moment whether I supported or opposed the constitution of the Senate at that time; but I am telling the House what I think now. Perhaps the position of the Senate at the present time is best stated by Senator Pearce, who is reported in the Dail y Telegraph of the 4th June, 1913, to have saidWhatever happened, the Labour party were masters of the situation, as no legislation could be passed or repealed without the sanction of the Senate. The future was pregnant with possibilities, because if the Senate rejected a measure twice within three months, the Governor General could order a dissolution. All I can say is that, „if the political situation is pregnant with possibilities, I do not think my honourable friends of the Opposition are anxious to see the deliverance take place too soon. Speaker (Mr MCDonald) is reported, in Mansard of the 22nd October, 1913, as follows: I ask the Government what they have done to carry out tlieir policy, and what solitary measure, containing part of their policy, they have passed through the House and sent to the otlicr Chamber?.",45
327,Mr CHAPMAN,Unknown,Who is responsible?,46
328,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I take it that we are responsible; but when we And a set of men who will sit there and allow themselves to bo insulted in every possible way,46
329,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,B y whom?,46
330,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"B y the very fact that they sit there without power, and have to do our bidding. Could anything more clearly show that the continuance of the present position is impossible? Honourable members on the Opposition side point out that, although we do hold a mandate from the majority of the people of Australia to conduct the government of the country, they not only can, but will, make it impossible for us to do that, and they will block us by means of their power in the Senate. Yet, we are told that, in putting forward a measure to test, between the Senate and this Chamber, whether the Senate is representative of the people, and entitled to block our efforts, we are putting up a mere sham. Here is another quotation from a speech by the honourable member for West Sydney, and published in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 4th June, 1913One thing is certain. The Fusion can pass no laws with which the Senate does not agree. In that Chamber the Labour party has an overwhelming majority. The Fusion cannot even get Supply without the consent of the Senate. It can only live upon the terms the Senate imposes. Now, what becomes of the argument that we heard in this House the other day?",46
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It just shows that Caucus controls the Senate. Mr W . H . IRVINE - E x a c t l y . What becomes of the argument that the Government are to carry on the administration and pass all sorts of non-contentious legislation, when honourable members admit that we cannot carry on unless we submit to the terms which their majority in the Senate imposes ? I say that that position is intolerable.' We on this side claim to represent the majority of the people, and to be allowed to carry on the government of the country, and honourable members opposite, who represent the minority of The late the people, say they will not allow us to carry on that government.",46
332,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 lo 7.4-5 p.m.,46
333,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"When you lef t the chair, Mr Speaker, I was dealing with a number of quotations from leading members of the Opposition to show how impossible is the present parliamentary position with one House, the popular House, the House which, under the Constitution, does represent the majority of the people of, Australia, the House to which every Ministry is responsible, and is alone responsible, with one party-in this case the Liberal party-holdin g a majorit y of seats in it , unable admittedly to carry out the ordinary functions of government, obstructed not merely in every legislative proposition put forward by Ministers, but even in regard to making the necessary provision for carrying on the government of the country. Because we are threatened that Supply will be stopped; we are told that we cannot move a step without the permission of a House which is in no sense representative of the people of Australia. I may add one quotation to those I have already used. One of the leading members of the Labour party is reported in the press to have said at Rockhampton, in the presence, I believe, of the Leader of the Opposition, "" Let the Prime Minister bring forward any proposal to repeal any of the measures which they had placed on the statute-book and they would see how the Senate would boot it out."" Who used this expression? Why, the President of the Senate, a man who, in his high office, is supposed to be in a position of i m partiality. But apart altogether from the question of good or bad taste on the part of a man in the position of President of the Senate in using such language, or in using such a threat, if this expression does nothing else it gives additional clear evidence of the impossibility of the present conditions, in which, though Ministers have a majorit y with which to carry on the ordinary business of government, they.are blocked by a House which in no rational sense can be said to be representative of the people of Australia. The honourable member for* ""West Sydney has accused me of being guilty of an unconstitutional and improper act in stating that the policy of the present Government is to go for a double dissolution. He said that I had done what no man ought to have done, and that I had indicated that a double dissolution should be granted. I have done nothing of the kind. What I have maintained is that it is the policy of the Government to carry out all the conditions on which the Governor General may grant a double dissolution; and I have always said-np t recently, as the honourable member for West Sydney said, but always-that when we carried out our part it would be for the gentleman who occupies the position of representative of His Majesty to carry out his part. That is his discretion.",46
334,Mr AKCIIIBALD,Unknown,"Have you not to vise the Governor General? Mr W . H . IRVINE - No ; that is the very thing I was about to say. The honourable member for West Sydney, who was Attorney-General in the late Administration, must know that that is one of the few important public functions, if it is not the only one, which a Governor or Governor General of any constitutionallygoverned country must perform without the advice of his responsible Ministers.",47
335,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"He must take the responsibility. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes ; and I have throughout said that nothing I would do would be done to cause the slightest embarrassment to H is Excellency in carryr ing out that high function. But what is the attitude of the honourable member for West Sydney? The Government, if the opportunity arises, will place the position before the Governor General. honourable member knows perfectly well that H is Excellency is not obliged to accept any advice given to him.",47
336,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The Governor General may not dissolve except on advice. Mr W . H . IRVINE - But he is by no means bound to dissolve on advice.,47
337,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That is so.,47
338,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"While rebuking me for adopting an tude I never adopted in urging the Governor General to exercise a discretion in one direction, the honourable member for West Sydney, in the strongest and clearest language, himself said that the Governor General ought to exercise his discretion in the other way; in fact, he devoted many minutes to an analysis of the conditions that ought to govern the discretion of the Governor General, and to an endeavour to prove that His Excellency should not grant a dissolution. That is ground I prefer not to tread. All I say is that, in the present impossible position in this House, without an amendment of the Constitution in the direction I have already indicated, there is no way open to us to bring about a working parliamentary condition, except the way the Constitution itself provides, that is, to send up a measure which, on being rejected by the Upper House, will , after the other requisites have been complied with, afford ground upon which the Governor General may, if he chooses, exercise his discretion. ad- Mr HUGHES - The honourable member thinks he ought to do so on that ground. Mr W . H . IRVINE - "" Ought to do so!"" I have never said so, and I shall never say so. It is our duty to open the door for him to do it . We cannot do more; we cannot compel him to enter through that door. '",47
339,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Y o u are reported as having said so on more than one occasion. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I do not think that the honourable member can refer to any report of my having said so. I know of no report, and I have never said so. It has been reported over and over again that I , as well as the Prime Minister, have said that the only door that is open to us to end this position is that of a double dissolution.",47
340,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"In the Town H all speech, the honourable member went f u r But the ther. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I remember the speech to which the honourable member is referring. The speech took half-an-hour, or twenty minutes, to deliver, and the report occupied the space of 2 inches.",47
341,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It was in reply to an interjection. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I said that we were going for a dissolution, and one attigentleman asked, ""Single or double?"", and I said "" Double."" Of course, we are going for a double dissolution. That is our whole policy; there is no other way out. But we have our duty, and the Governor General has his duty. the Constitution, these responsibilities are settled. Meantime, we are presenting a measure which we conceive to be one which tests, as perhaps no other measure can, the intrinsic and inherent difference between the two parties in this House, in order to afford an opportunity for the constitutional right to be exercised of allowing both Houses to go before the people in order to determine who has the right to carry on effectually the government of this country. We have thrown down the gage. What are the other side going to do about it? Look at it , walk round it , talk about it ?",47
342,Mr WEBSTEK,Unknown,"Fac e it like men. Mr W . H . IRVINE - We shall see, no doubt, the same spectacle as we saw last session-the party that purports to represent Democracy in this country fighting, talking, delaying, catching hold of every parliamentary pretext-for what ? To prevent them going before the people, who are their masters. We shall see honourable members on the other side taking to earth like the badger. But, sooner or later, honourable members opposite will have to come out in the open.",48
343,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Late r ! Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member says "" later,"" but I say the sooner the better; and, if honourable members opposite wish it to be soon, all they have to do is to reject or deal with the measures at once.",48
344,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"This is parliamentary government with a vengeance! "" R e j e c t our measures-0 , dear Lord, reject our measures! ' ' Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have no objection whatever to the honourable member for West Sydney saying his prayers, but I do object to his saying them in the middle of my speech. We have been told that the Government Preference Prohibition Bill is a mere sham, a mere empty measure-that it does nothing, achieves nothing. The Leader of the Opposition is not present, and the honourable member for West Sydney may, perhaps, answer the question I propose to put. Will the Leader of the Opposition give a pledge that, if the Labour party should be returned to power, they will not resort to this unclean practice of preference to unionists in the Government service?",48
345,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We will answer that after the Greek Kalends. TJnder Mr W . H . IRVINE - I should think honourable members opposite would. But if they will not pledge themselves or tlieir party not to resort to these Tammany practices, how can they, in Heaven's name, say that the Bill is not necessary ? If , as soon as by the chapter of accidents they take office, - they resort to using the powers of the Government for the purpose of giving billets to tlieir own supporters, how can it be said that the Bill is not necessary?",48
346,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"It is a mere question of preference. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes , of course it is-preferenc e to the supporters of honourable members opposite. The other night I watched the lights in that room upstairs where our friends opposite meet.",48
347,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite are very anxious about that room. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I know. I was with some friends enjoying a pleasant evening over the way, and when we went in those lights were burning. At the adjournment, which takes place in the middle of the entertainment, the lights were still burning, as they were after the entertainment was over; and I do not know how long afterwards. I should have liked very much to be there. I can well imagine what took place- I can well imagine the more ardent and courageous spirits, especially those whose seats are quite secure, urging their colleagues to come to the scratch-to come up and fight, for they were sure to winand the timorous gentlemen, whose seats are not quite so secure, replying, "" Not yet, O Lord, not yet."" I said to some of my friends that I should be prepared to take a wager that the badgers "" would have it ""-that they would stick to their holes and fight, bite, scratch, and do anything but be drawn into the open; and the result has justified my view. Opposite, we have the party who are supposed to represent Democracy, and yet they are going to take, probably, weeks in debating a want-of-confidence motion, and more weeks in debating a single test measure, and in adopting every parliamentary practice, and using every parliamentary method they can, to avoid the possibility of going before the country. That is the position.",48
348,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"How does the Attorney-General know that? Mr W . H . IRVINE - The lionorable member, with his 15,000 majority, is one of the stalwarts who would doubtless come up to the scratch.",48
349,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"How many are there on the Attorney-General's side who are a bit afraid? Mr W . H . IRVINE - If we are afraid, we are prepared to take the risks.",49
350,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Are you? Liberal members.,49
351,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"W it h regard to the charges of insincerity which the honourable member for West Sydney has urged against us, I point out that he can very easily test the matter by getting his party to at once allow the Government Preference Prohibition Bill to be dealt with. What can be the outcome of this amendment to the Address-in-Reply? We all know how every vote will be cast, and we are only wasting time in a discussion that cannot alter a single vote. Let us deal w it l i the question, and we shall then see whether we, or honourable members on the other side, are in earnest.",49
352,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [ 8 . 0 ] listened with great interest to the Attorney-General, and also to the Honorary Minister at an earlier stage. At the outset, I would like to say that the Attorney General was possibly unconsciously unf a i r in the statement that any discussion that takes place on this amendment is an obstruction of the business of the Chamber. The honourable gentleman knows full well that this censure amendment will not l i m it or extend the time of the discussion by one moment, because every word said on it could have been said on the main question itself. And how can any one say that there is obstruction? There can be obstruction in this Chamber only so long as the Ministry desire. It will continue only so long as they desire it to continue, and only on such topics as they desire shall be discussed; on every subject on which they desire there shall be no discussion they will prevent discussion; it is entirely in the hands of the Government. I can understand that the Honorary Minister should defend himself and his administration-that he should defend the purity of his personal honor. It was quite with in the limits of fair fight to counterpart the stroke of his opponents; but I am surprised at the indignation he shows when any one assails him. Why should he be indignant if anybody imputes the purit y of his motives? Of all members he ought to be the last to do so. Why should be object to the pangs and darts of base imputation, considering that year after year, while he sat in Opposition, there was no Minister or Ministry who was not the subject of imputations by him on their conduct and administraAsk the tion? I have no desire to traverse the statements of the Attorney-General. I have no wish to say one word in connection with Chinn, or Ryland, or Deane, or the contract question, and very little to say on preference to unionists or postal voting. All I wish to do is to present, so far as I can, facts that to me seem more important than those so far discussed, and to offer a few thoughts for what they may be worth. The Attorney-General, in answer to the question that I put, expressed the opinion that election time is the worse possible time at which to put a question to the electors by referendum. The honourable gentleman assailed the arguments of the honourable member for West Sydney, but lef t entirely unstated the - I position of the Government. I asked the Attorney-General why, if he cannot agree to the propositions of the Labour party, the Government should not at least put before the people the propositions which they believe to be absolutely necessary; and the answer he gave was that they would be put later on at the election ? The honourable gentleman then proceeded to argue that an election, which is a period of excitement, is the worse possible occasion on which to put such questions. I admit that that is a valid argument in connection with any proposition that may be put forward by the Labour party. The men who sit behind the Government are hostile to every proposition we may put forward, on the ground that it goes too far. That is a legitimate argument, but how can it be used as an argument against the propositions of the Government? They oppose us on the ground that we ask for. too much, whilst they are in favour of something less. But since we cannot oppose any alteration of the Constitution which would widen, however slightly, the powers of this Parliament, it is inevitable that this party would support the Government in any proposal in that direction. No question of party could be raised. Our party wants to secure a widening of the Constitution, and if it could not reach the limit of its own desires in that direction it would indubitably be delighted to secure as much as the Government proposed to concede. No party feeling could arise, therefore, at a general election so far as that was concerned. Both parties, irrespective of their fundamental differences, would be bound to support an amendment of the Constitution. I put forward that thought merely by way of a preliminary consideration. I ask the Attorney-General if what I state is not correct, and if it is whether it is not necessary to find some other reason for the inaction of the Government. The honourable gentleman referred to the question of trusts and combines, and asserted that some members of our party had given utterance to the strongest sentiments in regard to various institutions that exist in this country. Quite right. If we pin our faith to a collectivist system of society, and look forward to a time when the human race will gather to itself the means of production-regardin g the means of production as the means of life - wh y should we not, as we must, view this stage of human society in which all forms of competition are controlled by only a few men as but a transitory step to that which we desire ? I come now to my main question. I desire, first of all, Mr Speaker, to ""take you back to what happened twelve months ago. The two parties were then before the country, fighting for various issues, and, as the Attorney-General has pointed out, the present Government came back to power. They came back, it is true, with a majority of members, but not with a majority of the votes of the people behind them. That is the first important distinction to be noted. The Attorney General now wants to create a situation in the Senate. And be it here remembered for future reference that sometimes men like the Attorney-General say incautiously in anger, out of the bitterness of their minds, what in calmer moments they would not think of uttering. The honourable gentleman, when'asked to-night ""What are you going to do with the Senate?"" replied, ""We,shall tell you what we shall do with the Senate when we have the chance."" I shall tell the House at once what he and his party will do with the Senate. If they ever secure a majority, they will change the existing basis of election to the Senate. Instead of each State being polled as one constituency it will be cut into several, so that the Liberal party may obtain a larger proportion of representation there. By this readjustment of the constituencies they hope to secure, not that the Senate shall represent a majority of the votes of the people, but that their party shall have fuller representation there.",49
353,Mr CONROY,Unknown,How can they do that without the consent of the Senate?,50
354,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"As a preliminary to this they must, of course, first secure a majority in the Senate. In this Chamber they have a majority of members, although they do not represent a majority of the votes of the people. But they do not propose so to change the constitution of this House as to base representation upon the totality of votes cast. Honourable members opposite went to the country, and on coming back made various proposals. On meeting Parliament the Government sent out a programme, just as they did the other day, through the medium of the Governor General's Speech, in which they declared, amongst other things, that they would readjust inequalities; that they would raise the standard of living; and that they would grapple with complex problems and do other important things. It was a very glowing programme that they put before us. And on the Monday following the general election the Age declared that the people had now a guarantee which they could not secure from the Labour party-the guarantee of an immediate readjustment of Tariff anomalies. It pointed out that in the return of Mr Bennett, Mr Eodgers,.and Mr. Ahern the people had a guarantee that, so far as Victoria at least was concerned, the Government would be kept up to its promises, and one of those promises was that there should be a readjustment of Tariff anomalies. Another proposition which the Ministerial party put forward was a scheme of social insurance-insur ance against sickness and accident. They said that they would provide against the accidents of life. Later on, Parliament debated various proposals, and whatever the Government desired to pass it did pass. But it did not put forward any Tariff revision scheme: it did not submit any Bill to provide for insurance against sickness and accident; not bring down a Bill to provide a referendum upon a proposed ment of the Constitution to enable it to take action in the direction of social insurance. Not one item which in any way affected the social or industrial of this country was brought forward for the consideration of Parliament. now, is the answer of the Government those who complain of its inaction in this respect? It declares that it was blindly obstructed and prevented from ou the business of the country; somewhere, as yet undisclosed, it had a social and industrial policy-a progression-a scheme for grappling important problems. Yet it went through the whole session without doing thing, and now excuses itself with the plea that it could do nothing owing to the obstructive tactics of honourable bers on this side of the House. true? Is it not a fact that whatever the Government wanted to pass it passed in a single night? Has any serious proposal been submitted to this House by the Government? If the Government any policy of a progressive tive character it had the power in its own hands to present it and to push it through Parliament. It had the power to push it in the Senate, and if the Senate had then failed to deal with such a policy the Government could have represented it to the country as consisting of a body of men who obstructed useful progressive structive legislation. But it did nothing of the kind. If it had had such a policy somewhere in the recesses of its own mind - if it had had any definite policy for the development of the social and economic conditions of the country-is reasonable conclusion that it would have produced it, have fought for it, and have sought to obtain all the advertisement could get by propounding such a great Liberal programme ? But where its great Liberal programme? is its great and magnificent Every honourable member-I whether he agrees with me or come to the conclusion that the Government had, and has, no such policy. it had it would have availed itself of the facilities at its command to present it to ihe people of Australia.

Some men may think that there is a question carrying of principle at stake, and that the Gothat vernment should fight for it . I merely point to these two measures as constitupolicy of ting the principal work submitted to us with last session. Parliament has met again. For what has it met? Ostensibly, and any- so far as appears on the surface, it has met again not to do anything-no t to carry on the business of the countrymem- but fco secure a double dissolution upon Is that two items called test measures, which, whether they are carried or not, will never do anything to develop the resources of the country, will not augment its revenues, create one crust the more, or had add one atom to the sum of human hapconstruc- piness. If they have no such programme, I am driven to ask myself what is their purpose ? They musfc have some object that does not appear on the surface, and I musfc look for it in the financial situation as it is developing today. I must look for their real object in the position of the Government and the interests for which it stands. I have no desire to take conup the time of Parliament in discussing those fundamental diversities of opinion which exist upon big questions among the members of this Chamber, particularly with relation to the problem of how far the functions and powers of Parliament it not a should be utilized to. bring about social and economic changes. A p a r t from these, there existed in Australia other it broad, national issues - So long as they existed, so long as they remained mere is matters of sentiment wherewith to appeal Where to the sense of national pride, so long could policy? the gentlemen who are opposed to the care not social programme of the Labour party not-must claim to be the special custodians of them, and seek to divert public attenIf tion,"" with them, from the social and economic problems of the time, which we in our party regard as all important. Again and again they talked of a great fleet and a great army, of a unified railway gauge throughout Australia, by means of which our troops could be transported from one part of the continent to the other, of a great railway to link up the east with the west, and of other railways here, there, and everywhere. They turned to the Northern Territory, painting it as a land enormously rich, with great resources, stretching 900 miles north and south, 600 miles east and west - a land that had been basking in the sunshine of centuries, and only awaited our energies to develop it into a new Canaan flowing with milk and honey. They were going to drain the vast swamps and irrigate the wide, dry areas in the north, make it a white man's land, and people it . They depicted there the growth of great cities and the uprising of garrisons of armed troops fo resist any possible Asiatic invasion. Yet, for three years, they did nothing whatever. The Labour party came into power, and immediately proceeded to do the things about which other parties had merely talked. I am not referring to these matters in any way as a reproach, but I am citing them as short pages of history to lead up to the questions with which I shall deal. So long as these matters remained mere subjects of sentiment, and while we were - sitting upon this side, our opponents claimed that they were the real fathers of these various projects. They claimed the credit, such as it was, and all the glory. They said they were the persons who laid the eggs; they were the ones that developed the ideas; and that the Labour party were merely the mechanical incubator that hatched the glorious conceptions of Liberalism. But now what a change has come over the scene I Now we have to face the cost; we are face to face with the great fact that today all these great propositions are in their infancy, and somebody will have to foot the bill . They deny any part in them; they disclaim their own progeny. They say that these responsibilities have been foisted upon them by the Labour party. The Prime Minister said, "" These responsibilities are not of our creation. They have been created by the Labour party, and we have to pay the bill . "" The Treasurer said that everything belonged to the Labour party except the transcontinental railway, which Was his own exclusive idea. The real issue now before this Parliament is not so much the question of trusts or combines, not the question of preference to unionists or the restoration of the postal vote, but the problem of how the National Parliament is to meet the responsibilities imposed upon it as the result of the party combat in this Chamber. If this is to be a National Parliament at all, the great problem which musfc be settled by it is whether, with the means at its disposal, it shall assume and exercise half-a-dozen functions effectively and maintain them in full life and vigour, or continue to try to exercise a dozen functions, and permit them fco drag out a weak, weary, and inanimate existence, so that nothing can be said of them but that life exists within them. The question that, after all, lies at the back of the mind of every man in this Chamber, the question at the back of the mind of the Government, in fact, the real issue, is what I have stated. These matters of preference to unionists and the restoration of the postal vote are merely things upon the surface. We are fcold that during the next year we are bound to have a deficit of something like £5,000,000. The expenditure, said the Prime Minister, is going to increase automatically. Apparently, for some years it is going to increase by millions. On the other hand, the revenue is declining. A few days ago the Treasurer set out to give an explanation of the decline of the revenue under the Liberal Government. He said, "" Of course, it is declining; how can you expect anything else when there has been nothing but strikes and lockouts, and industrial unrest generally since we have been in power?"" I thought all the industrial unrest occurred during our term of office! Ifc is a most peculiar thing that, in spite of all the strikes and lock-outs that are said to have occurred during the rule of the Labour Governmenb, the revenue went on rising,' and now the great Treasurer of the Liberal Administration explains away the declining revenue by the fact that industrial unrest still continues. Revenue must be raised; but how? The Prime Minister said, "" We are going to borrow."" At Mount Gambier he said, "" We propose to borrow, and musfc borrow heavily; we are obstructed by the Labour party; we were prevented last session by them from getting our Loan Bill through."" Is that true? Is it true that anybody in the Senate prevented their Loan Bill from passing ? Nevertheless, it must be clearly recognised that a Loan Bill for the near future is not sufficient to meet the requirements of this country."" The Government may delay or postpone new works, or borrow some amount to carry them on, but no sum of money that they can legitimately borrow will adequately meet the obligations of the Eederation during the next few years. What do they propose to do? Will they tax, or will they retrench?",50
355,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That is just the point up to which the Leader of the Opposition led us last session, and then dodged the issue.",53
356,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The responsibility rests with the Government. Paragraph 12 of the Governor General's Speech states distinctly that they will at a later dateafter they have returned from the country, and provided that they obtain a majority in the Senate-submi t proposals to deal with the financial situation which now confronts this Commonwealth. repeat that the Ministry have no social and economic policy; otherwise they would have presented it to the country. Knowing as they do the financial situation, I ask the House to consider why it is that they have not put forward proposals to meet, it. Is it not all important, that, instead of voting upon a question of preference to unionists, or upon a proposal to restore the postal vote, if we are to have a great contest between two political parties, the people should be permitted to vote upon the financial proposals of the Ministry? Is it not a fact that the Government intend to go before the electors without saying a word as to what their financial proposals are? when they have come back from the country with a blank cheque they will fill it up for what amount they choose.",53
357,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member thinks that we will come back.,53
358,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I am assuming that the party with which the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs is associated will come back. I always like to assume the worse from my own stand-point. That being so, I conclude that the financial proposals of the Government are of such a character as will not earn them any kudos; otherwise they would unquestionably give them all the advertisement that they could. They would inscribe them on their banners. Since they have not proclaimed, either in the press or elsewhere, what are their proposals in this respect, I am justified, from an examination of the Government and its personnel, in drawing my own conclusions. Ministers are face to face with an enormously increasing expenditure and a declining revenue. We all know that the Attorney General is the man behind the guns in this Government, and that the policy which he has pursued in another Government is that which he is most likely to pursue in this Government. Paced with a similar situation in the Victorian Parliament, he very cleverly created a sixpenny crisis. This was not brought about by a member of the Labour party, but by a member of the Liberal party. He created a blank",53
359,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It was the other man who created the blank.,53
360,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The Attorney-General seized the opportunity, appealed to the country, and obtained a majority. I Having done that, he immediately proceeded to institute a policy of cutting down pensions, of stopping all increments, of lowering wages wherever possible, of refusing to pay trade union rates on the railways and elsewhere, and of increasing the freight upon the farmers' wheat, but not upon wool. He increased freight upon wheat by £d. a bushel, and he generally attacked the whole system of factories legislation.",53

But I also was a member of the Victorian Parliament at the time, and I think I have as large a conception of what truth is as has the Attorney-General.",53
364,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,But there is a record fortunately.,53
365,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I also have a knowledge of the records. Since the Attorney General has denied my statement.

If the Government succeed creating a sixpenny crisis over preference to unionists, and if they obtain, a majority in the Senate, they will do what the A torney-General has first suggested-effec changes in the otlier Chamber to suit their own party. They will borrow as far they can, because, as the Age remarked the other day, this country, in order meet the necessities of the hour, is bound to raise additional revenue somewhere. It is open to them to raise that revenue by additional taxation on wealth or by additional taxation upon the necessaries of life. Which will they choose they levy an additional tax on the wealth of this country, or will they raise quired revenue by impositions upon tea and kerosene?

They cannot retrench in regard to the transsite continental railway, because the TreaThey surer will take care of that part of business.

That is one of the reasous why, as I said last session, the question of preference is not worth fighting over, because it affects nobody.

"" That is a fair question; but when we understand the objective of to the Government and their desire to cloak over the real issues, this question serves them well enough for the purpose. I can quite understand that honourable members on this side, regarding the question as one bag of principle, are prepared to fight it , whether it means much or nothing. t take it that the prerogative of our party is to preserve intact every social privilege that has heen secured. We stand face to face with a Government that we know well can do nothing as the Senate is at present constituted. The Senate is of more importance to the Labour movement, to the interests we serve, and to the future progress of this country, than is the possession of the Treasury bench by this party at the present time.

377,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"They will not long continue in their present position before they will be forced into making a declaration. It is because they believe that such a declaration would be odious, and would render them unpopular in the country, that they want an election at this juncture upon other issues, before they are compelled to expose their hand. That is why, as an individual member of the Labour party, who does not fear the result of an election, I believe it would be good policy, as Napoleon once said, to retire from point to point in order eventually to w in , and not to fight the Government in any mere Berserker spirit. They wish to select the issues, and to choose the ground of battle; but I say that in three months' time they will be compelled to put before Parliament their proposals for dealing with the financial situation, and they know well that their declaration upon that matter will not help them in the country. That is where I stand as an individual member of the Labour party. On the other hand, I say that if there is any reason why the vote of censure upon the Government should be endorsed, and why I should endorse it as a member of the Labour party, it is not because of anything connected with the Honorary Minister, but because the Government, in face of the immense responsibilities confronting this Parliament, have absolutely failed in their duty to Australia in not shouldering those responsibilities, and declaring in definite terms how and by whafc means they propose to meet our gigantic financial obligations. On that ground, and that ground only, I support the motion of censure.",55
378,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"Boothby) [8.42] - In common with other honourable members on this side, I thought that at this juncture we should have had a speech from an honourable member on the other side, in reply to the honourable member for Bourke. Before I speak upon the various subjects with which I propose to deal I should like to say a word or two on the financial position which was enlarged upon by the honourable'member for Bourke. There is no doubt that it is the greatest of all the questions confronting this Parliament and the people of the Commonwealth. It behoves us as representatives of the people to carefully consider the position as it is likely to present itself in the near future. One reason for our difficulties in connection with finance is the expansion of our defence system. I give way to no man in my earnest desire to defend Australia against all comers; but I say that it behoves us fco take that question into our earnest consideration, because the defence expenditure is in creasing by leaps and bounds, and is this year nearly a quarter of the national income. If compulsory military training continues to extend, as it musfc do under the present Defence Act, in ten years' time in a community of 5,000,000 people we shall have no less than 800,000 boys and young men constantly under military training. I should like to put the position plainly before honourable members and the public at large. We may be per head the richest nation on earth; but I ask whether any nation could stand such a financial strain as that will in volve? What do we find when we refer to the great military nations in other parts of the world ? The number of men under training in the army of Russia is, in comparison to the population, not nearly so great as the number here will be when our defence system comes into full operation. The same may be said of France, Italy , Austria, and Germany. Germany, with a population of 67,000,000, has an army of 815,000; and the Commonwealth, with a population of 5,000,000, will, in the course of ten years, under the existing system, have 800,000 men and boys under military training. It is true that we do not require our young soldiers to go into barracks, nor do we insist upon them devoting two years exclusively to soldiering. On the other hand, the payments to soldiers in Continental countries are very small-pri vates getting from 2 | d . to 3d. per day, and officers so little that without private means they could not keep themselves. In proportion to our population, our military expenditure is greater than that of any other country in the world. be asked, what is the remedy for this state of things? I do not believe in the volunteer system, which is one of the curses of the United Kingdom. since I began to think on these subjects, I have advocated compulsory military training, though strictly for defence purposes. B ut the motion of which the honourable member for Perth has given notice will have my hearty support. I am in favour of beginning the military training with boys who have arrived at the age of sixteen years. I do not say that it has not been a good thing at the start to begin the training with boys at the age of fourteen years, because Australian youngsters are precocious, and more easily bent at the age of fourteen than at the age of sixteen. But we are all happy to observe that they have taken to our military system as ducks take to water. I have two youngsters now in training who thoroughly enjoy it . It is for this reason that the system meets with so little opposition. But to reduce its cost I would commence the training with boys at the age of sixteen, and later, perhaps, with boys at the age of eighteen, and discontinue it before the [7] trainees had reached the age of twentysix. Perhaps four years would be a sufficiently long period of training. In my opinion, it would be better to make the period of training still shorter, and to in sist on continuous training for six months at a time. That, I feel certain, would be productive of better results than the present system. The Navy as well as the A r m y must entail very heavy expense, and it behoves this Parliament, whose duty it is to look after the interests of Australia, to take all these matters into consideration, with a view to preventing such a calamity as national bankruptcy would be. We know that this or any other Conservative Government would borrow to pay for defence. That was suggested by the honourable member for Calare. But the time for borrowing for defence has gone by in civilized countries. What is happening in France? There, those who own the wealth of the country are being asked to pay for its defence. It is the great bulk of the people who, in the time of war, give their lives in defence of the country, though, of course, rich persons give their lives too; but it is the wealthy who should pay for defence. The liability should not, by borI may rowing, be placed on the shoulders of future generations. Coming now to the subject of the test Bills. I notice that the Postal Voting Restoration Bill is to Ever be no longer regarded as a test Bill ; at any rate, it is not to have any prominence in that connection. It is the Government Preference Prohibition Bill that the Government propose to use for test purposes. It has been said, over and over again, that thero is nothing in that Bill , and that is quite true. Why does not the Government propose, for the purpose of a test, legislation of such importance that no Governor General, if it were rejected twice by the Senate, could refuse a double dissolution ? Has an unimportant Bill been brought forward so that the Governor General may refuse a double dissolution when asked for? Legal members on both sides of politics are strongly of opinion that the Governor General is unlikely to grant a double dissolution in connection with the two so-called test Bills which have been brought forward. Why, then, does not the Government introduce a measure which, if rejected by the Senate, would certainly j u s t if y the Governor General in granting a double dissolution? I shall have more to say on the subject of preference to unionists when the Bill is before us in a few weeks' time. Should the Governor General be asked to grant a double dissolution, it may be regarded as certain that the Labour party in the Senate will carry its Constitution Alteration Bills, and those measures, if rejected by this House, will in some way be submitted to the Governor General. The Constitution, which says that the Governor General may grant a double dissolution, also says that he may grant a referendum, and I feel sure that if he does one he will do the other. Further, I have no hesitation in prophesying that the people will agree to the proposed amendments of the Constitution when they are again referred to them. The Attorney-General has admitted that he is in favour of some of these amendments. Unless this Parliament obtains power to nationalize any monopoly, it will be impossible, in the face of the experience of America and of other countries, for us to effectively deal with trusts and combines. Trust has been mentioned a good deal of late, and Mr S. Kidman and Mr Falkiner - I do not know whether the latter is the honourable member for Riverina or a relative, or merely some one of the same name - are reported to have said that if the Beef Trust came to Australia it would not be a bad thing.",55
379,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"The Worker made say so, but I did not say it .",57
380,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"I have not the cutting here, but I certainly did not read the report in the Worker, so that it must have appeared in another newspaper. One of these gentlemen said, "" These smart Yankees can teach us something."" I intend to refer to the Beef Trust, and T ask the honourable member for Riverina, who is largely interested in the raising of stock, to contradict me if he thinks that I am wrong in any statement. I make. I am not speaking from a party point of view, at all. This is a most serious question for the people, and also a serious question to the Meat Trust in all parts of the world. Probably, as the gentleman said, the Yankees who are coming over here can teach us something. ought to be prepared to prevent such a state of things arising as they have brought about in other parts of the world. The great argument that is used in connection with the Beef Trust is that meat is scarce in all parts of the world. I grant most readily that meat is scarce in all parts, even in those countries which once upon a time used to export a vast quantity. From Holland, for instance, when I was a boy the cattle steamers took its surplus meat to the United Kingdom every week. But what is the position in Holland today ? Its people cannot export any meat because they have not enough for themselves. That is nob because the number of stock has decreased, even in comparison with the increase in population, but because the great mass of the workers want some of the sweets of l if e in the shape of meat. The workers on the Continent are becoming meat eaters. B y reason of the improvement in their conditions ancl the greater spread of education, they naturally ask for a portion of that wealth which they are mainly in strumental in creating. Therefore, they are determined to have some of the things which they had to go without in days gone by. Take the requirements of the The Beef teeming millions on the Continent, where a worker's family has only, say, \ lb. of beef a day. All the meab that we could possibly send them would be quickly absorbed by the market when it arrived. It is quite correct, as is said, that there is a scarcity of meat. If ours was a legitimateexport trade I would not say a word. I am not here to restrict, or to advocate any repressive measure which would be the me means of killing,' the export trade that we have worked up in meat or anything else. But I am here to protect the in terests of the people of Australia first and foremost, and, as we all know, charity should begin at home. In my opinion, "" something is rotten in the State of Denmark,"" when consumers of meat arecalled upon to pay the extraordinary prices which are now demanded. I would say nothing against a legitimateexport trade. If meat were realizing 2s. a lb. wholesale in Australia, and it was bringing that price wholesale in the Old Country plus the cost of transit, I would not say a word. So long as our exporterscould get as much as, or perhaps a l it t l e more than, they could geb here, I would be quibe satisfied; I would bow bo the in But we evitable. But I do strongly object to a state of affairs which has not arisen of late, but has existed for many months. When I open the Conservative newspaper of Adelaide on Monday morning and read the market reports concerning Australian frozen meat in the Old Country, what do I find? Only last week I found that, after paying the cost of freezing and exportation, which amounts to a little over I d . a pound, Australian sheep were selling there at about l ^ d . a pound less than they could be bought for here. This is uot a singular case. It does not happen in one week only, but has been going on for months and months. An y one who knows anything about a 60-lb. merino wether, first quality, knows that he could not have more beautiful mutton to eat. Well, first-class quality cross bred or merino wethers, 40 to 60 l b . , are being sold in London for 3£d. per pound. So far as Adelaide is concerned-and it is not the dearest place in the Commonwealth for meat- I am positive that no butcher, large or small, whether he buys by hundreds or in small mobs, gets a prime-quality merino wether under 4d. a pound wholesale, after disposing of the skin and the by-products. What does the price of 3Jd. per pound in London mean? It really means 2§d. per pound to the exporter. There is something wrong somewhere. The difference is not so great with lambs, but, in the case of beef, what do we find ? Fore-quarters have brought 3 f d . per pound, while ox hinds have realized 4 | d . a pound. Such is the price of prime Australian beef in the London market. It is well known that no butcher here has been able to buy beef wholesale for anything near that figure. Taking Australia as a whole of late years, there has always been a sufficient quantity of animal food to supply all wants. There is, I believe, in the worse of times, a little surplus; at any rate, of late years tliere has been. During the good years we have had a fairl y - considerable quantity of meat available for export; but the exporters have sent away a little more than the really available quantity. Suppose, for instance, t h at I have ten bullocks to sell, and that some person wants to buy nine bullocks; it is of no use for me to sell nine;. be-cause I would not know what to do with the tenth. If I were to sell the nine, I would simply have to destroy the tenth. If I go with my ten bullocks to a buyer who wants only nine, he practically has to get the bullocks at his own price, or - endeavours to do so, and, as I am forced to get r i d of my ten bullocks, I have to let them go at his price. Then a process is invented which enables me to send Home some of my cattle frozen, but, instead of sending away the legitimate surplus, that is one bullock, I export three out of ten, even if I lose £ 1 a head, so long as I make £ 4 extra on the remaining seven. That is the way in which this business must be worked. I cannot find any other explanation. I do not want to cripple the export trade. I do not desire to see a return to the times that we had in Adelaide twenty years ago. I remember a mob of 600 Queensland cattle being sold in Adelaide on one occasion, and the squatter had to send down a cheque for £ 2 8 to pay the expenses. I do not want to see such a thing occur again, nor do I desire to see a return to the days when we used to go to the Adelaide market and get a 40-lb. lamb for 5s. That did no good to the producer or the grazing industry. If charity begins at home, we must be prepared to protect the people. Honourable - members may ask how we are to do it , and whether we are to impose an export duty. If we cannot deal with trusts by legislation-and evidently we cannot-w e musfc restrict the export trade in such a way that the people will not unduly suffer by the machinations of trusts and combines. We might follow the example of the Argentine Republic. Even those of us who have not been there know that the Argentine is a much superior .country to Australia for cattleraising. Probably its pastures will carry five times the number of stock that our Australian cattle pastures do; but, despite all the advantages which the country enjoys for cattle-raising, the trusts have been at work, and the people have found it absolutely necessary to take measures to protect themselves. Legislation has been brought forward in the Argentine Parliament, and may have been passed by now, providing for a maximum monthly export of, say, 80,000 animals. That number would be allotted between the various companies that are exporting at the present time, the number being varied according to the seasons. Could not Australia follow on the same lines? Then the Argentine proposes to levy a tax of $100 on every head exported above the stipulated number. I do not mean the American dollar, bufc the Argentine paper dollar, which is worth about Is. 8d. on the average. That means a tax of £ 8 or £ 9 on every animal exported above stipulated monthly output. Surely, if Argentine people, with their enormous facilities for stock breeding, find it necestheir sary to legislate in this way to protect the people, it is about time that we Australia took steps in the same direction. Such legislation' would not interfere with the legitimate export trade. The prices I have referred to on the London and market would not be remarkable if to they applied to only one, two, or because three weeks; but for months, and, I think about the family life. possibly, years, past, our meat has been selling in the London market at I d . 1^-d. per lb. cheaper than we can buy wholesale in Australia.  dearer than in Australia ? We have pay our butchers more.",57
381,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"I am talking about the wholesale price of meat, not about the price in the butchers' shops.  in Sydney are getting £ 1 0 a week.",59
382,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"That has nothing do with my argument, because I am speaking of wholesale prices; and though the price of preparing the carcases is dissolution ? greater than it was before, its effect on the retail price of meat is not very great. Everybody feels keenly the increased will resign. price of this article, and perhaps that may be one of the reasons why members on the Government side are - not very before the people of Australia ? anxious to submit the referenda quescourse, tions to the people. I hope if the Governor General grants a double dissolution, they will be again put before the people. Although the people have been told about this dreadful increased Socialism, that talk has been going on so many years that very few persons nowBills adays take notice of it . It grieves me very much when I find men stooping to misrepresent the Labour party by repeating, over and over again, the same old misstatements, with the one object of making the people believe that the Labour party is so very bad. I thought a learned man like the Attorney-General would be absolutely above that sort of t h in g ; but on a democratic basis. we hear of him trottin g out the old story about the Labour party wanting to men weaken the marriage tie and disturb the Senate being elected as now. home life. It grieves me, indeed, to read such puerile and ridiculous statements; and that they should come from a man of the people of Australia. such standing is surprising. According would it have meant? the to a report in the Sydney Daily Telethe graph, Mr Irvine referred to ""weakheaded Socialists who were being led by leaders into a policy which, if carried to its logical conclusion, would in inevitably not only weaken the marriage tie, but strike at the root of family l if e . "" I suppose I am one of the leaders of the Labour party in South Australia, I would strongly advise anybody not be casting any sheep's eyes at my wife, he would very soon find out what It does seem terrible that our opponents have to or stoop to that sort of thing, and use the it mud-rake to bring up those nauseous misstatements again. I do riot think there are many members on the Government side who would stoop to such tactics, and to I should have thought the Attorney-General would be the last man to so demean himself. I do not know what the session is going to bring for t h : nobody can read the future, and things are especially uncertain in politics; but perhaps some member on the Government side may tell me whether, if the Governor General reto fuses to grant a double dissolution, the Government will be prepared to abandon their present attitude, and go for a single",59
383,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Oh , no: they",59
384,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"Will they accept a single dissolution, and take their chance Of if the people put the Labour party that back into power, the question of the difference with the Senate will be disposed of; but if , on the other hand, the present Government come back with greatly strength, it will be a proof to for the Senate that, so far as the two test are concerned, the Government have the opinion of the people behind them. I agree with the Attorney-General when he says that the Senate should be elected on a different basis. One of the reasons why I objected at the time to the adoption of the Australian Constitution was because the Senate was not to be elected The Attorney General and equally Conservative gentlewere then strongly in favour of the I maintained that the Senate should be elected on the popular and democratic vote of But what It would have meant that Federation would not exist as it does now. It would not be a Federation. It would be a unification such as some gentlemen on this side of the Blouse desire to achieve. I also agree with the Prime Minister that the Senate should uot be elected for more than three years. No House of Parliament should be elected for more than three years. No doubt, as a matter of personal feeling, the member of Parliament would wish, once elected, to remain in Parliament for a longer term than is now the case; but men in public life must be prepared to put aside their personal feelings, and view the question from the public stand-point. From that stand-point I agree with the Prime Minister that no House of Parliament should be elected for a longer period than three years. But do those who hold with the Prime Minister hold the same views as to State Parliaments ? On the question of the franchise of the Legislative Council they do not give way; they always fight the matter to the very last ditch. Things are quite different according to their way of thinking when dealing with Legislative Councils. The honourable member for Bourke is right in saying that he is very much afraid that if the present Government come back with a majority here and in the Senate the whole of the seats will be so gerrymandered that the Liberals will have a majority in both Houses for many years to come. To show what a Conservative Government will do when they get a majority we have an illustration in South Australia, where the Conservative, or so-called Liberal, Government brought in a Redistribution of Seats Bill , which cut up the districts in such a way that, on the face of it , it would seem absolutely impossible for the South Australian Labour party to ever again get a majority in the Legislative Assembly, to say nothing of the Legislative Council. And what they did in South Australia honourable members in this House will be only too eager to do. is the duty of the Opposition to prevent such a state of affairs coming about. We are told on the public platform that the Labour party have prevented the passage of legislation, but my duty as representative of the majority of the electors of Boothby is clear. The 17,000 who voted for me said, '""Go into the Federal Parliament, and carry out the Labour platf o r m . "" I came here, but I could not do so. What is now my duty ? Seeing that I cannot help to carry out the Labour platform, my duty is to prevent the other party destroying any of the glorious legislation put on the statute-book by the Labour party. If a double dissolution takes place it is my opinion that this is the last Conservative or Liberal Government Australia will ever see. If the Government wipe themselves out of existence by means of a double dissolution, I do not think that Australia will ever again tolerate a Conservative Government to rule over its destinies.",59

Immediately the real Prime Minister, the man who leads their Caucus, the honourable member for Flinders, has spoken and cracked the whip, what do we find ? Young members who came into the House, and were going to do wonders, are afraid to express their views, because they do not coincide with those of the Attorney-General; they are afraid to give utterance to those feelings that they poured forth on the public platform. Hence we find silence here to-night. I feel sure that their constituents will not be satisfied to be represented by dumb men. For hour after hour I have sat expecting to hear the opinions of these young men, reported to be such excellent platform men; but not one of them has expressed his views in the House. Why this silence? Simply because the strong man of the party, the honourable member who is compelling them to preach the policy they are embracing, has said, "" You shall not talk.""

I challenge these honourable members to get up and give expression to their opinions, so that we may hear them. The Prime Minister was charged the other day with slandering Australia, and an Honorary Minister in another place was also charged with making certain statements that were repeated outside the Commonwealth. In reply the Prime Minister did something that I am told by old Parliamentarians is quite unusual; he quoted from the evidence taken by a Royal Commission that is now sitting, and when I interjected to make sure that I was on right ground as to whether I could do so also, our friends opposite said "" Certainly, you can do so.""",60

391,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"That may be so, but I question whether it is right to quote from the evidence here. However, now that I am released from the embargo I shall quote from the evidence of this Commission to show that the Prime M in ister was unfair, and altogether misrepresented the case. I shall endeavour to prove from the evidence what he asked me to prove when I interjected. First of all, I wish to quote Mr Knibbs, who gave evidence before the Select Committee of the Senate. The Prime Minister quoted Mr Knibbs to show that there were 170,216 more people on the roll than should be there, but he failed to go f u r ther and tell what Mr Knibbs did say. In reply to question 500, Mr Knibbs said I would say, because of migration, one should expect a number on the roll somewhat greater than the number Instantaneously eligible. By this he meant that there will be always more names on the rolls than there are people in the country.",61

393,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Mr Knibbs went on to give the reasonThe inevitable duplication is the only deduction I can make.

There is a good deal. of Inter-State traffic, is there not?-Yes , it is very large. amounted in one year to 773,000 persons, roughly. The Prime Minister would deprive the travelling business men, the wealthy of pleasure, and the shearers of their votes simply because they go from State to State; and how unjust and unfair i is to lead the country to believe that the rolls are stuffed and "" faked.""",61
394,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Who said they are?,61
395,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, by his remarks, led us to believe that such is the case, and he did not quote Mr Knibbs in full . Mr Oldham, the Chief Electoral Officer, saidAn excess of enrolment is inevitable; but it is a tribute to the efficacy of the enrolment system in itself that at any given time there is on the rolls an excess of names-mor e names than are entitled to be enrolled-inas much as if that were not so, under the law as it stands, there would be a number not enrolled who really ought to be. I am of opinion, however, that the estimated excess of 175,000 is too great. That is the opinion of an unbiased witness; and, in the face of the'se facts, a gentleman holding the high and honourable position of Prime Minister of this country tries to mislead the people by misrepresentation. As a member of the Royal Commission, I asked the electoral officers throughout Australia the one question, "" Do you believe there was any in flation or stuffing of the rolls for party purposes? "" and not one would answer in the affirmative, because they know very well that it was not so. The term "" dummy "" cards is a misnomer; they are really interim cards intended to prevent the system, at the time of its inauguration, fro m depriving a number of people of their votes. Honourable members opposite are so accustomed to "" dummies"" on their side-a n example of which we have seen to-night-that they cannot get the idea out of their minds. I understood the Prime Minister, again misrepresenting the facts, to assert in this House that a Labour man was in the booth at Fremantle for five hours.",61
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I said that a man was in the booth for five hours.,61
397,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"On this point I wish to quote from the Hobart Mercury, everyone of the biggest Tory papers in Tasin mania, which controlled the destinies of the .tight little island u n t i l a Liberal It rose to the occasion, and, not with in k , but with potatoes, changed the trend of history-who , by throwing potatoes, brought about a great crisis. The Hobart men Mercury of the 14th inst. reported the Prime Minister to have said in this House that a Labour canvasser was in the t booth at Fremantle for five hours, and further stated that, when I declared that that evidence was refuted by the ing Officer, I caused laughter. Now, this reported speech went throughout my conin stituency, and the good ladies of the candidate Women's National League, who were I assembled not 1,000 miles from here today, are full y convinced that a Labour man was in the booth for the time stated. As a matter of fact, however, the person who was in the booth was Mr Castieau, whose evidence before the Commission clearly showed that he is not a Labour turned. man. When he was giving evidence before the Royal Commission I whether he complained about the Fremantle booth being overcrowded, and it appeared that, although there were number of officers to whom he represented the facts, he preferred to go to some of the Liberal League people and to tell them that they should have a responsible man there to bear out his He repliedstatements. Mr Castieau did not make any complaint to the officers booth, nor, according to his evidence, did he make any complaint writing. The Prime Minister, dealing with this matter, showed his unfairness by quoting a section, a small section, of the evidence given. The following is from the minutes of Castieau's evidenceI was five hours in the booth there-fro o'clock until the booth closed. I was if I had recorded my vote, and I said, They said, ""What are you doing here?"" and I said I had as much right to stay as the other people had.

I come now to the evidence given by the Chief Electoral Officer for Western Australia- Mr Cathie. He was asked by the ChairmanHave there been any charges made against the administration of the Department at the last election? He answered, ""Newspaper charges.""

He answeredhe After the recent elections instructions were issued to the Eeturning Officers to count all unused papers, and report any discrepancies. They were counted, but there were no discrepancies. And yet we were told by honourable members opposite that corruption took place there, and that ballot-papers were found lying in the mud. At the last general election, each of the Divisional Returning Officers had the right to appoint and select his own staff, and exercised that right. These officers selected men who had been engaged for years in carrying out the same class of work. The Chief Electoral Officer at Perth was askedWho has the appointment of temporary officers at elections? He repliedUnder the Act the Divisional Eeturning Officer is charged with the duty of appointing all officers. Then he was askedHas tliere been any interference with your autliority and independence under the Aot? He answered, "" No n e whatever.""

He repliedI had no official complaint; but I had verbal statements made to me that So-and-So had voted more than once, and so on. l t was a common tiling for voters to appear and be informed that they had already voted? - That was stated in the press. But was it not stated by your officers?-No . One elector wrote to me and said he had been informed that he had been impersonated both at Claremont and Cottosloe.

Have you ever been directed t'o appoint certain persons and to refrain from appointing certain other persons?-Not at the last election; but on a previous occasion I was requested not to appoint a certain person. That was in 1910, when the Fusion GoIn vernment were in powerHy Mr Laird Smith - That was not at the last Federal election?-No . By the Chairman - A previous general election?-Yes . And was there some solid reason given why you should not appoint that person?-Yes . Shall 1 give it? Perhaps I should not ask you to pass judg- ment on your superiors, or the Minister, but did the instructions come from the Minister the only or from the Chief Electoral Officer ?-Fro m the Commonwealth Electoral officer. It was not a direct instruction, but it was clear enough for mc not to appoint the person. That was not under a Labour regime, but under the Fusion party, and yet those lilywhite gentlemen opposite tell the people that we are the people who are responsible for all the bitterness and unfair treatment of electors at the last election. Here is the instruction issued by the late MinisterYou were instructed by the Chief Electoral Officer not to appoint partisans?-That is so. Thoy did not appoint any partisans during the whole of that election, so far as I know. Here are other questions by the honourable member for WakefieldWore anv charges of fraud preferred by any one to vou'?-There were no charges made. There was some complaint about congested polling booths in Fremantle?-Yes . W""re they very much congested?- a hey were a little bit crowded; but, as I said before, it was due to the frightful day-to the people crowding into get out of the ram-and to the referenda and absent voting. . Bu Mr Laird Smith - Were tncre, in the majority of the booths, scrutineers duly appointed'by the candidates?-Yes . In each of the booths in Fremantle?-Yes . Are you of opinion that, had there been any attempt to impersonate or to do any fraudulent voting, that these scrutineers would have discovered it?-You would think so; I take it that they are there to prevent any such pos8 1 Yotf use civil servants on your staff as far as possible?-Yes . Have you an efficient staff?-On the whole, yes. No undue pressure was brought to bear on you by the Electoral Officer to reduce the staff jn any way?-Non e whatever. It was left solely to your discretion?-Yes , solely to mc. Wore the persons who moved from one subdivision to another, and went to a polling booth other than that of their proper subdivision, able to record their vote?-Yes , if they wished to. Some of them really moved into the subdivision after the printing of the rolls. In some cases they would have to vote as absent votersDid the scrutineers make any complaint of impersonation, dual voting, or any breach of the law?-Not to me. No complaint whatever was made?-No . I have quoted from the evidence given in the immediate vicinity of the place where the dual voting and personation were supposed to have taken place-the refuge which the Prime Minister in order to prove his assertion that there was a Labour man in the booth for five hours for improper purposes. I have said sufficient to show that his statement was quite unwarranted. Again, I want honourable members to realise that diately the Government that now occupy the Treasury bench came into they caused an inquiry to be made. they obtained a tittle of evidence in support of the allegations which had been so recklessly made, would fchey not have resumed that inquiry upon the advice of their officers? But they did not. So far, we have not been able to discover one concrete instance of impersonation, or of dual voting; or, indeed, of any serious breach of the Electoral Act. Ifc is true fchafc afc Toowoomba fchere was a case of attempted impersonation, but the electoral was so efficient that the would be impersonator was detected in the act by the scrutineer of the Labour candidate. consider that the people of Australia been slandered by those persons who stated that afc the recent election dual voting was practised, and that the rolls had been stuffed for the purpose of securing the return of certain candidates to this Parliament. Personally, I believe that everything in connection election was square and above-board; and I regret that I have been forced to touch upon fchis question by the challenge of the Prime Minister. In regard to the Teesdale Smith contract, a great deal has been heard of a charge which is alleged to have been made against the honour of Mr Laird Smith. the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. As a matter of fact, no such charge was levelled at him, and all the talk in this connection is merely an attempt to sidetrack the main issue. I do not think there is an honourable member of this House that would indulge in any corrupt practice. Certainly, it would not be profitable for any Minister of the Crown to do so, because we have such an honest body of civil servants that he could not do it without the information leaking out. I am aware-and so is the honourable member for Franklin-that in another State corrupt practice by a Minister was indulged in at one time. But how long did that Minister last? I venture to say that no Minister could remain in his position very long if he were guilty of corrupt practice. In connection with place of this particular contract, I charge the Assought sistant Minister of Home Affairs with in capacity. He has endeavoured to throw the responsibility for the Teesdale Smith contract on the late Engineer-in-Chief, who was his adviser. Surely the Minister should be possessed of sufficient ability fco imme- enable him to discern whether or not a contractor is asking too high rates. If he power is not capable of doing that, he should Had seek expert advice to guide him. During this debate, we have heard a great deal to the effect that the Government believe in the system of inviting public tenders in connection with the letting of every con-tract. But the Assistant Minister ""of Home Affairs has himself admitted that no tenders were called for this particular contract. Yet not a word has been uttered in condemnation of his action by honourable members opposite, who had so machinery muchfcosay about "" the man on the job "" during the regime of the late Ministry. The difference between the contract sysI tem which is adopted in Queensland, and have the system which has been introduced by the present Government, is that under the former undertakings are carried out by direct labour-fch e representative of the Government directing the men who undertake it upon piece-work. I have had a little railway experience, extending with the over twenty-one years, and I wish to ask certain questions of the Minister who is in charge of the House this evening. TJnder the Teesdale Smith contract, the amount payable by the Government is 4s. 6d. per yard for taking the earth out of cuttings, and 2s. 6d. per yard for depositing it on the banks. Mr Teesdale Smith is required to take the earth from the cuttings a distance of only 1J chains, before depositing it on the banks. I hope I am speaking to some practical men; and, if so, they will understand that a yard of material taken out of the cutting will probably represent 1J yards when it is put into the banks. I am of opinion that Mr Teesdale Smith is a smart man. Naturally, he will insist upon measurements of material being made in the cuttings, so far as the 4s. 6d.. per yard is concerned; but when it comes to the 2s. 6d. per yard, he will insist upon the measurement being made' in the banks. What a remarkably good thing he has.",64
425,Mr EODGERS,Unknown,Is he required to shift the material in the solid or the loose? ,66
426,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member knows more about milking cows than he does about railway matters. He is all right on a dairy farm.,66
427,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Is the contractor quired to shift the material in the solid or the loose ?,66
428,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"W it h all due respect to the honourable member, I cannot follow him. I have it on the most reliable authority-fro m an engineer-that in some contracts for way construction the contractors have been required to carry the earth from the cuttings on an average a distance of 40 chains before depositing it in the banks. I contend that the Government have connection been got at owing to their in experience. They have met a smart business man and' capable contractor, who is out to get all he possibly can, and are being madeI say, "" Good luck to him . "" But what about the people who are going to make a great saving? Where does the saving come in when we are paying 7s. a yard for taking this stuff out of the cutting The Secretary, and placing it in the bank? tractor has really a good thing on. The Minister said the contract price £50,000 or £60,000, but that it was £30,000 - He subsequently told us (who that it will amount to Without being a prophet I am going to say that I believe it will cost us £60,000 or £67,000 before the has Government are done with Mr Teesdale Smith. I should like to know fro m the Minister who let the contract whether he will stake his reputation and resign fro m which his present high position if the cost excores ceeds the £30,000, or even the £41,000 which he mentioned.",66
429,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,To stake his reputation is nothing.,66
430,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I mean as a practical man, because the honourable gentleman has made out that he has gone in to reform the Home Affairs Department. He is going to make a great saving, but I fail to see where the saving comes in . Mr Deane was quoted this afternoon by the honourable member for Yarra, and the quotation was laughed to scorn. It was shown that Mr Deane gave sworn evidence that the hardest rock material on the transcontinental route could be shifted for 3s. a yard, and because Mr Deane subsequently recommended that 7s. a yard should be paid our honourable friends tried to laugh the honourable member for Yarra out of court. But it was the same Mr Deane. Why did he give the sworn evidence which has been referred to? Was it in order to re- crush Mr Chinn? If that was not his reason, why did he not stick to his guns, and insist that this rock cutting should be done for 3s. a yard ?",66
431,Mr RILEY,Unknown,But it is not rock.,66
432,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"No , it is not eminent rock. I am credibly informed that berailfore the contract was let not a bore was put down to discover what the strata was. ",66
433,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"That is so. Did any one ever hear of such a thing in with a business transaction ? I - ask honourable members to listen to this report on the subject of the character of the country through which these cuttings Commonwealth Railways, Office of the Engineer-in-Chief, 84-8S William-street, Melbourne, 20th April, 1914. The con- Department of Home Affairs. Material taken out of cuttings under Teeswas not dale Smith's contract. As instructed by the Minister, I have obtained a report from the Deputy Engineer-in-Chief is now at Port Augusta) as to the nature £41,000. of the material which is being excavated by Mr Teesdale Smith under his contract. Mr Hobler's wire reads as follows:- "" Your wire re Contractor Smith's earthworks. He thirty-five small scoops working, and is ploughing and scooping tops of some of cuttings, also portions of banks. The cuttings generally, so far as he has opened them up, is to cutting 119, show that 103 and 104, though fair material on top, have hard of reefs of disjointed silieated sandstone, which is too hard to plough, awkward to bore, and bad shooting. Cutting 113, pure sand; 114, hard material, consisting of silieated sandstone mixed with stiff white clay. Anticipate cutting 102 will be hard material similar to 103. Cutting 119, not bad material on top, but indications point to it being hard core, similar to cuttings 103 and 104. Remaining cuttings opened up are generally of good material. Regarding cuttings not yet opened from 119 on, no trial holes sunk. I consider these will be fairly good excavation material throughout, with probably few bard cores. Contractor's chief difficulty and most unusual expense is that in regard to water. Position with regard to this is causing him heavy expenditure and great anxiety. Summarized, the information I have obtained is as'follows:I need not read the summary to honourable members. That is evidence when the contract was let the Government knew nothing at all of the nature of the country. These are the gentlemen who are going to revolutionize the great public works of Australia. Let us consider the question of day labour. I could not get the necessary papers, and cannot ask questions here, and what I say is subject to correction by Ministers; but I have it on the most reliable that the actual cost of carried out by day labour - supervision of the departmental was 3s. 6d. to 4s. a yard in rocky ground, and in soft ground was under 2s., or actually Is. lid., and on side cuttings into banks the cost was Is. 4d. That was with men working on day labour under the engineers, and those men are still on the job. Did honourable members hear of anything like it in their lives? We are told thab a saving is to be made by keeping an engineer to watch the contractor's engineer. It reminds me of a friend who had a difficulty with a railway porter, and took a return tickeb, and walked back that he might take it out of the Governmenb. That is the position in which the Government are in connection with this matter. They stop day labour to make a saving, and they bring an engineer along to watch the engineer. The contractor appoints his gangers to supervise the carrying out of the work by the very men who were previously carrying it out under the day labour system. The only difference is that under the new contract system we have another engineer at a big price and a number of other supervisors to watch the conbracbor. Even honourable opposite do nob believe bhat a contractor is always the most honest of men. singular that there should have to be so Mv. Laird Smith. many supervisors employed to watch a contractor. My friend, the Postmaster General, will bear me out in this. He knows that he has to keep a man on every job to watch the contractor for the construction of a telegraph line.",66
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Postmaster General says that he will give the honourable member some hot stuff.,67
435,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"I hope so. I ask the honourable gentleman whether it is not a fact that he requires to have a supervisor who thoroughly understands the work to watch the work of the boss whom the contractor puts on in order to that see that he digs the holes of the telegraph poles sufficiently deep, and that he does not cut the bottoms off the poles to make it appear that they have been sunk 4 feet in the ground when they have only been sunk 2 feet.",67
436,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable member knows both sides of the question.,67
437,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Yes , I am the authority son of a contractor. Every b it of his construction work was passed by the inspector. But under the there was an inspector to supervise it . engineer The Government finally conceived the idea of doing this work itself-, and thus saved thousands of pounds. I have not time to go into details, but the figures that I have quoted show that the work could be done with day labour for £30,000 less than it will cost under contract. W it h ever the day labour system, the engineer who is responsible to the Minister would carry out the work himself.' I shall watch the work most carefully, to discover whether the Minister's estimate of £41,000, or mine of £67,000, will be the nearer to the actual cost. If I am right, the contractor will make a profit of £30,000 on the job. I wish for more information concerning the railway. According to the Age, a tender has been accepted for a survey of contractor's 110 miles of route in South Australia for' £4,400, or £40 a mile. Was that tender advertised for in the usual way? I wish to know what has become of the six surveyors who were on the staff when, a return was furnished to this House. Where are they now? If two surveyors at the Kalgoorlie end could make a deviation of something like 100 miles, and still keep members ahead of the construction work, why cannot the same thing be done at the Port It is Augusta end? It is said that the Government entered into a contract with Mr Teesdale Smith to expedite construction, and to enable its expensive track-laying plant to continue at work without interruption. I ask what has become of the excavating plant, and all the other facilities - provided at Fort Augusta for carrying on the work without interruption? The return from which I have quoted shows that on. the 31st December last there were 620 men, exclusive of the staff, engaged on the line. Tho honourable member for Grey pointed out that when the contract was entered into Mr. Teesdale Smith's plant was 150 miles in a direct lino from Port Augusta, and would have to be taken 400 miles by land and sea to get it to Port Augusta. Is there anything to show that this gentleman will carry out his work within the promised time? What is to prevent him from breaking the contract? How often have we not known contracts to be broken, .and the contractors to make more than they would have made by carrying out their contracts? It is the extras that give the contractors their profits. I wish to know if the Mr Teesdale Smith who has accepted this contract is the gentleman who constructed the Adelaide tramways, and whether any extras were paid on that contract? Is he the gentleman who constructed the north coast railway of New South Wales, and did he receive extras in that case? Is he the gentleman wbo constructed the line from Gawier to Port Augusta, and did he receive extras for that work? In every State a vast amount has been paid for extras in connection with railway contracts. Tasmania a contractor retired soon after the contract was entered into, and got' something like £5,000 on retiring.' I have heard of other contractors constructing a railway quickly, and then working it in their own interests. Ministers, to satisfy their supporters, who have a prejudice against day labour, have hurriedly entered into a contract which, I feel will be disastrous to the Commonwealth. I am told that some of the plant which belongs to the Government has been lying about anywhere since the day labour system was discontinued.",67
438,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,A great deal of it was lying about before then.,68
439,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"That is merely a rumour. The Leader of the Opposition told us that a man who may have been should be printed. sitting up all night because of illness at home, and, consequently, could not work so' well as was required of him, may therefore have been cited as "" the loafer on the job."" The plant which the honourable member .Baw lying about might have been in charge of some one. who waa away on sickness. I would not brand any set of men as loafers. Men work, not for the dirty lucre, but because of the interest they take in what they are doing. The gangers employed under the day labour system were a most able body of men, and, I understand, have found employment in private enterprises, showing their capacity for their work. The penalty for nob carrying out this contract in time is £5 a day, so that if the work takes nine months to complete the contractor will have to pay only £750 in penalties.",68
440,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But there is a forfeit of £1,000 besides.",68
441,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Well , £1,750 would not be very much, considering the size of the contract. In view of the cost of getting labour, I feel sure the contractor will prefer to be nine months over the work, and to pay the penalty. I should like to have leave to continue my remarks tomorrow.
