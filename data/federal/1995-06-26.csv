2,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"Fraser) (12.31 p.m.)On behalf of the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Standing Committee, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled The proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder, together with the evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",11
3,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"The inquiry into the proposal to drain and restore Lake Pedder involved this committee in a great deal of controversy-far more than we expected when we undertook to investigate the proposal. After discussions with representatives of Pedder 2000 last year, members from all parties agreed that a parliamentary inquiry was warranted. This was because the proposal was a matter that had potential consequences for the future management of the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area, which of cpurse is the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the government of Tasmania. Although individual opinions about the proposal varied enormously, members of the committee agreed that a dispassionate study of all sides of the issue would not only lead to a reasonable conclusion but also would be a low cost method of considering the issue. We strove to conduct the inquiry in a speedy and even-handed manner, so we could report fairly and as early as possible. However, the inquiry generated wild controversy in which some seriously misjudged and sometimes quite untrue assertions were made. The committee was attacked from many sides and outrageous claims were made about the cost of the inquiry. Some people claimed that the Commonwealth government must have instigated the inquiry for some hidden political reason. I would like to make it quite clear that the decision to undertake the inquiry was entirely the committee's own and unanimously agreed. Nevertheless; a great deal of considered evidence was presented during the inquiry, both in submissions and by witnesses at the public hearings. The committee appreciated the effort which the main proponents from both sides of the argument put into gathering, preparing and presenting the maReport terial. Inevitably there were strong conflicts and sharp contrasts in the perspectives of the witnesses. In summary, our key findings are that the proposal is technically feasible and that if implemented it would enhance the World Heritage values of the area, although there is a risk that these values would be diminished while the area is rehabilitated. There could be a net financial cost to the Tasmanian community. There is little likelihood of the proposal proceeding in the foreseeable future and, more importantly, there are other environmental tasks that have much higher priority. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to allocate resources to the further consideration of the proposal at this time. It was generally agreed that the geomorphological features would survive draining, as would the peat mat that originally covered the area. Most witnesses accepted that, while an exact restoration of the pre-flooding ecology was no longer possible, an acceptable rehabilitation was probable with an unknown degree of human intervention to avoid problems such as erosion. The committee does not doubt that the unique and stunning features of the original Lake Pedder are still intact under the water and that if the waters of the new lake were drained they would re-emerge as a fully functioning, integrated landscape. However, at present, there is simply not sufficient technical information available for such an undertaking to proceed. A great many questions remain unanswered about the risks and costs that might be involved in the draining process and in successfully rehabilitating an enormous tract of land that has been submerged for 23 years. Significant costs could be involved in breaching or installing a spillway on one of the dams as well as in providing new infrastructure. There would be a marginal reduction in the capacity of the hydro-electric system, although with current demand the loss could be accommodated. I share the disappointment of those who loved and lost the original lake and. believe that the decision to flood was an appalling mistake. It was clear from the evidence of those who had visited the lake that its aesthetic and spiritual pull is still strongly felt. I personally do not doubt that if a restoration project on such a scale as this were undertaken it would attract enormous interest worldwide. However, the element of risk could have serious financial implications for the government since, once the process had begun, the commitment would be irrevocable. At present, the proposal is opposed by both the government and the opposition parties in Tasmania. So it would have no real prospect of proceeding in the foreseeable future. There are many more compelling and urgent environmental priorities. It would be inappropriate to allocate Commonwealth resources to further development of the Lake Pedder proposal. We must give the highest priority to urgent national tasks, such as establishing a nationwide system of protected areas in which a high proportion of the nation's ecological and biological diversity is represented. Many other urgent environmental problems were identified to the committee. We would not be acting responsibly if we recommended diverting resources from tasks such as these. Lake Pedder is, for the time being at least, safe under the waters of the impoundment, and its memory is alive in the hearts of its admirers. Given the interest that the inquiry has generated, particularly in Tasmania, the committee hurried to prepare this report so that we could present it to the parliament before it rises for the winter recess. I am grateful that, despite their differences in attitude and orientation, members of the committee were willing to make a concerted effort to reach an agreed conclusion. I would like to warmly praise the efficient organisation of the inquiry by Ian Dundas, Sue Irvine and Marlene Lyons and to recognise the crucial importance of their effective and lucid drafting, which provided an outstanding basis for the committee's final consideration of the report. I commend the report to the House.",11
4,Mr LLOYD,COMMITTEES,"I commend the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), for the calm and fair way in which he chaired the committee, which at times was a quite difficult and controversial one. I also commend the staff-Ian Dundas, Sue Irvine and Marlene Lyons--on their work. I recall that there were 171 submissions and 60 witnesses. There was a time constraint, as the honourable member has referred to. It is important that the report be released now before the winter recess. All members of the committee, particularly the secretariat staff, have worked well to achieve that goal. I commend all those involved with the report. Two fundamental facts have to be kept in mind when one is considering this proposal. The first of those is that the original Lake Pedder was only 10 square kilometres, including the dunes. The enlarged Lake Pedder is 242 square kilometres, and the question of the restoration of the original lake is not an issue. It is the other 230 square kilometres that is the issue with regard to restoration. Secondly, this area became part of the World Heritage listings in 1982, which was 10 years after the original Lake Pedder was flooded. That World Heritage listing was further strengthened in 1989. So the question of World Heritage listing is also not an issue. The committee recommendation. is quite definite. That recommendation is not only to not proceed but also to not provide any funds for any further studies. Even amongst environmentalists such .studies have a low priority. There are far more important things to be done with the environment in Australia, or about which to even provide finance for consideration, than become involved in the case of Lake Pedder. I agree with the chairman's comments in the preface of the report where he says that it is important that we have a conclusion to avoid the reopening of the subject for a long time. I believe this committee's report is quite clear and definite in that regard. It is quite clear that there should not be any reopening of this matter for a long time. However, I do disagree with some of his other comments-and he has the right to make those comments as chairman-in the preface where he says that it is with regret that we have had to come to that conclusion. I have no regrets at all as a member of the committee. I also disagree with comments he made in a press release when he said that it was an appalling mistake that the original Lake Pedder was flooded. I do not believe it was an appalling mistake. My regret is that the inquiry itself took place. I acknowledge that I did support the inquiry because I believed the situation was such that it had to occur. But what that inquiry has done is reopen some old wounds in Tasmania. It has created a divisive situation at a time of economic difficulty in Tasmania. It has frightened potential investment by creating doubt over one of Tasmania's major assets-that is, environmentally friendly hydro-electric power. I disagree with the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth)when he says in his dissenting report that we spend too much time on economic cost, but I acknowledge the sincerity of the member. I believe we did not spend enough time on economic cost, particularly the broader element of the total cost to the Tasmanian economy of any draining of Lake Pedder. In the narrowest context, we considered the cost of draining and trying to restore the 230 square kilometres which are presently flooded-that is, those 230 square kilometres of button grass plains. The report indicates the uncertainties of success and potential costs.",12
5,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Fraser wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,13
6,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,13
7,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Mr L1oyd- Mr Speaker, can I draw your attention to the time clock .. The time clock went back to 10 minutes and I, therefore, thought I had that time available to me.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Regrettably, as the blue suggests, the total time allocated for the presentation of the statement-that is, allocated by the Selection Committee""-was 10 minutes. Might I suggest that there has possibly been a breakdown in liaison between both sides in allocating that time more equitably. Mr L1oyd-I have no argument with the chairman.",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"That is the circumstance. Of course, when each person gets up to speak, under the standing orders the amount of time that you do have to make a contribution is 10 minutes. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report",13
10,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Standing Committee, I present the committee's report entitled In confidenceReport of the inquiry into the protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth, together with the summary and recommendations, the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
11,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to table the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry into the adequacy of protection of confidential personal and commercial information held by the Commonwealth government and its agencies. The committee's inquiry found that the handling of confidential third party information, both personal and commercial, is exercised with varying degrees of efficiency across different agencies. Those agencies which hold the most sensitive confidential information tend to have better developed systems forits protection. In general, however, the committee found that the protections afforded to such information are neither comprehensive nor reliable. The roles of the agency head and senior managers in the protection of third party information were closely considered by the committee. The committee made several recommendations which will give the group more express responsibility for implementing and promoting privacy and related security protections within an agency. In particular, the senior managers of Commonwealth agencies must do more to foster and nurture a privacy culture. It is disappointing to see that, more than six years after the commencement of the Privacy Act, incidents are, reported on a regular basis that are indicative of a signifistandards. cant breach of privacy principles. The committee also considered the application of the criminal law in relation to Commonwealth officials who wrongly disclose third party information as well as persons who procure and deal in the wrongful disclosure of such information- The committee recommends that unauthorised dealings in third party information should be prohibited at every point on the distribution chain by general offence provisions in the Crimes Act. 'Unauthorised dealings' include at least the following conduct: unauthorised access; unauthorised use, including disclosing and recording; procuring or soliciting; offering to supply; and publishing. General offence provisions avoid the situation where officers disclosing and persons soliciting information obtained under one enactment may face prosecution, while officers who disclose and persons soliciting information obtained under a different enactment may not be subject to criminal sanctions at all. Location in the Crimes Act indicates the seriousness with which the offences are viewed and contributes to community perception of the gravity of the offence. It is to be hoped that this perception may act as a greater deterrent to unauthorised dealings. in confidential third party information .and may further reinforce the development of a privacy culture. Finally, the need for anatiorial privacy code was addressed in the report, and thecoinmittee recommended that a national privacy code should be established. A national code would provide a consistent approach to privacy principles. Consistent application of these principles is important to individuals in their dealings with both the private and public sectors. There are also advantages to the private sector in having consistent standards for the protection of confIdential information rather than several different s-ts of rules. The privatisation of Commonwealth agencies has had the result that those instrumentalities are no longer subject to the Privacy Act. Telecom is also no longer subj-ct to the Privacy Act. It would be desirable for all Commonwealth agencies to be subject to consistent privacy I thank members of the committee and the secretariat staff, in particular Judy Middlebrook, Claressa Surtees, Kelly Williams and Di Singleton for their support and hard work in completing this inquiry. I commend the report to the parliament.",13
12,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Industry, Science and Technology Committee Report",14
13,Mrs EASSON,COMMITTEES,"n behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I present the committee's report entitled Olympics 2000 ... and the winner is?, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",14
14,Mrs EASSON,COMMITTEES,"It is with pleasure that I table on behalf of the industry, science and technology committee its report entitled Olympics 2000 ... and the winner is? This is a report of the committee's inquiry jnto the implications for industry arising out of the year 2000 Olympic Games. The staging of the 2000 Olympic Games presents Australia with a magnificent opportunity to display its prowess across the spectrum of industry to the largest international audience in history. I give special thanks to the members of the committee and also to the secretariat, especially Paul MCMahon, Brendhan Egan, Frances Wilson and Mr Justin Winton. . In relation to strategic opportunities, preparing and staging the games will add over $7 billion to Australia's GDP over the next decade. Clearly, the Olympic Games will have a positive impact on Australia's economy and there will be opportunities across the spectrum of Australian industry. The tourism industry, which is already experiencing tremendous growth, has a major opportunity to benefit from the Sydney Olympic Games. The Olympics will be a significant tourism event. Government action could, however, help in the following areas: additional funds for a marketing campaign based around the games, detailed research to be undertaken into the likely impact of the Olympics on Australian tourism and, to assist the meetings and exhibition industries, the development of multipurpose venues should be investigated. At the 2000 games Australia will judged not only in a sporting context but also on the construction of venues and other infrastructure. There is a major challenge but also a great opportunity in the games construction program. There is considerable potential for new technology to be developed and promoted in association with the Olympic Games. This is one of the great benefits of winning the right to host the games. Ultimately, however, the decision to proceed with new technology for developments associated with the games must be balanced against budgetary constraints. A key feature of the Sydney Olympic bid was the adoption of environmental guidelines. If the environmental guidelines are successfully implemented, opportunities will be created for Australian industry to be at the forefront of meeting a rapidly expanding world demand for environmental goods and services. Commonwealth monitoring of adherence to the games' environmental guidelines is recommended by the committee to provide an independent public assessment of theirimplementation. Australia's sporting capabilities are recognised around the world. In our own region there is growing interest in sports development. We have expertise in sporting technology, which is a highly marketable commodity in the Asia-Pacific area. The awarding of the 2000 Olympic Gaines to Sydney offers opportunities for significantly improving links with the Asia-Pacific region in sport and, through these links, opportunities for improved commercial, social and economic relations. The committee believes that existing efforts to build export markets for sporting goods and services should be given a higher priority by the Commonwealth government in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games. A number of submissions to the committee commented on Olympic Games merchandising and the strong feeling in the community that games related merchandise should be Australian made. The committee believes that in the long term the high visibility of Australian made products at the Sydney Olympics could have a considerable positive effect on Australia's manufacturing image overseas. However, legislating a mandatory Australian made regime may create problems when necessary items are not produced here and could cause difficulties with the Olympic 'top' sponsorship arrangements. Such legislation would also have revenue implications for SOCOG and could result in higher prices. A preferable alternative would be for SOCOG to provide interested parties with access to a list of companies and individuals given licences to use Sydney Olympic Games symbols and terminology. To help maintain commitment to Australian industry, the committee has recommended that the level of Australian industry involvement in the Sydney Olympic Games should be documented and that information should be made available to the New South Wales parliament. Initiatives of the New South Wales government such as the Olympic Business Information Service and a number of seminars and conferences on the Olympic Games have helped to improve industry's access to information on the Sydney Olympics. The committee believes, however, that more should be done. There is considerable potential in the area with recent government initiatives in the area of electronic commerce and the provision of information on industry support programs in electronic form. Commonwealth initiatives such as Bizhelp, if linked with the New South Wales government's OBIS and ideally an electronic commerce system, would provide industry with better access to information on the Olympic Games and at the same time information on any relevant government· assistance programs. Olympic Games one-stop shops across Australia, operating from existing information services offices and utilising on-line information, are also recommended. The committee believes that industry has a right to expect that all levels of government will be working together to maximise the opportunities from the Olympic Games. The promotion of ideas and discussions with and within industry, as well as a coordinated response to Olympic Games opportunities, will be facilitated by the establishment by the New South Wales government of the Olympic Business Roundtable. The committee is keen to see that this body truly has a national focus. The inclusion in its membership of the Isonet representative and more business people of national significance, with some coming from outside Sydney, would also be of assistance in this regard. In relation to the application of procurement policy, the committee believes that the New South Wales government initiatives to maximise Australian industry involvement in the Olympic Games are more than adequate. The only major practical improvements would be the extension of electronic commerce services; the inclusion of a statement on small to medium enterprises in the guidelines for local industry participation and plans; and the adoption of two-envelope tendering procedures, which include a separate envelope for industry development proposals associated with a tender. In conclusion, the committee believes that if the Olympic organisers, the state governments and the Commonwealth government can cooperate to provide industry with coordination, information, a forum for the promotion and discussion of ideas and Olympic issues, and a fair procurement regime, Australian industry can gain considerable benefit from the Olympic Games.",14
15,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"Bendigo) (12.56. p.m.}---I am pleased to support the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) in the tabling of this report. I also thought that the document, Olympics 2000 . .. and the winner is?, was a very attractive document. There will be many winners as a result of the Olympics 2000 in Sydney such as tourism, broadcasting, sporting goods manufacturers, oompetitors and industries. Industry as a whole will benefit as a result of the flow-on effects of the implementation and the conduct of the Olympics in Sydney. The construction industry already has received a significant boost in the Sydney area. The committee did inspect the facilities and I must commend Australian industry for the magnificent swimming complex, which we visited. If that is a sample of the quality of the product that is to be built, I congratulate all in the Australian construction industry for a job well done. The major beneficiaries of the Olympics 2000 will be the people of Australia. The flow-on effects of the publicity and the tourism campaign, which will be launched overseas following the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, will bring tourists to Australia for many years to come after the Olympics have been held in Sydney. The ultimate aim of the Olympics is to maximise the tourism benefit and all the other industry flow-on effects that should be forthcoming as a result of a successful Olympics 2000. One of the recommendations which the committee has put forward is that an international sports and industry trade fair be conducted in a capital city in Australia in 1999. I believe that this will be the opportunity for Australian industries and sporting goods manufacturers to show their capacity and expertise in producing products which can be used throughout the world. I expect that will attract a great deal of attention in the lead-up to the Olympics in Sydney. It also will highlight the development of the skills of Australian people, particularly in the manufacture of product, and their sporting expertise will be well visible through the lead-up to the Olympic Games. I join with the member for Lowe in complimenting the staff for their contribution to this report and the fine work they all did in making this a very worthwhile document, one which includes a number of very good recommendations to industry to participate in the lead-up to, and also· in the conduct of, the games. So many new technologies will come into play in the lead-up to the games with the rapid development of broadcasting technology. Australia will be able, and innovative enough, to capitalise on all of the advances in broadcasting technology and bring them to their fulfilment during the conduct of the Sydney Olympics. I believe this document has gone a long way towards alerting industry to the magnificent opportunities available.",16
16,Mrs EASSON,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Delegation to the third annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, Acapulco, and a report of bilateral visits to Chile and Barbados",17
17,Mr DUNCAN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the third annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Acapulco, Mexico in January 1995 and a report on the bilateral visits to Chile and Barbados in January 1995. In January 1995, a four-member parliamentary delegation attended the third annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, the APPF, in Acapulco, Mexico, and made bilateral visits to Chile and Barbados as official guests of those countries' parliaments. The report I have just tabled brings together the outcom.es of the Acapulco meeting and records the delegation's impressions gained during its visits to Chile and Barbados. I should say at the outset that I am grateful to the other members of the delegation-the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who served with distinction as deputy leader; the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth); and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss )-for their contributions to the success of the delegation. I do not think a delegation could have left these shores and served in a more cohesive and effective way than our delegation. I think that, across the parliament, it was a real example of the way that good work can be done in a constructive and effective fashion. I think Australia was exceedingly represented in a voluntary capacity by three of our partners-my wife Julie, Anne Chynoweth and Lyn Truss. I would particularly like to extend my sincere thanks to them for the work that they undertook. I also want to say in passing how much I appreciated the fact that my four-year-old daughter was prepared to do without her mother and father. Georgia went for a holiday to her grandparents in Hobart while we were away. The delegation wishes to express its appreciation to those who hosted its bilateral visits: the presiding officers of the National Congress of Chile and the presiding officers of the Parliament of Barbados. In both countries, the delegation was impressed by the warmth of the hospitality extended and was particularly grateful for the courtesies shown to the accompanying spouses. The delegation was well prepared prior to departure and is very grateful for the support provided by officers of the Parliamentary Relations Office, the Parliamentary Library, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Austrade and AusAID. On arrival in both Chile and Barbados, outstanding support was provided by staff of the Australian missions, capably led by Mr Matthew Peek and Mr Robert Whitty respectively. In both countries, excellent programs were put together to meet the delegation's objectives. In Acapulco, the delegation was supported well by officers from the Australian embassy in Mexico and was particularly grateful for the excellent assistance of Ms Rebecca Weisser and Mr Todd Mercer. Without their help, the significant changes achieved in the APPF's operating procedures would not have been possible. Mr Speaker, time precludes a detailed survey of the issues raised in the delegation's report. In brief, however, the delegation is optimistic for the future of the APPF, particularly following the organisational reforms pushed through so energetically in the executive committee by you. Certain administrative difficulties remain to be overcome in the conduct of the annual meeting, and I understand that this parliament is assisting in establishing conference procedures to overcome these. The delegation recommends that participation by an Australian delegation in the APPF meetings be a permanent inclusion in the annual schedule of outgoing parliamentary delegations. The delegation also recommends that some form of continuity in participation be established to enable maximum benefit to be gained from personal contacts made on such occasions. I stress that each member of the delegation felt-I am sure this is widely believed across the parliament-that going in cold to such international meetings is not nearly as effective an approach as going in under circumstances where you know many of the players and you are able to personally interrelate with many of the people there. The delegation strongly recommends to the parliament that we should find a method of having some degree of continuity in our delegation to the APPF. I tum to the bilateral visits. The report chronicles in some detail the nature and extent of discussions held in both countries. As a general comment to cover both bilateral relationships, the delegation came to query the extent to which Australian business is sufficiently energetic, enterprising and enthusiastic in opening and pursuing trade opportunities through Chile to the wider South American market and through Barbados to the wider Caribbean community. In both potential markets, the key issue is transportation. In the case of Chile, the delegation makes the strong recommendation that urgent action should be taken by the government to conclude air services negotiations' as soon ,as possible. In the delegation's view, the imminent float of Qantas should no longer be used to screen inaction. They are strong words,but each member of the delegation believes strongly that Australia has been dragging its feet to some extent in this matter and that we should get on with the job. It is in our national interest to make sure that the communications across the South Pacific to Latin America should be greatly improved compared with what exists at present. The idea that we had to go via North America to get there is simply ludicrous in this day and age. Something has to be done about that urgently. Mr Connolly-It is very expensive.",17
18,Mr DUNCAN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"..:..it is very expensive to get there. The report expresses the delegation's appreciation to all those involved in the visits. I conclude by reiterating our thanks to our hosts for the warmth of the hospitality extended, and I commend the report to the House;",18
19,Mr JULL,DELEGATION REPORTS,"May I also add my endorsement to the speech that has just been given by the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan). I thank him very much for the manner in which he led the delegation to Mexico, Barbados and Chile. I agree with him in that I, too, thought it was one of the most successful delegations in which I have been involved. May I also add my thanks-and I am sure the thanks of members of the delegation-to the secretary of the delegation, Peter Gibson, who did an absolutely magnificent job. It is one of those jobs that can be very difficult indeed, and he undertook it cheerfully and willingly. He really did tremendous work for us all. The lead that Australia took in its approach to the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Acapulco should be commented on a little further. A very large section of the report is devoted to what happened. We should endorse the remarks of the member for Makin in paying tribute to the Speaker. There is no doubt that, without the reforms that the APPF underwent at this session, there would have been some doubt as to the viability of it in the future. Australia led the way there; the Speaker led the way. It was very much the initiative of the Australian delegation and the hard work that was done that made this conference the success that I believe it was. Mr Duncan-Including the clerk.",18
20,Mr JULL,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I was just going to say that the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Barlin, was very much involved in that as well. But the fact that Australia was prepared to submit papers and to undertake some intelligent discussion on some of these matters that were of very great significance to the people of the Asia-Pacific rim did contribute to that success. It is a lead that I think will followed by many other nations in conferences to come. The trip to Barbados and Chile was interesting and opened up some enormous opportunities for Australians. Australia is already earning a good reputation in the mining industry of· Chile. There are tremendous opportunities in the communications industry and even the wine industry. In Barbados, although trade is not great at the moment, there are some very close Commonwealth ties and sporting ties. We all benefited very much from our activities there. I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Makin regarding air links between Australia and South America. Negotiations have been continuing for more than a decade and nothing has happened. I am upset that the New Zealanders have concluded an arrangement with Chile and it appears that Australia might have been beaten to. that market. The opportunities for business in South America are absolutely enormous jf we can get the air links right. As a matter .or urgency the government to government arrangements and the airline to airline agreements should be concluded as soon as possible.",19
21,Mr TRUSS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I compliment all those who took part in what was a very rewarding and very successful visit to Chile and Barbados and a very successful conference in Acapulco. To my mind, the constant theme of our .visit to Chile was the tremendous can-do approach of the Chilean government. There has been a slowness in Australia to acknowledge the progress that has occurred in South America. We can no longer consider South America to be part of the Third World. It is a tremendously productive area which offers the threat and the challenge of being a major competitor to Australia in so many areas of our export expertise. Chile has the biggest copper mine in the world and is about to get a bigger one. Chile's attitude towards developments of this type is very positive indeed. The government of Chile has the view that if there is a way to achieve these sorts of things it will be find it. South American countries are very much low tax countries and th- are· very proud of their low tax regime. I will nev.er forget the telecommunicatioris minister who was telling us with great enthusiasm about the seven telephone companies operating in Chile-a country with a similar population to that of Australia. When he was asked whether any tax was being placed upon these telecommunications companies he said, 'No. We don't need any more tax revenue. The government has plenty of spare money. We burn'he mentioned a figure; I forget how much it was-'cash each year.' This comes from a country with no social security system. Obviously the priorities are very different from ours. Australian companies operating in Chile are very well thought of. BHP and Mount Isa Mines are considered to be leaders in Chile and are warmly welcomed. Australians have a fond place in the minds of Chileans. The same must be said of Barbados. It seems that cricket absolutely dominates every conversation, particularly at a time when an Australian tour was approaching. The people of Barbados were never quite sure whether they were afraid of Shane Warne or whether the West Indies were going to belt him all around the island. They were eagerly looking forward to the contest. There is great warmth between Barbados and Australia. When we extended an invitation to the Barbados parliament to reciprocate our visit, the rest of our time was spent with bids being put in by everyone we met to be a part of the delegation. We are eagerly looking forward to their return visit to Australia. The hospitality extended by that small country was magnificent. It is a beautiful land in a beautiful part of the world. Barbados made a wonderful impression on us all. I note that the next meeting Of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum is scheduled for Thailand in January. Depending upon the election timetable in Australia it might be regarded as an inconvenient time for Australian members of parliament to attend. No matter how difficult it may be, Australia must make sure that it is well represented at that conference. As previous speakers have mentioned, there were legitimate doubts about whether the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum was going to mature. In Acapulco it showed very good signs of becoming a very worthwhile international forum. It is important that what was achieved in Acapulco is built upon in Thailand. Australia's participation in Thailand with a high level delegation is particularly important. We can entrench the future of that association if there is another successful conference in Thailand. Australia has a particular obligation to ensure that that happens. I found it a very enlightening visit. I would like to compliment the honourable member for Makin and his wife for the wonderful leadership that they provided. It was a very - njoyable experience as well as one from which we all learnt a great deal. PUBLIC SERVICE (ABOLITION OF COMPULSORY RETIREMENT AGE) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Connolly.",19
22,Mr CONNOLLY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The Public Service (Abolition of Compulsory Retirement Age) Amendment Bill 1995 will ensure that age alone is not a bar to a person joining the Public Service and to a person continuing to be employed in the Public Service. Currently, the Public Service Act imposes a mandatory retiring age of 65 with a limited, and not widely known, provision for staff beyond that age to be able to continue working at the secretary's discretion. The· act also provides for an option to retire at an earlier age. Finally, the act provides a bar to certain appointments of persons aged over 65 for a period extending beyond that age. The amendments to the act contained in this bill cover the major areas of public sector employment, including amendments to the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act and amendments to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act. There are some necessary exemptions, Following an amendment to the constitution in 1977, the judiciary must retire on reaching 70 years of age. The armed services and the police forces will also be exempt. In 1992, I introduced a similar bill into this parliament which the government refused to give. a second reading. I am introducing this bill because the government still, despite its many undertakings to the contrary, has not addressed the problem of employment related age discrimination. Employment related age discrimination pervades the labour market of Australia. Its existence is evident both in the continued use of mandatory retirement ages, and in the age based stereotypes which are used as an inappropriate proxy for assessment criteria such as capacity, performance and merit. These generalisations about older people's abilities, drive and enthusiasm militate against older people continuing in and gaining employment which undermines their right to equality of opportunity in our society. The statistics reveal that middle aged people on average face a longer duration of unemployment than do their younger counterparts. According to the February ABS survey, job seekers in the 35 to 54 age group are unemployed for an average duration of 75.1 weeks, compared with an average duration of 21.7 weeks for those aged 15 to 19. It is no surprise therefore, that mature age people represent more than 50 per cent of discouraged job seekers. With the exception of Tasmania, all of the states and territories have enacted, or are taking steps to enact, some form of age discrimination legislation. The Commonwealth government has not followed suit. In a media release dated 30 September 1990, the then Minister for Social Security gave an undertakdeserve ing to remove age discrimination from all existing federal legislation. In 1992, the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, Expectations of life: Increasing the options for the century, gave in-principle support to ending age discrimination. In 1993, during a parliamentary debate on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, Senator MCMullan stated: Discrimination on the grounds of age ... should be treated the same as discrimination on the grounds of race, colour or sex . . . In 1993, the Attorney-General, through Senator Bolkus, indicated that 'the Attorney General's Department is working towards the development of a comprehensive Commonwealth age discrimination policy' and that the department would release a discussion paper 'on the issues involved earlier next year'that is, 1994. Despite these commitments, the government has continued to discriminate against its own employees. None of the promises have been acted on and the discussion paper still has not been released. Rather than eliminating age discrimination, the Commonwealth government has taken advantage of its unique status as an employer to avoid the anti-age discrimination provisions it has enacted for everybody else. The Industrial Reform Act 1993 provides that an employer must not terminate an employee's contract on account of a number of variables, including age. However, the Commonwealth government has successfully argued before Industrial Relations Court that sections 76J and 76V of the Public Service Act, which provide that its employees may be compulSydney sorily retired at age 65, are not affected the reform act. This stance contradicts the government's international treaty obligations, particularly under the International Labour Organisation's Discrimination (Employment and Occupancy) Convention 1958, which require the removal of age discrimination. Consequently, I urge this parliament to once again consider this matter most seriously. It affects a growing percentage of the Australian population who better from this government.

24,Mr HOWARD,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The purpose of the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation) Amendment Bill 1995 is to entrench in legislation the existing curfew which applies to Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. This bill has been brought forward by me not only on behalf of the coalition but also on behalf of many thousands of residents in suburbs such as Hunters Hill, Woolwich, North Ryde and Boronia Park, and also in suburbs closer to Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport, whose lives have been very directly affected by the unfair, discriminatory and punitive way in which the government has administered policy concerning Sydney airport since the opening of the third runway. In fact, its policy has ruined the lives of thousands of Sydney residents. . I for one, as the member for Bennelong, have been inundated with letters, phone calls the and personal visits from people expressing 73C, their despair about the government's mismanagement of the airport issue. Other members, on both sides of the House, by have also received a huge number of complaints. The people of Sydney are extremely angry with the federal government's handling of this issue. They know that they were misled about the noise levels that would be associated with the opening of the parallel runway. According to the official noise contour map, my electorate of Bennelong should be virtually unaffected by aircraft noise, but my constituents in Hunters Hill would say that the map is absolutely wrong, and they would be justified in their complaints. The people of Sydney know that the government is not taking any real action to alleviate the noise which is adversely affecting their enjoyment of life. In my argument, and in the argument of many thousands of people within the electorate of Bennelong, the only fair solution to the Sydney airport issue in the short to medium term is to reopen the east-west runway, which would distribute the noise more equitably. I have yet to find a convincing argument from the government as to why the east-west runway should not be opened. One is driven to the conclusion that the closure of the eastorder west runway was designed to discriminate in favour of the constituents represented by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and to discriminate against constituents-against Australians-represented by me in areas such as Hunters Hill, Gladesville and North Ryde, and against people living in other parts of the northern part of Sydney represented by members of the Liberal Party. The Minister for Transport likes· to claim that the runway cannot be re-opened on safety grounds. His claim is palpable nonsense; and he knows it. It operated safely for over 30 years. La Guardia, Chicago and Los Angeles International all use crossing runways. The Minister for Transport is refusing to re-open the runway for his own partisan political purposes. The people of Sydney do not trust the federal government's promises on Sydney airport any more, and they are particularly fearful about the government's decision to lease the airport. They know the government's record. They are rightly concerned that the Minister for Transport may loosen the curfew to generate a higher return from the leasing of the airport. The Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation) Amendment Bill, which I have just presented, would entrench the curfew in an act of parliament. It would make it the law of Australia, a law that could not be altered, except by another act of the parliament. The text of the bill is straightforward. It would amend the Air Navigation Act 1920 to add a new part covering the curfew. It would require the Minister for Transport to consult widely before any attempts were made to alter the curfew. Mr Speaker, I ask a very simple question of the Minister for Transport: if the government is serious in its intention to ensure that the curfew will be maintained, irrespective of any leasing or other privatisation arrangements concerning Kingsford Smith airport, then it can support the bill. If the government does not support the private members bill that I have put forward today, people in my electorate and elsewhere will be led to the conclusion that the government does intend to relax the curfew, that it will bow to pressure into obtain a higher return on the leasing of the airport and that it will otherwise deal in a deceitful and dishonourable fashion with the people of my electorate and the people of areas such as Leichhardt and Marrickville who are also very. severely affected by the government's mishandling of Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. It is a fair measure, and I commend it very warmly to the House. Bill read a first time.",21

26,Mr CLEARY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations (Prevention of Child Labour) Bill 1995 will amend the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to include the prohibition of the importation of goods made by child labour. The bill defines a 'child' as being a person under 15 years of age and is totally consistent with our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child-a convention we ratified in December 1990. Article 32 of the convention calls on states parties to protect children from economic exploitation. Article 34, from which emanated the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 --an act passed unanimously by this parliament-alls on states parties to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation .. It would seem inconsistent for Australia to on the one hand pass legislation to protect children in another country from sexual exploitation by Australians yet, on the other hand, to resile from legislation designed to protect foreign ,children from economic exploitation by Australian consumers. Some would claim that we have no right to institute social clauses into trade arrangements. However, it has always been a tenet of the labour movement that workers in one country should support the rights of workers in another. To outlaw the use of child labour is not, as some claim, an act of xenophobia or an attack on the developing world, but an act of international worker solidarity. As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and I discovered on a delegation to the subcontinent, local trade unionists are totally opposed to the use of child labour. It was the view of Bangladeshi and Indian trade unionists that child labour produced poverty, and that the argument that abolishing child labour would produce poverty was simply a mechanism for weakening the resolve of those opposed to the exploitation of workers. This bill is not draconian or blindly arbitrary. It provides the minister, in consultation with a child labour advisory panel, with discretionary powers in relation to the importation of goods produced by children. It is now generally understood that the exploitation of child labour is becoming a serious problem. It is estimated that globally 80,000 children a day are forced into· work and that in India alone five million children are held as indentured labourers. It is also true that there are some who fulminate against the use of child labour yet turn a blind eye to the denial of the rights of adult workers or the banning of trade unions. Most of us are aware of some of the horrific things that have happened to trade unionists in Indonesia and elsewhere. The banning of the importation of goods made by child labour would be a step towards the implementation of other social clauses in trade arrangements under the World Trade Organisation. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) consistently argues that there is a direct relationship between lack of formal training and education and an Australian worker's likelihood of being unemployed. As child labour is one of the greatest obstacles to schooling and poten.,. tial to earn a future income; all on the government side should recommend its abolition. As far as the coalition is concerned I would have thought that, given the emotional position taken by a number of members to the sexual. exploitation of children, opposition to the economic exploitation of children would be a fait accompli. In the. United States tpe introduction of a child labour deterrence act by Senator Tom Harkin was so influential that importers took the telling step of labelling carpets as 'child labour free'. As I mentioned on 19 September 1994 in a speech on this issue, in India, Pakistan and Nepal a labelling system is being introduced which identifies carpets not made by child labour. As one observer pointed out, 'the main impetus for change comes from implicit threats of import bans from import countries' . The pursuit of free market policies without acknowledgment of their effect on workers worldwide and attention to the pursuit of cheap labour that accompanies globalism is regrettable. The prohibition of the importing of goods made by child labour is a step in the right direction. It reinforces the notion that the social relations of production are something that all countries have a stake in if they are truly international and outward looking. To admonish the old protectionists and derisively describe them as inward looking whilst at the same time resile from legislation aimed at protecting workers internationally is sheer hypocrisy. The exploitation of child labour occurs in the kind of deregulated market which most government members claim a coalition government would institute in Australia. We well remember the angst created when the coalition proposed a youth wage as part of its 1993 election campaign. As I understand it, the government and the coalition, whatever their real position on market deregulation, are opposed to the exploitation of children. This bill gives the parliament a chance to put the words into action and protect 'battlers' - the 'little battlers' - in foreign lands. Bill read a first time.",22

28,Mr LANGMORE,PEACEKEEPING AND FOREIGN AID,"I move: That this House: (1) expresses its serious. concern about US Congressional proposals to severely cut back on US financial and operational involvement in UN peacekeeping and development and on foreign aid; and (2) urges Congress to recognise the reality of growing global interdependence by approving sufficient increased financial resources to enable effective multilateral peacekeeping and economic and social development assistance for impoverished countries. For the whole of 1994 and early 1995 I ha.d the great privilege of being the alternate leader of the Australian delegation involved in the preparatory committees for the world summit for social development. At those preparatory committee meetings, which were attended by most members of the UN and which lasted for a couple of weeks each, the Australian delegation and the United States delegation worked together very cooperatively. We had considerable agreement in the goal of reducing poverty, increasing employment and improving social solidarity. We agreed, too, on some of the detail about setting targets for the reduction of poverty and for the provision of improved services for people in impoverished countries. The US spoke very effectively in favour of gender equity and in quite practical terms. We agreed about the importance of giving high priority to Africa, where much of global poverty occurs. We were in agreement about the goal of increasing employment growth so that there is work for all. Those agreements demonstrated very effective cooperation in the UN context about the need for interdependent approaches to addressing global problems. We do not need to be reminded, 1 hope, that the extent of global interdependency is now very high-not only in the trade and investment areas but also very clearly in the last few years in financial markets, in communication and in the environment, because what one country does has a direct impact on the environmental conditions in another. It is therefore very sad indeed to see the proposals that are now being presented to the US Congress for reductions in funding for the UN and for reductions in US foreign aid, including its contributions to the international development banks. It is a fact that what has been proposed are devastating cuts. The Republican majority is proposing to reduce overseas aid by $2.2 billion, compared with the Clinton administration's request for 1996. They are proposing to abolish the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. That really is an expression of a much more isolationist stance within the Congress-at exactly the time when one would expect a greater recognition of the need for integration. We live in a world which is much more interdependent than' ever before in human history. You would expect therefore that all countries, particularly global leaders like the US, would be asking: how can we address global problems through the international fora as cooperatively as possible so as to ensure a concerted attempt to deal with them? One tragedy is that the US is already severely in arrears to the United Nations; in fact, it is the biggest debtor. At present, it owes about $700 million for peacekeeping. It owesincluding its regular budget contributions, on which it is also in arrears-$1.2 billion in a total UN budget of around $4 billion or $5 billion. This is a huge deficit that the United States is causing. It is double the arrears of Russia, which owes $630 million. Some other countries are in arrears, but their arrears are minor in comparison. As well as that, it is not unfair to say that the US is very miserly in its contribution of overseas aid. In 1993 the US contributed 0.15 per cent of its GNP to overseas development assistance. Australia contributed 0.35 per cent, but even that is only half of the UN target 0.7 per cent. Some cO\lntries exceeded the target. In 1983 the Netherlands-which is country comparable with Australiakeeping contributed 0.82 per cent. Canada, another country comparable with Australia, contrirole buted 0.45 per cent; Germany contributed 0.37 per cent; and. even Japan contributed 0.26 per cent The US contributed only 0.15, well under half that of Australia and well under a quarter of the agreed UN targethave which was reiterated at the· social summit Copenhagen. We have a situation where, on top of already severely contracted overseas aid, further sharp cuts are being proposed. The same sort of approach is being adopted in the United Nations, with the Republican majority apparently arguing that US support for peacekeeping should be greatly reduced. This is quite tragic. Not only is the world more interdependent but, in a post cold war period, there is a growth in turbulence, tainty and the risk of local conflicts explodgreater ing. In many countries there is, certainly, continuation of the growth in poverty, inequity and real hardship. Those problems are, some extent, interrelated and, to some extent, quite separate, but they need to be addressed in a concerted way by the global community. It is very damaging if, in that concerted dri to address those issues, the world's largest and leading country is saying, 'We want pull back.' It also leads to dangerous confusion. What should be the global approach to these issues? Is it appropriate to attempt agreed action address these issues? It was striking to see the G7 meeting in Halifax nine days ago that the G7 countries-the leading seven nations of the world-said in their final communique, 'We call upon member states to meet their financial obligations to Nations.' That is a very direct reprimand from the other six leading industrial countries the US, which is the only country in that Group of Seven which is severely in arrears. As I have already said, it is much more in arrears than any other country. What is tending to happen is that We have of a division of responsibility growing in the UN world, with the US increasing its military a expenditure but massively reducing its peaceand development assistance. It is playing a much more negative and reactive while the European countries, Japan and Australia are contributing in a much more creative and positive way to global affairs So that problems are addressed before they lead to explosive conflict. A number of people been making those kinds of remarks in recently. There are very severe global consequences to the attitude iri the US Congress at present. Fortunately, the US administration remains committed to international cooperation and is demonstrating that by its activities in the UN. It is attempting to do so through· developmental assistance as well, but it will not be able to do so unless Congress agrees. One hopes that this isolationist tendency, therefore, will be much criticised and analysed and that alternatives are presented within the wider US uncercommunity, where I think there is much humanitarian support for developmenta al assistance for poverty reduction. If that does not happen and if this tendency to does not fairly quickly tum round, permanent damage will be done to the global community. Not only will ecoriomic development in impoverished companies be retarded, but ve financial and environmental and other kinds of conflicts will be exacerbated in ways that to could cause long-term harm to the whole world. That would be a tragedy which we, in Australia, would be very opposed to. Australia, I am glad to say, has a strong record of both aid and support for the UN. Therefore, to we can speak with some authority about these at issues in relation to the United States.",24
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PEACEKEEPING AND FOREIGN AID,Is industrial the motion seconded? Mr Ferguson-I second the motion and the United reserve my right to speak.,25
30,Mr TAYLOR,PEACEKEEPING AND FOREIGN AID,"While to I commend the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for putting this important motion to the House-and I have no truck with the general tenor of the message he is attempting to .send-I would say to the member and to this House that we need to look beyond the American Congress. We need to look further than the Republican Party majority and its increasing clashes with the White House· and the Clinton administration on many national security, economic, societal and political issues. To provide a more balanced perspective, this motion needs not only to explore the machinations of Washington DC but also to look objectively further afield to the bureaucratic and organisational confusion and the unrealistic-some might say 'blinkered'-vision that radiates from UN headquarters in New York. In my limited time today I want to concentrate briefly on peacekeeping from the viewpoint both of the US Congress and of the United Nations. There is little doubt thatdespite some notable successes in EI Salvador, Namibia and Cambodia in. recent yearsUN peacekeeping is in crisis. The crisis is both conceptual and practical. In recent years, many principles and practices have been tried, have been tested, have been modified and, in some cases, have dismally failed. There have been repeated difficulties in the control and management of peacekeeping operations, with the distinction between peacekeeping and enforcement activities inevitably blurred. Most recently, UN efforts in Bosnia have exposed the UN to accusa-ions not only of basic weakness but of a failure to protect fundamental human rights and dignity. In the extreme, some peacekeeping operations such as those in Angola have been followed by a resumption of war. Others like Somalia and Rwanda, in response to humanitarian crises, have been painfully and tragically slow, with limited long-term benefits. One thing is very clear: the range of conflicts around the globe far exceeds the UN's capacity to address it. Some states have imposed evasive and confrontationist participatory conditions, while The there have been accusations of bias in some into UN quarters on the method and rationale for activities involvement in some specific crises. Proposals to place forces at the general disposal of the the UN have, failed, and peacekeeping finances . is remain in a mess for a number only ambivalence by the US Congress; as this motion might of itself imply. As Dick mains Thornburgh said, in assessing. the situation from an outside viewpoint for President Bush, setting up a UN peacekeeping operation is aptly called a 'financial bungee jump' of continuous risk and crisis. Although they are moving picture, the most recent figures I have' seen show that UN peacekeeping operations are in arrears by over $US 1 billion, with the largest debtors being the Russians and the United States. The US has long been expected to bear over 30 per cent of the costs and wants that reduced to 25 per cent, and Russia IS also very concerned about the present system, partly because it has to maintain order in its own turbulent federation. By contrast, over 150 states, including Australia, are apportioned for peacekeeping at one-tenth or one-fifth of their regular UN dues. An additional problem is that dues for each peacekeeping operation are collected separately, so each UN member state receives a large number of bills in any given year, sometimes for operations in which the member state may feel it has little at stake. The problem is therefore one not simply for the US Congress to solve; it is a broader challenge for the United Nations. If not corrected, this financial sore will undoubtedly fester until it develops into something that no UN member state would want and will reinforce the views of some that the United Nations is high on self-congratulation but low on substance and on effectiveness. With his 1992 'An Agenda for Peace', 1994 'Agenda for Development' and 1995 'Supplement to Agenda for Peace', Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali has left the UN General Assembly and Security Council in no doubt about the extent of the financial crisis. In 1995 he said in part: failure of Member States to pay their assessed contributions for activities they themselves voted being, makes it impossible to carry out these to the standard expected. It also calls into question the credibility of those who have willed ends but not the means . . . The financial crisis particularly debilitating as regards peace-keeping of reasons, not and peace building. While the Secretary-General's rhetoric restrong, criticism of the UN persists and strengthens in this its 50th anniversary year. Turning to US .domestic politics, two acts of Congress and Presidential Decision Directive 25, PDD25, provide a basis for US participation in UN peace operations. The UN Participation Act 1945 as amended states that a maximum of 1,000 US armed forces personnel can be detailed to the United Nations in non-combat roles to help peacefully resolve disputes. The act also authorises the President to negotiate agreements with the Security Council, subject to the approval of Congress, to provide armed forces to the United Nations acting under chapter 7 to maintain international peace and security. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 limits appropriations for the US assessed contribution for UN peacekeeping to 25 per cent of the operation's cost, as of fiscal year 1996. It further requires the President to consult with the Congress each month on the status of UN peacekeeping operations, provide quarterly and annual reports on peacekeeping, and notify Congress 15 days prior to providing assistance to the United Nations for peacekeeping. PDD25, issued by President Clinton in May 1994, sets US policy regarding US participation in peace operations. It sets forth faCtors the United States will consider beforedeciding to participate in peace operations and states that US troops will not be placed under UN command but may be placed under UN operational control for a prescribed operation. Earlier this year the National Security Revitalization Act, or HR7, was introduced into the House of Representatives and the Peace Powers Act, or S5, was introduced into the Senate of the United States. This legislation, if enacted, would build on the existing policy framework. It would clarify certain reporting requirements, require the President to certify that placing US troops under the command of operational control of a UN command is necessary to protect US security interests and will provide a .credit against US peacekeeping assessment for certain Department of Defense expenditures in support of UN Security Council resolutions. It is HR7 and S5 and their clash with PDD25 in which we. find deep political . differences emerging. On the one hand, the President and Secretary of State Christopher, while conceding that peacekeeping forces could be more effective, see it as vital to advancing US interests, especially in areas where the US may be unable to get directly involved. The US Ambassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright, goes further in suggesting: The isolationist tide must be turned back. There are those on Capitol Hill who would kill peacekeeping. It should not be killed; it should be strengthened. S5 (Dole's bill) is a bad bill. On the other hand, Henry Kissinger, writing in March of this y-ar in his article entitled 'Ready for revitalizing', has very different views. In part, he said: The Clinton team entered office convinced that the Cold War exercise of American power (and even leadership) had often been excessive, if not evil, and it was determined to curb these tendencies by submitting them to the restraints of the international community. He went on to say: The Clinton administration has adopted a more passive stance at the precise moment that it expanded the .military role of the United Nations-a prescription for international paralysis. From my brief observations in Washington and Ne\V York last month,despite the political impasse in US domestic policies, PDD25 has already had a beneficial impact on UN reform efforts. The. Republican push on the Hill is not, as the honourable member suggests, a retreat into isolationism but a pragmatic attempt to match national security and diplomatic interests with the budget realities. Undoubtedly, some political compromises will be necessary . On the UN front, while the very readable 1993 publication Cooperating for peace, the so-called blue book, by our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) may not be the panacea to the. UN's many problems, perhaps some of the senior officia-s in New York might do worse than move it up the from their bottom bookshelves. The motion of the honourable member for Fraser therefore completes one side of. an equation. (Time expired)",25
31,Mr FERGUSON,PEACEKEEPING AND FOREIGN AID,"A few points have been made and some of them are agreed to by both sides of the House. Firstly, I refer to the substantial financial problems of the United Nations. In August 1994 Boutros Boutros-Ghali noted debts of $1.7 billion and said that $1 billion was owed to 75 countries for peacekeeping and $400 million to vendors and suppliers. That should be seen in the context of the devaluation of the US dollar since 1946, which leads to a situation whereby in 1995 in real terms the dollar budget has only increased eight times. If we look at the substantial change in operations and the broad agenda that the United Nations now fulfils, that puts the debt in some context. It is certainly a matter of deep division in US politics. It was stated by New York Democrat Gary Ackerman: What the republicans are trying to do with xenophobic and anti-UN stands, is to steal foreign policy from the President's bailiwick. On the other side of the agenda, Jesse Helms stated: The days are over for other people to solve their problems with American funds and American troops. In a contribution by Dole, he stated: The real choice is whether to allow international organisations to call the shots-as in Somalia or Bosnia-or to make multinational groupings work _ for American interests-as in Operation Desert Storm. I do not think that it really is a matter of trying to simply reform the problems of the United Nations. It is actually a very definite agenda to steal US policy from the presidential bailiwick. The other side of the coin was very succinctly put by Madeleine Albright, the UN representative, when she said: By mobilising the support of other nations and leveraging our resources through alliances in international institutions, we can achieve important objectives without asking our armed forces to bear all the risks or our taxpayers to pay all the bills. What we are seeing in America is a debate as to the degree to which the United Nations follows US foreign policy. In contrast to the Republican view, in recent decades we have seen a range of United States successes through the United Nations. They range from the nuclear non-proliferation work and the United States efforts on human rights around the world, and they encompass the intervention in Haiti-something which the previous Republican administration failed to take any interest in as regards intervention in Panama and Grenada. Yet the United States actually accomplished UN support for that intervention. . Similarly, in regard to Iraq, we have seen the United States, by this leverage that Albright talked about, influence worldopinion. There have been the sanctions on Libya. The United States has a substantial range of foreign policy interests, endorsed by the United Nations. That is the direction in which the current administration believes the United States policy should go. In contrast with the Republicans, we have a very substantial movement away from aid. It is all right to say that this is just a matter of their perhaps having legitimate concerns. There is a very broad agenda-an agenda to cut population policies unless China is given no aid. There is an agenda to expand NATO and to have a 40 per cent aid cut in general. It is very important to note that when there is such a concern about what is wrong-the waste, et cetera-Israel and Egypt will remain exempt in this massive cut in aid. The United States is continuing its pursuit of Star Wars technology. That is being pushed in a very real sense by the Republicans in Congress. There is the issue of any country having the effrontery to continue Cuban economic contacts. There is the attempt to approve US troops for Syria and Egypt. These are all part of a very substantial agenda. It is a very big matter of US debate at the moment. Substantially, I believe that the Republican Party, exploiting a lack of knowledge of the foreign aid commitments of the United States, is attempting to seize that agenda in foreign policy. It is worth noting that, in an article in the New York Times of 30 April 1995,41 per cent of Americans thought that foreign aid was the largest ingredient in the US budget. However, when Americans were asked whether the level should be increased to one per cent-the level is only 0.015 per cent at the moment-48 per cent of Americans thought that one per cent was a reasonable level, 16 per cent said it was way too little and 18 per cent said it was a bit too little. (Time expired)",28
32,Mr HAWKER,PEACEKEEPING AND FOREIGN AID,"On joining this debate, I would like to support the words of my colleague the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). While I support the sentiments put forward by the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), I think it is a bit presumptuous to single out the US in this debate and, at the same time, to not look at some of the problems within the United Nations itself. It is very interesting to note the comments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dr Boutros-Ghali. He was quoted last weekend saying that the United Nations is basically broke and that, unless the United Nations receives financial support from its members, it will have trouble achieving its goals. This is a very serious matter that we should be looking at. As we have already heard today, United Nations members owe the UN in the order of $2.8 billion, of which about $1.9 billion is for peacekeeping purposes. It is also true that the United States owes a great deal-in fact, probably something more than $1 billion-and this we should be pressing them to pay. But my concern is that this motion does seem to ignore the many other countries which owe proportionate amounts. That is the first point. The next point· is that it ignores many of the problems within the United Nations, which were highlighted by an article in the Age today. The article pointed out that there were internal problems-the profligate spending that goes on within the United Nations, the incompetence, the corruption; all sorts of things-that we should be very concerned about and that should be raised in the context of this debate. The UN was even referred to as being easily seen as an 'insatiable bloated monster' . While that may seem a little harsh, because we all know that the United Nations does some very good work, the fact is it still spends millions and millions of dollars treating itself to a lavish lifestyle. I think this issue that we ought to be having a look at, as well as other matters that have been raised in this debate. I think there is a certain amount of cynicism involved when people look at some of the things that are going on within the United Nations. The member for Fraser used terms like 'devastating cuts', 'permanent damage', and 'long-term harm to the whole world'. These are very serious statements. While they have an emotional flavour to them, we have to look at the other side of this whole question and not just single out the United States in this debate. I also noticed with some interest that, while being critical of the United States, the member for Fraser was also critical of his own government when it came to the level of foreign aid. He pointed out that, while the government's policy for some years has been to increase Australia's foreign aid to 0.4 per cent, it cannot even achieve that at the moment. That clearly shows that his own government deserves the criticism that he seems to be handing out to it. These are the sorts of issues that we should be looking at. My colleague the member for Groom pointed out very forcefully some of the good things that have been done under peacekeeping and that the peacekeeping budget has grown dramatically. In 1990 it was $450 million and in 1993-94 it was over $3 billion-a huge increase-and the United States did pay more than $1 billion of this. It is also important to note the debate that is going on in the United States. The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) did go into this in some detail. Both government speakers in this debate have highlighted that there is a definite prejudice amongst them towards the Democrats and that they see this motion, among other things, as an opportunity to attack the Republicans. That is unfortunate because it is really presumptuous for us in this parliament to get ourselves involved in condemning another country's internal politics, albeit that we are. talking about foreign relations matters. Overall, I make the point that it is a bit one sided. While I support the sentiments, I do is an have concerns that the member for Fraser, in putting forward this motion, has been a bit presumptuous to single .out the United States without ralSlng some concerns about the United Nations itself. (Time expired) Mr GmSON (Moreton) (2.02 p.m.)---':""'I congratulate the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on moving this motion. I am sorry that the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) did,not read it. His contribution did not touch on the major purpose of the debate;, that is, looking at the role that the US has in foreign policy and in international relations around the world, not just in the United Nations. This motion is about the crucial role that the United States plays in world leadership. The United States is the richest and most powerful nation on earth. It has a crucial role to play in providing leadership to all the other on earth in the directions in which they should be going. This motion is not about reforming the UN. The Australian government and both sides of this chamber agree that the United Nations does need major reform. The, United States agrees on that as well. We need to get all the members of the Security Council agreed on achieving major reform of the UN, but you do not achieve that through the actions that are being considered in the US Congress. Australia has a right to give, and a role to play in giving, its views about this matter, because we as a moderate power in the Asia Pacific region will directly suffer the consequences of any major withdrawal of US involvement in the world through a reduction in aid and a reduction in involvement in the United Nations. We need to send a very clear message to the political leaders of the United States that we do not believe that that is the appropriate role it should play. We need to say to the United States that, rather than withdrawing and returning to the dominant 19th century political philosophy of 'We should look after ourselves. Who cates what happens ,around the rest of the world? The Europeans can fight amongst themselves. The Africans can fight amongst themselves,' it has an even stronger leadership role to play than it already has. I think the United States has played an outstanding role in the 20th century. Without its involvement we would not be able to live in such peace as we have. But now is not the time for the United States to withdraw from - that effort. Now is the time for us to build on the peace that we have achieved, to build on the foundation that the end of the Cold War has achieved for us and to tackle the real people issues that affect the lives of people across the globe. We need to have a much greater effort to tackle poverty. We need to have a much greater effort across the world to tackle the health problems, the housing problems and the sanitation problems of the Third World-those nations and peoples of Africa, Asia and South America. We need the United States to provide that leadership in tackling those issues. We do not need the United States to be withdrawing nations from that by cutting its aid. Although the member for Fraser has been accused of playing some sort of political game, a number of Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate in the US have put forward a bill that will dramatically cut foreign aid programs as well as cut back on the involvement of the United States in UN peacekeeping operations. We are entitled as a country that has joined with the United States in many peacekeeping operations over this century-we have fought wars on behalf of other peoples; we have contributed greatly from our own nation's wealth to the benefit of other people around the world-to say to the United States: please reconsider your direction and provide that strong leadership that you have provided in the past. Now is not the time to withdraw. Now is the time to tackle the people issues-poverty, disease and housing-and in that way all of our security will be better enhanced, because we will get security problems around the globe if the peoples of the world are not able to share in the wealth of the world. We will have a much greater security problem emerging in Africa, in Asia and in America's own backyard-South America and Central America-if we do not have a strong commitment from the United States to continue and build its aid program. That is the message we are seeking to convey in this motion today. This is not about problems that the United Nations has experienced. (Time expired) , Mr ATKINSON (Isaacs) (2.07 p.m.)-I guess it is all a matter of perception. I think the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has put forward a good motion. I do not necessarily agree with all that he is after in the motion, but it certainly does give us an opportunity to debate the issue. Having listened to some of the debate last week in which there were accusations about who did and did not support French testing in past times, I find it rather ironical today to see government members standing up and talking about how responsible the US has been over the years. As an ex-Vietnam veteran, it seems. to me not many years ago that I heard a lot of people on the other side taking a different view with respect to that. Mr Gibson-That was their one big mistake.",29
33,Mr ATKINSON,PEACEKEEPING AND FOREIGN AID,"It may be one big mistake, as the member for Moreton says, but it is rather ironical to see that change in in the debate. When people talk about the US contribution and reduction, I accept that its contribution at 0.15 per cent of GDP is substantially lower than what is aimed for at 0.7 and substantially lower than our contribution at 0.35 per cent. But, when one looks at the US wanting to reduce its funding of the UN from 30 per cent to 25 per cent, it highlights the contribution that the US has made over a considerable period of time. I have some concerns with the changes in the dollar amounts, with the current viability of the UN and with where it may head in the future. When you look around at some of the contributions to peacekeeping forces in recent times, some have been successful-I think they have been noted by members-but we have also sent peacekeeping forces to a lot of areas where I would question whether or not their role was more one of peacemaking. Some of those can be seen on the news almost every night. It does concern me, when we are talking about peacekeeping, that we actually look in international terms at areas where people actually do want to solve their differences and solve their problems. Until the United Nations peacekeepers tackle roles where we can achieve some result from peacekeeping, we need to have a look at the overall approach. I am not taking away from that. I know there will be people who will say, 'Shock, horror. Fancy anybody standing up and talking about systems on the basis of peacekeeping. We need to solve the problems in these countries.' I am not denying that but, having spent a number of years in the services as a soldier, I know what it is like at the other end of it. I think that a lot of people who get up and use fine words about how we are going to solve problems need to look at the lives of the people we are sending into those areas to solve those problems as well. I regret that of the people who talk about the peacekeeping exercise far too few have not had any experience in the services. I think that one needs to stop and see what occurs over the next few years with the process of peacekeeping. As other speakers have said, the United States is not the only views country which has not been forthcoming with its money. I would be happy to support strongly the view that the United States and other countries which have not paid' their dues, which have not met their commitments, should make those payments. But one has to ask whether there are not a number of other fundamental problems with an organisation that cannot attract the funding necessary to keep its operations going, even though those funds in some areas have been committed. The member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and other members have indicated that there is a series of fundamental problems with the way the United States peacekeeping operations have been handled--or have been observed to have been handled. It is always difficult when there is such a range of soldiers being put into the field in various peacekeeping missions. I do not dispute that. I think that that is one area where it will always continue to be difficult. I understand the concerns of members when they say that the United States forces are being reduced, but there are some elements of the motion moved by the member for Fraser that I support, most particularly the fact that we do need to see the United Nations keep its figures up to date",31
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PEACEKEEPING AND FOREIGN AID,' Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking for a short period when the debate is resumed. NA,31
35,Mr ANDREW,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises the enormous difficulties being faced by fruit growers, vegetable growers and vignerons in the irrigation areas of Australia in attracting sufficient labour to harvest their crops; (2) notes the action of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, in attempting to address this employment shortfall; and (3) calls for the urgent implementation of a range of initiatives to address this problem, including the tightening of the arrangements for the receipt of unemployment benefits during the harvest season and provision of skills development programs. This private member's motion had its genesis in a question asked by the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) on 1 March of this year, towards the end of the height of the fruit picking season in southern Australia. The member for Mallee asked the question of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). He said: My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I have no need to remind the minister that over 800,000 people are unemployed in this country and that countless numbers again are underemployed. then, are horticulturalists currently having enormous difficulty in attracting harvest labour? I am ring to grape growers, vegetable growers and fruit growers in the Murray Valley, the Goulbum Valley and all across Australia. The member for Mal1ee's question was pivotal in drawing the attention of the House and of Australian taxpayers to an enormous inequity in our present employment schedule. With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, blind growing Freddy could tell you that to raise a motion like this in the House is a hazardous course because, as soon as one mentions what hapof pens to the unemployed and the opportunity that there is for harvest labour, one runs the risk of being accused of in some way wanting to be exploitative, wanting to reintroduce some form of slave labour and take the employment arrangements in Australia back to pre-Wilberforce days. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that none of those participating in this motion from the opposition side of the House-and I have no doubt that the comment I am about to make is true of the government side as well, although it is not my prerogative to speak for them on this side of the Housewhether the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) or even I, if I may I modestly say so, can be accused normally of being exploitative in the way we deal with issues or of representing, or having tasted what it is like to be a part of, big business, having reached the title of big businessman through some exploitative role. In fact, my sole qualification in bringing this motion into the House and in speaking to it today is that I suspect I can claim to have picked more fruit than has any other member of the House of Representatives.",32
36,Dr THEOPHANOUS,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,I don't know!,32
37,Mr ANDREW,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,"I think there would be a  it matters not. I am quite happy to defer to you and indicate the enormous enthusiasm .that the parliamentary secretary has shown for the role in the past. It matters not in terms of the debate. What matters is that I do not stand to address this matter from some particularly prejudiced point of view. I stand because I am Why, concerned, as are all other members in the House, that export opportunities for Australia referare being lost because there are people who stone are unemployed and underemployed and who are not prepared to do what they see as menial tasks. I know a good deal about the employment of the unemployed and the underemployed, having had some background in the fruit industry. I face the same frustration as prompted the member for Mallee to ask his question of the minister, that is, the frustration having crops ripe to be picked, quality crops waiting to be delivered, being unable to find the staff or, what is even more frustrating, finding the staff but finding them unwilling to work. That is at the nub of this concern. It is something we cannot escape. Members opposite may suggest that this would be addressed if salary levels were raised or if work situations were improved. Part of the focus of the motion I have put to the House calls on the government to look to ways in which .there may be some training component. People may feel they are more part of a national industry as a result of that training component. But at the bottom line what neither government nor opposition can escape is that there are people in Australia able to work but unwilling to work. I do not have a nice comfortable solution to the problem; but I believe the House owes it to all of those who are looking for export opportunities, particularly in labour intensive industries, to find some way to encourage people to work. Contrary to the popular opinion that fruit picking is some sort of menial task performed in impossible conditions, as someone who, along with the parliamentary secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), knows something about it, I can say that I would much prefer to be facing the prospect of harvesting a bin of peaches or a bin of oranges or even a bin of grapes-'--in the wine industry that is now largely done mechanically, but in the fresh fruit industry that analogy still stands-than of standing in a cannery with steam, water and noisy cans all around me and little opportunity for conversation. The tragedy that my Riverland growers face and that the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area growers in the electorate of the honourable member for Riverina face is that frankly it is not a bad sort of a vocation. I can find you people who spend their lives picking fruit and who regularly earn well in excess year round of $100 a day. In the citrus industry, for example, the harvest starts in May and does not finish until April the following year. The opportunities are there. Last week in my office we had a plea from one of the major citrus growers to intervene to ensure that an Indian family about to be deported could stay because they were among his best pickers. Each of those family members beyond schoolgoing age, clearly here as illegal immigrants or about to exceed their visa status, was earning more than $100 a day because they were energetic and organised fruit pickers. I find in my electorate-and I suspect the member for Riverina finds the same thingthat a number of my constituents make a plea for there to be more youth hostels built, because there is never any shortage of young people touring Australia who are prepared to be involved in what is seen as the menial task of fruit picking. So the jobs are there. They are not so unattractive that everybody runs away from them. However, among our 800,000 unemployed people there are people who could be involved in the industry but are not prepared to be. I think we need to look at providing some sort of career path in the fruit industry. It is difficult to imagine a career path in fruit picking, but we need to develop a mentality in people that they are ·part of a developing export industry, that the fruit they pick is destined for an export market, that it therefore needs to be handled carefully and that they need to be energetic in their approach. If that happened I would have thought that, with some imagination, there would be opportunities to move people through not only a fruit picking chain but also a processing and packing chain so that they feel they are part of a total industry rather than simply being regimented in the relatively boring task of taking a product off a tree and putting it into a container. This is something we need to address not only because of the frustration level currently being exhibited by fruit growers but also because of the export opportunities that exist in labour intensive industries in Australia. We are not going to achieve this by asking people to work for less. I must restate: this is not a plea to get people to work for less, but a plea for them to feel that there are opportunities in a contract fruit picking situation. If honourable members look at those products that are most labour intensive, for example soft fruit products, exports of stone fruits from Australia have doubled over the last three years-something for which the government may claim some credit. The exports of citrus fruits from across Australia, particularly navel oranges, has also increased. In fact, the greatest potential for the sale of Australian navel oranges exists in, of all plates, America. This increased potential for the sale of navel oranges occurs in a six-week time frame which starts about now. Our chance to meet that American demand depends on finding people prepared to recognise that that is a fruit that, in a whole fruit form headed for an export destination, needs to be carefully harvested and carefully processed. This is a training opportunity that the government cannot lose sight of, not a call to see labour exploited in some way. On behalf of a number of employers, I am expressing the frustration they feel at having unemployment queues on one side of their gate and fruit to pick on the other. (Time expired)",32
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,Is the motion seconded? Mr Hicks-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,34
39,Mr HARRY WOODS,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,"Page) (2.22 p.m.)I have very little trouble in accepting nearly everything the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) put forward. However, I doubt that the simple tightening of arrangements for the receipt of unemployment benefits would get the result he is after. The fruit and vegetable industry has experienced, over recent years, difficulty in obtaining sufficient harvest labour in certain areas, particularly during peak seasons. Many of the traditional workers, such as students, backpackers, migrants arid itinerant workers, et cetera, no longer seem to be attracted, as they have been in the past, to this industry. Several problems can be seen to be associated with this lack of enthusiasm for seasonal work. Harvest work requires workers to move from region to region and from farm to farm as one crop finishes and another starts. In my electorate of Page there is a range of horticulgrams, tural industries,including macadamia, avocado and banana growers, market gardeners, and citrus and stone fruit orchards. In all cases, the period of work differs for different crops. One of the major difficulties for employees to keep working within the industry is a lack of transport to move from farm to farm. As most of the growers are situated out of town, that lack of transport, both public and private, makes it difficult for people to get to those farms and to work in the fruit and vegetable industry. Another problem facing the harvest labourers is that many of them are women who live and have families in the area. They are generally working to supplement the family wage, and most of these workers also do not have reliable access to transport facilities. Another problem within the industry is that traditional harvest labour has. remained generally unskilled. Little training has been undertaken by the industry to increase skill levels or to multiskill its work force. For example, in my electorate of Page a variety of seasonal crops is grown. Each crop has its own requirements and associated knowledge is needed to effectively maintain the crop so yields of good quality fruit are produced. Separate skills are required to harvest the fruit. Workers should and must have a wellrounded knowledge of different fruit requirements if they are to continue to work the year round as one crop starts and another finishes. It also stands to reason that the more skilled the work force becomes the more likely it is that short-term jobs will be converted to longer term ones for local job seekers, particularly the long-term unemployed. If a worker has not only the training to be able to harvest the fruit but also the maintenance techniques required during the growing season-such as pest control, pruning and irrigation-more jobs will present themselves for longer periods, giving a greater stability to the work force and greater prosperity for the region. I acknowledge the work the Department of Employment, Education and Training has done in terms of adopting innovative approaches to the use of labour market prowhich provide a readily accessible and skilled work force to local growers and retain the earned income within the community. The Department of Employment, Education and Training has made considerable steps in the area of adopting measures that will ensure a skilled work fo-ce is retained within the community. Some of those programs are the group employment programs, the regional employment assistance scheme and the mobility assistance scheme. These program strategies include skilling a reliable work force to meet the demands for seasonal labour and a program to assist long term unemployed clients to learn the latest grafting techniques. This is an obvious area where jobs can be created. Most growers, and particularly orchards, in my electorate not only grow and harvest crops but propagate their own plants and graft what they have found to be successful varieties of fruit for their own crops. Seasonal work in grafting and propagation is available six to eight months each year. Another strategy is aimed at an integrated approach that provides casual workers with specific skill training followed by a period of seasonal work and then a period of further skill training prior to another round of on-the-job training. However, these strategies are only one answer to the problem experienced by growers having increased difficulty in attracting sufficient workers during peak season. We need to identify the major issues within the industry and adopt a series of reforms and initiatives that will strengthen the industry attract workers to it. It is a problem that the Department of Employment, Education and Training cannot tackle simply by itself. Indeed, if it could, that would not ultimately be of benefit to the industry, for change must come from within the industry and the community as well as the DEET initiatives. In February 1994 I released a report of the horticultural task force to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins. That report found that exports of horticultural products are decreasing in Australia in relative terms to Southern Hemisphere competitors. The findings point to a need to concentrate on our ability to compete on international markets and regain our domestic share as well to be able to compete in an import replacement industry, especially in the realm of processed products. Also, the report called upon the horticultural industry to change from one that is essentially fragmented in nature to a more modem, dynamic industry to actively respond to challenges and capitalise on the strengths of the industry to meet growing international demand and increase market opportunities as a result of GATT related changes. The report also identifies a future vision for the Australian horticultural industry where Australian exports of fresh and processed products have the potential to increase threefold to the value of $2 billion by the year 2000. The major destinations of those products would be north-east and south-east Asia and the Pacific nations. The gross value of product will have to increase to approximately $5 billion by the year 2000 to service increased domestic consumption and potential export demands. Therefore, changes must come from within the industry to meet those demands and challenges. There is a major need for the industry to be allowed not only the flexibility but also the incentives to effect change that will see greater productivity and prosperity for the grower and to encourage workers to seek work in a more productive and sustainable industry. There is a need for long-term strategies to be developed that can readily adopt the changes identified. The horticultural and industry has identified the need for consistent quality, value adding and innovative presentation of fresh and processed products. If these challenges are met, greater job opportunities will arise as profitability increases. The avenue of value adding to the fruit and vegetable industry is one which is yet to be adequately explored. Certainly, table fruit receives a higher market price than fruit for juicing or canning. But, with the demand of convenience food rising, it is likely that Australian horticultural growers will have new opportunities to add value to their products and take advantage of new markets. This responsibility does not lie with the Department of Employment, Education and Training but rather with a whole range of government bodies such as the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, particularly in its agribusiness funding program, as well as the industry itself and the community. Value adding is certainly an avenue that provides employment opportunities as the industry expands to meet growing demands. Take the example of one stone fruit orchard in my electorate of Page. Not only does the orchard provide quality table fruit but it also has invested in the machinery which allows it to produce its own dried fruit, which is sold locally. That extra work the orchard has created itself has provided greater productivity for the growers as well as increased employment opportunities for the workers. Research and development are also critical for growers to choose new varieties that are more suitable for their own particular areathose that are more disease resistant and produce better quality and greater produce. It is important that the industry be given the means to continue this research as greater productivity for the industry will logically flow on to more jobs in the community. Changes have been implemented by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to encourage workers, particularly the long-term unemployed, to areas in the fruit and vegetable industry that are experiencing shortages at peak season. I do not support the move to tighten conditions any further on receipt of unemployment benefits, further than they are currently. These changes would enable those suffering from the shortages to overcome that problem. One of the primary problems associated with much of the industry is the method of payment. In Page, for example, most stone fruit growers pay an hourly rate. However, most macadamia farmers pay on a quantity or piecework basis. Although on a good day many macadamia pickers can earn up to $150, the rate is extremely variable due to a whole host offactors. It is difficult to force people from one area to another, especially if they have settled in one area and have families or when travel arrangements are uncertain and accommodation may not be available. These problems must be overcome by strengthening the industry, not by penalising the workers. As part of the 1995-96 budget, changed case management arrangements were implemented for seasonal and part-time workers. It recognises that people are getting out there and working in an industry that has many drawba,cks for the employee. The fruit and vegetable industry is a vital part of the Australian economy but we must see the big picture. (Time expired) Mr mCKS (Riverina) (2.32 p.m.)-I rise to support this motion proposed by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) which calls on the government to take action in overcoming labour shortages in horticultural areas. Unless some method is found to overcome the difficulty of providing labour to harvest the nation's crops, food growing areas, particularly horticultural areas, will suffer great economic damage as will the national economy. Within the Riverina, particularly the MIA, over the past several years the situation has been deteriorating rapidly, and there are a number of reasons for this. Once itinerant professional pickers travelled from North Queensland, down through northern New South Wales, through the Riverina into Victoria and South Australia picking the crops as they went. For a number of reasons, these days have gone. The first reason is that the growth of the horticultural industries in Queensland which occupy the few remaining full-time pickers for at least six months of the year where they can be in a reasonably pleasant climate and close to the coast. The second reason is that the cost of travelling has increased dramatically. In addition, people are no longer willing to put up with a lack of accommodation, or even poor accommodation, that they once would have accepted. However, it has to be admitted that, in close proximity to the MIA, the Wagga Wagga district of the CES had nearly 4,000 registered unemployed on its books during the last picking season while the Griffith district had, at the same time, well over 2,000 registered. There is no doubt that picking some crops, particularly in summer, can be hard work and in some cases unpleasant. However, there are many people employed permanently in similcircumstances who are prepared to do thIS work. It may be asked: if some are prepared to do the work, why should others on unemployment benefits not be asked to do the same? While the CES imposes the activity test, there are many ways people can avoid work and one of them is to obtain a medical certificate to say they have some particular health problem that prevents them from working. Unfortunately, there are those people who are just not suited to that type of work. When people are totally unsuitable, it is better for both them and the employer that they do not turn up for the job. Today many growers are relying on backpackers from overseas to pick their crops, many of whom do not have work permits but without whom the crop would not be picked. I have received a number of representations over the years from both prospective employers and employees, and some things have become clear. The first is that when would be pickers come to horticultural areas there is generally a lack of suitable accommodation and facilities. Many growers have good onfarm accommodation and, according to anecdotal stories, they have little trouble attracting pickers. But other employers, some with accommodation, often strike a problem in finding workers. Another problem is transport. While many people can get to an area using public transport, they often find themselves isolated and not able to travel to the work site. Some of these work sites may be 30 kilometres from the town; they may be without toilet facilities; and, being flippant, in some cases they may not even have a tree in sight. With present unemployment benefits readily available, some people will no longer put up with these conditions. Another shortcoming is the lack of training given to newcomers to the various horticultural industries. While a skilled worker may be able to make a living from picking, newcomers find it very difficult. From the growers' point of view, there is a problem of non-reliability of the work force, and we see many letters in the local papers complaining of that. But we also find from community and charitable organisations complaints about the lack of accommodation and transport facilities. There is also the problem that arises when pickers refuse to work unless payment is in cash and no tax is taken from the pay . Often the employers pay the tax as well as the wage. In many instances, false tax file numbers are given and many imaginative pseudonyms are used as names. Apart from asking for a tax file number, the employer is not permitted to ask for any other identification. The compulsory superannuation payment then becomes a difficulty, with the payments going straight into consolidated revenue. There is no doubt that a great dilemma faces the horticultural industries. It is evident that those industries, the CES and all tiers of government must get together on this issue. It is a fact that most of a picker's money is spent soon after it is earned in the same area that the picker is working. Therefore, local government should assist where it can to provide suitable facilities for those pickers. The horticultural industries presently have many pressures placed on them, particularly in irrigation areas where governments are threatening to drastically increase the cost of water in addition to other commercial and government costs that seem never ending. For the long-term well-being of the horticultural industries, this is a problem that has to be solved. The solution will not be found in one area alone but in a multiplicity of areas. As the member for Wakefield and the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) have said before me, we know all the problems; now it is up to us to find the solutions to those problems.",34
40,Mr QUICK,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,"I am pleased to speak in support of this motion proposed by the .honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). It addresses the genuine concerns of fruit growers and vignerons in my electorate of Franklin in Tasmania. In addition, the motion looks to finding further solutions to a primary focus of my job: to get genuine job seekers back into the work force and to encourage employment growth in Tasmania. In the southern part of my electorate, which includes the D'Entrecasteaux Channel and the Huon Valley, there are small fruit growing areas and vineyards. The area also houses Australia's premier export apple industry. Each year, despite the same region suffering from severe unemployment problems, growers experience difficulties in finding workers to bring in their crops. Certainly, on the surface, this situation appears simply ridiculous. Upon analysis, it not only reveals complex problems that will require courage and determination in finding the necessary solutions but also raises new opportunities in the way we manage Australia's economy. From my analysis of this problem, two obstacles need to be overcome. The first problem is the way in which the activity test is applied by the Commonwealth Employment Service in directing job seekers to seasonal work. The second problem, which is complex but provides exciting opportunities, is to address the issue of having a recognised and efficient pool of workers for these industries. We currently have a non-existent working protocol arrangement between the CES and employers which must be rectified. The Commonwealth Employment Service in the Huon Valley only deals with between 15 and 20 per cent of workers employed for seasonal work. The great majority of seasonal workers are itinerant, travelling into the region and seeking employment independently. Local people registered with the CES, who are suitable for seasonal work, are contacted and advised to see certain employers about work. The CES applies an activity test to ensure that all suitable job seekers make genuine efforts to gain employment, otherwise their benefits may be withdrawn. I have been assured that every job seeker registered with the CES in the Huon Valley who is suitable for seasonal work is employed. For me, this is heartening in terms of the outcomes for the Huon Valley, but it does raise questions about the way in which the activity test is applied in other regions around Australia. This activity test is the key to ensuring that those people registered as job seekers with the CES have an imposition upon them to accept work. From the anecdotal evidence provided in this place, and from around Australia, there is a strong indication that the activity test is not applied with the strength necessary to ensure that job seekers accept available work. This problem needs to be investigated thoroughly and a report on the findings returned to parliament. The second problem that is critical to the whole issue is the need to formally link the CES, employers and state taxation departments 'during periods of seasonal work. As I mentioned previously, the CES in the Huon Valley only deals with between 15 and 20 per cent of the work force. I would suspect that this is the case across the nation. This situation means that the great majority of seasonal workers are not known as a group, not managed effectively as a work force, not formally linked to employers and not available to work around the country. There is no doubt that through the informal way that this important work force is ineffectively and inefficiently managed many of these ,workers are not declaring their incomes. With respect to seasonal work and employment arrangements, we have a serious management problem. I believe that to properly address this problem we must first identify the work force. To do this, there needs to be a requirement for employers to contact their local CES and inform the office of the details of their employment arrangements. This arrangement would begin the process of identifying the seasonal work force. The CES should in tum contact the state taxation offices and advise them of the details of all seasonal work employees. This would ensure that their incomes are declared. I have said in a few words what in fact will require an intensive and detailed investigation of establishing a management system for seasonal workers, one which effectively utilises an available work force of job seekers and itinerant workers and one which leads to legitimate revenue raising through declared income. I commend this motion to the House.",37
41,Mr NEVILLE,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,"I support the motion moved by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I come from a large fruit and vegetable growing electorate. I have three large fruit and vegetable growing areas in my electorate: the Bundaberg-Gin GinChilders area, which is on the coast; the North Burnett area, which has a big citrus industry; and the Yarwun-Targinnie area, which is near Gladstone. One of the big problems is that Bundaberg has now reached the stage where it is rivalling Bowen as the largest tomato growing area in Australia. It is already the largest zucchini growing area. On top of that, 30 other crops are grown in the area. It is a subtropical area and because of the subtropical nature of the district, it means that heat and humidity play a big part in the maturing of the crops. That means that small crops and fruit crops often have to be picked at very short notice. That in tum means that they need a very responsive and well organised work force. That has certainly developed in that area, but sadly not by using Australians who are out of work. The May quarterly figures for the Wide Bay area of my electorate .show that 13.7 per cent of people are out of work and 40.8 per cent of the teenage work force is out of work. That is a tragedy. In order to cope with this problem, a number of the backpacker lodges have developed efficient transfers to the farms for people seeking work. In Bundaberg and Childers alone there are 310 places at four lodges. When you add to that the accommodation available at caravan parks, they can cater for some 400 people. These people are taken in minibuses to the farms. That means that they arrive on time, they do a good day's work, they leave on time and are transported back to the backpacker lodges. They are back again the next morning at the required time of 7.00 or 7.30 to get into the crop. Those people are very popular with the farmers and they are a very reliable· source of work. What we are doing is virtually exporting Australian jobs to overseas backpackers. That matter needs to be addressed in some detail.",38
42,Mr SPEAKER,HARVEST SEASON LABOUR,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The member for Hinkler will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Primary Industry: Seasonal Labour",39
43,Mr NEVILLE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to continue speaking on the matter of employment in the small crop industry and, in the 90 seconds available to me, I would like to suggest a number of ways we can get over the problem that we have. Firstly, officers of the CES should make provision for fleets of .minibuses to be available,. either on a seasonal or a rotational regional basis, to take unemployed people to farms. If this can be done by backpacker lodges, with 10 or 12 minibuses operating each day, it should be possible for a government department to do something similar. Secondly, this could perhaps be developed on a circuit basis-a whole series of crops could be harvested in rotation. Thirdly, more flexible averaging arrangements for those moving in and out of fruit picking should be made and unemployment benefits should be arranged accordingly. Fourthly, as suggested by the Bundaberg and District Fruit and Vegetable Growers, a training video or film to take some of the terror and misunderstandings out of the fruit and vegetable industry should be considered. IDgher Education Contribution Scheme",39
44,Mr CAMERON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to explain to the House how this government is ripping off former university students. Under legislation passed last year, repayments of HECS debts through tax instalments became mandatory from July 1994. It was done this way to make it easier to clear debts in regular instalments through the PAYE system than as one lump sum each year. Where the system is unfair is that the government does not credit the repayments until the end of each financial year, yet on 1 June each year the Australian Taxation Office indexes debts to make them reflect the increase in the cost of living. The problem with this is that the indexation is applied to the previous year's balance, ignoring the repayments that have been made over the year via PAYE instalments. For example, one constituent at 1 June last year owed $4,878. He paid $1,391 for the 1993-94 year, leaving a balance of $3,487. On 1 June this year, the government applied indexation of 2.5 per cent to the figure, despite it going down each fortnight since July last year. Clearly, the indexation should be applied to a much lower figure. The present method of calculations amounts to theft by the government, wrongly and unfairly making BECS debtors worse off and giving the government a significant windfall. Imagine the outcry in the community if this particular accounting method applied to people with housing and car loans. Diesel Fuel Rebate",39
45,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"There is one thing that Australian farmers will willingly tell you: Labor's concern and treatment of farmers have been consistent-consistently cynical, consistently uncaring and consistently out of touch. The most recent example that has come to my attention is the question of the diesel fuel rebate. The government went to a lot of trouble to try to convince us that farmers would not be affected by the alterations to the diesel fuel rebate that are now before the Senate. In fact, when we look at the small print, we find that farmers will be affected. Limestone mining will also be affected. As anyone will tell you, lime plays a very important part in looking after the soil in many parts of Australia. What the government is proposing to do will add up to $1.50 per tonne to the cost of lime, which equates to a 10 to 15 per cent increase in the price of lime. Lime has to be used in fairly large quantities when converting acid soil to a more neutral soil. In Victoria alone, this could cost anywhere· between $200,000 and $300,000, and the figures from other states will add to that. This shows very clearly that we have a consistently cynical, consistently uncaring and consistently out of touch government. Murray-Darling Freshwater Research",40
46,Mr LIEBERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre, located on the Murray River at Albury-Wodonga, is facing a funding crisis. Unfortunately, the government has decided that $390,000 of its $2 million annual budget will be withdrawn from 1 July next year. This centre is a valuable resource. In fact, it is the natural repositunity tory of expert knowledge on research into delicate water environments in Australia. Mr Speaker, I know .you would appreciate that the freshwater resource of Australia is finite and needs to be protected. I am raising this matter of concern now because, if the funding from next year on is not assured, staff morale will be severely affected and valuable research projects that must be continued in the interests of the nation will also be put in jeopardy. I hope that by my raising this issue today the government will address the issue urgently. I offer the coalition's full cooperation to resolve this matter. It is not a political issue; it is one that the nation needs to address. The government should address this issue now and remove any doubts that exist as to the future of this valuable resource. Higher Education Contribution Scheme",40
47,Mr HORNE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Listening to the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), I was encouraged to come into the House and enter the debate. The member for Stirling seems to think that, for some reason, the government should be ashamed of its policy of encouraging young Australians, after they leave school, to attend university. Let us face it: currently there are 600,000 Australian young people at our universities. I would like all the people of Australia to know of the very positive policy that this government has of encouraging such people, of making it possible for such people to attend university. I can tell those opposite that we are not at all ashamed of asking for a BECS contribution once those people have finished at university and are participating in the work force, because that means that more Australians will be able to attend university. This tradition goes back to the Whitlam government. Up until then, under a long Centre history of coalition governments starting from the Second World War, it was virtually impossible for the children of working families to attend universities because the government gave them no assistance at all. Then, when the Whitlam government came to power, it made certain that the children of working class families had the same opporas those of the wealthy. That tradition continues, with the result that we have seen enormous growth in tertiary education. (Time expired) Born, MrWayne",40
48,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is with very great sadness that I report to the House the passing of a fine community worker in my electorate, Wayne Born: Wayne was Chairman of the Merriwa Residents Association and also Chairman of the new HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust. Those of you who have studied the Notice Paper would have noted order of the day No. 21 which relates to the sunken HMAS Sydney. That motion was a follow-on of the work that Mr Born had performed on behalf of the community in my electorate. Mr Born was a young man: he was in his late 30s. He leaves a widow and children. I know that many in the community will be grieving over his passing. He was a friend of mine. He worked very hard to inaugurate the HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust. We deeply regret his passing. Regional Development: Coalition Policy",41
49,Mr HARRY WOODS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I just want to make some comments about a recent document which has emanated from the shadow minister for regional development. In that document, the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure, Senator Ian Macdonald, states: The policy under the grand vision indicates that prior to the election we would be announcing a list of long-term visionary projects. We would specifically like the councilthat is the council they are to formto investigate and prioritise; for example, Darwin to Alice railway, turning coastal waters inland, rejuvenating the Murray-Darling Basin and Adelaide airport. The coalition is considering prioritising these long-term wonderful grand visions. Then the shadow minister further states: This gives us the flexibility of announcing a major long-term visionary matters but. with-ut committing ourselves to actually proceedmg wIth them. In other words, the coalition is going to go out and make these long-term visionary announcements with absolutely no intention of being committed to them. The defence of the shadow minister is that this documentwhich is headed 'the shadow minister's document' - is just personal notes. Yet in the document he says that this particular approach is strongly endorsed by the federal secretariat. He makes that abundantly clear on page 2 of the document, where he states: It is my assessment, supported by the federal secretariat, that we need to approach infrastructure on both the grand vision and the more localised angle. This document follows a document of a year ago put out by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), the then shadow minister for regional development, in which he said about infrastructure: We need to set a figure-$lbillion, $3 billion; the actual number is insignificant-as an indication of our commitment . . . He then said: We should also then allude to. some sort of assessment procedure. . . . In the year the approach has not changed at all. (Time expired) Islington Railyard",41
50,Ms WORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Wednesday I questioned the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) about the contaminated land at the Islington Railyard in my electorate. The residents' spokesperson has already made public her concerns about the inadequacy of the minister's answer, and I would like to challenge him over his claims that the problem at Islington is a problem entirely of South Australia's making. I challenge this statement for two important reasons. The first is that in the railway agreement of 1975 the Commonwealth took over from the state authorities. The agreement in part states: Shall include the land and other property rights and interests (including contracts and non-contractual) and things in action and liabilities as the case may be. lot of The second reason I challenge the statement is that the minister has not been entirely truthful in this matter. Ministers not being entirely truthful is something that, sadly, gives all politicians a bad name. The problem was not just the making of the South Australian authorities, and there is proof of this. In 1985, 10 years after Australian National took over the railways from South Australia, the Waste Management Commission wrote to both Australian National and the federal environment department in the following terms: Cease forthwith the disposal of waste asbestos these premises. Republic Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",41
51,Mr ROBERT BROWN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"My government? remarks follow closely on the remarks just made by my colleague the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). Harry referred to a ment that had been issued by Senator Ian Macdonald, a spokesman for the opposition, in which he drew attention to the possibility that the opposition could announce what referred to as visionary statements while making sure that they retained the flexibility that would ensure the coalition would not have to make any commitment to any of history...,--not them. That indicates a lack of political princirecent ple on the part of the opposition. Let us see if there have been any other examples of this. A senior Liberal is quoted as having said that the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to have a people's convention in relation to the republic is designed to simply bury the issue. That is not only happening with members of the opposition themselves; it is also occurring with the Leader of the Opposition. When he answered to a doorstop interview after Senator Gareth Evans had earlier indicated government's initial response to the proposal by France to resume those nuclear tests, he said that the government's response was appropriate. As soon as he got a whiff of the community's response to those nuclear tests, there was a sudden change in attitude. Then Senator Evans was just 'tickling their tummy' . (Time expired) Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",42
52,Mr ATKINSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am interested in the comments of the previous speaker, honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). Frankly, he does not get his timing very well organised on these issues. What needs to do if he wants to make these comstand ments about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is have a look at when the comments were made. They were made a little bit earlier than he is suggesting. It is very clear that our attitude to the on French has been very poor. The government did take a very weak stance on this issue in the very early stages. In fact, the opposition"" moved some amendments to provide a little bit of strength. What did we see from the It was quite happy to sit backon its laurels and not accept that. But what are we seeing now? We are seeing a little bit of statemovement to those areas-a little bit of support for some of the things that were really the initiatives of the opposition. When the honourable member wants to get he up in this 'place and talk about what his government is doing and the way it has been standing up and supporting these issues, I suggest he has a little bit of a look at the the too distant history, but the history-of this issue. I think the stance the opposition has taken-particularly the stance of the Leader of the Oppositionon this issue is totally appropriate. If this government had any courage, it would have actually stood behind the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition rather than wait until some time later. Obstetric Services",42

54,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 3.00 p.r I., in accordance with stanqing order 106A the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Nuclear Testing in the Pacific Mr nOWNER-I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the leaks in today's Australian newspaper suggesting that at a cabinet meeting on 6 to 7 June he, the Prime Minister, and the Minister he for Defence persuaded cabinet to take a soft on French nuclear testing. Is it true, as suggested by those who have been leaking to help the flailing Senator Evans, that it is the Prime Minister who first masterminded the government's initial weak response to the French?",42
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not be saying anything about cabinet discussions or the advice on which decisions are made. But I can say that wherever the report in the Australian this morning came from, the story is incorrect and misleading. In particular it confuses the reported views of departments and agencies in coordiriation comments in cabinet submissions with the views of ministers. I do not know how many former ministers there are left on the other side of the House but those who are there will know that routinely, certainly under this government and I am sure under the former government, departments enter cabinet coordination comments which are not necessarily the views of ministers. In fact, in the years that I have been Prime Minister and Treasurer the coordination comments were entered without advice to me. I have made it clear that they can, if they wish, put a view, but it is not necessarily my view. That is the weight with which all ministers regard these things. Then to ascribe them, as the honourable member has done, to the Minister for Defence and me is wrong. In any case, it turns out that I made the statement on behalf of the government on 14 June and the actions which we took immediately afterwards, including the decision to send a forum delegation to Paris, were made in response to the circumstances at the time, rather than according to the conclusions of the cabinet meeting which had taken place earlier. This story is written as though this was the cabinet decision. It was not the action the government took. The government took subsequent action and went beyond the measures contained in a decision taken by the cabinet. This was, I think, consistent with the graduated response the government believed was appropriate. This was the same response that the Leader of the Opposition agreed was appropriate. Let me remind you of what he said: ... it's one of those situations that you've got to keep under review and just as the response today is not necessarily the final response, in some times in these matters what you should do is give an initial response and if that doesn't produce any result, then you might consider a further response and it's never smart in those situations to fire ·all your shots at once. Mr Bilney-Who said that?",43
56,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Bennelong said it. The truth is: that is exactly what the government did. That"" is why .our first consideration was to seek directly from the French government, and in concert with other members of the South Pacific Forum, a review of the decision. That is why I got in touch with the forum leaders, had a discussion and dialogue"" with them, agreed we would send a delegation to Paris and the foreign minister led it with a view to doing that. Late last week the government then increased, if you like, its response in response to the lack of"" movement on the French side after the delegation to Paris.

We will be consulting with forum countries on the desirability of public information campaign in France itself. At the wider international level, Australian delegations and representatives will take advantage of all available opportunities in the UN and other appropriate multilateral bodies to register Australian and regional opposition ban treaty. to French testing. The government has reaffirmed its existing policy that no new contracts for the sale of uranium to France will be entered into until France signs the comprehensive test ban treaty.

Mr Tim Fischer-Absolutely.",44
63,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has just confirmed it again. But the government is saying that no new contracts for the sale of uranium to France will be entered into until France signs the comprehensive test ban treaty.

At no stage will the Commonwealth government be involved in selectthe type of generating plant . . . The federal government would not therefore oppose the development of a nuclear fuel cycle in Australia. a The whole graft of the opposition's policy is to mine more uranium-as the Leader of the National Party said and confirms today-and sell more of it to France and Northern Hemisphere countries regardless of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty or a comprehensive test All that was put in the context of the coalition's absolutely clear opposition to the signing of a South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty. Those opposite were implacably opposed to that throughout. That is why the only thing revealing about all of the shenanion the opposite side of the House is that is the member for Bennelong was rung by the member for Mayo. Now that is one for the of books, isn't it? There is a turn-up for the as books. In the end, who was calling the tune over there? Old Mayo. Who was dancing to his tune? The member for Bennelong.

68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has been a lot of debate in this House on the linkage between the current account deficit and the level of for Australian savings. I and other ministers have talked about the declining propensity to save, be put which came from the decade and a half of high inflation in this country, and, as a conseon: quence, the government's decision to move of the budget into surplus so that there would be to a higher level of public savings-that is, no public draw down on the savings pool, so as to relieve the pressure on the current account defiCit-and also a mandatory route of savings via occupational superannuation. They were the requirements of policy for the good of the country at this point in our economic history. We have got the opposition out there telling us that there ought to be remedial policy changes. On 21 June, just last week, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: What is absolutely clear now is that the government has been running a fiscal policy that is too loose. We have consistently been calling on the government to tighten its fiscal policy. In the face of that, the Leader of the Opposition is promoting the obstruction and defeat in the Senate of $1.5 billion worth of measures in this budget, in 1995-96, and. $2.5 billion in the following year. The dupliCity and hypocrisy of the member for Bennelong and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party when they are actually urging the government to tighten fiscal policy, yet opposing measures worth $1 Y2 to $2Y2 billion and using the Senate to knock over money bills in a government's budget.

Those opposite said they would block the changes to comdeclines pany taxes and to the sales tax on cars, changes in the Medicare levy, the introduction of sales tax on certain building materials, changes to how PAYE taxes are remitted and the provisional uplift factor. These measures will give rise to $1.5 billion in this year and $2.5 billion in the out years. I do not know whether we are having an unreality debate in this community-whether an opposition leader can go around promoting this kind of vandalism in the Senate. There is a lot of debate now about what the Democrats will do . .The Democrats have got eight votes over there. It is what the coalition will do that matters. What matters here is that the member for Bennelong, having visited that particular poison well in 1975, in the refusal of supply and that which came with it, is now going back to this issue in using the Senate to knock over these measures. What is he saying-that the money bills of the government are illegitimate, that they do not fulfil national policy? Where is the critical comment about the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition, about the way in which the Senate's processes have been prostituted to try to destroy the government's budget, about how the Liberal Party continues to try to use the Senate's powers to obstruct the business of the government of the day? I think it is high time that the reputation of John Howard-'Honest John' in inverted commas-for hypocrisy and dishonesty is exposed.

If those sorts of that we have seen in interest rates the and in the long-term bond rate-which has come from 10.1 to now 8.8 per cent-are not the further compounded and consolidated, then, as a consequence, the gUilty person will be J.W. Howard. He will be the person standing in the way of falling interest rates for Australians. He and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Costello, will be the two people standing there against relief on interest rates and disposable income coming from the budget's passage. What is the point of objection? That the measures are wrong? That the country doesn't need them? That the budget process doesn't need them? None of that. It is just rank and down again. putrid opportunism, just as it was in 1975 by the. then unprincipled opposition.

96,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government, I said in House the other day; has used three arms he of policy. One is monetary policy, one is fiscal policy and the other is wages policy through the Accord, with some weight on each arm rather than undue weight on anyone arm through high interest rates, by a massive cut in the social wage through cuts in government spending, and/or a massive reduction in real wages. What we have is a little weight on all. In fact, as a consequence of low inflation we have seen in the last few years substantial improvements in real wages and disposable incomes through lower interest rates. That is the environment. When the Minister for Finance talks about a change, we are not talking about $100 million here; we are talking about $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion. We are talking about half a per cent of GDP. GDP this year is running at $500 billion; $2.5 billion is half a per cent of GDP. That is a very large change of magnitude. That will have an impact on the sentiment in markets. It is that which the Minister for Finance referred to. At anyone time the sentiment in markets cannot be related to a particular nominal interest rate but when there is a market sentiment for a change in the underlying fiscal balance of the country and the government has provided for it, for that to change and for that to be arrogantly and politically put asunder for no reason but basically vandalism and villainy, that changes sentiment. That is why I made the point, and echoed a point made earlier by the Minister for Finance, that if there are not commensurate consolidations in falls in interest rates, John Howard and Peter Costello will be the guilty people as a consequence. What are they saying? Are they saying that basically revenue shouldn't be increased and that the budget balance shouldn't be tightened, when they are saying that just a week ago they had been calling on the government to tighten fiscal policy? Is it an objection to the measures? What is the point of objection? The point of objection is just paltry politics from a person who prides himself on being a principled leader. He runs around telling the press gallery and anyone who will listen, 'I am a man of principle.' But we have seen his principle. He is prepared to play games with the nation's fiscal policy and the nation's economic prosperity for no particular purpose, not even a particularly good political purpose. Having made a point of objection to the measures, he could then let them pass, but he wants to vandalise the measures in the Senate while at the same time saying that we should be tightening fiscal policy. Where is there any morality in our public debate with this kind of activity between the stated policies of the opposition and its behaviour in the House of Representatives and in the Senate? This is immoral behaviour. Not only that, it is economic vandalism of the very worse kind, because markets will look at Australia and say, 'This country is not serious about getting its house in order. Here is a .government which proposed perfectly sensible proposals to reduce the budget balance by $2.5 billion and they have been refused in the Australian upper house.' They are being refused by somebody who wants to pride himself, going around the business dinners, as somebody who can be trusted running the national economy. You could not trust him with a jam jar full of 5c pieces-that is the truth of it-because this person is prepared to put asunder the government's budget which is needed to get the economy, the budget, back ihto surplus so as to remove absolutely the call on national savings by the public sector, which it does. Let me make clear to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that both of the statements made by the Minister for Finance are entirely appropriate in the context in which they were put. Mr Costello-They are inconsistent.",46
97,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are not, and the fact that you think they are inconsistent means that you do not understand how markets work, what their expectations are, what the· government of the day is doing or is seeking to do-and how, when these things start to change, they move in a process and with an engagement with official policy which obviously, without experience, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not understand. If he does not understand, he should not get into the business of vandalism; he should not get into lighting fires he cannot put out. If rates do not fall and markets take a set against cash rates or 90-day bills or any of these indicators, the responsibility for that will be with the opposition. Budget 1995-96",47
98,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to reports that the opposition parties in the Senate plan to reject certain meas,:!res contained in the budget. Can the Pnme Minister further advise the House on the likely impact on national economic outcomes and on the Senate's prerogatives should the Senate reject elements of the budget?",48
99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have just said some things about the budget outcome, the imI?a-t upon savings, the current account defIc-t, market sentiment and interest rates. I also saId a couple of things about the prerogatives of the Senate. But let me make this point clear again. The Senate has had traditionally a r?le of reviewing these measures-of looking through them and seeing how they applyand consequential amendments have come from them. When a Senate decides that it will either refuse supply or get into the business of a massive change to the budget balancein this case of $2.5 billion in the out year-it is overplaying its hand. I notice remarks in the Weekend Australian by Sir Garfield Barwick about Sir Ro-ert Menzies. The article refers to when BarwIck first learned of this issue. It states: Menzies took a message from Fraser, saying just ""we are acting"". Barwick writes that he instantly understood what was meant and that Menzies was angered by it, saying: ""The young fools are impatient. If they give this fellow (Whitlam) enough rope, he'll hang himself."" Asked by Menzies what he would do, Barwick replied tltat in tlte right circumstances, ""I would be troubled by a refusal of Supply by the Senate."" The arrogance of it-he 'would not be troubled'. The article continues: Menzies disagreed, probably because he. did not believe it proper to refuse Supply, BarwIck says. But he thinks Fraser was right to do so. Here he is saying that the Prime Minister of 16 years standing-who had, I believe, always a quite clear understanding about the prerogatives of the two chambers-was angered by a refusal of supply and thought it improperBut of course we heard over the weekend that Sir Garfield Barwick has expatiated in his book that he thought it was appropriate. That is the sort of immorality of action that now runs in the minds of the current opposition. It has obviously been playing on Sir Garfield's conscience, like it played on Sir John Kerr's conscience and Malcolm Fraser's conscience. When the Leader of the Opposition said that it illegitimised us-I quote what he said a week ago in this parliament-:-in fact it did and did play on the conscience of those people, as it is playing on Sir Garfield Barwick's now. I say as an aside that the one person. who has kept his dignity sin.ce 1975-the-e .IS no problem with the conSCIence of the vIctIm of all this-is Gough Whitlam. History has judged him as being a much bigger person than it has judged Sir Garfield Barwick, John Kerr or Malcolm Fraser to be. . I come to the core of the matter-this is the same attitude taken by today's opposition. Sir Garfield stated: What a lot of hoo-ha there was about something which, if you know tlte facts-and the situation is the government has been refused Supply and the government has no money-what is wrong with getting rid of the government? That is the first point. Then he goes on to say, and it is the same attitude which prevails today: ... the Whitlam ministry was ""toughing it out"" ... But is that sort of conduct acceptable? Is it acceptable in a parliamentary democracy where the members are expected to do their parliamentary duties honourably and free of coercion of any kind? In other words, it was dishonourable for t-e government of the day to seek to get ItS not budget through and to pressure the Senate but it was completely honourable for the Senate to do that which Sir Robert Menzies said was improper. This is the sort of view put about, and it is still around now, by the tyrants of the Liberal Party-the unprincipled rogues of the Liberal Party gallery, who today still talk about refusing $2Y2 billion worth of budget measures. The article had a few other revealing things that I think are worthy of attention.",48

104,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-.: - When asked about the obligation to warn the ministry of any action, Sir Garfield said, 'First of all this is a power or ability ,not an obligation.' In other words, it· is not an obligation to. go telling the Prime Minister of the day that somebody will dismiss him. Then he went on to talk about Bagehot's expression. He said for the government to have been warned 'would clearly have worn the aspect of a threat'. The article continues: This is something which certainly should not be done by the governor-general. In other words, if the Governor General were to have been frank with his Prime Minister, it would have been a warning and a threat. The same immoral sentiment expressed by this conscience-ridden former Chief Justice is the exact sentiment being expressed by the coalition today. It is the very same sentiment that leads members opposite to believe that they can refuse $2Y2 billion worth of budget measures, and yet they cynically walk to the front door of Parliament House and say in a doorstop, 'The government should tighten its budget.' It is the same unprincipled, hypocritical action. What has been revealed by this is that the coalition, in 20 years, has come nowhere. You would think that at least the person who described them as illegitimised-that is, the member for Bennelong-would at least show the leadership needed to repair the immorality of their position. Instead of that, he compounds it by being the same opportunist that every Liberal before him was. That is why he should stand condemned for what he is seeking to do in the Senate to the government's budget. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional . Orders",49

114,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the blink of an eyelid compared with what your bloke goes on with. I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls the now Treasurer saying in August 1981: . . . we say that we have a right, as an opposition, to oppose tax measures. That is in no way inconsistent with the statement which we have made many times that we do not believe that the Opposition ought to block Supply. This is not blocking Supply. We are not suggesting a blockage of the Appropriation Bills and therefore putting the Government in jeopardy. All that we are saying is that there ought to be a blockage of these tax Bills because they are not in the best interest of this country. It is consistent with the fact that we have opposed various tax Bills in the past. Does the Prime Minister also recall the fact that on the Sunday program in April 1982 the now Treasurer told Max Walsh and the late Alan Reid that he believed the then Labor opposition ought to use its numbers in the Senate to throw out the government and block supply? Has the Prime Minister forgotten that the double dissolution of 1983 was obtained, in part, on the refusal of the opposition in the Senate'to pass some sales tax measures?

128,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says: What is absolutely clear now is that the government has been running a fiscal policy which is too loose. This is last week, not last year or in the 1980s. He continues: We have consistently been calling on the government to tighten its fiscal policy. Mr Speaker, can you believe it? Those opposite are consistently calling on us to tighten it. When they do, they defeat half a per cent of GDP's worth of measures in the Senate---or try to. That is what they are about. They are about trying to up-end half a per cent of GDP. This is a significant proportion of the savings task to deal with the current account imbalance. It is treading right across government policy and the prerogatives of the House of Representatives to frame the. budget. That is what he is doing; he knows that. Mr Speaker, you will see he is embarrassed. He has that silly little grin on his face again. He is giggling away over there. He knows what is right and what is wrong-and this is wrong, and he knows it. He knows it is wrong. Mr Speaker, you will have noticed that they did not like it when I reminded them of the quotation from Sir Garfield Barwick. They all put their heads down, they all stuck their heads down.

129,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh God, I'm in trouble now. Mr Reith-You are. You Were in trouble before I started, don't worry. Mr Speaker, my point of order is on two grounds: the first is on the point of relevance because the Prime Minister is now responding to a previous question, not to the question that was asked of him by the Leader of the Opposition. Secondly, as a result of falling into that trap, he also breaches standing order 85, which is the standing order which discourages irrelevance and tedious repetition.",53

135,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I uttered those words before, all their heads went down.

Malcolm FraSer was afraid to introduce any remedial policy lest he tear the fabric of our society right down the middle. That is what he said at the time, and he knew that to be true. Basically, it marked Malcolm Fraser out and destroyed his government from that period onwards-and it destroyed Sir John Kerr. Mr Howard interjecting",53
136,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did my best, with pleasure. Not only that, but from the shadows lurches the other culprit-and the other culprit from the shadows, of course, is Sir Garfield Barwick. The thing about the coalition is that they always say, 'We are the right and proper people, the people who know what is right. And the Labor Party is representing the working classthe ruffians of politics. They don't know what is right and proper.' We have seen it over and over. We saw it in 1975 here when we saw then an opportunist opposition who did, as Menzies said, something which was improper. We saw the same thingMr Smyth- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In a question entirely relevant to the member for Gellibrand, the Prime Minister is answering on statements about Garfield Barwick. On a question· of relevance, section 145, would he please answer a very specific question raised by the Leader of the Opposition.",53
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I say again to the member for Canberra that if he would take the opportunity to read House of Representatives Practice, on that very section he has referred to, he would see some very enlightened statements.",54
138,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am going to finish on these two points. Whether we saw it with the landed gentry in the House of Lords trying to destroy a House of Commons budget, or whether with the opposition here in 1975, they are always the same impulses. You see it again today in the member for Bennelong and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party trying to destroy $2Y2 billion of budgetary measures. Let us just record again: there is only one party in this system that observes all of the protocols of the system. That is the Labor Party. The coalition never do and they never have. I would have thought John Howard would have known better and shown better, but he does not know better and he is not showing better. I repeat the point: if there is a consequent impact in interest rates or the exchange markets, he will be the guilty person. Budget 1995-96",54
139,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of a report today concerning a potential quarter of a billion dollar hole in the budget surplus? What effect will that outcome have on the Australian economy.,54
140,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I saw a comment earlier this morning attributed to Senator Hill. When someone finally from the media draw attention to a slight inconsistency in the coalition's approach of calling for a budget surplus and at the same time opposing, as the Prime Minister has said, some billions of dollars worth on the revenue side, he said: We said that they should reduce expenditure significantly. That was Senator Hill's response. In addition to that, we have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition speak in those terms. When, from time to time, I have had occasion to stand up in this place and say that the opposition supports nothing in reducing what was then a budget deficit and putting it into surplusthey do not support revenue measures and they do not support outlays measures-I said that they support neither of those. The Leader of the Opposition said in this place in a personal explanation: He is absolutely incorrect. We will take a stand against taxes, but we will support spending cuts. They have thus far been invited to attend one spending cut. I remind the House· that, in gross terms, there is some $1 - billion worth of spending cuts in this budget. They have had their first test. They have only had one test on that. Tests will come down the line because all those propositions will cbme before the House as the year goes by. The first one of their tests is that in the out years is a saving of some $70 million--over $150 million through to that out year and growing exponentially after that. That was a decision by the government to put in place a limitation on access to non-work related child care, to occasional care. We put in place a child-care system that this country can be proud of. It has gonefrom something like an expenditure when they were in office of $60 million a year to close to $1 billion now-from 40,000 places then to 240,000 places now. What we have said is we have a target, particularly related to work related child care, of taking that through to 350,000 by the end of the decade. Let me go through what is meant by this non-work related child care. It does not relate to a family who find themselves in a situation where they have a non-working partner and nevertheless are, at risk because that nonworking partner' is ill or because that nonworking partner has decided to go into training because thatnon-working partner wants to enter the work force. It does not relate to afainily where that non-working partner is in a family situation which is a highly risky one because there is child abuse or whatever involved in the family. It does not apply to any of those criteria. People in those situations get access to full child care. It applies' toone group and one group only-that is, those who are using occasional child care effectively for other purposes. It may be for playing tennis. It may be for going' shopping. It may be for doing a whole raft of totally acceptable and necessary public activities. We say they should get 12 hours worth of that subsidised by the government. We should not get into a situation where we are effectively providing preschools-inadequately staffed, inadequately organised preschools-and cost shifting from the states to the public sector. In case you do not understand this, when you go through the process of making budget changes and putting in place budget cuts, you have to take decisions. They have to be from time to time reasonably tough decisions. This is not a particularly tough decision, but it very material consequences for the provision of child care in this community-very materi:' al consequences if you are going to hit that target of 350,000. Because there is not the incentive to provide work related child care, there is not the incentive to rim child care places which offer the full range of hours that ought to be available to working parents, there is not the incentive to build them in the areas where there is real need, where the kids need to be looked after, we are putting in place a set of incentives that will produce situation. The first hurdle on a cut and the opposition falls at it. So do not wander around in this place saying that you will resist all the tax changes, that you will resist any tax increases, but you will support some spending cuts. You have only been tested once on that and so far you have failed. You have failed monumentally because you have accompanied your failure with a promise. which is now an undertaking-that you will not only not support the government's position but support 50 hours worth of non-work related child care. What are you going to do with the kids-put them in a kibbutz? This is an extraordinary promise-50 hours worth of non-work related child care. Do you know how much that costs-$1'12 billion? This is not me saying it; this is a Finance calculated cost on your proposition$1 '12, billion. That goes on top of Senator Ian Macdonald's statemen,t last wee-, ,which the Prime Minister referred to, ,about what he - as going to do in that littfe sleight of hand exercise. He nevertheless did choose to put a bit of a cost on the infrastructure projects. He said: The way of course to assure credibility is to commit in money terms an upper limit of the program-$l billion would be a commencing point for discussion. That is $2'12 billion now on the record. This is not the government putting up some notional spending or notional activities of the opposition. Those opposite have now put two things on the table-ne of which they have costed themselves and one of which Finance has been able to cost for them--costing $2'12 has billion, compounding their failure to come to grips with the first item. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition did not know what you had done. When this was mentioned the other week, he looked surprised that his cover had been completely blown. He made a statement in this place, stood up and said that he would support spending cuts. You have blown his cover on that. He looked with some mystification to you as to why that should be the case. You assured him that he need not be mystified, that that, yes, you had blown it for him. If it gets into the out year, it will get to $70 million. You have to put in place measures which provide an incentive to ensure that child care goes into the places where it is needed. You have to ensure that the states accept their proper responsibility to provide preschools. You certainly have to maintain, as the government maintains, that people who are not in the work force should nevertheless be able to get a decent shake at child care if they are at risk-a totally unfettered shake at child care, which is the government's position. But if they are not at risk and they are using occasional child care instead for totally reasonable purposes like they want to go shopping, play sport or get involved in voluntary activities-all the sorts of things that non working spouses do-yes, we say they should be allowed to do that, but 12 hours a week is entirely reasonable for subsidised care, as far as that is concerned. If those other measures were not put in place, it would massively blowout the budget for the government of the day if they are going to get work related child care as it is needed. When we put it in place to provide that incentive, that minor step, that mild direction, you fail at the hurdle. You have fallen at the first hurdle of a cut. You wander around the place saying, 'I'm the boy who wants to make quality cuts. I know about quality cuts.' You have had your first real cut to come up with and you have fallen over. Not only have you fallen over on that, you have allowed him to make an absurd promise of 50 hours of child care for people who are not seeking work related child care, costingFinance costing-$1 - billion on top of the $1 billion that Senator Ian Macdonald promised. You have no fiscal clothes at all-none whatsoever. The next time the firm of Laverne and Shirley or whatever-the two former members of the dream team-rocks out for its press conferences to have a chat about it might up be to, perhaps somebody might decide to discuss with these ingenues where it is they may well be headed in terms of their allegedly sensible economic policies. They fall at the hurdle on decent revenue measures; they fall at the hurdle on cuts. Interest Rates",54
141,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: aren't your attacks today on the Senates.o much overblown rhetoric? Isn't it the case that interest rates in Australia today are high because our trade deficit is worse than Mexico's?,56
142,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me just give four figures. When John Howard was last Treasurer,56
143,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,56
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those.on my left! The· Prime Minister might just wait until we get some order.,56
145,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,56
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The House will come to order. The Prime Minister has the call.,56
147,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a couple of handy little statistics here: on the day John Howard left office bank housing loan rates were 12.5 per cent; they are now 10.5 per cent. Building society housing loan rates when he left office were 13.9 per cent; they are now 10.5 per cent. At December 1982, the bank housing loan rate was 13.5 per cent and the building society housing loan rate was 14.8 per cent. We have seen a quite dramatic change to the level of interest rates, nominal and real, and to the underlying inflation rate. Let me just record the point that, since 1991, the average inflation rate has been 1.9 per cent. If you go back over the Labor years to 1983, the average rate of inflation was 5.5 per cent, but under John Howard the average rate was 9.7 per cent. It was twice the level of inflation as under this government and, of course, it was five times the level which now prevails. That is the core issue in Australian competitiveness. Mr Ronaldson-Tell us about Mexico.",56
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Ballarat will go to Mexico shortly.,56
149,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The hardest thing to deliver in this country by a long measure has been low inflation. Low inflation is the core matter in Australia's competitiveness. It is the core matter in the exchange rate, in wages and in the current account deficit in terms of our competitiveness, our capacity to export more goods and services, to import and to compete. None of these things can succeed without a low inflation rate. The people· over there say that they can manage money, but what they established in the 1970s and early 1980s was that they could not manage double digit inflation. They did not know what to do about it. They could not manage wages and they could not manage inflation. But the main problem with the current account was a fall in domestic savings occasioned by a decade and a half of double digit inflation, and most of that period was presided over by the current Leader of the Opposition, who had the opportunity to deal a mortal blow to inflation but who never had the policies, the courage or the wit to be able to do it. That is why the current account was six per cent of GDP in 1980-81, leaving that current account exposure there. The only way out of it is, basically, a change in the savings performance and capacity of the country. That will only come from a slow change to propensity to save, with the changed inflation performance. It will come, most obviously, with the budget coming back into surpluslikely that is, the public sector saving and not dissaving-and by a set of arrangements where we have contributions to savings by sl!peranannounced nuation. They are the very things that opposition wants to upset. The Leader of the Opposition's question and the reference to the Senate go to the question about fiscal policy and whether the nation is serious about bringing the budget back into surplus, whether we can stand up in markets anywhere in the world and say that the whole public sector· of Australia is not calling on one dollar of private savings. That is a very important statement to be· able make-that the whole of the public sector of Australia is not calling on any private savings and that, therefore, the funding of the current account deficit is done by people who then look at the underlying competitiveness of the country. That is what the opposition is putting at risk. That is what those opposite want to the government and the country. To inflict what they think is a short-term political to the government, they are prepared to inflict a long-term political cost on the community. Their cynicism will come up in the most obvious way, in interest rates and market sentiment about the Australian economy, the exchange rate and interest rates. No amount of histrionics is going to excuse the unprincipled behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter. These are not measures that should be downed in the Senate and the. Leader of the Opposition should not try to do so. If he wants to make a point about it, he can make a point about it, but, as I have said in this House, people should ring up and find out how much their tax cuts would be: anybody who promised tax cuts in a election and took them away five months later cannot make much of a point about anything. Maternity Allowance Mrs SILVIA SMITIl-I address my question to the Minister for Social Security. the Has the minister seen criticisms of the government's new maternity allowance? Will the minister please advise the House of the benefits of this allowance.",56
150,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members would be well aware that the government in the budget the introduction of the the new maternity allowance. It will be coming into effect from February 1996. The allowance is equal to six weeks of the parenting allowance, which at current rates of payment is around $816. In the current round of Accord negotiations the government has undertaken to review that in future with a view to improvement as budgetary circumstances permit. There have been a few unwarranted critito cisms. Some have criticised the payment on the basis that it is paid to women outside the work force. On the contrary, we see that as a strength of the payment in. that it goes well beyond the requirements of the ILO convention and recognises the reality of the modem labour market, and that is that people enter and exit the labour market all the time and therefore it would be illogical to restrict the deny provision only to those women who are most recently in jobs. Other criticisms have come cost from the opposition. The honourable member for Berowra said the allowance was not enough, thereby implying that the opposition might do a bit more, but the Leader of the Opposition, aka the battler's friend, said he thought it was a good thing but he accused us of engaging in copycat politics. That is what he said: copycat politics. I wonder who it was he was implying that we had been copying. Had he perchance been suggesting we had been copying the opposition? Have we been doing that? It is interesting to go back to the 1978 budget speech of the Leader of the Opposition. On that occasion",57
151,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,58
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will wait a minute.,58
153,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,58
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are already on overtime. The minister will bring his answer to a close.,58
155,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 1978 one of the measures that the now Leader of the Opposition and then Treasurer undertook, in what was one of the most vicious budgets in the .entire post-war period from the point of view of battlers, was to abolish a small maternity allowance which had been introduced in the first instance under the Fisher Labor government in 1912. This was an allowance of about $30, which he abolished. Justifying that abolition, in his 1978 speech he said: . ... maternity allowance has been superseded health care and family allowance arrangements. It is interesting that he brings those two things up. In .terms of health care arrangements what did he do then? He slashed the Medicare coverage to 40 per cent of the schedule fee. That was what he did for battlers on that occasion in terms of health care. What about family allowance? All he did there was a revenue neutral substitution of the family allowance for the old child tax rebate. It was a revenue neutral measure. All he did on that occasion was subtract from benefits to families. That is a total contrast with everything we have done for families. Every time we have introduced a measure it has been a major enhancement, an increase, in the real level of assistance for families. would' not pay that measly $30 maternity allowance. We will be paying a maternity allowance currently set at $816, which is six weeks of parenting allowance. By the time it comes into effect, almost certainly we will be paying significantly more than that because there will be an indexation adjustment in . September of the parenting allowance. Interestingly enough, in all probability, depending on how the June quarter CPI tums out, the increase in the maternity allowance that we will be paying as a result of that adjustment in September will exceed the total amount that this man was not prepared to pay families in 1978. , Same Sex Couples",58
156,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Prime Minister. Last week in answer to a question about recognition of same sex couples you said, 'This· is not a matter for government policy.' Have you now caught up with the fact that the definition of 'family' is currently being examined by the Attorney-General's Department as part of a review of the Sex Discrimination Act? Are you also now aware that the federal government will make a submission in August covering this issue to the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? Given that contrary to your earlier statement your government is clearly involved in addressing this issue, I ask you, Prime Minister: do you support the full recognition of same by sex couples, including the right to adopt children?",58
157,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Marriage Act is a Commonwealth act but the government has absolutely no plans to amend it-none. Hospitals,58
158,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Cost shifting from state to Commonwealth governments has a major impact on service delivery in public hospitals. Can the minister inform the House of what actions she has taken to ensure· that Commonwealth and state governments improve the level of service delivery in our public hospital system?,58
159,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for He the question because it shows that he understands the importance of good relations between the Commonwealth and the states and also that this underpins the Medicare agreement, something which appears to escape the opposition from time to time. I was very pleased to have discussions with all the state· ministers just two weeks ago in which we ,got agreement to ensure that there genuinely is universal health care through the Medicare agreements. It is not just about payments to doctors; it is about ensuring the proper level of funding for hospitals. I am sure that members. will be aware that there has been anincreasing proportion .of expenditure coming from the Commonwealth. While thilt funding has. been increasing, the state share has declined and the impact has been on waiting lists and public confidence-'-public confidence which we can ill afford to undermine, particularly given the position of the opposition so far as we can determine what it is. The health ministers have agreed to engage in bilateral negotiations with the Commonwealth. That will mean the line is drawn very firmly on future cost shifting and it will mean that there will be bonus funding for the states on performance. For the first time we will have agreed outcomes with the states, for instance on the level and quality of inpatient and outpatient services, benchmarks for elective surgery waiting times and performance levels for accident and emergency departments to stop them cost shifting, as happened catastrophically in New South Wales with the Port Macquarie hospital. It js now costing the new state government 30 per cent more to run that privatised hospital than for other public hospitals. It is 30 per cent more expensive. This is the so-called saving that was supposed to be due to privatisation. The states have realised, regardless of their political affiliation, that this is a game they not want to be a part of anymore. We will now be able to enter into very substantial agreements with the states to reduce waiting times for patients, to make sure that care is patient focused, to enable one stop shopping instead of jumping around between various facilities and to enable a more rational and efficient hospital system. I make this point because Labor is clearly able to tackle the big issues and still deliver on major administrative and policy reform. These are very concrete strategies which focus on patients and delivering value. I can draw some comparisons, in so far as we are able to make them, between our policies and the Liberal's lack of . health policies. I think it is fair enough-although there is a loud outcry every time it is doneto look at the past form of the opposition to see what its future performance will be like. We do not have any other evidence to go on-the opposition does not have any concrete policies-so we have to go back and see what it did in the past. At the moment, the Leader of the Opposition. and the opposition spokesman on health are saying that they will keep Medicare-they are behind Medicare and they are behind bulk-billing. But what does that actually mean? We had similar assurances from one conservative Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, when asked whether he would support the then Medibank",58
160,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,59
161,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, because this is the form guide. This is what you have done in the past. You have said before that Medibank should be supported. Now what are you saying?",59
162,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,59
163,Mr SPEA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,R-Order! The minister will wait. I will get silence so she can proceed.,59
164,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We must look at the opposition's performance ihthe past, because opposition members have said exactly the same thing before: they would support Medibank. They are saying now that they will support MediCare. One month after the last time they got into government-and it will be do a long time before they get into government again-they had an inquiry and following that made six changes to Medibank: mark 2 in 1976, mark 3 in 1978, mark 4 in 1978, mark 5 in 1979 and mark 6 in 1981. These changes progressively ensured that people paid more and it also broke down the universality of Medicare. Anyone who believes that the <?pposition is now behind Medicare is wrong-absolutely wrong. We need to ask the opposition what level of co-payment there should be. Brendan Nelson reckons that there should be no bulkbilling. The Leader of the Opposition says that there will be. But at what level-30 per cent, 40 per cent, 50 per cent? We need to hear from the opposition, otherwise the form guide is all we have to go on. Women: Representation in Parliament",59
165,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the coalition will enter the next election with the same number of women candidates as Labor, if not more? Given that the Prime Minister made much of Labor's affirmative action plan to achieve 35 per cent female representation by the year 2002, will the Prime Minister now say which of his male colleagues he will demand leave parliament to avoid the gender traffic jam as 2002 approaches? If not, will he admit that this was just a cheap publicity stunt to make him seem more women friendly?",60
166,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are a long way in front at the moment. That is the first observation. Opposition members-No you aren't.,60
167,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left.,60
168,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second observation is that it is a completely reasonable aspiration for the women of this country to have a much higher proportion of the representation in the parliaments than they now have. Because of the selection systems of both major parties, we have come through this century and the number of women in parliament has not reached the level that it should have. Therefore, the Labor Party has taken the decision to change its policy by affirmationMr Costello-Did George Campbell support it?",60
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Mr Howard interjecting,60
170,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, do you think you should pop a valium or something into him?",60
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is not really helping. The Prime Minister has the call.,60
172,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,60
173,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Someone over here just said that we should give him a hot bath and put him in a draught, but that is too tough. I believe that, by taking these sorts of i approaches, we will see a higher proportion of women representatives in parliament. Because of the sort of chauvinism which exists within the coalition, such a change has not been possible. Coalition members knew of no way to increase female representation, so they slithered around the issue, explaining, 'Don't worry; we will have more women.' I know they will not, and they know they will not. I would have thought the questioner would have understood that and saved herself the embarrassment of having to hear me say itthat is, the opposition will not have that. On this side, a very large part of the changed status of Australian women has been delivered by this government. The overwhelming part of the change in sentiment, that background in public policy which has changed the status of Australian women, has been delivered by this government. It has been true in big and major areas of policy and it has been true in parliamentary representation. As the end of the century moves closer, it will be more true. Papua New Guinea",60
174,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of developments in aid delivery to Bougainville, Papua New Guinea?",60
175,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. In doing so, I commend him and the right honourable member for New England, who recently represented Australia at the coming into office of the Bougainville Transition Government. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the Premier of Bougainville and the BTG and of his delegation. I am pleased to say that the security situation in Bougainville has improved towards a peaceful settlement. As that situation has improved, the focus of Australia's aid has likewise been changed to concentrate on the longer term rehabilitation of that troubled province. We have provided over $7 million to Bougainville since 1991, focusing on health, education and communication needs. That includes medical supplies, shelter, household equipment for those in care centres, textbooks; equipment to restore communications, water pumps, generators for five high schools and assistance for health services, restoration of educational programs and nongovernment organisation rehabilitation projects. In early 1994 and in response to requests from Papua New Guinea, I approved a package of assistance valued at a further $10 million over the years 1994 and 1995. Of that, $2Y2 million has already been spent and the remaining $7Y2 million has been programmed for activities in the health, infrastructure and education sectors. A number of major capital works associated with water supply and power needs for schools and hospitals are currently under way. Detailed designs have been completed for the refurbishment of five health facilities, the construction of two wharves and the further rehabilitation of education facilities. Those priorities which have been endorsed by the Bougainville Transition Government. The implementation of those activities is likely to start in the next few months-subject of course to ongoing assessment of the security situation on Bougainville. To help the PNG government and the Bougainville Transition Government to consolidate the already significant move towards peace and to build confidence in the province, I announced today that I have decided to allocate a further $10 million for the Bougainville restoration program up to 1997. This assistance will be provided within our overall bilateral aid program to PNG and will concentrate again on health, education and infrastructure to enable people to resume normal life. Australia believes it would be a good thing if other donors were encouraged to contribute to the restoration efforts on Bougainville. That process will be assisted by the report of a UN mission which has recently been there. I conclude by saying that the restoration of the province depends fundamentally on the peace process, including reconciliation of all groups on Bougainville and the provision by the PNG government of adequate funding. We are doing our part. That capacity of Papua New Guinea to help will be assisted by its general economic recovery. That, in tum, will be helped by the anticipated successful conclusion of a package between the Papua New Guinean government, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.",60
176,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA NA",61
177,Mr SPEAKER,CENTRE,"Before I call the honourable member for Goldstein, who wishes to make a personal explanation, I indicate that I have just been given advice which I think all members should be made aware of. I understand members have been either written directly to or, I am sure, lobbied by the nurses centre in respect of some difficulties that we are encountering there. I therefore inform are honourable members that the Joint House Department is responsible for the provision of emergency first aid and other health care services through the nurses centre. An evaluation of the nurses centre was carried out by the Joint House Department in 1994. This evaluation followed advice received from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on the proper organisation of occupational health and safety within Parliament House. The Nursing Federation was consulted in regard to the terms of reference for the review, and the staff of the centre were involved in the process. The evaluation report indicated changes in the role of the nurses centre. Other changes, particularly the upgrading and relocating of OH&S functions following legislative changes in 1991, have impacted on the responsibilities of that nurses centre. In April 1995 a copy of the report, together with the management response to the report, was provided to the Australian Nursing Federation. Discussions have been continuing with the Australian Nursing Federation, the most recent taking place last Friday, 23 June 1995. At that meeting, the Joint House'Department representatives undertook to. seek further information on the appropriate classification of the positions. The views of the Department of Industrial Relations have been sought and it has agreed with the classifications proposed. Further meetings will be held with that department in respect of this matter. At this stage, no action' has been taken to change the classification of the positions. My latest advice, however, is that at 4.00 p.m. the nurses withdrew their services. Consideration is being given as to whether the Industrial Relations Commission should be notified of an industrial dispute. Can I say that, on behalf of both the President and me, every effort will be made to resolve this matter. NA",61

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. . Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: . 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations neces. sary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel; the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3.

Family Day Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, being Family Day Caregivers and/or Parent users of Family Day Care Services, draws to the attention of the house to the threat to the continuation of Family Day Care services, J the loss o- thousands of childcare places, the loss of employment for thousands of caregivers, resulting from the introduction of an award for Self Employed Caregivers. Your petitioners therefore pray· that the House recommends, with regard to the ALP Working Party, set up under resolution No. 164R 'to consider the implementation of the provision of better wages and conditions for home based child care workers' , that the Government seek input from the stake holders: the 15,087* Family Day Caregivers the Parents of the 76,356* children using Family Day Care, the Sponsors of the FDC schemes, before making any decisions. by Mr Melham (from 30 citizens), Mr Ruddock (from 17 citizens) and Mr Sinclair (from 109 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned concerned citizens In the State of Queensland draws to the attention of the House to: The screening on our national television channel of the GayJLesbian Mardi Gras. Yours petitioners therefore pray that the House will Ban any future telecast of Sydney's (or any other cities) gay/lesbian mardi gras from our national television channel. by Mr Bradford (from 22 citizens). Safe Sex Guide To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in assembled in Parliament : The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully show that: 1. We are opposed to the sex guide endorsed by the Honourable C. Lawrence, Minister for Human Services and Health in the Keating Government, and published in the December 1994 issue of Cleo. 2. We believe that the sex guide encourages dangerous sexual practices which could have serious medical and moral effects. We request the House to calIon Dr Lawrence to withdraw her endorsement of this sex guide and for the Prime Minister, the Honourable PJ Keating, to indicate his disapproval. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Cadman (from 24 citizens). Kingsford Smith Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that a large number of people are being adversely affected by the operations of Kingsford Smith Airport. To reduce this intolerable situation, the scaling down of operations at Kingsford Smith Airport is needed. Your petitioners therefore request the House to oppose the proposeq privatisation of Kingsford Smith Airport. by Mrs Easson (from 544 citizens). Breast Cancer To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: Mardi Gras The petition of certain residents of Australia draws to the attention of the House their concern that many people with breast cancer do not have access to expensive drugs, such as Taxol, that may prolong their li.fe and relieve their pain. Your petitioners ask the House to ensure that people with breast cancer have access to Taxol or its equivalent through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. by Ms Fatin (from 5,173 citizens). Mobile Telephone Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the huge service gap in a wide area of North West Victoria in respect to the provision of mobile telephone services. In an area which covers almost a quarter of the State of Victoria less than 15 per cent is serviced by mobile telephone. Quick communication is no longer seen as a luxury but a necessity both in the business and private world and the communities concerned would benefit both economically and socially through the availability of a mobile telephone system. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will take measures to ensure the Telecommunications (Standards of Service) Amendment Bill 1994 is passed by the Parliament thus ensuring that the standard telephone definition becomes more relevant to current consumer needs and more responsive to future technological developments and thereby embrace the provision of mobile telephone services to larger areas of rural Australia. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Forrest (from 213 citizens). Transsexual and Transgenderist To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia on behalf of the Transsexual and Transgenderist Communities of the Commonwealth of Australia draw to the attention of the House about the Anomalous Legal and Social Status of both the Transsexual and Transgenderist Communities and their need to have appropriate Legislation which addresses their Legal and Social Status. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House, (1) Establish a Commission of Inquiry to investigate both the Transsexual and Transgenderist Communities Anomalous Legal and Social Status with a view to enacting legislation to redress complicated Judicial and Administrative procedures, Discrimination and Health Care issues experienced by members of both communities. (2) Develop in consultation with all state of the Commonwealth of Australia uniform legislation which provides appropriate recognition and protection for all persons diagnosed as being Gender Dysphoric. (3) That the Commonwealth of Australia develop and implement in consultation with representatives from both the Transsexual and Transgenderist Communities from all States and Territories of the Commonwealth of Australia an appropriate Social Justice Package which addresses their various and specific Legal and Social needs. (4) It is requested that all proceedings of a Commission of Inquiry be concluded prior to the next General Election and that representatives of both communities be involved in the implementaTax tion of the outcomes. by Mr Gear (from 881 citizens). Audio Tapes and Compact Discs The Honourable the Speaker and Members of House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House that music lyrics that are sexually explicit, physically violent and promote the use and abuse of drugs available to children of any age at most record stores. Your petitioners therefore request the House apply a classification similar to the classifications used on Films and Videos on all such Audio Tapes and Compact Discs and to place a restriction on the sale of music containing such lyrics to minors. by Mr Nehl (from 18 citizens). Austudy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Communities House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain. . . Citizens of Australia. Draws to the Attention of the House... The deficiencies in the current Austudy scheme. Your petitioners therefore request the House to, Grant all Higher Education students independent status. by Mr Sinclair (from 20 citizens). Austudy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain. . . Citizens of Australia.

Your petitioners therefore request the House to, Introduce rental assistanae for away from home or independent students. by Mr Sinclair (from 20 citizens). Sales Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of the undersigned shows: Wethe undersigned citizens respectfully submit our opposition to the announced imposition of Sales of 12% on basic hardware and building products by the Federal Government from July 1 1995. The petitioners note particularly that: 1. This new tax will directly affect ordinary Australians in the form of rising prices of building, the maintaining and improving their home and by consequential job losses and company closures in draws an industry which has faced many economic containing pressures over recent years. 2. The new tax offers no net benefit to Australia are freely and should be abandoned. Your petitioners request Parliament not pass this legislation when it is presented and/or work to to prevent this taxation measure from being implemented by the current Federal Government. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Somlyay (from 102 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest support of the existing National Flag. The Australian National Flag is the most important symbol of the Australian nation and our national unity, and has evoked deep feelings of honour and respect from many generations of Australians. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian National Flag and to ensure that its design is not changed without the support of a referendum carried by the majority of Australians in the majority of States and in which the existing Flag is offered as an option. by Mr Truss (from 64 citizens). Hazardous Substances: Labelling To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of regional South Australia draws to the attention of the House that the proposed Hazardous Substances Legislation, seeks to change the warning labelling alerting consumers to the danger of all hazardous substances from red to an unspecified colour. We, the petitioners feel that the colour of this alert on the labelling is of vital importance-with the whole community being aware of the significance of RED for danger, or stop and look. Your petitioners therefore request the House that this change to labelling not be made when the proposed changes are passed. Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Wakelin (from 114 citizens). Triple J FM To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of regional South Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Youth Radio Network, Triple J FM, is at present only available to the residents of Adelaide and areas within approximately one hundred kilometres thereof. We believe that the youth of regional SA are entitled to access the fastest growing radio network in the country. Your petitioners therefore request the House to make funding available for the expansion of the Triple J network to regional South Australia. Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Wakelin (from 15 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Victoria: Privatisation",62
190,Mr CLEARY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On Sunday, yesterday, there was a major protest in Melbourne over the proposed selling of Victoria's electricity, gas and water. Regrettably, the focus continues to be on the Kennett government as though the federal ALP is unequivocally opposed to the privatisation of public assets. It is as though the Victorian State Bank and a publicly owned Qantas and Commonwealth Bank n-ver existed. Publicly, it serves the ·Left of the Victorian ALP to claim that it is Jeff Kennett alone who is driving privatisation. I cannot stand Kennett's. politics or his public school, bullyboy bravado but I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Mr Kennett are soul brothers on the question of the sale of public assets. To deviate in any way from the script would lead workers into direct confrontation with the federal ALP. That is a point not lost on some Left members of this House who, according to reports in today's Melbourne Herald Sun, are asking the government to remember its traditional ALP values before the old working class takes control of the situation and starts attacking the federal Labor Party over its privatisation agenda. What is also instructive is that ALP members of the Victorian parliament are jumping over each other in their quest to escape Kennett and take up a seat in the federal parliament. The three seats the refugees from the state parliament are chasing are Maribyrnong; Wills and Batman. Those who are chasing the seats are blokes, and they are all from the state party. Instead of facilitating a debate about the direction of the Labor Party, they want to engage in what they do best-that is, number crunch their way into a federal seat. It is disgraceful. It is one thing to run, join or try to co-opt a Public First campaign against Kennett; it is another to seriously address the obsession with privatisation which exists at both the federal and the state level. Perhaps the best thing the federal Labor Party has going· for it in Victoria is Jeff Kennett. In fact, the existence of Jeff Kennett and the Treasurer, Alan Stockdale, provides a perfect camouflage for federal market-driven policies which include wholesale sell-offs of public assets. It is no surprise that anyone defending public utilities in this House is labelled as Albanian. The ALP Left needs to remember that the old catchcries of 'reds under the bed' and the current catchcries of 'that is Albanian politics' are not directed solely at me; they are directed at members of the Left of the Labor Party, both federal and state. It is about time those members actually worked out where they stood with the New Right of the Labor Party .. Mr Gibson interjecting",65
191,Mr CLEARY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I think you could do it a bit more to your mate from Werriwa. A large part of the pressure on state governments to sell assets derives from the federal government's continuing reduction in funding to the states. Since 1983 federal grants to the states have been regularly reduced. In 1983 Commonwealth grants were $9.5 billion per annum; in 1994-95 they fell to $7.2 billion. State privatisation is a consequence of reduced federal funding, and federal privatisation is a less than cunning attempt to improve the balance sheet in order.to win an election. The federal government has the ability, under its Foreign Investment Review Board powers, to block the sale of Victoria's United Energy to a government owned French nuclear power company, but it is clear from the Prime Minister's answer to my question last week that it is the last thing he has in mind. It is one thing to proclaim a republic as being in the nation's genuine interest but it is another to use the FIRB regulations to stop a public asset being sold to a foreign enterprise. His answer last week would have given no solace to those genuinely opposed to the privatisation of public assets. Later this week the parliament will debate a bill which enshrines competition and the private service delivery of gas, water and electricity. It is the kind of bill and the kind of philosophy which would have produced Jeff Kennett even if he did not exist. It is the kind of philosophy that the Labor Party Left knows is blurring the difference between Labor and Liberal. The federal government's competition policy, if Professor Hilmer's comments are any indication, would open up to private ownership water pipelines, reservoirs, pumping stations and even municipal fountains and .fish ponds. To stand up and condemn Jeff Kennett at a rally in Melbourne and to then vote for competition policy which forces privatisation on the states, regardless of the Kennett-Stockdale agenda, has to be the last straw. It is this duplicity that ordinary people, the real battlers, are becoming sick and tired of. When Kennett proposed the widening of the Tullamarine freeway and thl(application of a tollway, which in effect meant the further privatisation of transport, the state ALP vociferously· registered its opposition and organised a local meeting. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), spoke at the meeting and declared his and his government's opposition. It was said that an environmental impact statement would have to be acquired first and that this would probably stop the widening of the freeway. When the state party's Transport 2000 policy came out, which was the most poorly kept secret in town, its support for widening the freeway was there in print. In the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where unemployment levels are once again on the rise, any Labor politician truly concerned about the damage inflicted by Kennett would be advocating government expenditure in local capital projects, and there are ample opportunities. Through the Better Cities program, the federal government )could fund a Sydney road development project, support the community arts and ensure that the Upfield railway line was upgraded and extended to Craigieburn. To concentrate almost exclusively on, and not complement, training programs when local people are crying out for the allocation of money for urban refurbishment relegates the area to a poor relation. The ALP candidate for Wills will run around gla:dhanding constituents and telling them that unemployment has dropped to 8.6 per cent when the reality is that the north-west recorded a rise of 2.2 per cent between June 1994 and May 1995. All the selfproclaimed ALP duty senator for Wills, Kim Carr, will say publicly is that comparing statistics from one month to another does not provide an accurate account of trends. Fancy claiming that contrasting the increase in unemployment in the north-west with the decline of unemployment in Victoria does not take into account the trend! It gets worse. The duty senator defends the $1.2 billion cuts to the Working Nation package on the grounds that the program was delivering jobs more efficiently than before. The truth is the north and west of Melbourne have not been recipierits of the so-called recovery. It is unquestionable that the Kennett regime, with its gambling, events. led agenda, has harmed Victoria and the north and west of Melbourne. But to claim that the only villain is Kennett is, to use the Prime Minister's language, arrant nonsense. In the 1990s trade unions which seek wage increases are described as pursuing 'aggressive money wage increases', and you can imagine who that came from. Telecom and Australia Post will obviously be in the firing line if the ALP is still In power and it sees the need to privatise in order to adjust the budget. If those who march against the sale of public utilities are not aware of the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Bank or do not see any danger for Telecom or Australia Post and the employment of Commonwealth public sector workers, then they are not looking situation. If they believe that the dominant thinkers of the ALP are ideologically opposed to the sale of public assets, they are horribly wrong. Working Nation Mr GmSON (Moreton) (4.44 p.m.)-When history does its assessment of this decade and the achievements of government of this decade, I believe the Working Nation statement will go down as one of the greatest achievements of this government or any government in Australia. I wish to place on record my congratulations both to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) for the outstanding work that they have done. It is not just rhetoric to be able to make these pronouncements. One only has to look at what has been achieved, such as the reduction in the unemployment figures throughout Australia and the increase in the numbers of those, particularly the long-term unemployed, who have been able to gain employment through the initiatives of Working Nation. What Working Nation represented was a real sea change in our whole attitude towards the process of assisting members of the community to gain the necessary skills and the opportunities to gain full-time employment. It put in place a comprehensive array of programs to subsidise the employment of those people who had been out of the work force for a great length of time and therefore needed work experience, exposure to new skills and the opportunity to learn new skills. It also represented a major change in our attitude towards young people. The job figures which have been as a result of the initiatives in Working Nation are proof that that sea change in attitudes, that total new commitment by this government to working people and those people in our community who wish to work, has lived up to all the expectations. We have had a decline in unemployment from almost 11 per cent down to 8.4 per cent. That has been a significant achievement and it has affected all levels of society. As I said, I wish to congratulate the carefully at the minister for that. Part of the process has been a total change in attitude by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In the past, I have been critical of the department. I have found that sometimes it has been a bit of a struggle to get the department to understand some basic issues with regard to what it needed to do to get out there and tackle problems for particular communities. I have expressed views about DEET and its inability to look after people, particularly those with disabilities, and help to get them into the work force. I am on the public record as having expressed those views. There has been a total change of attitude by the department. There is a new philosophy. When a member of parliament comes to the department and says, 'This is the problem I have in my electorate. What can you do?', instead of the department saying, 'Sorry, we don't have a line item for that; we don't have any program that can deal with that; go away,' in the last 12 to 18 months we have had a totally new change. The department now says, 'Yes, this is the problem. Let's look at how we can make our programs fit to solve your problem.' The department is working to do that. It is a refreshing change for me as a member of parliament to find that, instead of my having to find which line in the budget I might be able to wrangle a few dollars from to fix this problem or to get a service for a particular section of my electorate, the departinternational ment is now saying, 'Yes, we can help you; we will make sure we find a way to fix this particular problem and to service this particular group of people.' That is a very constructive and a very positive change. As the local federal member in my electorate, I have taken very seriously the role of having the responsibility for trying to find ways of getting the unemployed in my electorate back into jobs, back into training programs and leading productive lives. I have done that in a number of ways. These are all very clear signs that the department is recognising its responsibility. I have been involved in the area consultative committee. DEET has established a number of these committees around the country which involve business, industry, training providers, community representatives and political figures in the area. It has set up these advisory committees to assist DEET in understanding what the issues are and ways we cari help members of our local community to find jobs and get back into work. What we are looking at is: what are the challenges? What are the needs in our area? What are the challenges that certain people face? How can we address those needs? How can we find ways to overcome those challenges? Our area consultative committee is chaired by Mr George Keryk, a business person who is Managing Director of BOC Gas. He is doing an outstanding job and we have a great committee going. I have also been encouraging my local companies to get into exporting. I have highlighted to a lot of my local companies what support is available to them and how they can get access to the relevant government programs. I am getting the companies that are producing high quality products for the domestic market to start thinking about exporting. I had a business breakfast with Senator Cook when he was in my electorate a few weeks ago. He said to the local business people, 'If you are competing in the Australian market and producing goods for the Australian market then you are part of the marketplace. You are producing goods that are as good as anything else in the world. If you can compete effectively in the Australian market, you can compete anywhere in world.' That is the very strong message which I am trying to get across to the companies in my electorate. Only about 10 per cent of those companies are involved in exporting yet all of them are producing good quality goods that could be made available in the export market. If we get the companies out there in the community to export then we sell more Australian products and produce more jobs. That will get the people in my electorate back into employment. I have also been involved in spreading the word about Bizhelp, the computer program available from the Department of)ndustry, Science and Technology. I have distributed it to a number of groups in my electorate and it is available in my office. it to the Southside Chamber of Commerce and the Marymac employment group. Those groups are working with a lot of different companies. Bizhelp lets local companies know the full range of Commonwealth and state government programs that can assist businesses to grow and to export. We are trying to get that information out and make it as accessible as possible. I have been making sure that my local employment groups, indus! try advisory groups and the Southside Chamber of Commerce have direct access to Bizhelp and that they let their members know about the service. There is one issue in the employment that we still need to do some further work on-that is, migrants. I believe that we need to change our attitudes to assisting migrants into the workplace. I have had some discusplants, sions about this issue with the skillshare hospitals. centres, the Marymac employment group-a community based employment group-and the DEET offices in my electorate. It is clear from those discussions that very significant group of long-term unemwaste, ployed in Queensland-and I do not think is unique to Queensland; I think it happens across Australia-is migrants, particularly refugee migrants who have been allowed come here for humanitarian reasons and who have not had their qualifications and expericonsumption ences tested. When they come here they not have the necessary skills to enter into the work force. I believe the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs needs to work very closely with the Department of Employment, Educaprocess tion and Training in this regard. We should assisting those humanitarian and refugee migrants who land on Australian shores with language training, placing them in accommoas dation that is suitable for their families, putting them in contact with an employment or training adviser who can identify their needs and find out where they might be were appropriately placed. We should not leave to chance that they will contact a local migrant liaison officer and hopefully find job. We need to meet them at their point entry and identify their needs straight away.

192,Mr MCGAURAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish to address the topic of cogeneration. All members may not be familiar with this topic because, after all, it is not an issue that dominates question time. I will attempt to give honourable members my best technical definition. Cogeneration is the production of electricity and useful thermal energy from a single fuel source. A typical cogeneration plant comprises gas turbines or gas engines driving electric generators with a heat recovery system installed to recover area thermal energy from exhaust gas or from water used to cool these engines. This thermal energy can then be supplied to nearby industrial or commercial users, such as commercial food processing plants, paper mills and Of course, there are many atypical cogeneration plants in existence now and planned for the future. Alternate fuel sources include one biomass of all descriptions, such as wood gas from rubbish dumps and almost it any other energy producing source you can think of. Encouragingly, experience in other countries indicates potential for significant to growth in cogeneration in Australia. At present, about three per cent of electricity demand is met by cogeneration do at some 70 sites around Australia. While a few industrial processes have used cogeneration for decades, these have been largely isolated instances. For these operations, the particular nature of the industrial produced significant surplus energy be which could be used to meet a demand for electricity on the same site. These opportunities did not constitute a cogeneration industry they were rare and there was often no and market for the surplus electricity. The issues of buyback rates, equitable access and incentives which confront us today quite irrelevant then. But with the breakit up of the market monopoly held by state utilities, the opportunity is open for generators of a varying sizes and make-up to find a niche in of the new national competitive electricity market. Increased energy efficiency demanded by unrelenting pressure on business input costs and our heightened awareness of environmental issue have also driven the development of cogeneration. These fundamental forces have ushered in a new era, where cogeneration at many small sites is a real possibility. For instance, a hospital running boilers to circulate hot water and steam may find it attractive to generate electricity from the waste heat. But at these small sites, the lack of economies of scale reduces the financial return from installing or modifying plant for cogeneration. For a viable industry, you need a fair return on these initial capital costs. The price of electricity generated from cogeneration must also be competiti ve in the new market. As a result of these conflicting financial pressures, the development of the cogeneration industry is poised somewhat delicately on a knife edge. A clear opportunity for cogenerators has opened up, but how far that opportunity can be pursued depends crucially on the pricing of the product. In remote and rural regions the situation is more favourable. Cogeneration should be very attractive in areas where the electricity grid does not reach as the competition will often be expensive diesel generators. Even where mains power is available in rural areas, high connection fees and tariffs will make cogeneration competitive in many situations. But in the cities and larger towns the demand for electricity is such that distributors of grid power will strenuously defend their share of the new competitive market. Economies of scale mean that they will be able to shave operating margins to ensure they retain market share. Gloomy as this sounds, it does not spell the end of cogeneration in urban locations as the principal benefits from cogeneration, such as energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction, are increasingly recognised by governments and by public policy commentators. But the question then is what other forces are shaping the development of cogeneration and how best to position the industry to maximise its evident potential. The most crucial force shaping cogeneration is the fundamental change occurring in the energy market in Australia, which would have been hard to imagine just a decade ago. Around Australia the dismantling of government utility structures and associated monopolies in the energy industries are well advanced. In the new market the ability to remain competitive by absorbing costs through efficiency improvements will be more crucial than ever in enhancing market share. The increased energy efficiency resulting from cogeneration will therefore be very attractive. The coalition believes that increased energy efficiency is a key element in reducing input costs for business, putting more flexibility in household budgets and minimising greenhouse gas emissions. The Commonwealth government Department of Primary Industries and Energy has estimated that there is a potential for Australia to save some $7 billion a year out of a total domestic energy bill of $35 billion. About 43 per cent of these savings are achievable from the more efficient use of electricity. A coalition government would improve energy efficiency by encouraging the use of energy efficient building construction and design, minimising air conditioning costs and encouraging the use of energy efficient plant and appliances. Such measures usually involve an initial capital cost, which can then be recouped through lower operating costs. Education of consumers in energy saving practices is also an important element of improved energy efficiency. In government, the coalition will target energy efficiency programs to address the areas of greatest need, including adopting energy efficient equipment by businesses and adopting a leading role through government procurement and operations. In government, - the coalition will encourage the development of the cogeneration industry by removing impediments and encouraging the streamlining of approvals for the siting of cogeneration facilities, investigating incentive schemes to promote cogeneration and educating industry as to the benefits of cogeneration. In conclusion, the cogeneration industry is a very exciting industry to watch. Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries",69
193,Mr CLEELAND,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"MCEwen) (5.00 p.m.)Some months ago in this House I drew attention to matters arising from the report prepared by the Textile, Clothing and wear Union of Australia called The Hidden Cost of Fashion. In that report the union clearly outlined the outrageous circumstances now arising in Australia in the outreach industry where people work at home for what can be described only as slave wages and slave conditions. In the report, the TCFUA estimated that there are now about 300,000 outworkers in the clothing industry-and that is a huge increase over the last five years. This has occurred as garment production in Australia has moved from the factory to the home, some argue in an effort to improve competitiveness against imports. The report estimated that home based workers in the clothing industry outnumber factory based workers by about 14 to one. The effect of this is that there is little control over working conditions and pay rates, with numerous cases of exploitation and intimidaville, tion reported by outworkers, most of whom country. come from non-English-speaking backgrounds, particularly the Vietnamese and Chinese communities but also Turkish, SpanAustralian ish, Cambodian and other ethnic groups. What concerns me most is that the outreach industry appears to be also subject to control by organised criminality. It is clear that the outreach industry is outside the control of any regulations in Australia. In my home state of Victoria, for example, there is no control any more on factory legislation and there is no control on labour inspection at all. In fact, under the Victorian department of labour, I not think there are any inspectors of labour left. Hence no-one is going out into the community doing any checks on or controlthrough ling what is occurring in the outreach indusused try. After I made that speech, I received quite a bit of correspondence and phone calls people. Some of the correspondents were very critical of me. Country Road was very critical of me and suggested that I was wrong to name Country Road as a company that was using products from the outreach Ken Done's company also contacted me and was very critical. But a lot of people who know what is happening in the industry thanked me for that speech and have encourFootaged me to again raise these issues. For example, one gentleman from Yarraville in Melbourne rang me and said that from his window he was watching a house across the road which has a double carport. Around the double carport there was a bit of canvass and in within the carport, which is open, were 24 sewing machines. He tells me that those sewing machines operate 24 hours a day and the people come in and out basically on shift work. At night-time they bum the lights. He mentioned how cold it is in winter sitting in an open garage with a bit of canvass around you. These places run 24 hours a day, in total contradiction of all labour acts and factory acts in this country. You would have thought we had come a long way from the Industrial Revolution and the sorts of conditions that 18th century England had but, from the way this gentleman described the place in Yarrait is very clear they still exist in this But even worse is the report in the Weekend of 15 and 16 April which refers to an investigation by the Australian Taxation Office. The report indicates that there is a rogue element in the textile industry and that it is getting very sophisticated in tax avoidance. The article points out that gone are the days when employers simply paid their lowskilled migrant workers in cash to avoid the tax man. The report says that the Australian Federal do Police has uncovered a major cheque laundering scam in which suppliers and buyers collude to have legitimate payments made third parties to avoid tax. The cash is to pay subcontractors and outworkers in the outreach industry in the textile trade. The report indicates that, based on 1992 tax from research, the Australian Taxation Office estimates that the clothing industry avoids about $100 million a year in pay-as-you-earn tax deductions and a further $70 million a year through undeclared profits and false industry. deduction claims. But, as a report on the industry by the felt and textile union indicates, there is also massive Department of Social Security fraud, in that many of the outreach workers are instructed or forced to apply for unemployment benefits by the contractors who provide them with the work in order to get the contracts. In that way they can undercut the price they are offering the outreach worker. They also get the outreach worker in a criminal situation by defrauding DSS and avoiding tax. So they have the outreach worker locked into the contractor-a classic case of organised criminality known throughout most Western countries where these things happen as extortion. I have no doubt whatsoever that organised crime now controls the outreach industry in this country. I have no doubt whatsoever that Australian taxpayers are subsidising this outreach industry to well over $250 million a year. That is a massive scam in anyone's language; yet it seems to me that no-one is doing anything about it. My attention was drawn to this by people in the industry. I was invited to look at a factory on the north coast of New South Wales-a factory which had the latest technology in felt and textile production. It had computer systems for organising the flow rate of the garment production and it had the latest sewing machines. You name it, the factory had it. This factory closed putting 800 workers out of a job-800 people who were being paid according to award conditions; 800 people who were producing at a competitive price as against imports. This factory was competing successfully against imports from Asian countries, but it could not compete against the scams taking place in the garages and backyards of Australian outreach workers. That is what put this company out of business. I was reliably informed that this firm could produce a fashion garment for K-Mart or similar stores for $6. It could produce it for $6 .complying with factory acts, workers compensation acts, award wages and treating its employees civilly. The firm was put out of business because the outreach industry was producing the same garment for $3. One has to ask: what is wrong in this country when a legitimate business employing people under decent industrial awards and treating them like civilised workers should be treated is put out of business by an industry which does not pay tax and which is subsidised by DSS? Why is this being allowed? It is time some state governments started' employing factory inspectors again to go out into the streets of Melbourne in particular and Sydney to start investigating what is occurring in the outreach industry. Even further, I would like to see a major inquiry into the whole outreach industry. When there is clear evidence of tax avoidance of over $170 million a year and when there is clear evidence of massive fraud under the Department of Social Security, it is time that a major inquiry was instigated to examine this stinking, foul industry and to put it totally out of business. I will certainly be contacting ministers in this government and putting that proposition to them, and I will certainly be contacting state ministers asking them to start to intervene, so that legitimate business, genuine business, in Australia can compete not against imports but against the unfair competition of a subsidised racket which is occurring in Australia. Moore Preselection",71
194,Mr FILING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the brief time left to me, I rise to speak about a number of matters pertaining to the recent history of the Western Australian Liberal Party and, in particular, the preselection for the seat of Moore and related items. The person who was illegally endorsed as the candidate for Moore for the Liberal Party in Western Australia the other day was quoted as saying that I became an Independent member to avoid some sort of kangaroo court inquiry that has been established by the Crichton-Browne, Cheryl Edwards faction or clique within the Moore division. This particular so-called 'inquiry' is being put together as a means-a very poor means-of trying to discredit me. The following are amongst the grounds or terms of this inquiry. The first issue is the role of Dr Wayne Bradshaw in the 1987 Paul Filing campaign for the former seat of Cowan and the 1989 Brian Cooper campaign for the seat of Wanneroo. The elements of this particular inquiry obviously refer to Dr Wayne Bradshaw's involvement within the Liberal Party in the Moore division and, more substantially, his contacts and involvement with the city of Wanneroo-a matter that became the subject of quite an important inquiry, the Cahill report, which was conducted into the city of Wanneroo and. published in 1992 in Perth. One of the problems that Mr Cahill found when he reported on this matter was that it was almost impossible to get any information out of Dr Bradshaw, who obviously was integral to the inquiry. The irony of this particular inquiry which has been called for by some members of the Moore division-who are supporters of the clique to which I have referred-is that, in actual fact, I would be only too happy to see a full judicial inquiry being held into the aspects of the business dealings of the former Mayor, Wayne Bradshaw; the now sitting member for the seat of Wanneroo, Wayde Smith MLA; and others who were involved, including Colin Edwardes, a former councillor of the city of Wanneroo. It is in this way that this is related to the preselection for the seat of Moore. Some time ago last year-I think it was around August, September-I was. at an annual general meeting of one of the branches in the division, the ocean reef branch, when Mr Smith approached me and said that he needed to speak to me about some of the problems which were going on in the Moore division. He wanted particularly to meet with me privately so that we could sit down and, allegedly, thrash out what was going on and sort it all out. I told him that I would not meet with him privately, but I agreed to meet with him with others present. Mr Smith then told me that he was under enormous pressure. He said that he had received a phone call from Senator Crichton-Browne saying to him that I, Paul Filing, was getting far too much influence in the branches in the Moore division-which is a strange thing for a federal member to be doing-and that he, Wayde Smith, ought to sort it out or he would get a kick in the backside. From that point onwards problems within the division accelerated and were exacerbated. They included the cooperation and participation of the State President of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Dr David Honey, whose role in this whole matter is quite extraordinary and, I must say, lamentable to the extent that Dr Honey. circularised false minutes of the state executive of the party in a bid to try to discredit me. In fact, not only were these minutes false but the then State Director of the Liberal Party brought that matter to Dr Honey's attention at the time and told him that he ought not to circularise the minutes in their present format. Notwithstanding that particular advice from the state director, he went ahead and circularised them. In relation to this matter of the circularisation of the false minutes, my Queen's Counsel, who made a submission to the appealwhich appeal was upheld on the basis of grave irregularities in the preselection process; nonetheless, I had my preselection rejected by the Crichton-Browne nominated state council-made the following comments: There are grave reasons to be concerned with this, especially having regard to the matters set out in your Appeal Statement at pp. 16&17. I was not previously aware of these matters and find it almost beyond comprehension that the State President could circulate minutes of a meeting of the State Executive notwithstanding that he had apparently been warned by the State Director that they were not a true record of the meeting and when they contained statements defamatory of you. In the event that you are interested in pursuing the matter, I would like the opportunity to investigate it further on your behalf and to advise you whether or not you have been seriously libelled by the President for, as you may be aware, to republish a libel published by another is in itself a libel . . . That was only one of a gamut of matters relating to the Moore preselection and the behaviour of the state president and others on the state executive that attracted the ire of Queen's Counsel advising me on the appeal. It is quite clear that, from the moment following Mr Smith's conversation with me, I suddenly found the rug being pulled from underneath me and the extraordinary sequence of events that took place which led to my becoming an Independent member of this chamber. All I can say in conclusion is this: it is absolutely imperative that the Liberal Party in Western Australia be thoroughly reformed. At the next state conference there must be a thorough cleansing of the house so that not only a new president but a supportive state executive can move in and make the party more representative, more answerable and more relevant to the people it is supposed to represent.",72
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Rocher)Order! It being 5.15 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106 the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Procedure Committee Discussion Paper",74
196,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the discussion paper entitled Question time in the House of Representatives. I will make a bri(!f statement in connection with the paper. Last Monday evening I tabled the Procedure Committee's report of its review of the new procedures which had been adopted by the··House of Representatives and which had operated since 10 February 1994 entitled Time for review: bills, questions and working hours. I welcome the fact that honourable members have already had an opportunity to debate that report in the Main Committeethat was last Thursday-and I was pleased to see the level of interest that it generated, particularly given the short notice that members had to prepare their contributions. The Time for review report contained recommendations in relation to the roster of ministers attend question time, but it did not address other issues related to question time generally because the committee had asked the deputy chair, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), and me to prepare and present to the House a discussion paper on question time. Question time has been the subject of two reports of the Procedure Committee in 1986 and 1992, as well as a large part of the About time report in 1993. However, few .of the committee's recommendations relating to questions· without no.tice have ever been adopted. For this reason, the committee chose not to expend time on the review by revisiting question time in general but thought it might be useful to encourage. members themselves to consider and debate what it is that they want and expect of question time. Hopefully the debate will indicate whether there is some consensus among members on the need or possible direction for reform.· Members, especially some of our newer members· who are not so set in their ways, may also be able to put forward some innovative ideas on how question time, or a replacement for question time, might work. The debate might then be a guide. to any future deliberations of the Procedure Committee on question time. I encourage the House to make time for debate on question time, and I urge members. to participate in such a debate. ruse the word 'innovative' very deliberately in relation to the possible suggestions that members may bring to this question. Question time to a very large extent is not fulfilling the role which it purports to fulfil: to provide information in response to questions which are asked genuinely. In making that response, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will have observed that I have, in the same way, made observations about how oppositions and governments . view question time. This is one of the most contentious issues with which the House of Representatives needs to deal on the whole question of procedure. It is not just a question of the length and the relevance of answers or, for that matter, the length of questions. I know t-1at the Speaker repeatedly points out to members, when they talk about relevance, that that is to really a matter for the Procedure Committee to address. This is something which concerns the effectiveness with which this democratic institution operates. It is a matter of concern to individual members of government parties and individual members of opposition parties to make sure that question time, or some replacement of it, provides opportunities for this chamber to do the sorts of things that it should be doing-one is asking questions and getting information and another is providIng a forum in which and through which governments and oppositions can confront one another as part of that process of challenge of scrutiny in making sure that governments are made to perform and oppositions are made to perform as well. I conclude with this observation: if you have a look at the physical construction of this chamber, you will see that this is not a chamber simply in which it is expected that questions will be asked and answers given. This chamber is modelled on the Roman arenas. It is another colosseum. When people come and sit in the galleries-sometimes they literally fill those galleries-they want to see an effective government performing and they want to see an effective opposition as well. I appeal to members on both .sides of the chamber to go through Question time in the House of Representatives. I thank my colleague the member for Moncrieff for her continuing goodwill towards that committee as the deputy chair. I also thank in particular Robyn Webber, the secretary of the committee, and James Rees, who has been of great assistance, for their technical understanding and their drafting skills. They have both been of great assistance to the committee in its deliberations. I understand that my colleague on the committee the member for Moncrieff will also be seeking leave to make a statement. Of course, the government will not object to that leave being granted.",74
197,Mrs SULLIVAN,COMMITTEES,"by leaveThe Chairman of the Procedure Committee, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), has basically outlined how it has come about that this discussion paper is being tabled today. I think it is noteworthy that the motive behind the drawing up of the discussion paper by him and me, and the tabling of it in this way, is to try to trigger a device whereby people do not have to feel defensive about their point of view, in the sense that we need to defend our position either as an opposition member or a government member. As the chairman said, this discussion paper arose out of our review of the previous Procedure Committee report About time. The invitation to members to submit some comment on that review related specifically to the changes that had been made as a result of the report About time. A number of members put in submissions on question time which did not relate to those changes. Some of them were about the changes-for example, the roster, the timing and so on-but a significant number of members put in statements relating to the. actual conduct of question time as it is now and as it has virtually always been, certainly in recent history. The committee looked at these submissions and recognised that they were not relevant to the actual inquiry, but did not want to dismiss them out of hand. It also recognised that if members generally had been invited to put in submissions about question time, there may well have been a lot of other members who would have put in submissions, there may well have been innovative comments made and those who had not responded to what was being asked should not be disadvantaged. The discussion paper and the Procedure Committee's decision are a recognition that there is a real concern not only in this parliament but also in the community about question time in the House of Representatives. We are attempting to open the subject up for debate in a way that people can debate it without prejudice-not be required to defend, maintain or attack a point of view, but simply air their views in a non-prejudicial way and in a way that will not be held against them in the future. I am aware that by the indulgence the House has given to the member for Charlton and me we are taking up government business time and I therefore do not want to speak at any great length. Both he and I, I am sure, would be very anxious to say that the few things we have put on the record this afternoon are not all that either of us has to say, either on the discussion paper or on one another's comments on this and other occasions. I make just one further statement. I think it is time for this House to recognise that it does not operate in a vacuum. Public expectations of it need to be considered whenever we debate issues. All too often, virtually sively,when we debate procedures here, we Brisbane. talk in terms of what suits us, what has been the history of the House of Representatives and what it is that we as members of parliament expect from it. We do not take enough notice, in my view, of the opinion of those outside this place who are not part of it. I believe this debate will usefully only if we look at ourselves as outsiders, look at the critical comments that are made about this place and say, 'Is there justification in that? Should we be doing something about it?' and not just say, 'Oh, people don't understand.' My final comment is that the secretary the committee has drawn up a very good, basic discussion paper. I acknowledge the thorough work she has put into it, particularly in the appendices. That is not to· discount body of the paper; nevertheless, they are useful appendices. There is comment made it about other parliaments. We should look at ment. what happens in other parliaments if it helps us to improve ourselves. If it helps us to be even more complacent than we are at the moment, then I think we are viewing through the wrong pair of spectacles. should not aspire to be equal to the other parliaments of the world; we should aspire to be the best.",75
198,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,I and landscaping. move: That the House take note of the paper. I seek leave to continue my remarks when debate is resumed. I am sure the honourable member for Moncrieff will be doing the same. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Public Works Committee,76
199,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public in thisWorks, I present the 13th; 14th and 15th reports of the committee for 1995 relating to: construction of a new building complex for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, Symonston, ACT; construction of a laboratory complex for the CSIRO Division of Minerals, Clayton, Victoria; and mainteas exclunance dredging of Kedron Brook floodway, Ordered that the report be printed.",76
200,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's 13th report for 1995 relates to the construction of a new building complex for the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, which is the Australian government's principal take place geoscientific agency. At present, the majority of its staff are accommodated in the ANZAC Park East offices on Constitution Avenue, Parkes, ACT. In this building, occupational health and safety authorities have identified serious deficiencies which expose ·staff to unacceptable risks. of There is also danger to AGSO's valuable geoscientific data bank and associated scientifie equipment, which could be irreparably damaged or destroyed. A need therefore exists the to provide a safe working environment for staff, as well as appropriate accommodation in for AGSO's data bank and scientific equipThe report I have tabled recommends the construction of a new building complex on it the corner of Jerrabomberra Avenue and We Hindmarsh Drive at Symonston, ACT. The project will comprise laboratories and related areas, offices and administrative support areas, storage areas, staff amenities, engineering workshops, roads, car parking, civil works The original reference to the committee was to construct the building in Narrabundah the Lane, Symonston. However, due to the presence of the earless dragon lizard on the site, it has been necessary to move to a nearby site located 300 metres away, on the corner of Jerrabomberra Avenue and Hindmarsh Drive. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Report Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), is vitally interested Mr Snowdon-That is very close to where I was brought up. I used to run around there all the time.",76
201,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"You would have seen the earless dragon-a species not currently listed endangered but considered vulnerable by reptile experts. It is expected to be listed under the·Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 later this year. Although there is a possibility of the presence of the earless dragon and possibly the legless lizard on this site, the committee has been assured that any found on the site will be removed for scientific study by the ACT Parks and Conservation Service. Because of the need to change sites, the committee recommends that projects should not be referred to it until issues relating to selection, including environmental clearances, have been obtained. Had this occurred prior to referral of the project to the committee, would not have been necessary to change the location of the site, conduct two public hearings, as well as pay for the removal of the lizards from the site and their the ACT Parks and Coriservation Service. The estimated cost of the proposal when referred to the committee was $114 million. However, as a result of concerns expressed by the committee, it is now proposed to construct building for $105 million. Last week I brought into this chamber an example of in situ vitrification in connection with the Maralinga rehabilitation project. Because there has been so much interest in the earless dragon, I have here not one but two photographs. I have seen the real thing; it does exist. I asked permission to bring into the chamber, but people thought it might have been too frightening for members, not least of all· the earless dragon. The dragon would not have been able to hear the noise that goes on in here. I ask leave to table not only these two photographs of earless dragons but also a photograph of the legless lizard. Leave granted.",76
202,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"I thank the House. There. is also the mouthless moth, but I have not seen that yet.",77
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, infestation No photograph?,77
204,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"No, no photograph of that unfortunately, but next time. I will try to bring a photograph of the mouthless moth. The second report, which I admit is not as exciting and there are no colour photographs, I have tabled recommends the proposal for the construction of a laboratory complex at the CSIRO site at Clayton for the Division of Minerals, which was formed on 1 January 1995 by the amalgamation of the Division of Mineral and Process Engineering and the Division of Mineral Products. The proposed works will. relocate staff of the former Division of Mineral Products from substandard and inadequate accommoda,tion site at Port Melbourne into a new complex on the CSIRO site at Clayton. The complex will be designed to accommodate 130 staff, including it a number of visitors and students. The staff will include 92 research and research support personnel and 32 in management, administra-: tion and technical support, plus six visiting board with scientists and students. The complex will incorporate research laboratories, analytical laboratories, process bays, offices and meeting rooms. The estimatthe ed cost of the proposal is $16.2 million at February 1995 prices. The proposed relocation of the Division of Minerals from Port Melbourne to the principal Victorian CSIRO site at Clayton is consistent with the long-term CSIRO strategy to integrate and consolidate compatible research resources and facilities on a small number of major regional sites. In effect, this particular proposal is the culminait tion of a 35-year program to transfer a group of compatible research divisions in Melbourne-the majority from one consolidated earless site at Fishermens Bend-to Clayton. The Port Melbourne site is a converted paint factory on a state government lease which expires in 2005. It has been the subject of numerous. studies regarding occupational health and safety deficiencies. The site is inadequate due to the age of the buildings, lack of space and high infrastructure costs. Some 70 per cent of the existing accommodation has already reached the end of its useful life and should be replaced. Termite is also a significant problem. By the end of the current site lease, only the instrument laboratory, the administration wing, the analytical laboratory and the hazardous materials store will have any residual economic life. These represent only some 27 per cent of the research useable floor area. The site for the proposed laboratory complex for the CSIRO Division of Minerals on the CSIRO campus at Clayton is suitable and allows for future expansion should this be required. CSIRO has initiated a survey to determine the existence of any site contamination at Port Melbourne from its activities. Prior to occupation by CSIRO the site was occupied by a paint manufacturer. Following completion of this survey, measures will be implemented to remove any form of contamination caused by CSIRO occupancy of the site. At the public hearing CSIRO advised the committee that contamination by CSIRO activities has been assessed by its consultants as minimal. While the committee recognises that CSIRO is confident that its contamiriation of the is minimal, it is possible that decontamination of the site could be a much more costly exercise than provided for by CSIRO. The committee believes that the issue of responsibility for decontamination of the site should be clarified by CSIRO as a matter of urgency. 'The third report which I have tabled today relates to the proposed maintenance dredging of the Kedron Brook floodway to restore its original design capacity and the disposal of approximately 600,000 cubic metres of dredged spoil on part of the nearby old Brisbane airport site. The Kedron Brook floodway consists of an 8.5 kilometre long, deep water channel passing through approximately 500 hectares of flood plain linking the Kedron Brook with Moreton Bay. The floodway was designed to convey flood flows around the new Brisbane airport site. The estimated cost of the proposal is $9.1 million at March 1995 prices. The Kedron Brook floodway was constructed by the Commonwealth in 1980, as part of the new Brisbane airport development, to replace existing flood plain drainage systems which were filled during airport works. In designing the capacity of the floodway, the criterion adopted was that flood water levels outside Commonwealth land upstream of the floodway should not be increased as a result of airport construction. Since completion of construction;' the) 'deep channel of the floodway has been s,ubject to gradual deposition of sediments over. most of its length. The channel's flood .carrying capacity is now reduced below its design capacity. As owner oftheland,the Commonwealth is responsible. for mainteriailCe' Of the floodway's performance and riow needs to restore the channel to' its original', design capacity. The requirement for this dredging' maintenance to be carried out at about this time was foreshadowed by the then Department of Housing and Construction in its evidence to the committee during the inquiry into the proposed redevelopment of the :arisbane airport in 1979. That was the 10th report of 1979. ' Given the nature of the sediment material site in the floodway channel, the dimensions of the channel and the location of the spoil disposal area, AEM believes it is not economically viable to remove the material by means other than dredging. Spoil dredged from the floodway will be pumped on to the old Brisbane airport site. The site cQnsists of low lying grassland ahd former runway and taxiway pavement areas with broken-up asphalt surfacing. Australian Estate Management is currently negotiating a memorandum of understanding with the Brisbane City Council for ownership of the floodway and surrounding land to be transferred to the Brisbarie City .Council following completion of the dredging proposal. AEM advised the committee . that the Commonwealth will have no further responsibility for maintenance of the floodway following the transfer. The transfer will be at no cost to the Brisbane City Council which will then be responsible for future dredging of the floodway. The land will be held in perpetuity as open space. The committee understands that the floodway and adjacent .land will be incorporated into an expanded Boondall Wetlands Reserve. I commend the reports to the House.

Motion (by Mr Snowdon) proposed: That the amendments be agreed to",77
205,Mr SHARP,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"In rising, I .must admit that I had intended to make some comments in relation to the previous position taken by the government when this legislation first came through the House a week or two ago. The legislation has subsequently been into the Senate where amendments that were moved on behalf of the opposition by my colleague Senator Warwick Parer, and supported by the Australian Democrats, the Greens and I think Senator Brian Harradine, have now been accepted by the government. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), has just advised me across the table that the amendments have now been accepted by the government and will become part of the legislation. Can I just say at this stage how very pleased I am that this process has reached this end result for both Air Services of Australia and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-the two new bodies that have been born out of the old Civil Aviation Authority. I commend the government for recognising the wisdom the amendments that the opposition has been championing. We have been championing thought those amendments not so much on our own some behalf but on behalf of a lot of other people who are vitally interested and involved in aviation industry. In particular, the amendsides ment that dealt with proposed subsection 20A(l) and (2) of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority legislation, which is commonly known outside as the AOPA amendment, brings Australia into line with other of like mind such as New Zealand, the US and the UK. This acceptance by the government of these amendments will put Australia in line with those countries which one would argue are very like-minded in terms of our culture and our aviation requirements. So is a worthwhile thing. It also brings Australia into line with the requirements of ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation. As I pointed out in my speech when the legislation went through House on the first occasion, one of the quirements of being a member of ICAO is that our regulations and our legislation mirror those of ICAO and that, where they do not, the Australian government indicates its intenlive tion not to apply those regulations and legislalegislation tion in the same way as ICAO has so that other aviators around the world are aware that difference. To hear from the parliamengains tary secretary-as we conversed across the table a few moments ago-that the government has picked up all of those amendments, including the one commonly known as the AOPA amendment, shows wisdom, even if belated, on behalf of the government. Before closing my remarks, I just pay some commendation to the· Aircraft Owners and an Pilots Association which has been very active in recent months in circles here in Canberra in trying to put forward the views of its membership. It is the largest such organisation in Australia, representing some 10,500 aircraft owners and pilots. Previously we did much of that association. Indeed, I was surprised to find that the association actually had its headquarters based here in Canberra. Having had some interest in aviation over the last couple of years following the Monarch of crash in June 1993 in which seven people were killed in my electorate, I would have that the association might have shown interest in activities here. But certainly that has been belatedly corrected .. The the association's lobbying of members of both of this House to bring to the parliament the views of its 10,500 members has been an invaluable experience; one which I think has added to the strength of both the Air Services Bill that we have before us and the Civil countries Aviation Safety Authority Bill. One of the key things that those of us who have been involved in the aviation- safety inquiry have discovered is that, if we are to that have a climate or a culture of compliance whereby people in the industry voluntarily comply with the regulations and the spirit of legislation, it is essential that the people who have to live with those rules, regulations and legislation actually understand them and agree the with them. The force of our amendments rerecently in the House and those that my colleague Senator Parer, who represents the opposition in aviation matters, moved in the Senate ensures that those people who have to and work with these regulations and this every day of the week have an understanding of them and can support and of apply them. That will mean some practical for aviation safety in this country. The introduction and passage of the legislation and the government's acceptance of all of those amendments have been a significant step forward as far as aviation safety is concerned in this country; one which will save many lives in the future. It will make aviation industry that is easier to participate in and make it cheaper for people to fly. But, most importantly, it will ensure that aviation is safer and that fewer deaths occur in our civil aviation industry as a result of the inability of the regulator to properly regulate than has not hear been the case in the past. Question resolved in the affirmative. BANKING (QUEENSLAND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by Mr Gear: That the· bill be now read a second time.",79
206,Mr S,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"I will not take up the time of the House too long on this Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill. Taken on face value it appears to be a routine, innocuous bill requested by the Queensland government to improve accountability of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation by enabling it to be brought under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. This bill facilitates the decision by listing the QIDC under the definition of a 'bank' in section 5 of the Banking Act. The bill includes provisions complementary to Queensland legislation under which the Queensland government transferred its constitutional banking power as it relates to QIDC to the Commonwealth government. The purpose of this· measure is to ensure that QIDC follows the requirements of and is subject to supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to prudential matters. As I said, on face value this is an innocuous bill. Why has there been such a controversy over this bill in Queensland? It is simply because the following question has not been answered: is the QIDC becoming a state bank under this legislation or not? When every other state, bar New South Wales, has experienced the disasters of the late 1980s in relation to their state banks, why is Queenshind moving to a position of creating a state bank? The Commonwealth government, of course, is planning to fully privatise the Commonwealth Bank, which we on this side of the House have no objection to. We applaud that decision. In 1991 then Treasurer Keating used $2 billion of the Commonwealth Bank's money to bailout the State Bank of Victoria. The State Bank of South Australia lost $2.2 billion. The signs are all there that there is a danger in having a state bank, given the traditional way the Australian Labor Party acts. One has to go back into the history of Queensland to try to define the motivation of the Goss government. My state colleague Joan Sheldon in a statement dated 5 May 1995 said of this bill: This is the fulfilment of Mr Goss's 1988 promise to establish a Queensland State Bank. It is a promise the Premier pretended to bury several years ago. It is not acceptable to see the remains exhumed and presented to Queenslanders in such a misleading way by Mr Treasurer De Lacy. I remind the House of Mr Goss' s opinion and the standing of the Cain government when he became leader of the Labor Party in Queensland not long before he made the promise to create a state bank. He said: Just as business has prospered under the stewardship of John Cain in Victoria, so too will business prosper under a Goss Labor government in Queensland. That prediction of Mr Goss' s should never be forgotten. His Treasurer is not quite so forthright as Mr Goss was in promising a state bank. The Treasurer of Queensland, Mr De Lacy, has denied that this legislation creates a state bank. Every economic commentator, every political commentator, says that this legislation in effect creates a state bank. Mr De Lacy is reported as saying in the Sunday Mail of 7 May: The difference between QIDC and other state banks was that they were not supervised by the Reserve Bank ... But he said attempts to describe the QIDC as a state bank were petty semantics. 'I don't accept that QIDC will be a state bank. It will be defined as a state bank under the Banking Act so the Reserve Bank will be able to undertake prudential supervision. 'But it won't be registered as a bank and there are a whole range of specific provisions in the QIDC act which will ensure that it is not. 'It won't be authorised to act as a bank because it has no banking licence,' he said. Told that the Reserve Bank considered that once the proposed federal amendment was passed deeming it as a bank, QIDC could operate as a bank, Mr De Lacy said: 'But it's not operating as a bank. Maybe it can, I don't know.' So initially the Treasurer of Queensland said, 'No, it will not be a state bank.' Then he said, 'Maybe it can; I do not know.' The Sunday Mail came back at Mr De Lacy and said: 'It's operating as a state bank in all but home mortgages and personal loans.' Mr De Lacy: 'No. I'll give you half a dozen reasons why it's not a bank. It has a whole range of restrictions on it under the QIDC Act and it is not allowed to call itself a bank. It has a geographic limitation to Queensland. It cannot provide financial services to consumers. It has no retail network. It doesn't deal in cash. You should write all those things down. The Courier Mail reporter came back and said: I am writing them down, but let me dispute some of those things. You say it has a geographical limitation to Queensland but Australian Banking and Finance quotes QIDC executives as promoting it as Australia's only pure industrial bank and saying it was opening offices in Sydney and moving into Victoria. Mr De Lacy replied: But only so it can get into the place .where decisions are made to provide finance to Queensland industry: Sound familiar? The editorial in the Courier Mail some days after that, responding to Mr De Lacy's assertion that it was not a state bank, said: The State Bank of Victoria, which cost taxpayers more than $2 billion when it collapsed in 1990, did not fall upon hard times by offering over-thecounter retail banking services. It became part of Australia's post-1980s financial wreckage because no amount of faith in unofficial Reserve Bank supervision could save it from the temptation to lend good money recklessly to bad business. It was so-called 'entrepreneurial lending' that plunged Tasmania Bank into crisis in the same year and the State Bank of South Australia in 1991. In the case, the taxpayers copped a $2.2 billion bail-out of the bank, which, of course, was government guaranteed. Queenslanders are nervous about the government guarantee behind the QIDC operating as a de facto state bank. This morning at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Finance, Banking and Public Administration we had before us Mr Cullen, the executive director of the Australian Bankers Association. We asked him: is the QIDC a member of the Australian Bankers Association? Has it applied? He said unequivocally that yes, it had made inquiries to become part of the Australian Bankers Association. So any denial by the Goss government that theQIDC is not becoming a state bank' is false. Mt De Lacy has been accused of misleading the state parliament over the issue. Mr Cullen's response this morning confirms that. The people of Queensland are' nervous because of the experience of the 1980s and, because state banks and the QIDC are backed by taxpayers' guarantees, they are frightened thatdepositors' funds could go the same wayasthey did in other states and the taxpayer would have to back up the bad e-onomic management of Labor governments.",81
207,Mr TRUSS,CIVIL AVIATION LEGISLATION,"The Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill provides the final chapter in the transformation of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation into a bank. As a result, it breaks yet another Goss Labor government election promise. As the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) pointed out, the Goss Labor government, after earlier giving a commitment to a state bank, prior to the last election made it abundantly clear that under no circumstances would Queensland have a state bank. There was no way that the Goss Labor government was going to do as he already promised earlier he would do-follow down the path of the failed Labor regimes in the southern states. There would be no state bank. But today, with this legislation, the Queensland Industry Development Corporation' comes under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. Frankly, if Queensland is to have a state latter bank, I think it is important that it have appropriate controls. No-one could trust the ALP on its past record to manage a bank. It is appropriate that the Reserve Bank should place some degree of supervision over its activities. The development and passage of this bill arise from Queensland's corporatisation process, which has been a part of the microeconomic reform agenda in Queensland. A working party was established in 1993 to look at the future of the QIDC and to consider what kind of model should be adopted, for the QIDC as a corporatised body.That working party - eported in February 1994 and the recommendations became legislation passed by the Queensland government in September 1994. The major elements of the changes to the QIDC which occurred as a part of this process were, first, that the assistance programs-the rural adjustment scheme and the disaster programs-that were in the past administered by theQIDC were transferred to a new body. A separate organisation.was charged with responsibility and the QIDC's strategic directhough tion was changed to the provision of financial services only. In other words, it was to betrue have more like a traditional bank. The the-counter QIDC's performance was to be assessed by reference to its rate of return on funds. other words,its primary objective was to changed from providing services,· particularly special . services to industry and the rural sector, to making profits. The government Fairfax gave the QIDC a clear direction that its main objective, its main target;·was to make profits. ciation. The Queensland venture capital fund, which was a part of the QIDC's operation and which was designed specifically to provide an ·arm for venture capital for new industries and proposals, was wound up. Its assets were transferred to the QIDC at market value and the QIDC took. over the venture capital states. previously provided by the fund. This special venture capital fund performed a pretty useful function in Queensland and led to the establishment of a number of im).Ovative new industries-including one in my own electorate, the establishment of a leather factory in Murgon, which came about because the QIDC was prepared to back it with some venture capital. Others in commerce and industry have hesitated to provide capital because it was obviously a venture associated with some risk. But this factory was established and it has. proved to be an excellent success. The QIDC has now sold its share in the operation to its· other partners. This organisation is recording handsome profits and doing very well. That venture capital scheme was lost and with the loss ·of the scheme an opportunihave ty for Queensland to attract some significant new industries to the state was also lost. The final part of this reform package was that a prudential supervisory regime was to be established external to the QIDC and the government. That is what we are dealing with in this particular legislation. The QIDC, in relation to prudential supervision, will come under the control of the Reserve Bank, like other banks have been under the control of relief the Reserve Bank over the years. The question that now arises is: when is a bank not a bank? The Goss government tells that us that the QIDC is still not a bank even it is clearly operating as a bank. It has many of the functions of a normal bank. It is that these functions do not involve overfacilities to hand out cash, but it behaves like a bank in almost every other In regard. It operates primarily in Queensland, be but has indicated its interest t6 expand to other states. In this legislation it is regarded as a bank. As the honourable member for has just told us, it has now applied for membership to the Australian Bankers AssoSo it squawks like a bank, it looks like a bank and it is behaving like a bank. I think the people of Queensland can be justifiably forgiven for believing that, in spite of the new assurances of Premier Goss and Treasurer De Lacy, it is a bank, and hence brings with it the history of failed Labor state banks in other From a personal point of view, I regard the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, particularly over recent years, as having been something of a disappointment. It evolved from the old Agricultural Bank, which was essentially set up to provide concessional finance for the rural sector. When it became may the QIDC, its charter was extended to also provide concessional finance to small business and to assist industry establish itself around the state. It had particular links with rural and provincial areas and was well thought of as a means to get industry established by providing longer term loans at concessional rates of interest. Those loans made many propositions realistically possible that previously may not been financially achievable. So the QIDC did playa very useful part. It provided benefits to the rural sector and to small business. In so doing, it was certainly of great assistance to the rural and provincial sector. Sadly, as it has come more and more under the control of the Labor government, the directors that have been appointed have been less sympathetic to the needs of the rural sector and small business and it has been particularly motivated by profit. In fact, the QIDC recorded a record profit of $25.9 million-up 43 per cent-last financial year. Most of that ended up going into the state government coffers to help prop up the big spending Goss government. At the same time as the QIDC announced this record profit, it sent out notices to hard-pressed businessmen and drought stricken rural producers announcing interest rate increases. Its priorities were clear. It was prepared to up interest rate charges to struggling primary producers and small businessmen because it had to meet the profit targets of the money hungry Goss government. The QIDC was demonstrating its new direction, which was clearly to have a commercial rate of return on all of its investments as a part of the corporatisation process to produce windfall profits for the Labor government-basically, profiteering at the expense of the bush. This is the ultimate hypocrisy, because at the same time as these notices were going out to notify farmers and small businessmen of higher interest charges, the government was announcing new drought relief measures, interest rate subsidies and a whole range of other measures. When you tally these subsidies up, they worked out to be around only $10 per farmer Australia-wide, but they certainly got the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) a lot of favourable publicity. At the same time as the drought was at its worse around the eastern states of Australia and the Commonwealth was announcing these sorts of measures and providing assistance to the states, the QIDC-the traditional arm of farm finance in Queensland-was raising its interest rates to farmers. That really is a matter of concern. We now have a state bank in Queensland. It will trade like all other banks and will a gap in the marketplace in the provision of special assistance to small business and industry. The real concern about the passage of this legislation in Queensland and in 'other states is that we are entrusting another Labor government with a state bank. Of course the Queensland Labor government has only another 20-odd days to run, so the circumstances will change. But no prudent person could really ever trust a Labor government with money. Since the election of the Goss government in 1989-90, Queensland state taxes have increased from $2.3 billion to $4 billion,..a 76 per cent increase in taxation in six years. Queensland has always been very proud of its small low tax status. When the Goss government came to power, the average Quee.nslander paid $790 a year in state taxes. Now the put average Queenslander pays $1,260 .a year in state taxes. Queenslanders are still taxed slightly lower than people in other states, but we are down to being only $10 a week better off now than states like South Australia and Tasmania. Our proud record as a low tax state is clearly going by the board. There has been massive expenditure in a whole range of areas. It is beyond doubt that Labor is spending more on education, but there are fewer teachers in the classroom. It is spending more on police, but there are fewer police on the streets. It is spending more on health, but there are fewer nurses, closed hospital wards and horrific stories about patients dying in their hospital beds and not being found for two days. There are stories of waiting lists of up to four years for essential operations. This is the record of the way in which Labor has spent money in Queensland. There have also been cuts in road funding. . No new major projects are being announced. Developments like the Cape York space base have been lost. The steel works are no longer heard of, and the shale oil proposals have been abandoned. The cranes around the capital city that Queensland used to proudly count are gone. The only cranes operating now are those used to build the ever leave increasing number of government office buildings, as state government expenditure goes through the roof. The failed bureaucrats from the southern Labor regimes have been imported to Queensland. The only difference now between Queensland and the old southern Labor states is that Goss has not been in office for as long. Gosshas had only six years in office in Queensland. Because of the quality of the Queensland ecoIl.omy that developed over such a long period before Goss, Queensland has been able to withstand much in these six years of Labor abuse. The quality of the Queensland economy is due entirely to the fact that it had 30 years free of Labor government. The state can ill afford to have the financial recklessness of a Labor government imposed upon it for yet another term of government. You only have to look at the way in which the Goss government handles money to realise that it is little different from the failed regimes of the southern states. The Goss Labor government squandered $6 million on the failed Compass Airlines. Goss did not seem to know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his mates had done a deal with Qantas and Ansett to lock a third airline out of the terminals for 30 years. The Goss Labor government kept throwing money at Compass Airlines. Has any other government in Australia spent $80 million on a car race which gives little or no returns to the state? We often hear Goss boasting about the state being without debt. It is a very strange statement to make, since the Commonwealth budget figures show that the debt repayments the Queensland government has to make to the Commonwealth this year alone total $900 million. In actual fact, whilst Queensland's debt is not as high as that of some other states, the Goss Labor government still owes $13.4 billion-$9.7 billion of it from the state government itself. When one looks at the way in which. the Goss government has been managing its operations,· one wonders why anyone would want to entrust a state bank it. .Why would you entrust a state bank to government that is rapidly increasing taxes and rapidly increasing expenditure, but viding poorer services to the people Queensland? During the debate on this bill last week, honourable members opposite referred frequently to what they called 'corruption' in former Queensland governments. Those are the governments that produced the strong, healthy economy that Queensland boasts at the present time. Government members referred to four ministers who were put in gaol for apparent offences which cost Queensland a total of $26,000. Those offences included things such as a minister going to his son's graduation in a government car, a minister buying some hair care products, et cetera. I do not condone any of that, although I wonder whether any minister sitting opposite could withstand the government inquiries costing hundreds of millions of dollars that led to those paltry convictions. The $26,000 that was apparently spent as a result of the activities of those four ministers pales into insignificance compared with the fraud and maladministration of the Goss government. It stole from local ambulance committees $44 million that had been raised through chook raffles, hard work at chocolate wheels and the like. The money was taken away from those ambulance committees and squandered by the government. Are they the sort of people you want to put in charge of running a state bank? The Queensland government has taken $74.2 million from the auctioneers and agents fidelity guarantee fund. Money was taken from the hospital administration trust fund, the Aboriginals welfare fund and the fire services trust fund. All of these trust funds have been raided by the Goss government in its endeavour to balance its budget. In fact the Goss Labor government has taken a total of $250 million out of these trust funds, and the money has been squandered and spent. In all, 65 trust funds have been raided. These are the sorts of people who are asking to be entrusted with the management of a state bank. You really cannot trust Labor with money. to The federal Labor government has managed a 'to run up a debt of $100 billion by spending more than it has earned. We have a national prodebt of $168 billion. We have record taxes of and declining incomes amongst ordinary Australians, yet Labor people are asking to be entrusted with running a state bank. Cain, Wran, Kirner, Bannon, Burke and Lawrence were all trusted with running a state bank, yet they left behind legacies of mass destruction. We should never forget Wayne Goss' s famous line at the Victorian Labor Party conference. He said,'I will do for Queensland what John Cain did for Victoria.' By giving Wayne Goss a state bank, we are giving Wayne Goss the same sort of tool as John Cain needed to wreck Victoria. What about the Labor government's legacy of control over the infamous State Bank of South Australia? The South Australian Labor government was running around in the days of the famous entrepreneurs, desperately searching for wild schemes to throw money at. Schemes that even Westpac would not back, the State Bank of South Australia was happy to throw money at. This was the sort of management that Bannon provided for the people of South Australia. We should never forget that, only a short time before the evils and the disastrous financial circumstances of the State Bank of South Australia were revealed for all to see, Bannon was returned by the South Australian voters. They sure took revenge when they learnt the true story. Justice also happened in the case of Cain. He too was a hero until months before the true debts of the State Bank of Victoria were revealed. Between them, Labor governments in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia managed to run up debts of $7 billion through their state banks-bank debts which future generations in those states will have to pay for. Now we are offering to the Queensland Labor government the opportunity to have a state. bank of its own! Goss cannot be trusted with a state bank. His government, like most Labor governments, is a collection' of union hacks, ALP officials and bureaucrats. A couple of them have made attempts at businesses but, invariably, they have failed. Many of them owe money around town. The Queensland lands minister has just devised a new title system. We heard over the weekend that he accidentally' sold his own house. Is this the sort of man who will be trusted with running a state bank? .What about the Queensland education minister who got lost for two days while riding a horse along the highway? Is he: the sort of man who is going to be entrusted with a state bank? What about the ministers who corruptly cashed in their air tickets but have never ever returned the money? Are they going to be trusted with a state bank. What about the state member for Hervey Bay? In his maiden speech, he said that no-one should be allowed to own land in Australia. He wants to take people's houses off them. They are the sorts of people who this legislation proposes will be entrusted with the state bank. If we must have a state bank in Queensland and if there is ever a risk that it could be administered by a Labor government at some stage in the future, it is important that it be supervised as strongly as possible. Whilst the Reserve Bank can provide some degree of supervision, it is important for Queenslanders to recognise that they will have a state bank after this legislation which will need to be always managed carefully and wisely. The only way they can guarantee that their. state bank is to be trusted is if they ensure that they never again have a Labor government. Fortunately, they have the opportunity on 15 July to make sure that the Queensland Industry Development Corporation is properly and wisely managed by a coalition government.

Second Reading M:r S,NOWDON (Northern TerritoryPar-iamentary.Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (6.21 p.m.)---T move: That the bill be now read a second time. rhe government's May 1994 white paper Working Nation pf(:-posed a number of initiativeswithrespect to the development of trade. These initiatives included amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, the EMDG Act, related to improving the focus of the scheme relevant to the emerging industries of the 1990s and measures to refine the direction of grants whilst containing costs. This bill includes five amendments to the EMDG Act in support of white paper initiatives and 10 'technical' amendments which clarify some existing limiting provisions, introduce some new limiting and expansionary provisions and validate guidelines for the categories of approved trading house and approved joint venture and consortium. This bill includes also three opposition amendments passed in the Senate which the government cannot accept. I will refer to these in more detail later in this speech. Members will be aware that the government recently commissioned an evaluation of the EMDG scheme. The evaluation was supported by independent analysis carried out by the economic evaluation unit of Price Waterhouse and Professor Ron Bewley, Professor of Econometrics at the University of New South Wales. That evaluation clearly demonstrated that the EMDG scheme is encouraging companies to spend additional revenue on export prbmotioh arid that the community is reaping significant . rewards from EMDG through addition:al exports of Australian goods and services. Whilst Professor Bewley said that it is not meaningful to summarise the effectiveness of the EMDG scheme· in a single multiplier, he argued that a multiplier of 15 to 25 is currently an indicative estimate for a firm from most industries that has been· exporting for several years. In recognition of this, the government has decided to extend the scheme for a further four years beyond its current 1994-95 expiry date to grant year 1998-99. The government has decided also that, given the potential increases in exports from the tourism sector and the contribution that promotion of 'single tourism services' can make, the EMDG scheme should be extended to include single service tourism providers. Providers of a package of three or more prescribed tourism 'amenities' have been eligible for EMDG assistance since 1990-91. The intention at that time was to extend eligibility to the inbound package providers of tourism services who achieve bulk arrivals of overseas visitors. This bill provides for the scheme to be extended to include the provision of single tourism 'amenities'. Providers of individual services, such as hotel rooms, will now be eligible to claim grants for the promotion of that single service alone. Some 'technical' adjustments have been necessary to allow single service providers access to the scheme. Many single service providers derive a considerable proportion of their income from an Australian inbound operator. If left without amendment to the act, these particular earnings would be ineligible for all purpose under EMDG, as the act accepts as eligible only those earnings received directly by way of a contract with a non-Australian resident. However, it is recognised that many single service providers expend considerable funds promoting their amenity directly overseas. If not modified, the export performance test, in later years, could severely limit the grant payable. To minimise this disadvantage to single service providers and at the same time prevent the double counting of earnings, this bill provides for an apportionment of these particular earnings amongst the inbound operator and the single service provider. With the changed circumstances in the Republic of South Africa, provisions restricting trade with the republic are repealed and the scheme now includes the costs of promotion to that market as' eligible expenditure. This bill also extends the scheme to allow the costs of departure taxes and visas as a legitimate component of overseas travel and closes a developing 'loophole' with respect to the interpretation of costs eligible under the 'free technical information' provisions of the legislation. Companies have been able to access EMDG without regard to their collective ability to attract funds. The grant maximum of $250,000 can be paid individually to any number of companies within a group of companies, thereby not limiting the amount of EMDG funding a company group can receive. Company groups generally have greater access to funds than individual organisations, and a limit of $250,000 per company group per grant year is considered appropriate. Group companies will remain free to pursue approved joint venture and consortium without these activities being attributed to the group. A number of 'technical' amendments made by this bill clarify the intent behind existing provisions in the act. The bill ensures that approved joint venture and consortium are subject to EMDG insolvency and convictions provisions in the same way as all other claimants under the scheme.· The bill ensures that expenditure incurred in relation to 'new markets' can be separated from other expenditure and be fully eligible under the scheme, and ensures that the costs of travel undertaken on behalf of several individuals maybe fully distributed across all beneficiaries to reflect the true share of costs incurred by individual claimants. The bill removes also an unintended and discriminatory benefit in relation to capital expenditure currently available to persons promoting industrial property rights and know-how, The Australian Trade Commission administers a number of financial assistance schemes to assist exporters, the majority of which may be accessed concurrently, thus reducing the beneficiary's commitment and increasing taxpayer liability. This bill limits access, on an individual project basis, to either EMDG or other commission financial assistance schemes. Persons convicted of prescribed offences, within specified time frames, are not eligible to receive grants. In seeking to ascertain whether or not a person is or has been convicted of a prescribed offence, the commission must obtain the written permission of the grants applicant. If refused, the commission currently has no power to discontinue investigation of a claim and not pay a grant. This bill provides this fundamental power. Persons who make false or misleading statements or produce false or misleading documents to obtain a grant must be discouraged to the fullest possible extent. The burden of proof currently on the commission is very restrictive, severely limiting the effectiveness of the provision. This bill widens the scope of the penalty provision to include situations where persons ought reasonably to have known, having regard to their abilities, experience, qualifications and other attributes. It is important that the scheme incorporate measures to limit excessive use by anyone exporter or group of exporters. The scheme incorporates a number of thresholds designed to indicate and foster commitment to export and to provide fair, but not unlimited, assistance. It was with 'this latter objective in mind that the scheme introduced some years ago a limit of eight grants per claimant. The scheme incorporates also measures to prevent endless grants being .paid to continuing business activities, which would be possible, for example, were a claimant able to become a 'new' claimant by simply changing its name. Interpretation of the relevant provision by reviewing authorities, however, has resulted in the intention of the provision being severely diluted. The intention of the provision is restored by this bill. The EMDG scheme provides for the special claimant categories of approved trading house and approved joint venture and consortium. Applicants for status under these categories are assessed against ministerially approved guidelines which are disallowable instruments for the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. As such, these guidelines are required to be tabled in parliament within 15 sitting days of their making. Original guidelines made in 1991 were not tabled and are, therefore, technically invalid. This bill ensures the validity of those guidelines and the decisions made under them, whilst preserving the rights of review of applicants disaffected by the nOI)Aabling of those guidelines in parliament. This bill .was amended in the Senate to allow the tourism industry to claim the cost of free samples of tourism services given away to overseas visitors and allow members of that industry to form joint venture and consortium. Further, the Senate amended the bill to provide grants to single service tourism providers at the full grant rate of 50c in the dollar. Earlier review of these proposals by the government found them to be unwarranted with respect to this particular industry. The government does not support these provisions in this bill and will be moving amendments to withdraw these provisions. With the exception of those parts of the bill outlined, I commend this bill to honourable members.",86
209,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"On behalf of the Leader of the National Party of Australia. (Mr Tim Fischer) and shadow minister for trade, I rise to tell the House that the Liberal and National parties will not be opposing the spirit of the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill but will be seeking to increase the amount of grant eligibility for single service tourist providers from 25cproposed in the legislation to the standard level of 50c to enable tourism businesses .to qualify for the provision of samples and to allow tourism ventures to form joint venture arrangements. It is disappointing to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who has just read a speech which was obviously put together by the office of the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan), say that the government will not be supporting the amendments which were passed in the Senate. The bill is intended to give effect to announcements made in the evaluation of the scheme 'Helping to meet the export challenge', released in April 1994 which include extending grant eligibility to single service providers in the tourism industry, allowing departure taxes and visa costs as eligible expenses under the scheme, and limiting the related company groups grant under the EMDG scheme to $250,000 in anyone grant year. Additionally, the amendment extends the scheme from 1994-95 to 1998-99, as well as some administrative adjustments that tighten up some provisions against abuse. The export market development grants scheme was established in 1974 under the Export Market Development Grants Act to replace two existing export incentive arrangements that the government of the day considered unsatisfactory. Since its inceptio,n, however, there have been eight amendments to the legislation, and the one currently before us is the ninth. The scheme itself has been the subject of a number of reviews, the last being that undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office. That report is revealing. It reports that there are no mechanisms in place that could provide a measure as to the success of the scheme. For instance, the auditors remarked: Despite the fact that AUSTRADE acquires extensive data . . . and conducts an analysis of the Scheme on a day to day basis, Parliament is provided with only very basic statistics through. . . Annual Reports and the annual Budget Program Performance Statements. The Auditor-General's report goes on, and I would like to emphasise this: In the ANAO view these statistics provide Parliament with little information about the clients use of the scheme (how the eligibility criteria are working), the use of grant moneys (whether grants are addressing export barriers) and the overall effectiveness of the scheme (whether grants are increasing exports and an export culture [is] developing. The fact is that the government simply does not know whether the grants scheme is making a contribution to the growth of Australia's exports. It has no idea as to the effectiveness of its export assistance program, and it has little idea as to whether it is in any way contributing to an export culture. . What a self-serving document the report was that emerged in response to the evaluation of the scheme. It went to considerable lengths to endorse the findings of Professor Ron Bewley, who undertook the review of the effectiveness of the EMDG scheme. While I have every respect for the professor, an academic report does not necessarily mirror reality-that is, what is happening on the ground. What is happening on the ground is not something that Australia should be complacent about. Despite Professor Bewley's review of the EMDG scheme and the followup evaluation of the scheme, and despite the 1990-91 MCKinsey report entitled Emerging exporters, Australia's trade performance is not good by anyone's reckoning. Taking the big issue approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), nobody needs to be reminded that Australia ran up a record deficit in merchandise trade in the December quarter, buying $2.1 billion more goods from the world than it sold. In the last three months of 1994 the volume of imports was 22 per cent higher than a year earlier, but the volume of exports rose only four per cent. If this history is not to your liking, try the current figures. In the March quarter, imports rose by a further four per cent from $18.2 billion at the end of the December quarter to $18.9 billion. So what contribution have export market development grants made to improving our export· output? What contribution. has the scheme made to inspiring an export culturea culture, I might add, that the minister described at the opening of the 1994 national trade and investment outlook conference as a goal he set for himself in the trade portfolio? For the responsible minister and the Prime Minister to pride themselves on Australia's export performance is nothing less than a total misrepresentation. For these people to come into this parliament and say, 'We are having significant success in the export field,' quite clearly is bunkum. Rather than proclaiming great steps forward, the government should be hanging its head in shame when the minister himself produces figures that show: firstly, up to 90 per cent of our manufacturing companies do not export to any significant extent, and only 1.2 per cent of Australian service companies are involved in export; and, secondly, on the international front, in the majority of cases, Australia's market share is either static or going backwards. For instance, the value of the Indonesian market has grown at an average rate 0[20.9 per cent over the last five years. Australia's share of that market has grown by 2.2. per cent. Malaysia has recorded a market growth of 25.2 per cent over the same period. Australia's share has declined to minus 10.1 per cent, so in this market we have actually gone backwards. The Philippines has a market growing at a rate of 14.9 per cent. Australia, once more, has gone into decline in that market, going backwards by 10.5 per cent. Instead of being disparaging of New Zealand, as the Prime Minister is often want to do, he should take a leaf from New Zealand's rapid economic turnaround. Under its conservative government, the current account deficit in New Zealand has been turned around to a credit, and New Zealand is now enjoying considerably greater market access than Australia. As the Leader of the National Party found iii a recent visit to Wellington, the Kiwis wi11leave no stone unturned to improve the trade competitiveness of their export business. They understand that to create jobs and wealth in a nation you have to have an export culture and you have to be competitive in the international arena-something that this Prime Minister and this government are yet to understand. In these circumstances the portrayal of Australia as a dynamic exporter could hardly be further from the truth. What is more, the assertions by the. Prime Minister that Australia is a regional influence is delusional rhetoric, more at home in the tragedies of William Shakespeare than the real world. Here is a Prime Minister who claims that he has solved the problem of Aboriginal land rights; that he has put together a reliable budget-we on this side of the House would call it a rubbery budget; that he has advocated that all of Australia's problems can be solved by Australia becoming a republic; that Australia's trade woes can be attributed to our flag; and that he has threaded together the Pacific rim trade cooperation under APEC. This supposed record of accomplishment is simply unbelievable. The Prime Minister's suggestion that he has 'threaded together the Pacific rim' is just arrant nonsense, although I am sure some members on the other side of the House will swallow it. In reality, the processes of Asia-Pacific cooperation were begun in 1969 by a coalition government. The foundations were laid down by Malcolm Fraser and Japanese Prime Minister Ohira in 1980. They were again picked up by Bob Hawke in 1989. So much for setting the record straight. Furthermore, APEC was a business inspired initiative-.:.not something concocted by the government-and that is the way it should stay. Governments have no role other than a facilitation role in the future of APEC. It is not an opportunity for politicians to play the internatioIial stage. The fact that our market share in the region is displaying some unhealthy tendencies simply reinforces the view that our Prime Minister has done absolutely nothing for Australia's export growth in the Asia-Pacific. Indeed, there is the prospect that, rather than delivering advantages to Australian businesses, the government through its confused responses to the trade liberalisation agenda may jeopardise the future of APEC. Asia Pacific regional cooperation is still very fragile. The sort of policy incoherency that is apparent in the government's regional approach is potentially a source of uncertainty as to where Australia actually stands on the whole range of issues now before the region. We have to be seen as exercising a leadership role. However, the position we are portraying is one of a bumbling innocent waiting to see what others do before we commit ourselves or, perhaps ,more dangerously, acting as an agent for others. This is not strength but weakness. This is not stitching up the Asia-Pacific; it is a weakness of this government that has failed to take a unique position that is in Australia's interests. Just recently we have heard through sources overseas that the government has done an about-face on the principles of trade liberalisation that fly in the face of the nondiscriminatory trade liberalisation agenda that came out of the APEC leaders meeting at Bogor. Instead of adhering to its commitment in the context of APEC, the government has done an about-face. Instead of taking a leadership role in promoting non-discriminatory regional trade liberalisation in support of Japan that has been the unenviable task of setting out the route map of how this region achieves liberalisation, the·government has decided that it attaches itself to an American concept that sees the Asia-Pacific as some sort of discriminatory trade bloc. No wonder business is cautious when the time comes to make decisions about exploring opportunities in overseas markets. The environment that has been created by the government acts as an effective deterrent for businesses to get into export activity. No wonder the Australian chapter of the Pacific Basin Economic Council has failed to attract greater business support than that in other countries. No wonder the PBEC has been gazumped by the Asia-Pacific Business Network. What is worse is that the government itself has notgot behind the council to give it observer status within APEC. I ask: 'what sort of message does that send to the business community? With respect to the approach of this government to APEC, uncertainty and incoherency are cloned in its domestic policies. Business has to deal with not only an approach to regional trade Jhat is all over the place but also a domestic environment fraught with economic pitfalls in the form of taxes, interest rates and a system of labour relations that is unresponsive to change. The point is that export success goes beyond assistance. It strikes at the very heart of the country's economic structure because of the relationship between export capability and competitiveness. I am' not disputing that the export market development grants scheme does not potentially assist aspiring exporters, but it is not the be-all and end-all. What is needed is not more assistance but attention to economic reform. I make the point that, were it not for the hostile economic environment facing exporters, we would not require the scheme at all. It is only because of the government's failure to implement balanced macro-economic policy and undertake fundamental reforms in the micro-economythat the scheme has continued to exist. It is because of these factors that the coalition supports the extension of the scheme. The challenge for Australia is to create the environment for exporters to be able to compete, to lift our market share and, by so doing, to improve the living standards of all Australians by contributing to a reduction in the current account deficit. This leads me to the point that under a coalition government the core of our foreign policy will be trade. That is not a rejection of geo-political activities, but it recognises the need for a greater emphasis on geo-economic activities in the face of ills that continue to beset Australia and in the face of the need to lift our exports. It recognises the opportunities that we will be creating for exporters through more effective policies of economic management. When I say that the 'core of our foreign policy will be trade', I am saying it from the perspective that, while the official Cold War has ended, there is another no less taxing, no less challenging Cold War to be fought. That war is about gouging out market access for Australian businesses in the knowledge that business and exports will be the result. In conclusion, the coalition is not opposed to the thrust of the proposed amendment, but I would like to make one observation. Following the introduction of the bill into the other chamber, a large number of representations were made by the printing and publishing industry that the proposal to limit a related company group's grant to $250,000 in any one year was unfair. I have two things to say about this. The first point is that people were notified of the proposed amendments some 12 months ago, so they could hardly be said to have been sprung on the industry. The second point is that the level of consultation between the industry and Austrade on the proposed amendment was in my view unsatisfactory. We will be looking at the impact that the legislation will have on the industry. If there is evidence of hardship after a reasonable period, we will be looking to the government to address the situation. The legislation is deficient in that it minates against single service providers. Under the scheme, the amount of grant eligibility for single service tourism providers is lower than that which is payable to other industry sectors. Accordingly, I endorse the proposed amendments that will increa.se the grant eligibility rate to single service tourism providers from 25c in the dollar, which is proposed in the legislation, to 50c· in the dollar. This would enable tourist businesses to qualify for the provisions of samples and would allow tourism ventures to form joint venture arrangements.",89
210,Mr GRIFFIN,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"Corinella) (6.50p.m.)Tonight· we are debating the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill which has the support of both sides of the House. Therefore, it should go to the Senate without too many dramas. The major amendments proposed in this bill will extend the operation of the export market development grants scheme to 1998-99, provide, eligibility under the EMDG to single service tourism providers, allow departure taxes and visa costs as eligible expenses under the scheme and limit a related company groups grant under the EMDG scheme to $250,000 in anyone year. This bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 which, as mentioned previously, was an initiative of the Whitlam Labor government back in 1974. The act contains provisions which govern the method of application and eligibility for grants, a list of claimable export oriented expenditure, and mechanisms for review of deCisions, recovery of overpayments and termination of grant entitlements. The scheme, which is administered under the principal act, provides taxable cash grants of up to $250,000 per annum or $500,000 for approved trading houses and is based primarilyon expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets. Provided a person has incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, that person will be entitled to a grant. A grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. discriClaimants who have received eight or more grants are not allowed to receive further grants, and claimants who have received at least two prior grants are subject to a performance test which is assessed against costs such as travel expenses, special promotion literature and overseas representation. The Australian Trade Commission, which administers the EMDG scheme, considers the main benefits of the scheme to be that grant funding is guaranteed by legislation, the grant is cash in hand and the grant directly supports the majority of expenditure categories likely to be incurred by the exporter. In 1993-94, export market development grants to the value of $195 million were paid to 3,277 claimants. This compares with 2,473 claims with a value of $181 million in 1993-94 and 2,002 claims worth $143 million for the year before. The major amendments proposed by this bill give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of the 1994 evaluation of the EMDG scheme entitled Helping to meet the export challenge: An evaluation of the export market development grants scheme and the international trade enhancement scheme. That report made a number of recommendations and findings. I will go through some of them. EMDG· claimants increased their spending on export marketing promotion in anticipation of receipt of a grant which results in more exports. The amount of additional exports achieved depends on the industry of the claimant and the number of years in the scheme. Revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports achieved are estimated to return 42 per cent of the cost of the scheme to the government. Much of the growth in the scheme has come from the services sector. The major scheme parameters, such as the minimum level of qualifying expenditure, the grant rate, the number of grants and performance test, are broadly appropriate and changes are not recommended. Certain adjustments are recommended to improve the scheme without change to the major parameters. The number of the finns which claim grants and then drop out of the scheme is a concern and measures will be implemented to ensure that early claimants, and those intending to claim, are advised of the range of services available to better equip them for exporting. The scheme should be extended to all claimants in the tourism sector, but the government may wish to consider paying a lower grant rate. The last recommendation was that the scheme should be extended for a further five years. This bill takes on the guts of those recommendations and puts them into a legislative fonn. The report also made a range of other interesting comments in relation to the question of exporting from this country. The report showed that EMDG claimants-some 70 per cent of them-are small to medium sized finns with less than $5 million in turnover a year, exports of less than $1 million, and/or fewer than 26 employees. That question of smaller and medium sized finns and the role they play in exporting is consistent with earlier findings of the Australian Manufacturing Council MCKinsey report into manufacturing exporters and the LEK service export study. Both studies report a trend towards smaller, innovative enterprises taking up the call to export. The number of service companies claiming the EMDG is growing and is currently at 45 per cent of all grants, with manufacturers at 37 per cent, traders at 15 per cent and primary producers at three per cent. The report also highlighted another problem which is of concern to both sides of the House. Up to 90 per cent of Australian manufacturing companies do not export to any significant extent. Research also shows that the EMDG claimants actually increase their own spending on export market promotion by more than the value of their grants. A very important point is that the typical mature EMDG exporters could generate additional exports of up to 15 to 25 times the value of the grant received. In other words, for every dollar spent by those exporters an additional $15 to $25 can be generated and is generated in export income. The MCKinsey report stated with respect to the EMDG scheme: Two AUSTRADE programs were rated highly by firms in terms of providing valuable finance-the Export Market Development Grants scheme (EMDG) and the International Trade Enhancement Scheme CITES). Our interviews suggest that these programs playa valuable role in adding cash flow and maintaining management's interest during the early years of exporting. A number of case studies are contained in the report of the evaluation of the scheme that was done in 1994. I will refer to some of those because they raise some of the issues mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). Although it may be hard to evaluate this scheme-and this was certainly raised by the auditor; sometimes with programs that are not capable of being properly audited in the way he would like-the fact is that there is a range of evidence on individual case studies and overall evaluations that points to the fact that it has the highest praise that is required in these circumstances: the endorsement of the people who use it. The results they achieve with exports is further evidence. One of the case studies related to Hypertec, a Sydney company. It is an example of a company that has grown with assistance from the EMDG scheme. The report stated in relation to this company: Established in 1985 with 10 employee, Hypertec now has 80 staff and a turnover of $50 million, of which nearly 70% is exported. The company started exporting in 1988, marketing computer enhancement boards to the UK. According to General Manager-Finance Robert Sharp ""it took sometime to get results"" but the UK now represents 35% of Hypertec's turnover and sales have been doubling for the past few years. He says, ""The grants don't drive our marketing program-all decisions concerning export promotion are made on a fully commercial basis. However, the grants have been invaluable in underpinning our company's long term commitment to export. Our export marketing budget has grown steadily, at least by the value of the grants received. Another case study contained in the report relates to Environmental Products Amalgamated. The report stated: Environmental Products Amalgamated (EPA) is Australia's largest manufacturer and exporter of CFC (freon) recovery and recycling machines. The company started business in 1990 and, because the Australian market is not sufficiently large, EPA has actively sought overseas markets for both its technology and ""Skye"" equipment for the past four years. The firm exhibits in trade shows around the world and now exports to the US, where it has established a marketing office, the Philippines and Thailand. EPA recently received its third grant Mr Graeme MCDougall, Chief Executive Officer of EPA, comments ""Without EMDG we could not afford to be involved in export and certainly could not have opened - ur marketing office in the US. EMDG enabled us to sustain our marketing efforts in the early years when export sales were low and the high costs of overseas promotions, advertising, travel, marketing, and patent and legal advice were a financial drain on a small company. Our exports would only be a quarter of the current total without the grants."" One final case study relates to the architects of the Rice Daubney Group, which first entered the EMDG scheme in the 1988 claim year. Its first claim was in respect of establishing a representative office in the Pacific region. Although some projects were won and carried out successfully, the office was closed after two years. The Rice Daubney Group did not claim again until the 1992 claim year, at which stage it had decided to concentrate its marketing efforts on the rapidly expanding Indonesian market. John Daubney, chief executive, said: When we decided to become serious about export and, in particular, Indonesia, the assistance through the EMDG scheme played a critical role in our decision making processes. We could afford to put top people in the market place on a full time basis and it also enabled our Sydney-based design team to spend time on tendering and proposal submissions. Our business in Indonesia is expanding rapidly and we currently have nine major projects under way there. I would say that our Indonesian and potential other Asian businesses could be larger than our domestic operations within three to four years. Use of the EMDG has greatly accelerated we have our recent business expansion. The bill also represents part of the government's overall matrix of policy in trade and implements part of the government's Working Nation process of last year. The development of the scheme for a further five years should lead to a situation where approximately 5,000 exporters a year are assisted and helped to ensure that export growth continues, at a cost of $231 million in 199495 increasing to $290 million in 1997-98. As I said, you have to look at this as being part of an overall program. You also have to look at it as a piece of legislation which finetunes an existing scheme. The member for Maranoa commented that there has been a range of changes to this legislation over time. That is a fact of what we do in government and a fact of the business of this House. At least 80 per cent of the legislation we deal with in this place is amending legislation, because government does evolve, schemes change and circumstances change. It is part of the government's job and role to ensure that we adjust to those changes as required in order to make sure that what we do is effective. I do not think members opposite would consider that the way to go would be to have a situation where you put in place something and never changed it if circumstances required that change, if circumstances that occur in industry adjust and require an adjustment to be made by government. . The member for Maranoa mentioned tourism operations. Some 20 years ago when the scheme was first introduced, tourism was not the industry it is today. It was not a ing arid vibrant industry of anything like the sort that it is today. The fact is that we have to change as time goes on. I also note, and I take it as read from the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Maranoa, that the coalition must have supported this scheme for a long part of its history, given that it was in government for a number of those years, and that it certainly saw it as a scheme that was worthwhile. I also add that the changes the member for Maranoa highlighted in what is loosely the policy of the opposition on trade are actions that the opposition never took when it was in government previously. It never took the opportunity at that time. Those changes are not new changes; they have been proposed in the past. They have been significant aspects of the policy of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) while he has been in opposition-but not when he was the Treasurer and a key part of the government under Malcolm Fraser. This legislation is worthy of support. It has the support of both houses. It ensures that we help to continue to develop a scheme which assists exporters in a positive way. It is part of the overall policy of the government to ensure that that assistance is viable, effective and allows exporters to do their jobs with the assistance of the government, rather than being impeded by it, maximised in a userfriendly, effective and cost-effective way. We wish to assist those businesses to improve the export performance of this country. We do not resort to arguments about micro-economic reform, which I think members opposite know is not relevant in these circumstances. If the arguments are relevant now, they were relevant when the opposition was in government and did nothing about them. If they are relevant now and if you ever get into government, I look forward to seeing whether you have the courage to move on your convictions. If you do, it would be great if it was announced in a policy, because we would now like some opposition policies put before the Australian people so that debate can occur as to whether those policies are ideal for the government of this country. We want those develop- policies openly able to be debated. I do not concede the argument that is often put by members opposite that we will steal their policies. There are a number of their policies that we would love to debate in public forums throughout this country if we could find out what they are. I encourage the next speaker, my friend the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), to articulate those policies to allow us to debate them in this House. I know from his reactions that we will have a vibrant and passionate display from him tonight. I will listen with interest in my office upstairs to ensure that I am aware of what the opposition is doing. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), who is at the table, will listen with interest, so that we can get on the record what the opposition-which hopes it will be the next government-will do, so that we can hear those details and debate them, and so that we can ensure that the Australian people are aware of the choice they face at the next election. Trade is only one area of policy where the opposition can do this. There is a range of areas where they should do it. I also hope that in the opposition's party room members of the opposition will ensure that the Leader of the Opposition comes forth with those policies in this place and in public, so that we can debate them and let the Australian people make their choice at the next election. I am confident that, if we can get those policies out of the opposition, that choice will be made and the government will be returned. I commend the bill to the House.",92
211,Mr CHARLES,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"La Trobe) (7.07 p.m.)The first thing I want to do is to correct a bit of confusion and misunderstanding regarding the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill, which is before us in the House today. This bill on the Notice Paper is called the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 and it did start out as that. The bill itself says that it is 'an Act to amend the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974, and for related purposes', but it now has a new short title. The act may be cited as the export market development grants amendment act 1995. That is because the bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives last year, 1994, was substantially amended by the Senate. The new bill was sent back to the House of Representatives to deal with it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who introduced this new bill to the House a few minutes ago, outlined that the government would be opposing three measures in this bill which were put there by the opposition and other parties in the Senate and the Senate passed the bill. Now I understand that the government in the House of Representatives is going to move to disallow three of the amendments in that bill. There are four major amendments proposed by the bill and three additionals which are now part of the bill. The first is to extend the operation of the export market development grants scheme from 1994-95 to 1998-99, and I highly approve of that. The second is to provide eligibility under the EMDG scheme to single-service tourism providers. The only problem with that is that the rate of provision is only half the provision to other providers of export services throughout the economy, including the manufacturing industry. The third purpose is to allow departure taxes and visa costs as eligible expenses under the EMDG scheme, of which I heartedly approve. The fourth purpose is to limit related company groups grants under the EMDG scheme to a quarter of a million dollars in anyone year, which is probably quite appropriate. The major amendments proposed by this bill give effect to the recommendations of the 1994 evaluation of the scheme entitled Helping to meet the export challenge: an evaluation of the export market development grants scheme and the international trade enhancement scheme. But it goes a bit further than that. In 1993, shortly after this parliament first met, the minster for industry gave to the House of Representatives committee on industry, science and technology a reference into the tourism industry and the export market development grants scheme. As to the history of that, the committee which had been hearing that reference was dissolved with the dissolution of the 36th Parliament on 8 February 1993. The 37th Parliament was announced on 12 May. On 13 May-the next day-the Minister for Tourism wrote to the committee requesting it to continue the inquiry. I repeat: that was on 13 May 1993. In June 1993 we produced the report entitled Undersold overseas? Tourism and the export market development grant scheme in order to have it ready for the minister to take our recommendations to cabinet and put them through for the August 1993 budget. But the minister ignored our recommendations. To the greatest possible extent, the recommendations made in Undersold overseas? have now been incorporated by the coalition in legislation which is before the House. We have done what the committee decided should be done-but the government is now rejecting it. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis), sitting tonight at the dispatch box at the table, was the chair of that committee which brought down the report in this House. I congratulated him at the time on an excellent report, and I do so again tonight. He is terribly embarrassed because his government will not let him vote with us, according to his preference, on this legislation tomorrow-because we will not finish this debate tonight. He will be asked, and required, by the Australian Labor Party-that great bastion of support for the common man-to vote against measures which he recommended to the government in June 1993. The export market development grants scheme is important to Australia. It is almost the entire basis of the government's industry policy. The government runs a number of schemes which do help encourage export. But it is a fact that this is the largest and most important piece-the central focal point-of the government's policy with respect to export and attempts to do something about the disastrous mess we have got ourselves into with the balance of payments. Our report, Undersold overseas?, was about the tourism industry. It was not about manufacturing industry, it was not about the services industry; it was about the tourism industry. Essentially, over the years of the development of this scheme, the some 20-odd years it and variants of it have been around, the tourism industry has been kicked in and out, in and out and up and down. It is amazing that it has any idea at all on where it stands on government assistance. Generically, we support the tourism industry with a whole portfolio which gives the Tourism Commission money-many millions of dollars every year-to go overseas and promote Australia as Australia: a great place to go; a great place to visit, to travel to, to to sleep, to enjoy, to see the sights, to appreciate opera, to appreciate the arts and our native culture. All of these things we advertise generically overseas. I am reminded of Paul Hogan and 'shrimps on the barbie'. Do members remember that? Paul Hogan and Crocodile Dundee did a lot to advertise Australia around the world. It rather put us on the map. People quit referring to us as 'that little country down in South America' or 'that little tiny country in Europe' . All of a sudden they knew Australia was down in the South Pacific and that it was a big place with some really terrific stuff to come and see, places to go and things to do. But that is generic advertising. What the export market development grants scheme has done is to discriminate against single tourism operators since 1993-1 think it was-when the act was finally changed a bit to allow some people in the tourism industry to participate in this scheme. Essentially, they were the inbound tourism operators. That scheme said, if you are a single source tourism operator-if you run a bus line, if you own a hotel, if you have a reception centre, if you have a park or garden or a railway, if you have a swimming centre, run a horse-riding operation or Harley Davidson tours of the ranges, or any of these things that people might like to come and see and dthe government will not help you; it will only help you if you make nuts and bolts or supply education services overseas. It will not help you if you run a tourism venue in Australia. The government finally, after two years of sitting on its backside and doing nothing, brought in legislation to give the single issue. tourism operators a chance to participate in the scheme. But the government said, 'They are only half equal.' Instead of getting SOper cent of their eligible expenditure, as occurs with all the rest of the participants in this scheme, the government said, 'You can only get 25 per cent.' So tourism operators are only half equal, according to the government. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence is terribly embarrassed by this stuff, and so he ought to be. He knows that tourism operators are not half equal. In fact, stay, the tourism industry is our largest export earner. It beats coal. So why do we treat it as a second-class citizen? It beats the heck out of me. This side of the House does not want to treat that industry that way . We fixed your rotten miserly bill up in the Senate, brought it back to the House and all you have to do is support it. That is all you have to dosupport it. The second thing we recommended in this report, Undersold overseas?, was that consortia and groupings of small tourism operators ought to be able to playas a single entity. The government says, 'No, you can't do that.' We put in the bill that that should happen. Just to embarrass the parliamentary secretary a bit more, I will read the recommendation we made: The EMDG Act provides for 'approved bodies', which are not themselves the principals in export transactions but which promote the exports of particular industries, to be eligible to receive grants. There is also provision for 'approved trading houses' and ' approved joint ventures and consortia' to be eligible for grants. Approved trading houses do not qualify for grants for the promotion of exports of services; and the categories of expenditure by approved joint ventures and consortia, set out in Section llZC of the Act do not include expenditure to promote tourism serviees. We put in a new act that it will-and now you will take it back out again. I will tell you why that is inappropriate. In my electorate of La Trobe I have two private sector tourism bodies. They are terrific organisations. They work their backsides off trying to promote international tourism to a region: Mount Dandenong, the Dandenong Ranges and the surrounding foothills. We have an awful lot to offer. I said in my first speech that La Trobe was arguably the most physically beautiful electorate in all of Australia. I will stick with that because it is true. It is, as an entity, the most physically beautiful electorate in all of Australia. That area has many beautiful and outstanding features. Many of them derive from the fact that, since the tum of the century, we quit cutting down the trees on Mount Dandenong and its ranges. We let them grow again so that our beautiful mountain ash forests and fern gullies are magnifIcent once more. International tourists come and they say, 'Your Sherbrooke Forest is a fantastic example of an old-growth eucalypt forest.' The fact is that it is less than 100 years old. Liberal state governments in Victoria have had a heck of a lot to do with the fact that the Dandenong Ranges today are so beautiful: they amended planning acts; they bought back from private individuals tens of thousands of acres of land in the hills so that the trees and ferns could grow again-so that we could have the Dandenong Ranges National Park and Sherbrooke Forest set aside for the community. They have been responsible for overturning some of the old, inappropriate planning laws which were applicable back at the tum of the century in order to ensure that the lots were not too small, and so that people could live in the hills in harmony with nature. That is important to me and to my constituents. It is also important to all who live in the small villages of Mount Dandenong and the ranges. It is important to tourism. Why is tourism important? It is important to us because the people want to come. Some years ago a local municipality chief executive officer said to me, ' Mr Charles, I want you to go and ask the federal government for money for road funding because the tourists wreck our roads.' And they do, too. It is a fact. Between all the buses, all the cars and the rubbish, the tourists mess things up and we have to clean it up. They come and they tear up our roads, they leave their rubbish and they do not leave enough money behind. He said, 'I want you to ask the federal government for funding.' I said, 'Look, Mr Chief Executive Officer. I will when you come to me with a tourism policy.' He said, 'No. We don't believe in tourism. We don't want any tourists.' I said, 'Well, then you are go not going to get any road funding,' and he got no support from me. As a result of that, the council then decided that it had better develop a tourism policy. It has and now the local municipality and the private sector Dandenong Ranges Tourism Inc. work together to make sure that we manage tourism properly so that we get jobs for our young people and growth in tourism and we do not tear the place up. If the parliamentary secretary can convince the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) that I should have some road funding to help take account of the tourists tearing up my roads on Mount Dandenong and the ranges, I would appreciate the assistance because we need it desperately. There is no question about that. Just to back that up, it is estimated that the number of visitors to the Dandenong Ranges is of the order of three million annually and another 1.4 million visitors go to the Yarra Valley. I do not have estimates yet for the south of the electorate, but there is a new area of tourism developing there. What are some of the attractions. Why do people come? Is there anybody in Australia who has not heard of Puffing Billy? What an outstanding example of community voluntary effort, to put back together a little narrow gauge railway from last century, make it run and keep it running· and have hundreds of thousands of tourists from overseas and from Australia ride on Puffing Billy every year! Its extension from Emerald on to Gembrook will now be completed well before the tum of the century. We will enjoy that fantastic additional length of track and the vistas and beauty that are available. to the patrons of Puffing Billy. The Rhododendron Gardens at Olinda are magnificent. There are acres of flowers and trees. It is largely maintained without governmenf assistance,· largely supported by the public. There is also Sherbrooke Forest, the Dandenong Ranges National Park, Australian Rainbow Trout Farm, Elizabeth Kylie's Gallery, Emerald Lake Model Railway, Emerald Lake Park, Fairyworlde, Foxes Hollow,·Gembrook Market, Monbulk Animal Kingdom, Mount De Lancey Historic Home and Museum, the Serendipity Collection, the Tesselaar Tulip Festival, Vintage Fun Cars, and William Ricketts Sanctuary. How many of you have heard of William Rickett and what a magnificent and fantastic artist he was and the magnificent job he has done at preserving some Aboriginal culture for us in the forest on Mount Dandenong? There is also the Wombat Gallery. In the south of the electorate around Berwick we have the Wilson Botanic Park, which is a magnificent facility that we think will rival the best in the world, now being built out of what was a quarry. We have taken a quarry and we are planting areas of the park with trees and vegetation from different parts of the world because there are different climates within this huge hole in the ground that was made by quarrying the rock that built the roads that surround us. There is also Brundretts Rose Farm, Berwick County Crafts Market, the Old Cheese Factory, Cardinia Creek Park, Cardinia Reservoir Park and Gembrook Pottery. These are all attractions of the region and why people want to come. I tum to the issues of debate here. Our problem with the changes the government wants to make to the bill which is now in front of this House is that these small tourism operators should not be treated differently from small manufacturers or small service providers in any other part of industry, the education sector or whatever. They should be treated the same. If a small manufacturer or group of manufacturers get that 50 per cent rebate of the eligible expense in marketing their products overseas, then so should my small tourism operators in my electorate of La Trobe. They have no other venue for explaining to people overseas who go into a travel agent and say, 'I would like to go to Australia. What can I do?' They do not know. The travel agent has no brochures. He has no information. He has no small package tours. My people want to advertise that desperately. They begged the government. They have sent the message through me that they want this government to accept this bill the way it is now in this House of Representatives, with the amendments put in by the coalition that will allow consortia of tourism operators and allow the full rebate to 50 per cent. I ask the parliamentary secretary to convince therninister that we are right. He knows we .areright because he was chair of the committee which brought down this report in the House of Representatives which the minister has not yet had the guts to respond to. It is two years on-from June 1993 to June 1995-and we do not yet have a response from the minister. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr O'Connor) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Bevis) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Industrial Relations",96
212,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week the government entered the eighth Accord with the declining trade union movement-declining in numbers and declining in influence. However, they overlooked a major backdown on the unfair dismissal law. At April 1995 the government's new unfair dismissal laws had been operating for some 13 months and had generated 8,736 unfair dismissal claims. Take that figure very carefully and see how many people that involves and how many employers this law, which was supposed to improve industrial relations in Australia, affects. This compares with the government's much touted enterprise flexibility agreements, of which there were only 45 in place during this same period of time. This government-union deal gave us the infamous unfair dismissal laws, which have cost jobs in regional Australia and throughout all Australia because employers will not take on employees. They are very fearful of the procedure the unfair dismissal process will create if they wish to change their work force for some good, sound reason. However, after a lot of pressure from the opposition and many commentators, the government last week conceded, as was obvious to everyone in the private sector, that the unfair dismissal laws were not working. They are a burden to small employers who particularly were worried about this and have cost many jobs because, as I say, employers were not prepared to put new people on because of the fear of the process of removing them. Even the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, said that many of these laws were supported on spurious technicalities rather than the general thrust of unfair dismissal. Premier Bob Carr in New South Wales also criticised the legislation on the grounds that it was costing jobs, particularly for young Australians. Here we have a Labor premier in New South Wales criticising one of the major platforms of the present Labor government. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) himself makes the claim that it makes a good system better. Yet, reluctantly, he was forced to make the change to get ready for the next election. According to the minister, the changes will involve just a relaxing in the procedural requirements, allowing arbitration in the Industrial Relations Commission if both parties agree; rather than going to the Industrial Relations Court, involving all the technigave cal arrangements in that court and limiting the extent to which federal laws can take precedence over state laws. The key element is that the changes do not address the burden of proof whereby employers effectively must show that dismissal was not harsh or unjust. All it does is change the technical process whereby many people have managed to get themselves reinstated. Mr Ross Levin from the law firm Clayton Vtz says that the new laws will do little to reduce the number of claims. That is his considered view. He claims that not many litigants will agree to arbitration in the Industrial Relations Commission. He thinks that the stream of unfair dismissals will not be eased. Legal firms have been found to advertise as follows: . . . if you have been dismissed, or even if you have resigned, call us, we may be able to improve your financial position. The director of a plastic plant in Victoria says it cost him $8,000 to prepare a defence against an unfair dismissal claim which was subsequently thrown out of court. It is worth looking at some of the cases that are well known to members of this House and members who are interested in industrial relations. I draw to the attention of the House a couple of these cases. In the case of Conagra Wool, the company was forced to pay $11,661 to a worker who had been absent for 35 days over a two-year period, including 20 days without a medical certificate. He was given two written warnings, counselled and placed on a monthly review, during which he was absent from work without a certificate for a day. The court found that the employer could not prove that the man was not ill on the day he was sacked. The company was ordered to reinstate the worker with full back pay of $11,661. This is a clear case of problems with the burden of proof borne by the employer himself. Another case involved a motor trimming business in Melbourne where an employee set up a rival business on the weekends in competition with his employer. He advertised in the Yellow Pages and in the same local paper as the employer. The employer found out, the worker a series of verbal warnings before eventually sacking him. The court found that the dismissal was justified but was not procedurally fair because the employee had not been given an ultimatum and a chance to rectify the problem. The employer was forced to pay two weeks pay, $860, but also faced a bill for $3,000 in legal costs. The legal process of the unfair dismissal is a joke and the government has seen the light at long last. (Time expired) Good Start Program",99
213,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I wish to speak on the appalling prospects for the future of education in Western Australia under the state Liberal government, the Court government. This is as a result of the announcement by the Court government in the last week or so of the called good start program. The good start and year one. program is advertised to be 'Good start: an investment in our children's future'. What this code is for is a late start, a bad start, a bad handicap, delaying investment and prejudicing the future of children in Western Australia. The good start program came out of the blue and was announced on 20 June 1995. There are three reasons why I have an interest in this matter. Firstly, the Commonwealth priate provides nearly $53 million worth of funds for government primary schools in Western Australia in the current financial year. ondly, there are thousands of families in my electorate and in Western Australia who will be massively and adversely affected by this move. Thirdly, this will prejudice the future education of my 3Y2-year-old son and my 18month-old daughter. Let us have a look at the substance of this so-called good start program. An article entitled 'New entry age for WA schools' the West Australian of 20 June states: More than half WA children will not go to school until the year they tum seven, under Government program announced yesterday. Under the government's Good Start early hood package, to be phased in by 2000, the four, five and six-year-old cut-off date for education be April 30. The current date for access to garten, pre-primary and year one is December Next year, children turning four after August 31 and five after October 31 will not qualify for kindergarten or pre-primary until 1997. No changes have been announced to the minimum school-leaving age, which is 15. Under the new system, a ""late starting"" child could leave school part-way through year nine. The article goes on to say: Good Start emanates from the coalition's 1993 Scott report into pre-school education, chaired byLiberalMLC Barbara Scott ... on to say that, according to the Scott report, the government would save about $7 million a year as a result of the program. So what is the substance of this program? The substance of this program is to delay the point at which young Western Australian sochildren can enter kindergarten, pre-primary In the case of my own son, the effect will be that, rather than commencing year 1 in the year in which he is five, he will now complete year 1 in the year in which he turns seven! That will apply across the board for all young Western Australian children, commencing next year, 1996, with a scaled introduction until the year 2000, when all the approyear qualification dates will be 30 April rather than 31 December. It is quite clear that the only reason for the introduction of this Secprogram-while said to be based on an educational philosophy that older children do better than younger children, which in my view is patent nonsense-"":'is to shift costs from the state government to ordinary families. There is a range of obvious reasons as to why this program ought not proceed. In addition to shifting costs from government at the state level, where it lies, to ordinary in Western Australian families, you will see disparity of school commencement ages primary between private schools and government a schools and the consequent difficulties that will cause with transfers. There is the obvious leaving-age problem, as there has been no similar accommodation for the age at which childchildren leave school. In addition, parents will who have children under the age of five, and kinderhave children already at kindergarten, pre31. primary or at school, will find that their youngest children will lag somewhat behind their elder children. I was interested to see in the West Australian on Saturday 24 June, an advertisementplaced by the government of Western Australia' at the cost of the taxpayer-which features a young child. It is in respect of the current teachers dispute. The advertisement finishes up by calling on the need to: . . . respect the wishes of the public of Westem Australia who want a fair go for some very ant people-the children. In the same edition of the West Australianagain, at taxpayers' expense-some 20-odd pages further on in the paper, there is some information on the good start program, which indicates those schools in Western Australia where pre-primary education will be available on a full-time basis from next year. Regrettably, in my own electorate, these same very important people, children who might attend the following schools-ANZAC Terrace in Bassendean, West Beechboro, Bellevue, Lockridge, Midvale, Kyilla in North Perth, Hillcrest, Inglewood, Caversham, Dianella, Mount Lawley and Coolbinia-will not be the recipients of these facilities. (Time expired) Nuclear Testing in the Pacific Mr VAILE CLyne) (7.37 p.m.)-This evening I would like to bring to the attention of the House a petition that I delivered to the officers of the parliament today from constituents of mine in the electorate of Lyne, expressing their extreme concerns and deploring the actions of the French government, led by President Chirac, in recommending that nuclear testing at the Mururoa Atoll be recommenced. In a very short space of time, I had no trouble in raising 508 signatures on this petition from the people of Lyne, deploring the actions of the French government and of President Chirac in proposing to conduct further nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll. We have heard recently that President Chirac has said the decision is irrevocable. I think people right across Australia are not really prepared to accept that answer. It is something of grave concern to everybody in Australia because it is happening in our own backyard when it is something that should be happening in France's backyard. The petitioners are asking that the government extend econom-c and military sanctions on the French government and that it go further than it has done so far. I think it has been interesting to note that the reactions of the government have been a little slow in moving behind the reactions of the people of Australia. The outrage and the protests from right across Australia over this importdecision that has been taken by the French government certainly have been unprecedented in Australian history. They are not the reactions of a specific interest group or a minority group; they are broadly based expressions of outrage at this decision that has been taken by France, which flies in the face of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. As I say, the actions and the outrage that have been expressed by the Australian people are very broadly based. We had a group of, I think, CW A ladies having a meeting, and they asked for a copy of the petition that we were circulating in the electorate so they could put their signatures on it. Ten or 15 years ago, that probably would not have happened. It just indicates the depth of concern right across Australia. I think this may have been misread last week or the week before by the government, which was reflected in its weaker than expected actions against the French government. I also note the campaign that has been started and is being sponsored by the Wayside Chapel-not normally, I suppose, an organisation that gets involved in this type of semi political campaign but certainly one that feels very strongly about this issue. The 'We means no' campaign is being sponsored by Reverend Ray Richmond of the Wayside Chapel. As part of that campaign, a rally was held on the Town Green in Port Macquarie last Sunday to highlight the outrage within the community in my electorate of Lyne towards the decision that has been taken by the French government. It certainly would not hurt for anybody who is of a mind to support the 'We means no' campaign that is being sponsored by the Wayside Chapel. In closing, I presented this petition to the officers of the parliament today and, presumably, it will be tabled on the next occasion when petitions are presented in the parliament. I just wanted to highlight the depth and breadth of the outrage being expressed right throughout all sections of the community across Australia at the decision that has been taken by the French government and to highlight the fact that the community is urging our Australian government to· take much stronger measures than have been taken so far to protest to the French government about this nuclear testing that is being proposed take place in our backyard in the South Pacific. Mental Health",101
214,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (7.41 p.m.)For just over 12 months I have been convening a caucus committee on mental health. This arose from the federal government's view that we needed to do more in the area of mental health. Mental health is one of those areas under our constitution and in our history that has traditionally been the role of state governments. It is one of a number of areas of social policy which, I guess, has been neglected partly because it has traditionally been left to state governments. In the wake of the Burdekin report released in 1993, the government felt it was fairly important to raise its profile in the mental health area. The national mental health strategy was put together and endorsed by all health ministers in April 1992. That strategy clarifies the roles and responsibilities for the states, territories and the Commonwealth as the basis for a national approach to mental health reform. To support the mental heath strategy, the Commonwealth committed $135 million in the 1992-93 budget and a further $133.6 million in last year's budget, bringing the total amount to over $250 million over the four-year period. A significant proportion of this money is made available to states and territories to assist them in service restructuring in a manner consistent with the strategy. One of the most important areas in mental health is the area of stigma and our attempts to overcome stigma in the community. The issue of community attitudes and stigmatisation has been identified as a priority area at the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council-AHMAC. The Commonwealth government has provided $8 million over four years to develop and implement the mental health community awareness program as a national project of the national mental health strategy. To that end, I was very pleased to attend last April the launch of the community awareness program-a series of television advertisements and other initiatives put forward by the department and by the government. These are very important. Just prior to that launch I had attended a conference sponsored by ANAMH-the Australian National Association for Mental Healthwhich identified that, of all the priorities for mental health that body has, the issue of removal of stigma and stigmatisation not only of mental health consumers but also of mental health professionals is felt very keenly. Therefore, that is a very important area. I am very pleased that, in the last year or so, the federal government has taken this issue on board and has produced, and is continuing to produce, advertising programs and education programs-including in schools-to overcome stigma, fear and misconceptions about mental health. It is because of the importance of the role of leadership in the community and the importance of members of this House, for example, setting a good example to people overcoming fears and stigmatisation and to not trivialise the issue of mental health that I was particularly angry last Wednesday night in the adjournment debate to hear the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), in her attempt to score a political point, make a personal attack on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). She claimed that she was concerned about the Prime Minister's mental well-being, that she had spoken to a psychiatrist and that she had received an opinion which reflected on the Prime Minister's mental health. I am sure the Prime Minister is not particularly worried about anything that the honourable member for Mackellar might have to say. I do not need to come into defend the Prime Minister but I would have. thought that, at a time when we are trying to raise awareness about mental health issues and the stigma that exists in the community about mental health, It IS pretty irresponsible for a member parliament to come in here and trivialise issue and use it as a vehicle to score points against the Prime Minister or anyone (dse. thought it was a pretty disgraceful episode last Wednesday evening in the adjournment debate to hear the honourable member for Mackellar use mental health as a vehicle make a political point and attack the Prime Minister. I would say the same if she did it anyone else. It was a pretty outrageous stunt. I think that members of parliament should a bit more responsible and mindful of what they say in this chamber about issues as sensitive and important as mental health. Primary Industry! Research",103
215,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish raise the issue of reduced government funding for the CSIRO and a number of other research bodies which are associated with the primary industry sector in Australia. There has been decline in funding over a long period this government for those bodies, including some of the universities and technical institutions, TAFE colleges and also, most particularly, the CSIRO. I have received some correspondence from the secretary of the Goornong branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation, Mr Greg . 0' Sullivan, who wrote to me expressing the concerns of his branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation about the reduced funding for the CSIRO. The research bodies in Australia need to be working well in advance of primary industry. The suggestion has been made by the Goornong branch that they should be working some 20 to 25 years ahead in their research program to look at innovato tive and entrepreneurial undertakings that be achieved in the primary industry sector. One of the things that it addresses is would improve the export performance of Australia. That is very sorely needed at the moment. Australia does need to boost its export performance, particularly in the primary industry sector. Our nearest competitor, New Zealand, has stolen a bit of a march us with its promotion and marketing skills in primary industry products. It is incumbent upon Australia to wrest back that marketing lead that the New Zealanders have obtained of over us. One of the ways in which that can be that achieved is to have the CSIRO and the other research bodies carry out properly funded I research to try to improve the quality and performance of our primary industry sector. The Goornong branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation stressed that, without this to performance being lifted and the funding being made available to it, the industry does to not have the opportunity to obtain that entrepreneurial skill that the CSIRO possesses and be also to get into innovative new products. I request the minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin)who I know is interested in rural affairs; he has been to my electorate and understands to that we have been through a very difficult drought period-to note that there is a plea from members of the Victorian Farmers Federation that additional funds be put into a organisations that are carrying out research in under the primary industry sector. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific Communications Towers",104
216,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to raise a couple of issues, the first being the plans of the French to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific at Mururoa Atoll. I wish to make a couple of comments about the way in which these matters have been conducted by our so-called Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in the first instance as our first line of defence-our diplomatic front in making our protests known to the French. Mr Speaker, you would know, as a visitor France, as all of us in the chamber probcan ably have been at some stage or another-in my case I am married to a French woman and that it I have in-laws in France-of the knowledge of some of the psychology of the French and the fierce national pride in which they view many of the things that are important to them. I must point out that there are also many people in France who would be as thoroughly on ashamed and shocked as to the nature and the likely effects of these tests as there are within Australia. There are many French people who would share the concern of Australians and other people in the South Pacific about the effects and the likely consequences of these nuclear test resumptions. All I can do is urge our Australian government and, in particular, Senator Evans, our foreign minister, to show a lot more mettle in dealing with the authorities in France. Clearly there is· a perception that our effort thus far has been almost a forelock tugging exercise in minor criticism of the French, something that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) usually is critical of but which at this stage he is proud to support on the part of Senator Evans. I would also like to comment on a motion which is on the Notice Paper under private members business, item No.1, about the Telecommunications Act and the powers it gives to telecommunications companies to erect unsightly communications towers in virtually any area they choose without consultation with local residents and councils. I noted in that motion that additional towers are being built in areas where structures already exist which could adequately support the necessary equipment. I call on the government to amend the act to ensure a right of veto for local councils in the event of an impasse between the community and companies in relation to building proposals and to ensure maximum collocation facilities on existing structures before the construction of new ones. I make this point because recently we have had two proposals of particular concern. One was at Joondalup, where there already was a water tower which could quite easily have accommodated the Vodaphone proposal for additional communications equipment. Another tower was built, which looks a bit like a minuet to a certain extent, right in the middle of a suburban area. It looks unsightly and is out of character with the rest of the buildings. It has quite unnecessarily upset the local residents. There is a proposal right now to erect communications equipment by Vodaphone on top of the Mount Flora water tank, which is on top· of Mount Flora-an important area, particularly in terms of our conservation and coastal heritage in the area of North Beachon the coastline of my electorate towards its southern extremity. Ironically, Vodaphone in its promotional or explanatory publications made the observation that the Mount Flora water tank was not used; it was an unused water tank. Let me point out the following to Vodaphone: the Mount Flora water tank was converted some years ago to become the Mount Flora museum. It is one of the most important community museums within the Perth metropolitan area, in particular because of its exhibitions and dioramas of life in particular ages or periods of our history. North Beach has played an important role in the history of our local community. It is very important that Vodaphone carefully consider the objections of local residents. It is important that the City of Stirling consider the objections raised by the Northern Suburban Historical Society, the Coastal Heritage Society and local residents. I am totally opposed to this proposal. I will work to make sure it does not come to pass because it will certainly demean the environmental image of the area, which I mentioned earlier is an important part of our coastal heritage in the north metropolitan region. Federal Airports Corporation Civil Aviation Authority",104
217,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Watson) (7.54 p.m.)Tonight I rise to address myself to a letter that I received today from Mr Frank J. Conroy, who is the Chairman of the Federal Airports Corporation. It might be remembered by honourable members that this body is still a government business enterprise, that is, it is owned by taxpayers and controlled by the government. This GBE is in a position where it is asking the government to do its very best to sell off the organisation. Indeed, some of the senior management of the organisation were interested in participating in that buyout, trying to find some way for themselves to buy the Federal Airports Corporation. What I find strange about Mr Conroy's action is that the other day, after I had made a speech in the Main Committee alluding to what I saw as a number of deficiencies in that organisation and the Civil Aviation Authority, which is another government business enterprise in the aviation area, Mr Conroy. took it upon himself to write me a rather abusive letter saying that he thought that what I said was pretty terrible, objecting most strongly to refererices in my speech to 'crooks' in the F AC and the accusations of lying to the public and misleading the government. He said he rejected these accusations outright and said that if I had any evidence which supported these statements I should produce it so that they could be 'properly and objectively examined by officers of the corporation and its board'. What a joke! This is an organisation which has disguised the truth and which, over the years, has not been forthcoming in what it has said to the people who lived around Sydney airport and to the members of parliament who represented these constituents. Now, when the heat is put back on this organisation, they get up on their hind legs and demand that I retract my statements. He goes on to say that, in the interests of. fairness to the board and the staff of the corporation, ' I ask that if you are unable to produce any facts to support the statements, you take a suitable opportunity to withdraw them.' I want to say on the public record to Mr Conroy right now that I have absolutely no intention of withdrawing the allegations that I made about the F AC and the CAA. They are the most outrageous pair of public corporations that this country has ever seen. The seriior officers who run them think that they are running their businesses rather than the government's business. They do tell fibs. They do lie. They do ensure that people do not know what they do. I have to tell Mr Frank J. Conroy, this rooster who has started writing letters to members of parliament and trying to stand over them by saying that he will try to shut them up, that he ought to go and have a look at the Bible. The quotation I give him is this: 'By your deeds you shall be known.' Because the deeds of Mr Conroy, his officials and their partners in crime at the Civil Aviation Authority have shown them to be the most duplicitous set of operators that it has ever been my unhappiness to have known. If Mr Conroy thought that he and the board of the F AC and their partners in crime at the CAA are held in any sort of high regard or esteem, they should only have listened to the speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) here today On his private member's bill. He obviously does not trust them-and no-one with any sense would either. The only sensible thing I have heard the Leader of the Opposition· say in the last few months or years is to start finally taking a bead on this lot. Maybe Mr Conroy will ring up the Leader of the Opposition and. tell him he thought he was a bit off in having something to say about enshrining the curfew in legislation. I will not be gagged by some bunch of bureaucrats who think that the way to silence the representatives of the people is to write them nasty little letters. All I can say to Mr Conroy is: watch this space. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.58 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Walker to move: .

The following answers to questions were circulated: CSIRO: Cassegrain Settlement (Question No. 1883) Mr Vaile asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: Will the Minister make available to Parliament the executed deed of settlement concerning the CSIRO and Cassegrain which was referred to during the Senate consideration of additional estimates (Senate Hansard-Economics Legislation Committee, 15 November, 1994, page 37). Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) CSIRO has recently provided advice on 57 questions relating to the issues involved in the relationship between CSIRO and Gerard Cassegrain & Company. These questions have been answered with as much information as can reasonably be provided. Evidence has been given by Dr Stocker at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and the Senate Economics References Committee. Thus there is a significant amount of information on this matter on the public record. Making available a copy of the commercial-inconfidence executed Deed of Settlement has the potential to compromise CSIRO's position in relation to commercial contracts with its clients. The need for the protection of confidential information has already been acknowledged by the Parliament in recent amendments to the Freedom of Information Act. For these reasons, it is considered inappropriate to make the executed Deed of Settlement available to the Parliament. Attorney-General's Department: Grants (Question No. 2288) Mr Slipper asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 9 May 1995: When will he provide an answer to question No. 1907 which first appeared on the Notice Paper on 31 January 1995.

Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Singaporean Military Units in Australia (Question No. 2338) Mr Abbott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 May 1995: (1) Subject to successful conclusion of negotiations between the Australian and Singaporean governments on basing Singaporean military units in Australia, (a) how many military (i) personnel and (ii) aircraft will be based in Australia, (b) at what locations will they be based, (c) what will Singapore pay for the right to base personnel and aircraft in Australia, (d) will restrictions be on the operation of Singaporean military aircraft from Australian bases, (e) will Singaporean forces based in Australia operate under Australian command and control, (f) under what conditions would the agreement to host Singaporean personnel and aircraft be terminated, (g) will the agreement be made under the Five Power Defence Agreement and (h) have other members of the Five Power Defence Agreement and other allied nations been consulted; if so, what are the details. (2) Have other members of the Five Power Defence Agreement and other allied nations requested permission to base military personnel and equipment in Australia; if so, what response did they receive from the Government.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: l(a)(i) Under current agreements or arrangements, up to 258 Singaporean defence personnel (military and civilian) and their dependants may be stationed in Australia. In addition, up to 530 Singaporean defence personnel (military and civilian) and their dependants may be stationed at Amberley and Oakey in the future under proposals which are still under consideration. (ii) Under current agreements, ilp to 30 Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) training aircraft may be stationed in Australia. Under proposals which are still under consideration, a further 20 aircraft and 12 helicopters may be stationed in Australia in the future. (b) Under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the establishment of the RSAF Flying Training School (FrS), up to 253 Singaporean defence personnel (military and civilian) and up to 30 aircraft may be stationed at RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia. Under the Memorandum of Agreement concerning the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) use of the Shoal water Bay Training Area and associated storage facilities, a five-man SAF detachment is located in Brisbane to assist with the maintenance of .SAF equipment stored at Brisbane Logistics Group, Meeandah, and to provide liaison for the conduct of the annual SAF exercise at Shoalwater Bay Training Area. Under proposals which are still under consideration, up to 280 SAF personnel and their dependants and up to 20 aircraft and will be stationedat RAAF. Base Amberley near Ipswich hi.' southern Queensland, and up to 250 defence personnel and their dependants and up to 12 helicopters will be stationed at the Army A""iation Centre at Oakey near Toowoomba, also in southern Queensland. (c) With respect to the RSAF Flying Training imposed School at RAAF Base Pearce, the RSAF has met the cost of construction of all facilities associated with its establishment and is responsible for associated running costs as well as .the cost of stationing of RSAF personnel and aircraft in Western Australia. The RSAF is not required to pay rent but, in return for favourable terms of access to RAAF Base Pearce, the RSAF is required by the end of 1995, to obtain at least fifty per cent of the workforce performing operational level aircraft maintenance from Australian commercial enterprises and to contract deeper level aircraft maintenance work to Australian commercial enterprises on a commercially competitive basis. The FrS facilities atRAAF Base Pearce will revert to Australian ownership at the. completion of the agreement. With respect to SAF use of the Shoal water Bay Training Area, cost recovery in accordance with Australian Department of Defence guidelines is applied to the conduct of the annual SAF exercise, including repair of any environmental damage caused during the conduct of the training. The current storage of SAF vehicles and equipment at Meeandah is also on the same cost recovery basis. TheSAF is required to contract with an Australian commercial enterprise, on a competitive basis, for the maintenance of vehicles and equipment which are to remain in Australia. Negotiations on current proposals to station RSAF aircraft and personnel at Amberley and Oakey will be conducted on similar terms. The RSAF would be responsible for the cost of construction and maintenance of all facilities required to station these aircraft and personnel in Australia. This would include a contribution to the upgrade and maintenance of shared facilities. In return for access to Amberley and Oakey, the RSAF would be required to make a formal commitment to agreed levels of Australian industry involvement, in part specifically directed towards the repair and maintenance of aircraft and associated equipment. There will be significant flow-on benefits for Australian firms from construction of facilities as well as benefits to the local economy as a result of pennanent housing of RSAF personnel and families in the Ipswich and Toowoomba areas. (d) Singapore military aircraft operating from Australian bases are required to comply with all the Civil Aviation Authority regulations and Australian Defence Force (ADF) flying orders and instructions which regulate Australian military aircraft. RSAF . flights are subject to the standard Air Traffic Control procedures used at the bases from which the aircraft operate, and the planning of RSAF flying operations is done in conjunction with the RAAF. (e) Singaporean forces when stationed in Australia are independent units and remain under their own national command and control. They are required to operate in accordance with Australian law and, where applicable, Australian military and civil orders and regulations. All use of ADF resources is subject to Australian approval. (t) Current agreements provide for termination by either party twelve months after written notice or by mutual consent at any time. With respect to the proposals yet to be finalised, the conditions for termination are yet to be settled. It is expected similar provisions will be included in the respective agreements. Both parties recognise the long tenn nature of the commitment implicit in these agreements and accept that neither party will seek to terminate the agreements unless confronted by extreme circumstances which make it impossible to mutually determine altemative arrangements for the operation of the agreement. (g) Current and future agreements governing Singapore Anned Forces access to ADF facilities and training areas are not made pursuant to the Five Power Defence Arrangements. (h) Neither parties to the Five Power Defence Arrangements nor our alliance partners have been consulted about Singapore Anned Forces access to ADF facilities and training areas. 2. Neither Malaysia nor the United Kingdom has requested permission to station military personnel and equipment in Australia. Since 1991, under Closer Defence Relations, Australia and New Zealand have aimed to take full advantage of opportunities to enhance our respective defence capabilities through cooperative programs which use our resources more efficiently, including the stationing of the six Skyhawk aircraft of the Royal New Zealand Air Force's No 2 Training Squadron at Nowra under the 1990 'Nowra Agreement'. The stationing of New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel and equipment in Australia is consistent with our mutual alliance obligations and designed to develop cooperation between the ADF and NZDF which will contribute to our shared strategic interests and regional security. Australia's defence relationship with the United States is long standing and encompasses a diversity of activities including contributing to global security through the hosting of the Joint Defence Facilities. US combat forces are not stationed in Australia, US military equipment is not stockpiled here and there are no US bases in Australia. Noncombatant US military personnel have for many years been associated with the Joint Defence Facilities operated jointly by Australian Government agencies and the US Defense Department. L.abour Growth in Queensland (Question No. 2364) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 29 May 1995: (1) Will he provide a breakdown on an industry basis of where labour growth has occurred in Queensland according to the labour force figures announced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in April 1995. (2) What proportion of employment growth occurred in the (a) local; (b) State and (c) federal government sectors. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Industry employment statistics are available for only the mid month of each quarter. The latest available Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for employment on an industry basis relate to February 1995. As the figures are not seasonally adjusted, comparisons need to be made with the same month each year.

219,Mr RUDDOCK,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 29 May 1995: Is it a fact that certain recipients of social security benefits were advised by mail on 9 May 1995, before the Treasurer introduced the 1995-96 Budget, of new deeming provisions applicable to the income test for pensioners which were to be introduced in the Budget; if so, (a) why were they informed beforehand, (b) were the recipients aware of the new deeming provisions while secrecy provisions applied to the Budget, (c) were persons aware of other Budget provisions because his Department had supplied information before the Budget's introduction and (d) does he respect the secrecy provisions of the Budget. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department's contractor has confirmed that no items were delivered before the Treasurer's introduction of the 1995-96 Budget Advertorial (Question No. 2386)",113
220,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 31 May 1995: Did the Minister's Department pay for an advertorial in Ansett Airline's in-flight magazine; if so, (a) why, (b) who was paid for the advertorial, (c) what sum was paid for it, (d) who originated it, and (e) will the Minister provide a copy of the advertorial.",113

(e) Yes-a copy has been provided to the honourable member, further copies are available from the House of Representatives Table Office. Partner Allowance Recipients (Question No. 2403) Mr Wakelin asked the Treasurer, upon notice,on 6 June 1995: How will the Australian Bureau of Statistics categorise persons receiving Partner Allowance particularly in relation to employment.",113
222,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: When collecting labour force statistics the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) does not take into account whether or not persons are in receipt of a Department of Social Security payment. In ABS labour force statistics, a person is classified as employed or unemployed depending upon their answers to a detailed questionnaire which is designed to determine whether that person is in work, or if not in work, whether they are actively looking for and are available to start work. The eligibility criteria for the Partner Allowance suggest that recipients of the Social Security benefit are most likely to be not actively looking for work and as such would be classified, by the ABS, as 'not in the labour force'. Benefit Payments (Question No. 2407)  Security, upon notice, on 6 June 1995: (1) Does his Department require all its benefit payments to be paid directly to bank accounts; if so, (a) when did the requirement begin, (b) what sum is saved annually as a result and (c) what total sum has been saved to the date of answering this question. (2) Has he received proposals for a government transactions card for targeted recipients of social security benefits; if so, what is the estimated cost of implementing the proposals. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In 1990, after extensive consultation with the banks and various interest groups who agreed that direct crediting would be the best way to pay clients their entitlements, the Social Security Act was amended to make payment of Social Security payments by direct credit to an account in a bank, building society or credit union mandatory. The Department may now only make payments by cheque in circumstances of: remoteness or isolation of the client; age, frailty or disability; legal or ad!llinistrative problems of the individual which clearly establish that the person might be deprived of their payments; genuine religious or cultural beliefs precluding the operation of an account. Currently, approximately 99 per cent of DSS payments are made by direct credit to an account. When the move toward direct credit was initiated in 1984, the Government expected to save in a full year: $15 million in postal costs, $16.9 million in overpayments and $7.5 million in staffing costs. It was also expected that banks would benefit by an estimated $35-85 million a year, both from the fact that significant amounts of money were now being deposited directly with them and from lower transaction and processing costs-moving from cheque cashing to greater use of automatic teller machines. Due to vast changes in the numbers of SoCial Security reCipients, the greater variety of payments available and the assoCiated administrative processing changes since this time, it has not been possible to determine the actual savings annually or to date. (2) The Government approved a proposal in its 1993-94 Budget to fund a trial of electronic banking in the Department of SoCial Security. Electronic Benefits Transfer, or EBT as the project is known, is seen as another method for delivering payments to soCial security customers. It would complement payment directly to bank accounts which is the Department's principal payment delivery medium. Typically, EBT would allow selected customers to access automatic teller machines and point-ofsale devices in the electronic funds transfer networks to obtain cash or pay for goods without the need to operate an account at a finanCial institution. Customers would have this access through magnetically encoded plastic cards and personal identification numbers issued by the Department. EBT is to run over six months at six regional offices of the Department and is scheduled to start in mid-August of this year. It will be targeted in this trial solely at customers applying for emergency payments, replacing the manually' prepared cheques that would otherwise be issued; The Department will. be using this trial to evaluate the effectiveness of EBT as a payment delivery medium for customers and staff as well as the costs and benefits for the Commonwealth. Any deCision on adopting EBTnationally would depend on the outcome of the trial; $0.93 million was allocated in the 1993-94 Budget to cover the cost of this trial. Defence Signals Directorate (Question No. 2411) Mr Langinore. asked the Minister represfmting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 June 1995: (1) What was the total budget allocation to the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) in each year since 1980-81. (2) What was the (a) increase in, (b) percentage increase in, (c) real increase in, (d) proportion of total budget outlays of, and (e) proportion of GDP of, the total budget allocation to DSD in each year since 1980-81. (3) What was the increase in the (a) actual allocation to DSD and (b) real value of the allocation between 1980-81 and 1995-96,  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Direct allocations to the Defence Signals Directorate are included in Sub-Program 5.3 of the Defence portfolio. As indicated in the Portfolio Budget Statement, details .of allocations within the Intelligence function (Sub-Program 5.3) are not publicly available.",113
