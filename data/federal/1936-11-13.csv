1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"HOB. 6. J. Bell) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. CONSTITUTION ALTERATION. PnnxiOATTOsr OF DEBATES.",11
2,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"I understand that a suggestion has been made that the debates in both Houses of the Parliament on the proposed alterations of the Constitution are to be published in a separate volume of Hansard. If is not any truth in that suggestion, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will see that something of the kind is done so that people deeply interested in the subject will not require to examine many volumes of Hansard in order to ascertain what has been said on this subject by honourable members?",11
3,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"All I can say is that "" the subject is under consideration. SALES TAX LAW. Mr E. J. HARBISON"" - Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to a statement in the Taxpayers' Bulletin to the effect that the publication The Sales Tax Law was out of date as soon as it was published and that it shows up in bold relief the complexities and intricacies of the law and also the inconsistencies in its administration? Will the Treasurer take immediate steps to have these complexities and intricacies removed and the inconsistencies adjusted ?",12
4,Mr OASEY,Unknown,"I understand that some such reference as that referred to by the honourable member was made in the publication mentioned. The Sales Tax Law was issued with a supplement which brought it right up-to-date and arrangements have been made for all sales tax rulings to be made available immediately at the offices of the Deputy Commissioners *of Taxation in the capital cities of each State. They can be seen there without charge, or copies can be purchased for a few pence each. In that way taxpayers may keep themselves completely abreast of all decisions in the administration of the sales tax law. As to the complexities and intricacies of the law, I can say that while the sales tax law is not simple, any person should be able without great difficulty to master the law in its relation to his own business, for it would not in that connection be unduly complicated. Necessarily, however, the sales tax law covering the whole of the trade and commerce of Australia occupies a fair bulk of paper; but it is not necessary for any one individual to master the whole of the law in respect of every business. Taxpayers can certainly understand the law in respect to their own businesses, [06] NATIONA L INSURANCE. Mr. Curtin,-I ' ask the Treasure!' there whether it would be practicable for a precis of the various reports furnished to the Government on national insurance by Sir Walter Kinnear and his colleagues, Messrs. Bonnett and Innes, and other research workers to be prepared and made available to honourable members so that they may be able to study this important subject in its application to Australia? The period between the rising of Parliament for the Christmas recess and its re-assembly next year would give useful opportunity for such study.",12
5,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"^-I am afraid that the material in the hands of the Government at present does not represent a conspectus of the whole subject, and I do not think that it would enlighten honourable members very much to be furnished with a precis of disjointed aspects of it. Mr GuiiTiisr - But a vast amount of investigation has been made during the last few years. Mr SCUU.IN - Has the Government nothing that it could make available to us?",12
6,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"- I do not think that it would enlighten honourable members to be furnished with such information before the Government has formulated some comprehensive proposal on the subject. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Has Sir Walter Kinnear informed the Treasurer that it will be impossible for him to complete his report - on national insurance until his colleague, Mr Ince, returns to England? Is it a fact that Mr Ince does not expect to reach England until the middle of next year? If that is so, are we to understand the report will not be available until towards the end of the year ?",12
7,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I do not believe that Sir Walter Kinnear's report is necessarily connected with that of Mr Ince. The two subjects can be dealt with separately, and there is no reason why Sir Walter Kinnear's report sliould be withheld until the return of Mr Ince. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Will the Treasurer inform honourable members what is the nature of the report which he expects to receive from Sir Walter Kinnear, and wherein it differs from that which will be made by Mr Ince? In view of the fact that Mr Ince's report will not be available until the middle of next year, is it the intention of the Government to shelve the whole matter until the end of next year ?",12
8,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"Si r Walter Kinnear has been engaged to inquire into and report upon the health and old-age sections of national insurance, while Mr Ince has been devoting his attention to the unemployment side of the matter. The two subjects are quite distinct, and have little relation to each other. I did not make any statement regarding the date upon which it was expected that the report of Mr Ince would be received by the Government.",13
9,Sir PEEDERICK STEWART,Unknown,Can the Treasurer say when the Government is likely to receive the report of Mr Ince on the unemployment phase of national insurance ?,13
10,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"I cannot give the actual date, but I expect that it will be some time during the first quarter of 1937. NA COMMISSION.",13
11,Mr LYONS,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) asked me if I could say when the Government expected to receive the report of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems. I am now able to inform him that it is not likely that the report will come to hand before the end of this year, but we expect to receive it in January or February next.",13
12,Mr JOHN LAWSON,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"Is it expected that that report will be the final, or only a preliminary, report?",13

14,Mr LYONS,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"A communication has been received from the organization referred to by the honourable member and it will be considered, by the Government in conjunction with other suggestions that have been made to it on the same subject recently.",13
15,Mr HOLT,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"Has the Prime Minister received from the Young Peoples Employment Council in Adelaide a suggestion that the proposed conference to deal with the employment of youths should be enlarged to include delegates from representatives of youth organizations in every State? As such organizations, probably have a closer knowledge of the real difficulties of this problem, and their possible remedy, than has the Government, will the Prime Minister take steps to ensure that at least one delegate from each State is invited to attend the conference?",13
16,Mr LYONS,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"So far, no definite steps have been taken to arrange a conference, although the Commonwealth Government has expressed its willingness to participate if the States are willing. When something definite has been arranged, consideration will be given to the suggestion of the honourable member. PARLIAMENTARY STAFFS: APPOINTMENTS.",13
17,Mr WARD,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you will have prepared and placed upon the table of the House a statement showing the names, location, rates of pay, dates of appointment, and procedure of entry of the members of the Federal Parliamentary staffs?",13
18,Mr SPEAKER,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,I shall see how far i±> is practicable to supply the information asked for. LOAN COUNCIL.,13
19,Mr HAWKER,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"Is the Treasurer able to inform the House of the detail* of the arrangement made by the Loan Council to increase the allocation to Western Australia because of the drought conditions in that State? I wish to know whether the allocation was intended to make good a revenue deficit which will arise because of the drought conditions; whether it is intended that the money shall be used to make advances to drought- ""ir!--en settlers to enable them 5t to maintain their operations; or whether it is the intention that the State shall be permitted to budget for a deficit to enable it to make grants direct to farmers in cases of hardship on somewhat similar lines, to those followed by this Government in recent years?",13
20,Mr CASEY,MONETARY ANDBANKI NG,"The application of the Government of ""Western Australia to the Loan Council was for permission to incur a deficit of up to £1,000,000 in place the balanced budget that was contemexpire, plated. The State also applied for an crease of the amount to be made available duced? for loan works. The Council received very sympathetically the application of the State for permission to incur a deficit, and this, I am glad to say, was agreed to unanimously, the representative of the Commonwealth Government supportbut ing the ' application. The Governdate ment of ""Western Australia is therefore now at liberty, in consequence of the recess? drought conditions in that State, to incur a deficit of £1,000,000 in its revenue account and to employ funds to tent in whatever way it pleases to for drought relief.

Simiand, if so, why? lar offers have also been made by the Government of New South Wales of a site near Sydney, and by the Government of South Australia of a 6ite in the neighinformation borhood of Adelaide. The decision of this subject rests entirely with the coradditional poration itself. This subject is quite separate from the proposal to establish department. an airport at Fishermen's Bend. In that connection a conference was held last week and a sub-committee representative of the interests likely to be concerned the formation of a trust for the estabSenator lishment of an airport was set up to further consideration to that proposal.

SECOND READING.",15
43,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Kooyong-Attorney Grnneral) [10.50] - I move'Chat the bill be now read a second time. This is a very short bill, designed to effect an alteration of the Constitution by inserting in section 51, after paragraph 5, the following words:Air navigation and aircraft. The purpose of the amendment is to add to the legislative powers of the Commonwealth a power to make laws in respect of air navigation and aircraft, quite unrestricted to'interstate. aviation; in other words, to give to the Commonwealth Parliament a general power over aviation. The immediate occasion for the introduction of this amendment is a declaration by the High Court of the existing limitations upon the powers of the Commonweal tli Parliament. In effect, by the decision of the High Court in the Henry case, given two or three days ago, the Court has declared that the legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament in respect of aviation is confined to three areas: (1) The Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate for the carrying out of an international air convention, but in that event its legislation must scrupulously follow the terms of the convention; (&) it has power to legislate under its interstate trade and commerce powers in regard to aviation in so far as such aviation possesses an interstate character; and (3) it has power in dealing with its territories to pass laws in respect of those territories in relation to aviation. It follows, therefore, that there remains an area of power which does not belong to the Commonwealth Parliament, that area having to do with intra-State aviation in so far as it is not the subject BILL 1936. of an international air convention. The purpose of this bill is to get rid of that serious and anomalous state of affairs by making the power of the Commonwealth Parliament, in relation to aviation, both specific and unrestricted. The history of this matter can he mentioned very briefly. I a 1920, th» Commonwealth asked the State governments to take steps to arm it - with power to deal with aviation, and a resolution was carried at the Premiers Conference of that year to the effect that it was desirable that the States Bhould refer to the Commonwealth power to make laws with respect to air navigation, retaining for each State the right to own and use State aircraft operated within the State for Government purposes, and "" the police powers of the State""-whateve r that phrase may mean. Pursuant to that decision, certain States passed legislation. Queensland and Tasmania passed acts which were in accordance with the resolution. The Queensland act was not to come into force until proclaimed, whereas the Tasmanian act operated upon the date of its passing. The Parliaments of Victoria, and South Australia passed legislation in a different form, legislation which, in fact, was never proclaimed, but it is interesting to note that it provided for the handing over to the Commonwealth of power to make laws with respect tc aviation, first, within the terms of air conventions, and secondly, within the scope of interstate trade and commerce. In other words, those acts intended to hand over to the Commonwealth the very powers it is now seen to possess, and no more. Mr Scui/LiN - They gave us nothing. Mr MENZIES,-As matters have turned out, they gave u? nothing. At that time, as the right honourable gentleman knows, it was not appreciated that the legislative powers of the Commonwealth would go to the distance of carrying out the International A i r Convention in all its implications. In fact, as we now know, as the result of the High Court decision, the legislation passed in those two"" States would not have affected or added to the powers o* the Commonwealth. In the case of J /ew South Wales and Western Australia, bills were introduced iuto the Parliament, but were not proceeded with. That was the position in and immediately after 1920. On the anticipation that these referring acts of Parliament would be passed by the various States, the Commonwealth Parliament passed an A i r Navigation Act. That act provided that the Governor General might make regulations for the purpose of carrying put; and giving effect to the convention-that power has now been'upheld - and the provisions of any amendment of the convention, and for the purpose of providing for the control of air navigation in the Commonwealth and the territories of the Commonwealth. That act has, by the decision of the High Court, been in part invalidated*, because the effect of the decision of the High Court is, that while regulations may be made for the purpose of giving effect to the convention and for the purpose of controlling air navigation as between the States in the Commonwealth, they may not be made for the purpose of controlling it generally with in the territorial boundaries of the Commonwealth. Consequently, if what was sought to be done by that act is to be made validly competent to the Commonwealth Parliament, a constitutional alteration of the kind that I have indicated is necessary.",16
44,Mr MARTENS,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Accordin g to yesterday's Sydney Sun, the Premier of New South Wales is prepared to hand over to the Commonwealth the power that it seeks.",17
45,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"It is true, as the honourable gentleman knows, that there are two ways by which the Commonwealth might obtain increased jurisdiction over tiiig matter. It might do so by virtue of the process of a constitutional alteration, which process the Government is adopting by this bill. It might also obtain the additional power under section 51, paragraph 37, of the Constitution as a matter referred to the Commonwealth Parliament by the parliament or parliaments of any State or States. But if the latter course is followed and we are to have a universal power within the. limits of Australia, then it will be necessary for every parliament to puss such a l a w; and as the honourable gentleman will , I think, agree, having regard to the fact that discussions in regard to references of powers commenced as far back as 1920, and that tliere has yet been no effective reference of power, that method might prove rather tedious and unsatisfactory. Consequently, the Government has decided that it will give to the people the opportunity to say that the Commonwealth ought to have this power; and of course we confidently believe that the State Governments will be willing to co-operate with us in the carrying of such a vote, because on each occasion when the matter has been discussed, they have agreed that aviation ought to come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Royal Commission on the Constitution also investigated this matter subsequently to the decision by the Premiers Conference to which I have referred. At page 206 of its reportwhich, as honourable members know, was made in 192S-29-unde r the heading '*' Control of Aviation "", the commission saidAll the expert witnesses on this subject who appeared before the commission were agreed that the Commonwealth should have control of aviation, and their views may be summed up in the following extract from the evidence of Captain G. F. Hughes, president of the Aero Club of New South Wales, which W M expressly approved by other witnesses: The very nature of aircraft and their uses, and the nature of the regulation* required, make utterly Impracticable, in my opinion, a control by the Commonwealth, the effectiveness of which would only arise contingently on a particular class of journey being undertaken. He was referring to a journey interstateWhere could one draw the line and decide where Commonwealth regulations began to operate? Such en arrangement would, in my view, be hazardous in the extreme, and a menace to «ll elastes of aerial navigation . . . Then is ak*wlutely no other industry or means of motion in which control necessitates supervision of the product from the drawing board through all the processes of manufacture to the finished article, and then throughout the life of the machine. There is no means of travel which is so unrestricted by physical boundaries. Subsequently, at page 248, in making their recommendations, the members of the commission-Si r Hal Colebatch disencesenting-sai d thisWe recommend that a power to make lawB with respect to aviation be conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament. All the expert witnesses on this subject who appeared before the commission were agreed that the Commonwealth should have this power, aiid, as is shown elsewhere in this report, the State Premiers at one time passed a resolution that it was desirable that the power to make laws with respect to aviation, with certain reservations, should be transferred by the States to the Commonwealth. ftffeet could, we think, be given to this recommendation hy inserting in section 51 of the Constitution the following paragraph:(vi&) A i r navigation and aircraft.  give reasons for his not agreeing?",17
46,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"The views of Sir Hal Colebatch are set out at page 29S. They are very shortly stated, and, as it seems that they are of interest to the honourable gentleman, I shall read them. He said1 a.m of opinion that suflicicnt uniformity in regard to air navigation can be obtained by arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States, more readily than it has obtained between contiguous countries on continent of Europe. At the most it may be desirab'e for the State parliaments transfer an aviation power, with certain vations, to the Commonwealth. Brinsmead, officer in charge of civil aviation. Defence Department, told the. commission (.page 278) that a transference of power with such reservations "" would meet with governquently ment requirements absolutely "". l'n the near future transport by air will power. play an important part in the ordinary life of the community. Such features of air navigation as intra-state trade and commerce, industrial conditions, and the ordinary police power are better left, to the States. The adoption of the recommendation of my colleagues would bring all these under central control, whilst similar matters in TOgard to other forms of intra-etate trannportation would remain with the States. Those were the. views of Sir Hal Colethat batch ; but they were not shared by remaining members of the commission. loco- who consequently reported in the direction that I have indicated. I have said that the Premiers had agreed in 1920 that they should hand over this power to the Commonwealth. The matter was again considered by the Premiers Conference in 1929. This is an extract from the report of that conferI t was the general opinion that legislative provision with reference to aviation was deft'i'tivu. and that the position required immediate attention, it was agreed that the Commonwealth Parliament should d r a f t a bill to he submitted to tingovernments of the States, .transferring .to the Commonwealth Parlifl.mcnt full power to legislate with respect to aviation aud matters incidental to aviation. The State governments undertook to consider whether they would submit the bill to their parliaments at an early date. Then again, in 1934, th<>re was some indeterminate discussion of the matter at the Premiers Conference: and at tha Premiers Conference in Adelaide in 1936 it was again agreed by the States that legislation should be passed referring this power to the Common weal tit Parliament. So that the position is this: We have been told authoritatively that there are certain sharp limits upon the legislative power of the Commonwealth. We have readied on more titan one occasion substantial agreement with State governments, that this power should belong to, been and be exercised by, the Commonwealth the Parliament. The royal commission which to investigated the matter came to a similar reserconclusion, and so recommended. In all Colonel those circumstances, the Government does not, hesitate to put forward legislation and to invite the Parliament, and subsethe people,, to approve of thil very necessary addition to the national . , The one otlicr mutter that I want to mention is this: It may he said that we already have so much jurisdiction under the International Air Conventionwhicli is an elaborate doenment-that what is left is of no practical moment. Let. me just give to honourable members one illustration to show what is left is of great practical the moment. Article 11 of the Conventioa provides that every aircraft engaged is international navigation shall, in accordance with certain conditions, be provided with a certificate of airworthiness issued or rendered valid by the State whose nationality it possesses. That is the one provision that I can find in the Convention in regard to airworthiness, and it is confined to aircraft engaged in international navigation. To it may be added that the Commonwealth would have power to make laws and regulations with respect to airworthiness in the case of aircraft engaged in interstate trade and commerce, but not in relation to aircraft engaged in purely local operations; that is, operations within the boundaries of any one State.",18
47,Mr BLACKBURN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,Excep t in Commonwealth territory.,19
48,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Unless , as I have said before, it is within. Commonwealth territories. That, honourable members will agree, is a rather serious gap in power; because, admittedly, the greatest care should be taken with respect to the airworthiness of aircraft, and I am sure that honourable members and the people of Australia will agree that any rules which apply in relation to the matter should apply uniforml y and over every portion of Australia, since the safety of human beings is just as important in one part as in another part of Australia. That, briefly, is the case for this .alteration of the Constitution, and submit it to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr BRENNAN ) adjourned. REFERENDUM (CONSTITUTION ALTERATION ) BILL 1936. SECOND READING.",19
49,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Kooyong-Attorney - General) [11.13] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is the bill which deals with the machinery for the taking of a referendum on an alteration of the Constitution. There is on the statute-book at present, and has been for a number of years, an act entitled the Referendum Constitution (Alteration) Act 1906, which was particular amended subsequent to the date of its enactment. That act provides by section 6A in these terms- I can do no better than read themIf, within nine weeks after the passage of the proposed law That is, the proposed law for the alteration of the Constitutionthrough both Houses there is forwarded to the Chief Electoral Officerfa) an argument in favour of the proposed law consisting of not more than 2,000 words and authorized by a majority of those members of both Houses of the Parliament who voted for the proposed law; or (It) an argument against the proposed law consisting of not more than 2,000 words and authorized by a majority of those members of both Houses of the Parliament who voted against the proposed law the Chief Electoral Officer shall, within twe months after the expiry of those nine weeks and not later than two weeks after the issue of the writ, cause to be printed and posted to each elector as nearly as practicable, a pamphlet containing the arguments, together with a statement snowing the textual alterations and additions proposed to be made te the Constitution. The policy embodied in this act of providing the elector with some statements, first, of the nature of the amendment, and, secondly, arguments both for and against it , is, I am sure, a sound one. It is, in the highest degree desirable that all of those who vote on a proposed alteration of the Constitution should be in possession of the exact terms of the proposal and of a reasoned argument both for and against I its adoption. Otherwise we shall have a vote cast very largely in ignorance if voters fail to perceive the true nature of the issue. Pamphlets were used in connection with the referendum of 1913 and were printed, but not circulated, in connection with the referendum of 1915, which was not proceeded with, but they have not been used in connection with - any other referenda. Having regard to the fact, particularly in relation to marketing, that the precise nature of matters of that kind is not to be perceived at a glance, it is proposed by the - Government on this occasion, that it is desirable to continue the practice followed before the war of circulating pamphlets. The object of this bill , apart from two trifling verbal alterations to correct the sections of the act involved, is to shorten to three weeks the period of nine weeks, which it is now provided must elapse between the passage of the proposed law and the date of the holding of the referendum.",19
50,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that only a third of the time is necessary?,20
51,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"I feel, not presumptuously, that I could compose an argument in favour of the bill inside three weeks, and I have no doubt that the honourable gentleman, if he were entrusted with the delicate task of preparing the case fov the other side, would be able to do it in the same period. Of course, if we were making a very elaborate series of fundamental alterations of the Constitution it might be well to retain the longer period, but I feel sure that honourable gentlemen will agree that there is no cause for delay in this instance and that a period of three weeks is sufficient. I have inquired as to the cost of printing and circulating these pamphlets, not that I attach undue importance to that aspect, because, if it is worthwhile asking the people to alter the Constitution, it is worthwhile spending a few pounds to let them know what the proposals are. If this cost were twice the amount it would be money well spent. I find, on inquiry, that the estimated cost Division Income for the whole of the Commonwealth, on the basis of submitting one question, would be a little under £10,000.",20

53,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"There will be no actual postage costs, but the various items covered by the £10,000 include the printing of the wrappers and pamphlets, and the folding and wrapping of the pamphlets. To that sum must, of course, be added the cost of handling this material through the ordinary post offiee channels. As there are 4,000,000 pamphlets to he distributed in Australia, honourable members will see that this eost is not excessive. As a matter of fact it works out at slightly over a halfpenny a pamphlet. I think I - im right in saying that the cost on the last occasion was in the region of £20,000, but, as honourable gentlemen will recall, many tnore questions were submitted on that occasion, with the result that the pamphlets were bulkier. The estimated cost of £10,000 will be increased by something like £2,000 as the result of the addition of a second question with the corresponding arguments for it, and, if any, against it.

That the foregoing provisions of this resolution shall also apply to all assessments for financial years subsequent to that beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-Bix, made prior to the passing of the act for the levying and payment of income tax for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and thirtyseven. This is the usual m o t i o n for the i m p o s it i o n of the rates of income tax payable for the c u r r e n t financial year. As I announced in the budget speech, the Government has decided to reduce the rates of n o r m a l income tax payable by in d i v i d u a l s by 10 per cent., in respect of income from personal e x e r t i on and income from p r o p e r t y , and also to abolish the special tax o n income from p r o p e r t y . B o t h of these proposals are given effect to in m y m o t i o n . The following statement shows a p p r o x i m at e ly the v a r i at i o n in the norm a l rates of tax provided in the resolut i o n as compared with the 1915-16 basic r at e : Taxable Income.

The original rate was 7 | per cent., which was increased to 10 per cent, in 1931-32, and the latter rate was maintained in 1932-33. In 1933-34, the rate was reduced to 6 per cent., and last year a further reduction to 5 per cent, was made. The Government regards this tax as being a particularly onerous form of taxation, and is glad it is in a position to have abolished. It has long been thought, find indeed urged, by many sections of the community, that the abolition of this tax would restore economic health by tending to reduce interest rates „and free large sums of money for real estate investment and building activities. Tho freer circulation of moneys thus promoted should work considerable benefit for the whole community-for the wage earner as much as the enterpreneur. Division A of the motion prescribes personal the rate of tax on income from personal exertion. in 1931-32 the formula for ascertaining the rate of tax on each £1 of taxable income was revised by Prothe fessor Giblin when be was Commonderived wealth Statistician. This revision was an adaptation of the rates applied in the previous year, subject to an allpayer round increase of approximately 5 per cent. In 1933-34 the rate of tax on perthe sonal exertion income was reduced by l o income. per cent, and the rate was ascertained by taking 85 per cent, of the rate provided by the 1931-32 formula. This year the reduction of 10 per cent, means that the rate will be 76.5 per cent, of the rate originally prescribed. The rate of tax increases with each £1 of taxable inTaxation, come uutil the taxable income reaches £6,900: thereafter a flat rate of 68.85(1. is imposed. Originally this flat rate was 90d., but the reduction of 15 per cent, in 1933-34 reduced it to 76.5d., and the present reduction of 10 per ceiit. it still further to 6S.85d. DivirHon P> deals with income from property. As no reduction of property rates has been made siuce the present formula was introduced i h 1931-32, rate for this year is ascertained by taking 90 por cont. of the rate as originally prescribed.",20
55,Mr CURTIN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,At the same time the tax on property as property has been reduced in this resolution?;,22
56,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"I L am speaking of the normal tax on property. The rate of that tax increases, with each £1 of taxable income until a taxable income of £3,700 is reached; thereafter a flat rate of Sid. is charged. The flat rate was originally 90d., as in the ease of personal exertion income, and the 10 per cent, it reduction explains, the difference. Hon!orahle members will see from this that the curve of taxation of income from property increase,.? very much more steeply than that of taxation on income from personal exertion, and that the actual rate of tax on any given amount of income from property is substantially higher than the rate of tax on a similar given amount of income from personal exertion. division C applies to the taxpayer whose total income is derived partly from exertion and partly from property. It provides for the separate rates of tax on the personal exertion and property incomes to be ascertained as if taxpayer's total taxable income were wholly from either personal exertion sources or property sources. Subject to the averaging provisions, the taxpays tax on his taxable incomes from personal exertion snd property at rate attributable to his total taxable Division D, relating to averaging, is a new division i u the rates act. Previously the substance of this division was embodied in section 13 (2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922-34 but, at the suggestion of the Royal Commission on the provisions of the relevant section in the 192.2-34 act were not repeated in the Income Tax Assessment Bill , which was passed during the last session of the Parliament, the intention being to incorporate them in this year's reduces Income Tax Bill .",22
57,Mr CURTIN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,Is not that more of a condition than a rate; and is the Treasurer quite satisfied about the constitutional authority to enable this provision the to he put into the rates bill?,22
58,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Yes , it has been examined closely first by the royal commission and then by the conference of Commissioners of Taxation and by the legal advisers of the Commonwealth Government. At the present time the taxpayer's income is averaged over a five-year period, and the rate of tax which is applied to his taxable income is the rate applicable to his average income over that period. example, if a taxpayer's actual income for the year ended the 30th June, 1936, were £500, and his taxable income for the five years, 1932 to 1936, were £400, he would pay tax on £500, at the rate attributable to £400. Similarly, if his average income were £600, he would pay tax on £500 at the rate attributable to £600. The division is an adaptation of draft provided by the royal commission, and, it is considered, expresses the objective in a simpler form than that which is used in the assessment act. As honourable members know, the Government has in mind proposals for the dropping of this averaging provision at a future date for other than the incomes of primary producers. But as that does not. take effect until approximately three years hence, it does not concern us at this moment. Division E is also a new division is due to the adoption in substance of a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Taxation in connection with the taxation of premiums received in respect of private leases. The principle underlying the taxation of lease premiums is that a premium is nothing more than a commuted rent. However, when several years' rent is commuted into one single premium, the recipient must pay tax on that premium as income of the year in which he receives it. As the rate of tax increases with the increase of income, it follows that in such a case the recipient, pays a greater amount of tax on that premium than he would have paid if the amount of the premium had been received as rent over the term, of the lease. This is considered to be a hardship, and as a measure of relief the royal commission recommended that the premium should be taxed at a rate ascertained by dividing the amount of the premium by the number of years of the lease with a maximum divisor of five years. That another method really of applying the averaging provision for that period. Mr Casey. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Why has the Government decided to cut out the averaging provision when quite obviously during the depression period the taxpayer was at a disadvantage? Now we are coming into a boom period the taxpayer will lose the benefit of the lower Eor rate.",22
59,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"That consideration recommended itself to the Government, which has decided not to cut out the averaging for a period of three years hence. The 'royal commission recommended that it should be abolished generally, but to be fail to taxpayers who are 1 now deriving some little advantage from the the averaging, whereas they were at a disadvantage during' the depression, it has been postponed for three years. At the conference of Taxation Commissioners, the royal commission's recommendation in regard to leases was adopted in a slightly modified form. The final decision with which the royal commission was in agreement is embodied in section 86 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which has been passed by this Parliament. The effect of this secwhich tion is that the recipient of the premium pays tax on the premium as he receives it, but at a rate of tax on a notional income ascertained by dividing the amount of the premium by one-half of the number of years of the term of the lease. To this notional income is added, of course, any other taxable income derived by the taxpayer for the purpose of obtaining the appropriate rate applicable to the total taxable income. This division is in accordance with the draft which was prepared by the royal commission to give legislative effect to its proposal, and is modelled on the same principle as that adopted in division D. This division will not apply in the assessments of any taxpayers to whom the existing averaging provisions apply, but it is necessary to provide for the isolated case of a taxpayer whose income is not at present averaged. This division, in respect of the spreading of income tax received as rent over a term of five years, will not, of course, apply to the assessis ments of any taxpayers to whom the ordinary averaging applies. Taxpayers cannot have the advantage both ways. from the commuted rent proposal'as well as from the ordinary averaging proposal. Division F provides that the minimum tax payable snail be 10s., and needs no explanation. Divisions G and H deal with the rates of tax to be paid by a trustee and a company respectively, and do not call for any explanation. They are the normal things which have appeared before and there is no reduction of the rate of company tax. Paragraph 3 is framed with rhe object of enabling assessments to be paid for financial years subsequent to the financial year 1936-37, in those cases where it is necessary to raise such assessments before the rates bill for the subsequent year is passed by Parliament. The taxpayers generally affected are theatrical artists and others who are visiting Australia, and who are required to pay tax on their earnings before their departure, and also tourists who are desirous of paying the tax before leaving Australia. Mr E, J. HARRISON - Can the Treasurer introduce a regulation to ensure that taxpayers will not receive Federal and State assessments at the same time?",23
60,Mr CURTIN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,In certain States in which Federal and State taxes are collected by the one department such an occurrence is inevitable.,24
61,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"The Commonwealth allows two months after the issue of the assessments for the payment of the tax. In the case of some States the period allowed is one month. The provisions of the Income Tax Act 1935 relating to individually and severally-owned partnerships have not been included in the resolution. This is made possible by the fact that sections 94 and 102 of the assessment act, which deal with family partnerships and trusts, specify therein how the income tax payable by the partnership or the trustee is to be calculated in those cases which come within the operation of those sections, and, consequently, a declaration of a rate of tax for such cases is unnecessary. As the special property tax is being abolished, the provisions relating thereto in last year's act have not been included in the resolution. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Casey and Mr Hunter do prepare and bring in a bill ' to carry out the foregoing resolution.

62,Mr CURTIN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [11.42] This bill relates to a distribution of portion of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth last year among the States for the purpose of helping their budgets. The money has been distributed upon a population basis, and, curiously enough, this procedure complies with one of the original practices of the federation, in that the surplus revenues of the Commonwealth were to be distributed to the States on a basis somewhat approximating that which has been used in the allocation on this occasion. The Opposition has no objection to the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. DEFENCE EQUIPMENT BILL 1936. SECOND READING.",24
63,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Corio-Treasurer ) [11.45] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. Copies of this bill were circulated some time ago. The object of the measure is to appropriate an amount, of £2,000,000 from the excess revenue receipts of the last financial year for defence expenditure of a capital nature. An amount of £1,800,000 is to be paid into the Defence Equipment Trust Account established by the Defence Equipment Act 1934, and aa amount of £800,000 is to be paid into ike Civil Aviation Trust Account established by the Defence Equipment Act 1928. Honourable members may recollect that £4,160,000 was paid fro m the excess revenue receipts into the Defence Equipment Trust Account in 1934-35, and this amount was drawn upon in the three subsequent years, including the current financial year in order to relieve the burden of defence expenditure on each year. The amount of £4,160,000 will, 'it is anticipated, be completely expended by the end of the current financial year. I gave an explanation of the operation of the Defence Equipment Trust Account in my budget speech. The purpose of the money now proposed to be paid into the account is to provide for naval constructions, coastal and anti-aircraft defence, modernization of the field army, aircraft, machinery and plant, and defence work, buildings and sites. The amount is to \w expended this year and in future financial years. Mr .CUKTIN - How much of it will be left over for expenditure in future years?",24
64,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"The balance that'is left in the fund at. the end of this financial year. At the 1st July of this financial year an amount of £.1,931,000 stood to the credit of the Defence Equipment Trviei Account. This will be increased by the amount now to be paid into the fund, and the expenditure of this year and of subsequent years will be debited against these amounts. Mr Ci'itTtN -- I understood that the amount of £S,000.000 required for defence expenditure in this year could not have, been made available except for the £2,000,000 now proposed to be paid into the fund? . Mr CAREY - That is not so, and I am sorry if I gave that impression. At the end of this financial year it is estimated that approximately £2.000,000 will he left in the fund.",25
65,Mr CURTIN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,Then it does not appear necessary to provide this money for this year's expenditure?,25
66,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"The amount will be available in the fund if it should be required, but i u any case it will be therts for expenditure in com'ine; years, just the amount of £4,160.000 placed in the fund several ves* !) ago was available 1 expenditure in subsequent .years an required. Mr E. P. HAUKISON - This money will be spent this financial year if it is required.",25
67,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"It will be available for expenditure, it would not be proper fur me at this stage to embark upon a discussion of the defence policy of the Government, for that has already been full y outlined by the Minister for Defence (Sir Archdale P a r k h ill ) . This is purely a machinery measure to set aside £2,000,000 of fortuitous excess receipts in the last financial year, £1,800,000 of which will be credited to the Defence Equipment Trust Account, and the remaining £200,000 to the Civil Aviation T i ust Account.",25
68,Mr CURTIN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [11.52] .But for the fact that this is essentially a machinery measure which arises out of the budget proposals of the Government and merely involves the transfer of surplus funds of the Treasury to trust accounts to provide for expenditure which, in principle at any rate, has already been authorized, I should have asked for the adjournment of the debate. As it is, I direct attention to only one point. Before agreeing to the payment of surplus revenues into trust accounts honourable members should have a clear understanding, not only of the general purport of the trust account, but also as to whether it is actually necessary to use the money in the way intended. If a balance is left in a trust f u n d at the end of the financial year larger than seems to be necessary for the purpose intended, it means in effect that that, amount is not available for immediate public expenditure. ""While I agree that in existing conditions it is necessary to pay surplus revenue into trust accounts in order that money may be available for expenditure in future years on works approved by the Parliament, I must confess to some doubt as to whether larger sums are not being he^ in certain trust accounts than are actually necessary for the purpose. It would be unjustifiable to withdraw money from immediate expenditure to too large on extent. .",25
69,Mr CASEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"I propose to take an early as opportunity to make a statement either in Parliament or through the press as to for the exact position of the trust funds of the Commonwealth. This, 1 think, will allay any doubt that the Leader of the Opposition may have in that regard. Mr CUIiTIN - In view of the general difficulties of the position, it appears to be unavoidable to set aside surpluses of Commonwealth revenue in trust funds for expenditure in future years unless we are content to allow a considerable proportion of Commonwealth revenue to be dissipated in a manner which would deprive the Parliament of any real authority over its expenditure. The only alternative to that course seems to me to be the setting up of trust funds, a practice which has been followed for many years. I agree that when the Parliament envisages expenditure on a public work extending over a number of years, it is wise to establish trust funds to ensure the competence of the Parliament to maintain the necessary rate of expenditure on such work, and to render less likely an undup interference with its progress in consequence of a decrease of revenue because of seasonal adversity or some otlier unforeseen development. At the same lime honourable members should satisfy themselves that trust funds are not unduly inflated, for that course must inevitably deprive Parliament of the opportunity to spend money in other very necessary directions. In the circumstances I rest content with the Treasurer's assurance that he will make a full statement upon this subject, for I have discussed it with him on other occasions. This bill, like the Invalid and Old-age Appropriation Bills which come before us periodically, is necessary to enable Government policy to be pursued without undue interruption. In this case, as the policy has been approved by Parliament, I shall offer no objection to the measure. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. LANDS ACQUISITION BILL 1936. SECOND BEADING.",25
70,Mr MENZIES,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.58] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. If honourable members have ' before them the memorandum showing the amendments proposed to be made by this bill, they will be able to follow my remarks more closely. The purpose of the measure is to amend the Lands Acquisition Act 1906-34, but it does not seek to alter, in 'substance, the principles upon which compensation for land taken for public purposes shall be assessed. It may be assumed that any person whose land is compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth for Commonwealth purposes will still be entitled to the same measure of compensation as he would have received under the existing law. The object of this measure is to alter certain machinery or procedural steps that have to be taken. These alterations are proposed to be made in two main groups. The law as it stands provides thatA claim for compensation shall lie in writing, and shall be served ou the Minister, and shall set forth the prescribed particulars, and shall be in accordance with such of the prescribed forms as is applicable to the case. The proposed amendment readsA claim for compensation shall(a) be in accordance with auch of the prescribed forms as is applicable to the case; (6) sot forth the total amount of compensation claimed and the amount (if nny) attributable to each item ; in that prescribed form; and (c) be served on the Minister. The purpose of the amendment, and the others which a.re contingent upon it, is to provide that where a man claims compensation, he shall not merely claim a lump sum, but shall itemize his claim by indicating how much he is asking, for instance, for the unimproved land value of the property. It is desirable that that should be done because the decision then given will have some usefulness in the future, whereas, in the absence of such an itemized claim, every case must stand, as it were, on its own feet, and can throw no light on others. There is, of course, a drag-net provision to enable the claimant to make a general claim so that he shall not be denied anything to which he is rightly entitled. The second amendment provided for in the bill is intended to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings - in relation to the same acquisition. All property that is sought to be taken for public purposes is not necessarily in one ownership, or held in one right. In the case of land, the fee simple may be held by A, the head lease by B, and a sub-lease by C, while D may have a right of easement over it. Each one of these might have some claim for compensation for the compulsory taking of the property. As the law now stands, the owner in fee simple may proceed before the High Court, his head lessee may proceed in the State Court, while the person claiming easement may proceed under another jurisdiction, with the result that there would be parallel proceedings going on involving enormously increased expenditure, while no particular authority would attach to any judgment given. The bill provides that when action is taken in the High Court for the determination of compensation, any action taken in other courts in respect of the same parcel of land shall be stayed, and the whole matter taken into the High Court. ""Wc want, to provide that where various claims come from various sources in relation to one piece of property, they shall all be heard in one court, the court giving notice to the parties so that they may be brought together for the one hearing. We hope thus to simplify procedure, save time, and make for greater certainty. It has been felt for some time that amending legislation of this kind was necessary. These very amendments were included in a bill brought down in 1924, but it was not proceeded with to the point of enactment. However, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is from time to time making resumptions of properties, it is felt that action should now be taken to simplify the procedure. Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned. .NATIONALITY BILL 1934*. toSECOND READING . Debate resumed from the 15th March, 1935, (vide page 137, vol. 146).

We should, long before this, have taken action to give our own women at least tliose rights' and privileges within Australia to which we. believe they are entitled. The bill does not do that. Indeed, it hardly makes any difference at all in regard to the nationality of married women. I under^ stand that the honourable member for Lilley (Sir Donald Cameron) has foreshadowed an amendment designed to widen the scope of the measure, and i i that amendment be accepted, it will go far to make of this bill what it ought to be. We have been mistaken in delaying action in the hope that a general international agreement on this question would be reached. The longer I . live, the more convinced I become that it is useless to hope for complete international agreement on any major question, whether it be peace, disarmament, or anything else. Each nation should effect what reforms it believes necessary in its own laws in the hope that, eventually, international unity will be achieved, in so far as it is necessary. As I have said, I cannot see that this bill represents any improvement upon the existing situation.  that the bill does away with absolute statelessness.",27

73,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Barker) [12.17] - I again raise the question which I raised when the bill was previously considered, a long time ago, as to what nationality will be assumed by the children of a marriage in the event of sub-section 3 of the proposed new section 18 being put into operation. That sub-section provides that, if a man acquires a foreign nationality, his wife need not, unless she so desires, by reason only of that fact also acquire a foreign nationality. I should like .the Minister to state whether children will retain the nationality of the father or of the mother, or will became stateless.

74,Mr NAIRN,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Perth) [12.21] - On behalf of the honourable member for Lilley (Sir Donald Cameron), who is unavoidably absent, I movfcTliat the following new clause he inserted:""'5. After section eighteen of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:' 1 8 A - (1.) This section shall apply to every woman who at the time of her marriage to an alien, whether before or after the commencement of this section, PATERSON) was a British subject and who, by reason of her marriage, has acquired the nationality of her husband. (2.) Any woman to whom this section applies, whether, her marriage is still continuing or not, may(a) in the case of a woman married 1 to an alien before the commencement of this section, at any timewithin twelve months after thecommencement of this section, (6) in the case of a woman married; to an alien after the commencement of this section, within, twelve inonths after the date ot her marriage, or (c) in either qase, at such later timeas the Minister in special circumstances allows, make a declaration in the prescribed: form and manner that she desires to retain while in Australia or any Territory the rights of a British subject, and thereupon she shall, within Australia or any Territory, be entitled to all political and! other rights, powers, and privileges, and lie subject to all obligations, duties and liabilities, to which a natural-born Britisli subject. is entitled or subject.'"". The object of the proposed new clause is to remove disadvantages that are suffered by many of our womenfolk by reason of having married persons deemed to be aliens; and having thereby acquired the nationality of their husbands. Those disadvantages have been already specified in this Parliament, and I believe that the general desire is that they should be removed as far as is consistent with international conventions in relation to the status of marriage. The subject has been, considered on different occasions at The Hague, and the bill that we now have before us represents agreement, so far as it could be obtained, among the under Part II . of the different nations. Thus far it has been British Act, is exercisable found impossible to reach an agreement by the Secretary of State, that would give full relief to women who shall be vested in and exerare married to aliens. If the proposed cisable by the Minister.' new clause is embodied in the measure, those of our womenfolk married to aliens who are living in Australia will obtain the relief that we think should be extended to women in all countries. They will have the option, shortly, of making a declarareceive tion expressing the desire to retain rights which they would enjoy as British subjects, or they, may acquire the nationality of their husbands. operation of the provision will be limited to Australia and the territories under the control of the Commonwealth. As no international complicationswhich have previously been feared when such a proposal has been advanced-wil l be caused, it is hoped that the Government will accept the proposal of honourable member for Lilley.  for the Interior) [12.25],-On behalf the Government I have very much General pleasxire in accepting the proposed new clause which has been submitted to the committee by the honourable member for agreed to. Perth (Mr Nairn) in the absence of the honourable member for Lilley (Sir Donald Cameron). I may say that the Parlia- - h y leave-adopted . ment of New Zealand has already adopted a similar provision. dominion law adopts the provisions of section 10 of the Erjglish act, upon which our proposed new section 18 is founded; but our section, in addition to providing, as a general rule that the nationality of a married woman shall be that of her husband, contains exceptions in .the interests of British women. For example, women who do not acquire, by marriage, the nationality of their husbands, and become stateless, remain British subjects. Similarly, i husband should lose his British nationAct ality, the wife, unless she acquires the foreign nationality of her husband, may remain a British subject. New Zealand provision which the honourable member for Lilley has adopted, relates to another class of case, that British woman who becomes an alien virtue of her marriage. The object of the proposed new clause is to enable such a woman still to enjoy, within Australia, all the privileges of British citizenship. .Strictly speaking, in law she would still be regarded as an alien outside of tralia ; but so long as she remained in country she would enjoy every right ancl privilege enjoyed by a British subject; for example, the exercise of the franchise, and the old-age pension when she reached the age that would entitle her to it. In short, by the adoption of the the proposal, we shall go a long way towards meeting, in Australia at all events, the wish of our womenfolk to be The treated on an equality basis.",28

76,Mr HUNTER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"Maranoa-Assistant several Minister) [12.31] - I moveTliat the bill be now read a second time. The object of this bill is to amend sections 11, 29, 42, 47, 4S, 62, 71, 74 and f a 84 of the Commonwealth Public Service 1922-1934. I think that honourable members will find that the proposed amendments are of a non-controversial The nature. Clause 2 of the bill, which amends subsection 1 of section 11 of the principal of a act, merely confers the title of "" The by Public Service Board"" on the Board of Commissioners. Sub-section 1 of section 11 of the act-provides that the Governor General may appoint a Board of Commissioners, and whilst the term - "" The Public Service Board "" is generally used Ausin reference to the Board of Commisthis sioners, it does not appear in the act. It has, therefore, been deemed advisable, for convenience and general usage with statutory authority, to make provision had in the act for its recognition. Clause 3 relates to sub-section 1 section 29 of the act, which reads follows: The Governor General may, on the recomfollowed mendation of the Boai-d, after obtaining report from the permanent, head («) create a new office in any division in any department; (6) abolish any ofiice in any or (c) raise or lower the classification of any office. This is regarded as ambiguous, or, least, as not expressing the intention the sub-section. It may be read to mean that, the Governor General is to obtain report from the permanent head, but intention is that the board shall obtain the report and then make a recommendation to the Governor General. posed amendment will make this procedure clear. As regards clause 4, I. point out to orable members that section 42 of the principal act provides that if the Public Service Board is satisfied that it is able in the interests of the CommonCapital Territory.' wealth that the appointment be made, the board may appoint, without nation or probation, any officer of the territorial service, or the Commonthe wealth railway service, to any office '.n conditions. the Commonwealth Service. Under clause 4 of the bill, it is proposed that eligibility for appointment under section 4.2 shall be extended to members of Federal Capital Territory Police I remind honourable members that the clause, if agreed to, will merely confer eligibility on members of the Federal Capital Territory Police Force for appointment to the Commonwealth Serbe vice, and that before such an appointoffence. ment can be made it will be necessary for the Public Service Board to satisfy that it is desirable in the interests of Commonwealth that the appointment should be made. In connection with clause 5 of the bill, I point out that sub-section 1 of section 47 of the act provides that in special cases appointments may be made to division other than the Fourth Division of the Service of persons from outside Service, and that the Governor General may, on the recommendation of the board, upon report from the permanent head, make such appointments. Under of this clause it is proposed to amend subas section 1 of section 47 of the act in order to make clear the procedure to be prior to the, board making a a recommendation to the Governor General under the sub-section. The proposed amendment is similar to that embodied department; in clause 3 of the bill. Clause 6 of the bill amends section 48, which relates to prior service being reckoned as Commonwealth service, and at is complementary to clause 4. It proof vides that service in the Federal Capital Territory Police Force of a member of a that force who may be appointed to the the Commonwealth Public Service shall be reckoned as service in the latter.",29
77,Mr MAHOKBY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,*-Will that interfere The prowith the competitive system? Mr HfUfTERr-No ; it is simply an addition to the provision iii the principal honact which allows ijor the appointment of outsiders. The amendment provides for such appointment in the case of members desirof the police force in the Federal,30
78,Mr MAHONEY,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,Will such policemen examihave to sit for an examination?,30
79,Mr HUNTER,CONSTITUTIO N ALTERATION,"It depends on what board says; the hoard lays down the Sub-section 1 of section 62 of the act provides than an officer convicted the of a criminal offence against the Force. law of the Commonwealth or of a State punishable either on indictment or on summary conviction may be suspended from duty. Sub-sections 2 to 4 prescribe other action which may taken if the officer is convicted of th.2 I understand that a criminal offence against the law of a territory of itself the Commonwealth is not a criminal the offence against the law of the Commonwealth. Clause 7 of the bill is, therefore, intended to enable similar action to be taken under section 62 in respect of criminal offences against the laws of the territories of the Commonwealth. Under section 71 of the act, it is proa vided that the maximum leave without pay which may be granted to an officer, the other than one proposing to serve with the League of Nations, or the governments of the United Kingdom, a dominion, colony, or an Australian State, shall be twelve months. Clause 8 of the bill, if agreed to, will enable an officer to be granted leave not exceeding three years, for the purposes of study or research work related to the duties of his office. Instances have occurred in which the period of twelve months already provided under section 71 of the act has been found to be insufficient to enable an officer to complete such a course of study or research work, and, as the Commonwealth would derive an advantage from the purpose for which the leave is required, it is considered desirable that provision should be made for leave to be granted in such cases up to a maximum of three years. Clause 9 provides for an amendment of section 73 of the act, and clause 10 provides for an amendment of section 74 of the act. Several cases have occurred in which officers eligible for long service leave, or pay in lieu thereof, under sections 73 and 74 of the act, have ceased duty without notice and, although their whereabouts cannot be traced, there is substantial reason to believe they have died. A considerable time must elapse before a court will grant leave for the death of an officer to be sworn, and, in the meantime, the officer's wife anddependants cannot be paid moneys, under the sections named, which would be payable if death were established. In some cases, the dependants have been in necessitous circumstances. The amendments embodied in clauses 9 and 10 of the bill are intended to enable the Public Service adjourned. Board, in such cases, without waiting for the sanction of the court to presume death, to authorize payment to the dependants when, in the board's opinion, it is reasonable to assume, from the facts, that the officer is deceased. Paragraph c, of sub-section 9 of section S4 of the act relates to the eligibility for appointment to positions of a non-clerical nature of returned soldiers who have not passed the prescribed examination, but have been temporarily employed continuously for not less than two vears, and are certified as having performed their duties in a satisfactory manner. Under the existing provision a number of returned soldiers had acquired eligibility, and their permanent appointments were proceeding, as extra staff was needed, alternatively with the advancement of Mr Hunter. junior officers eligible for promotion. However, owing to the staffing situation brought about by the financial depression it became necessary, unfortunately, to terminate the employment of a number of temporary hands, including returned soldiers who by length of service had acquired eligibility for permanent appointment. In consequence these particular returned soldiers lost eligibility, the Crown law authorities advising that the words in the act "" who have been temporarily employed continuously for not less than two years "" require that the requisite continuous employment must h . p completed during a period of employment which is still existing at the time when the returned soldier is being considered for permanent appointment. With the recent general increase of departmental activities and the consequential expansion of staffs, the stage has been reached at which the Government feels that action might reasonably be taken for the restoration of eligibility for permanent - appointment of those returned soldiers who are still within the prescribed age limit, and had lost eligibility when their employment had to be terminated. Clause 11 makes this provision ancl, if it is agreed to, it will then be possible for the Public Service Board to consider those men for permanent appointment as opportunity offers. It is estimated that about 150 returned soldiers are affected. Debate (on motion by Mr Rosevear) House adjourned at 12.45 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.

Norfolk Island was joined with Australia, when New Zealand instituted the embargo against fresh fruit y and vegetables in January, 1933.
