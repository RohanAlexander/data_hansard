4,Mr BARTLETT,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"It this debate to follow the contributions of the a moment that I have sat transfixed and listened to me, in the bits that I have noticed, On the one hand we have had member after budget fell short in not delivering increased where they would like to have seen an increased Barton's commitment to his own portfolio that-an argument that more money needed to program and more money on another program. contributions from the other side arguing that surplus of $2.8 billion is not enough and that, cases we have had the same speaker arguing Madam Deputy Speaker, you cannot have it on every program that you would like to surplus-or at least not unless you resort, as approach, and that is raising taxes. You cannot surplus without increasing taxes. Yet this through from day one in the response of I would like, first of all, to make some more specific comments about some of the initiatives while. The first general comment I would like sensible one that carries with it a combination right macro-economic settings continuing, in address the critical economic fundamentals-and address a few areas of critical need. In terms of addressing those economic fundamentals number that are detailed in the budget papers, already alluded to, the budget surplus of $2.8 surplus. A budget surplus for four years in a row government when we had five years of deficits five years, including this year's budget, the Commonwealth debt. Of a total of $97 billion-almost last five years of the former government-$50 MAIN COMMITTEE 17653 This is particularly regrettable because credit introduced the concept of the Administrative the 20-odd years that the Administrative Appeals achieved one of the best administrative review important to the Australian people. an underlying Bill of Rights and the ability to government has been vital to Australians having were going to be protected and that there too highly the significant risk that tainting is a substantial risk that is occurring because to the area of administrative review. areas. The areas of concern are that under this been diminished, the ability of the courts to and our prized system of administrative dismantled. They are all matters of regret. has been fascinating throughout the course of members of the opposition. Not that I pretend for to every speech, but a common theme seems to have run through those contributions. member standing and suggesting how the spending in this area, that area or some other area allocation of funds. I respect the member for area but again we have had evidence tonight of be spent on this program, more money on that On the other hand, we have heard the surplus is not big enough; that a budget in fact, it ought to have been larger. In some both in the same bracket of 15 to 20 minutes. both ways. You cannot increase your spending see further funded, and have a larger budget the Labor Party frequently does, to its favourite increase spending and increase the size of your is the contradiction we have had right the way the opposition to the government's budget. general comments about this budget and then some that I thought were extremely worth to make is that this budget is a sound and of strong economic management-that is, the the way that we have for the last four years, to some very specifically targeted initiatives to I would just like to again highlight a but these are important. The first is, as I have billion. For the fourth year in a row, a budget in contrast to the last five years of the former totalling $75 billion to $80 billion. In the past government will have paid back $50 billion of $80 billion of which was run up in the billion will have been paid back by the end of NA 17654 this year by the time this year's budget GDP ratio, which was 20 per cent when we came by the end of this year, will be This might be dismissed as economic theory anything, but the fact is that this does matter people's lives. Unless we have these fundamentals affected. It is essential that we get our house Bankcard has to be paid off; eventually we have children. Early in his contribution, the member spending on one thing rather than another. opportunity cost is the incredible lost expenditure interest payments on that accumulated debt. billion a year of taxpayers' money was going in need, not to create any extra infrastructure, debt during those previous years of government. an annual debt of $6 billion. Already, because years, we have saved taxpayers $3 billion programs. The second point that needs to be made rate regime that prevails at the moment and prevail if we can continue to keep the budget as all would know, are currently at 7.8 per cent. newspapers over the past year as there has been that 7.8 per cent is still considerably lower of the reasons it is considerably lower is that, deficit, we are running a surplus and putting the upward pressure on rates that was being interest rates of 7.8 per cent we are still running ago. That is, the average mortgage holder is than they were four years ago. Tens of Macquarie have saved significant sums, some mortgage payments over those four years. That that they would not have had if we had continued Some of them will have saved perhaps a couple result of that. The third point I wish to make in addressing forecast growth rate in this budget is 3.75 per economic growth that we have had for the last indicate an annualised growth rate of GDP consecutive quarter with high growth rates. It have had in 30 years-and, might I add, with low not something that was fuelled by massive growth it is growth that has been maintained in spite It is growth that has been achieved because interest rates, getting the budget back in business investment to fuel that growth. The benefit of that growth is the fourth reduction in unemployment that we have seen MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 19 June 2000 has been applied. The net Commonwealth debt to into office, is already below 10 per cent and, down to an estimated 7.1 per cent. or bottom line figures that do not mean because the economic fundamentals do affect right, people's lives will be adversely in order and that we continue to do that. The to pay for this debt or it will be left to our for Barton mentioned the opportunity cost of The critical point that needs to be made about opportunities because of the massive When this government came into office, $9 not to fund any new program, not to help those but simply to pay interest on the accumulated Already that $9 billion has been reduced to of responsible management over the last four a year that can more effectively go to other about the economic fundamentals is the interest the interest rate regime that will continue to situation under control. Home loan interest rates, We have had a fair bit of screaming from the a slight upward adjustment, but the point is than what the interest rate was four years ago. One instead of running a $10 billion or $15 billion downward pressure on interest rates, rather than fuelled by the string of budget deficits. With at 2.7 per cent less than we were four years still saving $225 a month-they are paying less thousands of home buyers in my electorate of even saving several thousand dollars off their is several thousand dollars in their pockets the policies of the former government. of years off the life of their mortgages as a those economic fundamentals is that the cent. That continues the strong performance of four years. The figures that came out last week in the last quarter of 4.3 per cent-the 12th is the best string of high growth rates that we inflation. Again, this is not an accident; it is in our region. In fact, it is quite the reverse; of the collapse of many economies in our region. of responsible economic management, lower order and providing incentives and confidence to point I want to make-the growth in jobs and the as part of that program of management over the NA Monday, 19 June 2000 last four years. The jobs growth figure estimated down to 6.25 per cent by the end of the year. have already been created in the last four cent-the lowest level in 22 years. And this is reducing unemployment. The other point that needs to be made unemployment over the last four years but we rising participation rates and reduced industrial 2.5 per cent on average over the last four years of the former government. We have had cent over the last four years. Again, this is management to achieve rising job creation rising participation rates and rising real In general terms, this is a responsible fundamentals are right, not for the sake of economic rationalism, but to ensure that opportunities for everyone in our community, or turns sour, it is the vulnerable who are the their jobs. By strengthening the economy, I want to turn now to a few specifics in specifically targeted programs. The first is subject of so much debate over the past couple new tax system brings with it income tax cuts million from 1 July will put 80 per cent of rates of 30 per cent or less. Along with that provisional tax, the PPS system, the RPS system, family allowances, guaranteed pension rises and income earners, wage and salary earners, and changes. There are other specific programs that I am firstly, a program of recognition for veterans. both governments-we have increasingly seen to target those areas that have previously would be pleased to see that, in this budget, who previously missed out are now catered for served in different capacities in the South-East includes those who served in the Far Eastern Emergency, including 1,800 naval personnel, last three or four years, saying, ‘Look, it is those benefits be extended to us?' I was delighted catered for. Others to benefit include those who served Confrontation, and the merchant marines who the Vietnam War. It is tremendously heartening out, are now going to be looked after in terms full repatriation benefits, including service pensions. In this budget there is increased support for veterans and their families as a result of applying of the Vietnam veterans' health study, especially MAIN COMMITTEE 17655 in this budget is to have unemployment It is already down to 6.7 per cent-700,000 jobs years. Youth unemployment is down to 21.5 per in the context of increasing participation rates is that not only have we managed to reduce have done that in a context of rising real wages, unrest. We have had a growth in real wages of years compared with only 0.5 per cent under 13 a growth in minimum award wages of 9.5 per not by accident; this is by good planning and good and reducing unemployment in the context of wages, at both average and minimum levels. budget which continues to guarantee that those economic theory, not for some obsession with a sound, strong economy continues to provide including the battlers. If the economy runs sick first to be affected. It is the vulnerable who lose we strengthen the opportunities for all. this budget that are particularly good news-a few taxation reform. The tax system that has been the of years was introduced in this budget. The of $12 billion. Income tax cuts of $12,000 Australian income earners on marginal income tax is the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, et cetera. With that, there will be increased an up-front savings bonus for retirees, so that families will be the big winners out of these tax pleased to see tackled in this budget, including, Over the past years-and, I must say, under initiatives to tackle the needs of veterans and been neglected. I am sure the member opposite we have again extended that process. Veterans in this budget, particularly a key group who Asian region between 1955 and 1975.

I also have to say that I was today to listen to the superb speeches of politics. If future parliaments can have people then they will be in good hands. I would now like to make some comments claims that it is splurging $1.8 billion on interesting thing about that is that there are regional Australia or for anywhere else. Indeed, government is bragging about is not new investment. rubbery promise that the GST will not push prices. So it is not $1.8 billion of new funds rubbery promise. Of course, no money for infrastructure Highway duplication. I noticed in the campaign opponent made a big thing of Labor's attitude some two years into this parliament, with two The Calder Highway is the main lifeblood from any funds earmarked for it in this budget, million on this series of very biased political Calder Highway. One good point about the budget that I have $500 million of course-includes a program of welcome that. I also welcome the setting up and country Australia. I still remember that some $800 million out of the health system; welcome the health initiatives. I guess we have to ask ourselves: why is there simple. It is called blackmail. The Prime Minister infrastructure only if we agree to sell Telstra. need to keep Telstra connected to regional be able to do that is to have a Labor government. Telstra needs to be fully privatised.

I certainly of a program in Bendigo to train GPs for regional when this government came into office it pulled we are yet to recover from that. However, I no infrastructure? The answer to that is quite said that we can get funds for regional But we on this side of politics believe that we Australia's future.

Now we find that it is money over four years to honour this NA Monday, 19 June 2000 commitment. The other major area of impact the City Link tolls. You will be aware that now-thanks to the previous Kennett government-and Victorian motorist heaps to drive into their tolls now, and that will increase the e-tag cost that it is only the people from central Victoria Shepparton and you drive into your capital city and you drive to the capital city you do not pay your capital city you do not pay a toll.

The government claims that education is was no mention of the GST burden on students this GST discriminates because of that. It is students who are not well off enough to pay up Students paying up front are eligible for a difficulties at the moment. It is a major compared with its counterpart university in One of the reasons for that, of course, is the Advanced Education with La Trobe University.
