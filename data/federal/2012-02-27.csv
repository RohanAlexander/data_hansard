1,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS, I seek leave to be the very first member to refer a bill Federation Chamber for consideration.,21
2,The SPEAKER,BILLS,Is leave granted?,21
3,Mr Jenkins,BILLS,Most certainly.,21
4,The SPEAKER,BILLS,I thank the honourable member for Scullin and I note that leave was also given by the honourable member for Cowper.,21
5,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,I would have thought that the leave from the member for Scullin would have been sufficient. I move: That the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 be referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration. Question agreed to. NA Economics Committee Report,21
6,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I seek leave to make a statement on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012, in discharge of the committee's requirement to provide an advisory report on the bill, and to present a copy of my statement. Leave granted.",21
7,Ms OWENS,COMMITTEES,"The committee has endorsed the comments of this statement. On 16 February 2012, the Selection Committee referred the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 to the committee. The bill has two main purposes: the first is to grant the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in order to facilitate payment of employee entitlements, the power to order the winding up of a company that has been abandoned, to the and the second is to allow petitioning further creditors and liquidators to publish notices of certain administration events on a website rather than in the print media or the commission's gazette. The bill also makes other miscellaneous and technical amendments. The committee considers that the bill comprises uncontroversial measures that will assist in curbing the amoral practice of phoenixing. Indeed, in a briefing issued on 23 January 2012, the law firm Minter Ellison stated: The … bill contains some reasonable measures for facilitating the protection of workers' entitlements. and these measures are unlikely to affect the position of the majority of directors. Therefore, the committee has decided not to inquire into the bill and recommends that the House or the Federation Chamber consider the bill forthwith. NA 20th Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum",21
8,Ms SAFFIN,DELEGATION REPORTS," I present the report of the Parliamentary Delegation to the 20th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, Tokyo, 8 to 12 January 2012, and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",22
9,Ms SAFFIN,DELEGATION REPORTS,"As leader of the delegation to the 20th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, I am pleased to present this report. The delegation members comprised the member for Mallee, John Forrest, who was deputy leader; Senator Chris Back; and Senator Catryna Bilyk. The Australian parliament has participated in each annual meeting of the APPF as well as the meetings that prepared for the establishment of the forum. The APPF is most relevant to Australia-the countries that participate are significant to our strategic and economic interests. Delegates have an opportunity to develop their understanding of these issues and, more broadly, of the perspectives of neighbouring parliaments, and to reach agreement on the resolutions of the meeting. This meeting was significant in three particular ways. First, it was fitting that the anniversary meeting was held in Tokyo, as the APPF began there some 20 years previously. The fact that the meeting took place less than a year after the great east Japan earthquake provided a significant backdrop to the meeting. Second, the attendance at the meeting of the APPF Honorary President and former Prime Minister of Japan, His Excellency Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, was important. Mr Nakasone was central to the establishment of the forum and has maintained his interest in and involvement with the APPF over its life. At 93 years of age, Mr Nakasone was a central figure at APPF20. His son, former foreign minister Mr Hirofumi Nakasone, was a member of the Japanese delegation at the meeting. Third, the meeting was highly successful: 326 delegates from 20 member countries and one observer country attended. I now turn to the subject matter of the meeting. There were three broad subject areas: regional cooperation, politics and security, and economic matters. The future work of the APPF was also on the agenda. Before the meeting, the Australian delegation proposed six resolutions, and all six of them got up-yes, there were some negotiations; and yes, there was some give and take, as you would expect at a forum, but essentially they got up in their entirety. The subjects that we put forward were: promoting cultural, educational and personal exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region; strengthening peace and security in the region; the global economic situation; food security; energy security; and cooperation in disaster risk reduction and disaster preparedness. The six resolutions are relevant nationally, regionally and internationally. Each of us spoke in the plenary session on one of these topics and negotiated the related resolution through working groups. I also participated in the working group, Negotiating the New Tokyo Declaration. That took some doing, on all of our parts! The delegation participated in all sessions of the drafting committee, where the draft resolutions from the working groups were finalised before they were returned to the plenary. Mr Forrest and Senator Bilyk represented the delegation on the drafting committee. It was pleasing, given Australia's contribution to the APPF reform process over many years, and I would like to acknowledge former Speaker Jenkins' leadership role in Australia sustaining this role at APFF20. In particular, we contributed a number of amendments to the new APPF rules of procedure. The final joint communique of the forum included 13 resolutions, and six of these were the ones sponsored by our delegation representing the Australian parliament. I would also like to add that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra assisted us in the preparation for the meeting with comprehensive briefing materials, as usual. The Parliamentary Library assisted us in the same vein, so I thank them both. The International and Community Relations Office provided great logistical support and the delegation appreciates this assistance. In Tokyo the ambassador, His Excellency Mr Bruce Miller, and embassy staff-in particular, the  Roberts-provided excellent advice and support. I will digress here. The visit provided with an opportunity, through the ambassador, to meet up with a former colleague of mine, the former Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Timor-Leste, Dr Sukehiro Hasegawa, who has retired and is living back in Japan. He was someone I had worked with very closely, and he was able to meet the delegation and other people connected with Australia. The delegation now has greater knowledge of Japan and the importance and strength of the bilateral relationship as a result of our visit. Next year's APPF meeting will be held in Vladivostok from 8 January to 12 January. I am sure it will be a cold meeting! In the report we point out that there are lead times for participation in the APPF annual meetings and suggest that delegation members be identified by Octobernormally, they are not; this will make it work a lot easier. We also suggest that it would be helpful if members of our delegation attended an initial briefing meeting with the members of the incoming Australian delegation to provide some continuity. In the past, Australian delegations to the APPF annual meetings have been led at Presiding Officer level, which has provided continuity-and I ask you, Mr Speaker, to turn your mind to that. I thank my colleagues the member for Mallee and Senators Back and Bilyk for their cooperation and highly professional representation of the parliament. We were 'Team Australia' and worked very effectively, and we were noticed. I was quite proud to lead the delegation. I would also like to thank our Serjeant-At-Arms, Robyn MCClelland. She not only accompanied us but participated with us and was able to work with us in such a collegial way. With Ms MCClelland we had five in the delegation, and she represented Australia admirablyme and I thank her. I believe the delegation represented the parliament effectively. I thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the honourable members for granting leave to present the report.",22
10,Mr FORREST,DELEGATION REPORTS, I seek leave to make a few remarks with respect to the report. Leave granted.,23
11,Mr FORREST,DELEGATION REPORTS,"In my view the APPF is a very significant forum of the Asia-Pacific Rim nations. In my years in the parliament I have had the opportunity to participate fairly extensively. My first meeting was in Lima, Peru, in 1996. I participated again in 2000, when Australia hosted the APPF. In 2011 I was due to go to Ulan Bator, Mongolia, but at the last minute was unable to attend because there was serious flooding in my constituency and I did not think it appropriate to be away. That was significant, and I refer to it because I had the opportunity in Tokyo to speak on natural disaster relief arrangements and I was really pleased that our delegation performed well in respect to that resolution and quite a few others. People would say that APPF is just another talkfest. That may be true to a casual observer, but I think that it is very important. The consistent contribution made by nations like ours and the fact that we were noticed in Tokyo-and many of the chairmen of the various committees we served on said that and in fact gave us privileges that would probably not normally be available to others-is important because Australia has made a consistent contribution. I wanted to support the remarks by the member for Page with regard to our secretarial support from Robyn MCClelland. It was excellent and it contributed to the success of this delegation. I also wanted to comment that it is a great shame that the Australian public do not see us working in forums like this where partisanship is put aside and the national interest has priority. I was very proud to make a contribution to that in Australia's best interests. I also commend to you the two recommendations at the end of the report, Mr Speaker, about the timeliness of appointment of delegates. There was not a lot of time for us to be prepared for this delegation. In fact I arrived at the first meeting with less than 24 hours notice. Senator Bilyk was much the same. I was surprised at that meeting when I was advised that I would be the deputy leader of the delegation. In the interests of better continuity, I would like these two recommendations to be given serious regard by you. I am not proposing that we appoint permanent delegates to APPF forums in the future-although I note that Canada and New Zealand do that and their delegates there were quite regularly at these forumsbut that there is an overlap, an opportunity for those members who participated in the previous forum to brief and have a chat with the new delegates coming forward. I think that would be a very useful thing to do and it would add to our ability to contribute to this important forum. I too want to thank my colleagues, the member for Page who led us very well, Senator Bilyk and Senator Back, and I feel very proud that I have made a contribution in the national interest to this very important forum. I thank you for letting me make a few remarks. NA Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",23
12,Mr ANDREWS,BILLS," The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011 amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security Act 1999 to enable state and territory agencies such as the Alcohol and Other Drugs Tribunal in the Northern Territory to trigger income management through referrals. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill also amends the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to enable the minister to designate states, territories and areas in which income management can be implemented. This in effect provides the government the necessary flexibility for the operation of income management in the five trial sites announced in the 2010-11 budget. Protecting the welfare of Indigenous children-indeed, all Australian children-is the fundamental responsibility of any government. When intervention is required to protect children, to respond to threats against children, the government must be ready, willing and able to step in and protect those most vulnerable in our society. The change of government in 2007 was not a good thing for the people of the Northern Territory. In fact it would be the hallmark of a policy shift that has been detrimental to Territorians, particularly Indigenous Australians. Labor decided to smash the coalition's commitment to doing what was right and what was needed in the Northern Territory, namely, the emergency response. The ideological pursuit of opposition to the Northern Territory intervention caused widespread collateral damage and undid the good work of the former coalition government. Labor through their various incarnations, firstly, the Rudd government and now the government, are opposed to real welfare reform. They are opposed to promoting measures that will actually help not burden the people concerned. This minister says she not only really believes in reform, in change, in helping people in the Northern Territory, and indeed all Australians, but she proclaims the urgency of this bill, all the while having fallen asleep at the policy wheel. The other side were vocal in criticising income management. Now they profess it is an important part of our welfare system. The government is now picking winners. It is okay, for example, to have this in the Northern Territory but not in the minister's electorate. It is okay for the governmentnominated trial states but not in the Treasurer's or the Prime Minister's electorates. If it is good enough for parts of Australia, for some Australians, we on this side say that it is good enough for all Australians. This government has now had an epiphany that it should somehow work hand in hand with other agencies, with state and territory agencies such as the Northern Territory Alcohol and Other Drugs Tribunal. My congratulations to the Gillard Labor government for coming to a realisation of this and for adopting the approach that we have pursued for years. The hypocrisy of the government simply knows no bounds. This bill, however, is a welcome measure. Together with elements of the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory legislation package, which I will come to shortly, the objectives are important and the coalition hopes that the desired outcomes are realised. But we will not be holding our breath. This is a government which is big on promises. It makes agreements; its leader, the Prime Minister, signs those agreements-then she rips them up. Whilst courage and conviction Gillard are not in great supply on the other side of the chamber, dysfunction and disunity are in abundance particularly today. Suddenly the government is concerned about school attendance. Indeed, this bill seeks to amend social security legislation that underpins the Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure or SEAM. This bill will enable local tailoring of this measure to allow for greater intervention in the Northern Territory's Every Child, Every Day initiative. Combined, these measures will hopefully support greater improvements to school attendance. Moreover, under the amendment arrangements a parent may be required to attend a compulsory conference to discuss their child's school attendance and to enter into a school attendance plan. The bill mandates the parent then complies with the plan. The bill provides for parent income support payments to be suspended where a non-compliance occurs. When the government chose to depart from the successful measures of the emergency response, they chose to ignore the inevitable consequences of this and how it would have an impact on the welfare of Indigenous children. When the Gillard government chose to water down and to soften the previous coalition government measures, they confirmed to the Australian people that they were more interested in populism than progress and they were more interested in press statements and releases than in sound public policy. The measures enacted in this bill are another classic example from the Gillard government of a government desperate to be seen to be doing something. The coalition supports these measures, but the coalition also supports a proactive approach to welfare, not a reactive one. We support comprehensive policy development, not quick fixes designed to patch over endemic issues. The government has contributed toindeed, has caused-many of the problems that it now proudly proclaims it will fix. This government is not taking the tough decisions. It is not providing hope, reward and opportunity to Territorians-indeed, to all Australians. The government is merely playing politics with an issue close to my heart and close to the hearts of many people on this side of the chamber. The Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs talks about income management. She proclaims how great it is. I challenge her here and now to introduce income management to the APY lands in northern South Australia. Use the powers she has right now and do something for these people in one of the most remote parts of the country. The people of the APY lands are crying out for income management, no group more so than their Women's Council that I visited a few months ago. If the government is truly committed, then order income management for the APY lands which this legislation will enable to be done. The coalition supports these measures and, therefore, this bill. We have little confidence in the government, however, that what will be done and necessary will come to fruition. I fear they will not do. I hope that the government go some way to proving me wrong, for if for nobody else's sake it is for the sake of our brothers and sisters and their children in the Northern Territory and in places like the APY lands who have been so wilfully neglected by a government so utterly weak and incompetent, so bitterly divided and dysfunctional. Let me turn to the other bills, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill. Firstly, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill incorporates additional measures for tackling alcohol abuse by increasing the powers of the minister to suspend, modify or cancel liquor licences and individual permits issued in prescribed areas. Current legislation provides that, once the minister grants an exemption for a permit or licence to be issued, the terms, conditions and enforcement of such is the responsibility of the Northern Territory government as legislated through the Northern Territory Liquor Act. The measures also provide powers to the minister to request the Northern Territory government appoint an independent assessor to examine any licence or premises where the minister has reasonable grounds to believe that a particular licensed premise anywhere in the Northern Territory is linked to substantial harm to Indigenous people. An additional measure provides and empowers the Commonwealth minister to approve all alcohol management plans for Indigenous communities. The measures proposed in this bill are in line with the policies and measures established by the Northern Territory government. It should be noted that the Labor government has not proposed any new or additional alcohol control or management initiatives to enhance existing measures. The government has merely duplicated existing measures in order to appear to be taking a strong stance on alcohol management. I turn to land reform. Township leasing arrangements are fundamental in facilitating private home ownership and commercial development in Aboriginal communities. The Labor government has not actively pursued this vital reform in government, with the Northern Territory Emergency Response monitoring report dated October 2011 noting: Following feedback from the land councils on these proposals, township leasing is now being pursued as a longer term priority, unless traditional owners initiate discussions. The Labor government have now incorporated this measure into their 10-year plan. While the coalition is supportive of this measure, it should be highlighted that this must be considered as a priority. The bill seeks to expand measures introduced by the former coalition government's community store program where stores were assessed and outback stores were supported to enter a community in order to raise the quality and quantity of food products and reduce the prices of food and household items. All measures in these bills are to be reviewed after seven years of operation. A sunset provision of 10 years is incorporated. While long-term behavioural change and structural change in Indigenous communities cannot be achieved overnight, allowing any government measures to run for seven years before a review sends the wrong message. It says in reality that this area is not a priority. It says the issue is not one demanding urgent attention. Labor's approach in this area lacks leadership, lacks vision and lacks any new ideas. Pursuant to the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill, an exemption is required to be granted by the minister to obtain a liquor licence or permit in an alcohol protected area. All licences and permits are then issued and regulated by the Northern Territory government through the provisions of the Northern Territory Liquor Act. This bill grants the power to the federal minister to modify, suspend or cancel liquor licences and permits. Those powers to be conferred are essentially a duplicate of the powers already vested in the Northern Territory minister and the Northern Territory Liquor Commissioner. Monitoring, suspending or cancelling of liquor licences and permits is currently the responsibility of the Northern Territory minister and the Northern Territory Liquor Commission. Any intervention in this area by the federal minister will, therefore, lead to duplication of effort by governments or confusion by permit holders and licensees over which minister or which regulations are in force. The coalition amendments, circulated in my name, remove any potential confusion or duplication of effort by clearly specifying when and how the federal minister may act. The amendments, if adopted, would require that prior to issuing a determination to modify, suspend or cancel a liquor licence or permit the minister must first write to the Northern Territory minister and the Northern Territory Liquor Commission setting out the issue and the proposed action. The Northern Territory minister and the Northern Territory Liquor Commissioner must then respond in writing within the specified consultation period with any comments or actions that they consider appropriate. The amendments require that the federal minister must have regard to those comments prior to making any determination. These amendments ensure that any federal intervention in the management of the Northern Territory Liquor Act does not duplicate or complicate the legislation of the Northern Territory or actions of the Territory government. The amendments reserve the right of the federal minister to make a determination where the Northern Territory government is unable or fails to take appropriate action to address harm caused by alcohol abuse. I therefore commend the coalition amendments to the House.",24
13,Ms SAFFIN,BILLS," I rise to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and cognate bills. Firstly, I recognise and applaud the work of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for working with a commitment and a will to consult and to improve people's lives in an area that is not an easy area to legislate That is what it is about, but it is not always easy to achieve when we are dealing with laws in this place. The minister has put a lot of time and both intellectual and physical effort into achieving that. I start by commending her for that work. I listened to the member for Menzies giving his contribution. I reject the notion that the government is playing politics on this. That is nonsense. This legislation is about people's lives. It is an area that has challenged all governments. I reject outright the member's glib words, which can be thrown around so easily. There was a lot of consultation. As with any consultation, some people said they were not consulted enough. The reality is for this legislation meetings were held in more than 100 communities and town camps, together with public meetings in major towns. There were hundreds of discussions with individuals, families and other groups across the Northern Territory. Those meetings were held from the end of June to mid-August 2011. The consultations were overseen by the independent Cultural and Indigenous Research Centre of Australia. The centre's assessment was that the consultations were fair, open and accountable. What more could you ask for? At the end of any consultation, having such a report done by an independent body means that something was done right. In the consultations, Aboriginal people said that getting more children to school, increasing the number of Aboriginal people in local jobs, improving housing and reducing alcohol related harm were top priorities. Indeed, they are top priorities for communities across our nation. They are priorities that Aboriginal people identified in these consultations for which meetings took place regularly over several months. They rightly want those things. There were for. meetings with the Northern Territory government's Chief Minister and other ministers and officials working to develop a forward-looking policy approach. The legislation had to align with the range of reforms the Northern Territory government is taking to lift school attendance, tackle alcohol abuse and improve housing. The Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory package of bills is one element in the Australian government's continued commitment to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Turning to alcohol, the legislation provides that the Northern Territory Emergency Response alcohol restrictions be continued and strengthened. It also provides that alcohol management plans established by local communities be directed at minimising alcohol related harm. Whilst this is about Aboriginal communities, in looking at these alcohol management plans, something may be gained by all of us. Alcohol does contribute to a lot of harm across Australian society and communities. Where an alcohol management plan is approved and in place, consideration will be given to lifting the restrictions under the Stronger Futures legislation. If restrictions are lifted, the Northern Territory Liquor Act will apply, including for enforcement. But where communities want to retain the Stronger Futures restrictions, they will be able to do so. The legislation also provides for the Commonwealth to require the Northern Territory Licensing Commission to provide to the Commonwealth minister reports on levels of alcohol related harm and the impact of policy measures in the Territory. From the government's perspective, being able to get the information needed to make good decisions in the future is particularly important to knowing how we are tracking and to honing the policy settings to achieve better outcomes. That is what it is about: achieving better outcomes. The legislation also provides for a joint CommonwealthNorthern Territory review to be conducted in two years from commencement of the legislation. The review will examine the impact of the legislation and the Territory's strategies to address alcohol related harm. This will allow both governments to continue working together to make progress. Another key feature of the package is that there is a clear commitment from the Australian government to negotiating voluntary long-term leases. The government will not be extending the compulsory five year leases acquired under the original NTER legislation. As a separate issue, the legislation provides the Australian government with the ability to address land tenure restrictions in Northern Territory legislation. The aim is to enable the Aboriginal landholders of town camps and community living areas to have the opportunity to make use of their land for a in broader range of purposes, including economic development and private home ownership, which are really important. There are also key review and sunset provisions in the legislation. In closing, I would like to make a few points. I have here a copy of a statement that came out of website of the Australian Human Rights Commission. There are comments from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda. I would like to quote a couple of them because they are quite telling and, coming from someone such as Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda, it is a key view and an important view from a key person. Commissioner Gooda said: I call on Parliament to work constructively in a bipartisan way to address the issues confronting our communities in the Northern Territory. I hope that bipartisanship is a key feature of this package of legislation because we owe it to people to turn our minds to working in the best and most constructive way we can. To quote Commissioner Gooda further, he says: … every child has the right to be educated. We need to make sure we provide every opportunity for this to happen. It's critical for our kids to attend school. I cannot see anyone in this place disagreeing with that statement. He went on to say: The implementation of any proposed measures under the Stronger Futures Bills, such as school attendance and alcohol management, must be done in a culturally safe and culturally secure way. I agree with the commissioner in that regard. I would like to say that, having spent the last year being part of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition for Indigenous Australians, as it was called, I probably had to turn my mind a lot more to some of the issues in the legislation than some other members might have had to. I note that I served on that panel with the honourable member for Hasluck, who is sitting ready to speak in this debate as I expected him to. It was a good experience for all sorts of reasons, but one of them was that it also challenged some of the views I had about ways we could achieve better outcomes and help in that area. Even though it was on constitutional recognition, all the other issues were still brought up. As the honourable member for Hasluck would know, it was at times challenging to listen to such forceful people-well-published people with strong, compelling and known views. It was an enriching experience that certainly helped me better understand-beyond the issue of constitutional recognition-and to bring that understanding into this place. I also thank the minister and Prime Minister for having given me the opportunity to serve on that panel. I will close there. not think my voice will hold out much longer. I have been challenged with laryngitis but was listed to speak. I thought was important to do so today. I will leave it at that.",28
14,Mr WYATT,BILLS," I rise to support the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011. I acknowledge the comments made by the member for Page because I think she made a very salient point in noting the fact that a learning process occurred for her through our interactions with some of the Indigenous leadership who sat around that table. But there were not only Indigenous people; there were nonIndigenous people whose contributions have been significant to the debates over probably the last decade. There are many others who, in the past, also contributed to some of the direction setting that has occurred in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This bill proposes some key reforms that I think are fundamental not only to the shift in the way that services are delivered but also to creating the opportunities for people within those Northern Territory communities to become part players within the process of the reform. The next stage is the part that concerns me-that is, the red tape that applies in the way of regulation and guidelines. It is there that the intent of parliaments and ministers becomes murky, with the interpretation and application of the fairly broad initiatives within this. If we do anything at all-if we want to make a difference-we have to involve Aboriginal communities as equal partners in the process of reform and change. They have to be able to sit in that process and have access to information and knowledge that enables them to make informed consent decisions collaboratively with the senior bureaucrats I do who will be sitting with them. I note the Senate is doing a series of consultations, and it is a pity this consultation is occurring after it this bill has been introduced into the chamber. I would have preferred to have argued that we consult first and then frame the legislation so that we had a process embedded that would require government agencies, in working through and implementing these solutions, to be imbued with the mindset of those who deliver. Change through legislation does not occur easily. There is always a time lag. But anywhere you have an equal basis of decision making-and where you contribute to the debate through the way that you shape and form your own aspirations and so contribute to the direction setting of the legislation-it is much more enduring and effective. I commend the minister for focusing on some key areas, particularly the alcohol and substance abuse element. Alcohol, taken in moderation by any individual, is a good relaxing agent; it enables you to lose some of those inhibitions and at least have conversations. But the challenge is when it becomes a destructive habit that harms and ruins families and communities, so I would certainly support those measures. On land issues, the debate in this country has never before gone to the extent that we are taking it now-where the consultation involves talking about the subdivision of Aboriginal lands to enable families to build homes of their own in the communities where they have lived for some time. In fact, what we have done-and all governments have done this-is enter into housing programs, put them in place and then expect change to occur. But we have to remember that we have here the oldest living culture which has never really lost many of the threads and elements that have been significant and important to it. In that context, change does bring conflict. Change also brings about disproportion in the way in which engagement and planning occur. I think the cultural practices that have long prevailed and have at times been used as a reason not to proceed should never prevent what needs to happen-and that is that people should sit face to face, work through the issues and reach real solutions that make effective and efficient use of the resources that Commonwealth, state and territory governments provide, in the context of the change being mooted. I would also urge very strongly that the provisions in the legislation to do with alcohol and controls around the distribution of alcohol have built into them a better evaluation process. When we implement a framework for change to reduce the abuse of alcohol and a process which we hope will significantly improve the outcomes, we need to evaluate the things that work and ensure that people within a community can use best practice to determine how effective their community is in taking forward measures that will make a difference. In reading the bill I was quite heartened by the fact that there are some constructive aspects to it. The enforcement of food security has always been a concern to me, given what I have witnessed over a long period of time. I know from working in the health area that you try to encourage community stores to provide a nutritious and balanced range of foods, but you also try to encourage community stores to be effective in providing an avenue for food on a regular basis. Often I have read stories about or been involved in discussions about a community store having collapsed because the manager has had problems-and the community has then had to struggle. I think alcohol and housing, the community land approach, and food security and community stores are three critical areas that for some time have languished. Let me say that from a bipartisan perspective, in fact in this House from a tripartisan perspective, the approach to these is a common one and there is that support. So I anticipate that if we do this well we will see the types of changes we all have argued for. I have listened to Noel Pearson, Mick Gooda and many other leaders around this country who have argued for reform that will ensure the security of pathways not only for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities but for families and children-so that we break the nexus with ills and dysfunction and we strengthen the role of the family within the community. I see elements of that in this legislation if it is implemented in concert and in partnership. I referred earlier to informed consent decision making. I think that is one of the things that is missing in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. What we tend to do is establish the legislation, develop the programs-or cobble together many of the existing programs-and look at how we can better deliver them given the circumstances. While the intent is good and it is driven from Canberra, it nevertheless is an imposition of a framework on top of people whose daily lives are often influenced by those who make decisions from afar. Let me reflect back to the Reformation period in the history of world civilisation. When people had access to knowledge and information, they were then able to influence their own destinies and become strong by becoming a voice in that process. I think we as Australian governments over the periods to come have to adopt a different approach. In the apology the former Prime Minister said, 'If things aren't working then let's look at alternative solutions, let's look at different understanding ways of doing business.' I would hope that those elements within this bill are considered in that context because I can see that, at the end of a 10-year moratorium, for a couple of the areas that are referred to, change will not be as significant as we would have hoped. No community, no family and no individual have really progressed when you provide a nanny state framework. If we empower them to become the shapers of their own destiny, if we empower them to be part of an equal decision-making process and if we give them the capacity to change their own circumstances while providing support from the expertise of the agencies that prevail at both Commonwealth and state levels, I think we will see real and meaningful change. I am optimistic that there are many elements of this bill that will achieve that, and that is aided by the inclusion of other matters such as information about criminal history. I can take people to reports in which the criminal history of some individuals running Aboriginal communities or running community stores has not been a factor that has helped any community at all. I think the other thing we have the opportunity to do is to build the human capacity of those within communities to contribute to the shaping of what is delivered within their community through this process. It is the front end, in many aspects, to significant reforms that can occur within education and health. The only thing that I find slightly distracting is when we apply a whole-of-community approach to income management. Let me say that there are people within those communities whose income management skills are equal to those of any other person who lives in this country. I would rather see us give more focus to providing some upstream work around the of financial literacy, budgetary processes and budgeting, and costs-and then working that through. I do not resile from the fact that this legislation will support those who have aspirations for their children, those who want the circumstances in which their families live and reside to be better than what they currently are, those who want to provide the pathways to a home environment in which there is the support and love that leads to educational opportunities and leads to a place where their children feel safe and comfortable-where alcohol is not a factor in the abuse that some experience. This bill will provide the legislative framework that will enable some of the change that is needed. I ask the minister to give serious consideration in the implementation process to her agencies looking at the way in which state, territory and Commonwealth senior public officers negotiate and work with communities. I also ask the minister to consider the outcome of the detailed consultations that will occur in the Senate inquiry-what they bring back in the messages from Aboriginal communities. I have seen in the media reports that there is some anger about the lack of consultation. There is an expression that is often used in Aboriginal communities of 'seagulls' who fly in and fly out but who never leave a solution. They talk and then disappear. I would hope that we do not contribute to that concept in the implementation of the programs that support this bill. I do support the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011. I think that we have the opportunity, with a tripartisan approach, to make an incredible difference in working far more effectively with the Northern Territory government and, certainly, far more effectively with Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. I commend the bill to the House.",30
15,Mr BANDT,BILLS," I rise on behalf of the Australian Greens to oppose the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011. We oppose the bill, not because we do not support stronger futures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but because we do. We support stronger futures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as we do for all Australians, not just in the Northern Territory but across the country. But stronger futures for Australia must be underpinned by equality and respect for our first peoples. This bill is not underpinned by equality or respect. It is an extension of top-down, punitive, discriminatory and flawed Northern Territory intervention initiated by the Howard government and perpetuated by this Labor government. It is only a few weeks since the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians presented their report recommending a series of changes to our Constitution which would go some way to righting the wrongs of the past and to recognising Indigenous Australians. Such a referendum would further challenge the false and damaging assumption that Australia was a nation born from a land devoid of people when instead we are a country first cared for by one of the world's oldest living cultures. Constitutional recognition would be another step towards healing this shameful legacy. It was only last week that we as a nation had an opportunity to reflect on the fourth anniversary of the apology to the stolen generations, and still so much needs to be done to bring about true reconciliation in this country. We need to match the words of the apology with actions that deliver equality. This bill, however, is yet another example of the government's inability to extend the commitment to recognition, reconciliation and equality across its legislative agenda. With this bill, the government is seeking to continue and expand the discriminatory measures introduced by the Howard government's Northern Territory intervention. It is an intervention which has failed to put in place measures that genuinely overcome disadvantage, an intervention which has failed to deliver better overall outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and an intervention which will fail to deliver stronger futures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. One look at the Closing the Gap in the the Northern Territory Monitoring Report shows how much work there is still to do: school attendance has declined since 2009; child hospitalisation rates have increased; incarceration rates continue to rise, with Indigenous people more than 17 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous people in 2008; and incidences of personal harm and suicide have doubled since 2007. There is no evidence that any positive changes in education and employment have come from this flawed intervention. The use of spin to justify poor policies will remain a necessity until the approach in the Northern Territory changes. I am a big believer in the principle that you do not make people's lives better by taking away their rights. This expansion adheres to the long-held and ultimately flawed principle that punishing people will lead to changes in behaviour. These old approaches are typified by negative measures such as income management and the suspension of welfare payments, which are justified with the use of reports that are all too often derived from perfunctory consultations by government employed outsiders and framed to meet a predetermined outcome. They generally lack the quantitative rigour which is necessary. Stronger Futures consultations have come under fire for poor process and reporting. Analysis based on independent recordings of the consultations reveals discrepancies between opinions expressed by communities and the view of opinions present in the report. A top-down intervention is unnecessary for effecting change in the community, and other ideas proposed by the communities themselves are being ignored by the consultation process. The government point to some areas they say have improved, such as personal and community safety, to justify a continuation of the intervention. An increased feeling of safety is hardly surprising given that some policies associated with the intervention have seen money spent on more safe houses, police and Aboriginal liaison officers. These investments obviously produce results, they improve services and they address wider community disadvantage. The key point here is that an emergency intervention, with its discrimination and punitive approach, is not needed in order to make these investments a reality. The Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure, or SEAM program, is another example of an unnecessarily punitive policy that achieves some benefit through the elements of investment contained within it that could be achieved in other ways. SEAM is now being extended, despite the fact that DEEWR have admitted the trials could not be directly linked to educational outcomes. It was made clear in Senate estimates recently that the positive and more consistent results from SEAM are delivered through case management and personalised involvement with families rather than any measures that punish parents. Consistently better outcomes are delivered when the primary policies focus on engagement between parents and schools. The positive investments contribute to improving school attendance. More teachers, striking better training, bilingual education, community involvement, better parental engagement with schools, action to address children's hearing health and more investment in case management would all deliver better outcomes than SEAM is able to. It is these suggestions that were most prevalent in the Stronger Futures consultation with communities, not a preference for punitive measures. Despite this, money is still being funnelled into truancy measures which alienate people and take an old-fashioned, punitive approach. This approach, aimed at punishing parents, does not build the trust or partnerships that are needed or build the ability of parents to take responsibility for their child's education in positive ways. The $1.5 billion spent so far would have delivered significantly better results had it been directed to service investments and programs rather than signs, bureaucracy and income management. These programs are extremely costly. To date, the bill for the current income management process in the Northern Territory sits at around $450 million and the policy remains one of the most criticised across the NT. The money used to incomemanage people would produce far better results if it were directed to services and programs based on collaboration and community involvement and partnership. A recent report by the Equality Rights Alliance into women's experiences of income management in the Northern Territory, funded by the government, shows that, of the 168 surveyed, 74 per cent said that the BasicsCard does not make it easier to look after their families. Most women reported that it just added difficulties and costs to paying for goods and services. The report also showed that most women surveyed had an apparent lack of understanding as to the purpose of the program or why they were on it and 70 per cent said they did not feel safer since the introduction of income management. In their submission to the Senate inquiry on this legislation, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples highlighted the general lack of robust baseline data and evidence in support of policies initiated in the intervention. The government needs to be investing in policy measures that have solid evidence to support them, not repeating the same failed policies over and over. If we were to implement sound community based initiatives that we know are effective, that would provide communities with the ability and opportunity to control and improve their social and economic conditions-elements that are a key component of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which Australia has endorsed. Engagement in the Northern Territory and with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities must be fundamentally altered if the rights set out in the UN declaration are to be honoured. That will happen when we adopt policies that are considered and that originate from real, consultative engagement with a sound evidence base. When this occurs, a well-chosen set of statistics and a well-oiled PR machine will not be needed to justify the approach. The benefits for communities and individuals across the Northern Territory will be self-evident. The government's stealthy expansion of income management measures is a sign they have failed to learn their lesson in the Northern Territory. In the words of Barb Shaw: Loss of autonomy, resources and opportunities in communities is driving many people into the larger town centres. The overcrowding situation with housing has not improved. More and more Aboriginal children are being removed from families, another silent statistic. There is a deteriorating social situation in these larger towns, with crime on the increase. The government remain unable to effectively develop and implement policies alongside communities in the Northern Territory that work. This legislation will only further entrench this, not just in the NT but now in other parts of the country as income management is extended to other states and territories to allow for the quarantining of income support payments. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities must be allowed to take responsibility for their own affairs. This legislation is a step in the wrong direction and the government is missing yet another opportunity to take a new approach in the Northern Territory. Extending ineffective measures is a waste of money. Punishing parents by cutting income support flies in the face of existing knowledge and opinion, including of the government's own departments. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to work out that by investing in community services you improve outcomes for communities and address disadvantage. The Australian Greens are committed to proactive and positive policies which deliver long-term benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and not costly punishment schemes which diminish the ability of those peoples to develop the capacity to build their own stronger futures as they define them. The government continues to act in a way contrary to the evidence and the opinions of experts and the community. This is precisely why we have seen more than $1.5 billion spent on the intervention without seeing the necessary improvements. The Australian Greens-in particular my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert, who has worked tirelessly to uncover the real impacts of government policies on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples-have strongly and consistently stood up to the government over the issue of the intervention. I have serious doubts about extending a program which is already operating and returning underwhelming results. That is why I will be voting against this legislation. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:07): I listened with great interest to the member for Melbourne. I have actually spoken to a number of Aboriginal women in the communities who receive the BasicsCard. They think it works really well for them. They know that they have guaranteed money that cannot be touched. So for them it is working quite well. I rise to contribute to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The debate on this bill encompasses a compilation of legislation known as Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory, which includes the social security bill and other legislation amendment bills. These bills amend aspects of the Northern Territory Emergency Response, or the intervention, as it is more colloquially known, which was introduced by the Howard government in June 2007 and is subject to sunset in August this year. In essence, this bill has three focus points: to introduce various measures for the control and regulation of alcohol in protected areas of the Northern Territory; to provide the Commonwealth with powers to regulate town camps and community living areas in the Northern Territory; and to provide the Commonwealth with the power to regulate community store licences in the Northern Territory, including the power to impose conditions on licences granted to store managers and owners. In addition, this suite of bills amends the social security law underpinning the government's school enrolment and attendance measure, thus allowing for the suspension of income support to parents who fail to meet certain compliance arrangements. Tackling alcohol abuse is a significant portion of this bill. Alcohol consumption and abuse levels are extremely high and have been identified and reported on many times as primary factors associated with child abuse, assaults, domestic violence, social dysfunction and numerous other problems plaguing Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. I acknowledge that there are critics of this bill with respect to measures directed at alcohol misuse in the Northern Territory, who indicate that without a floor price on alcohol these measures are unlikely to be successful-that is just one opinion. Land reform is a means to provide the government with a platform to secure tenure, economic development and home-ownership opportunities within Indigenous communities across the Northern Territory. The largest portion of this bill relates to food security. It has been recognised that, over time, the question of food quality has become a major issue, one that is being linked with health concerns. Part of the intervention saw the introduction of a licensing system for community stores. The Stronger Futures bills seek to expand on this original premise and extend the licensing scheme to cover all shops that are a key source of food, drink and grocery items to Indigenous communities. Having been to some of the communities prior to and during the intervention, I can say that there has been a significant change to the food that is being provided in the communities. The intervention measures have been revisited over the past four years, including a subtle rebranding to Closing the Gap, resulting in the reversal or softening of some of the original measures, including reversal of the suspension of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the removal of the process to suspend the permit system for access to Aboriginal land and the redefinition of the term 'income management' in the Social Security and other Legislation (Welfare Reform Reinstatement of Racial Discrimination Act) Act 2010. In June 2011 the government released its discussion paper Stronger Futures for the Northern Territory, following which, between June and August, a consultative process was undertaken within the Northern Territory. The minister has said: 'There were more than 470 consultation meetings in over 100 hundred towns and communities.' The member for Melbourne suggested that consultation was not occurring-that is evidence that it was. In research as a result of the consultation and provided by an independent analysis of data relating to the intervention to September 2011, the government identified several key areas as issues requiring urgent attention. It will be not be a surprise to members to learn that school attendance and educational achievement were two of those areas, along with economic development and employment and the tackling of alcohol abuse. The then Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, in a policy statement issued on the day that this legislation was introduced into the parliament, stated: The Australian Government, in partnership with the Northern Territory Government, is now acting on the issues people said were the most urgentthis was identified four years ago, but it is good that the government has come on board now and says that it is tackling it. She said it was looking at:  getting children to school to get a decent education  tackling alcohol misuse  providing decent housing, and  building strong local economies and increasing job opportunities. and They are all part of the reason the intervention was introduced under John Howard. I note that the minister has also said: The Australian Government is determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past but to work together with Aboriginal people to build stronger futures together. I think we all want that. This bill is another example showing that this Gillard Labor government is desperate to be seen to be doing something. While supporting the introduction of these measures, the coalition also highlights the need for a proactive approach to welfare, not a reactive one. We on this side of the House support comprehensive policy development followed up with strong management and implementation measures, not quick fixes or patches that are designed to gloss over endemic issues and that result in mismanagement, waste and a failure to achieve the desired outcomes. Too often the Gillard Labor government has tripped at the implementation stage and failed to deliver on its promises. The intervention in the Northern Territory as introduced by the Howard government remains an issue of contention; there is no doubt about it. There is division and misunderstanding, not just among Aboriginal people, within the communities, but among their supporters and their opposition, who are broadly spread across all facets of the Northern Territory and populations. As we heard, the member for Melbourne is one of those critics of the intervention. But, as I said, I have seen the results of this. While there is still a long way to go, it does seem to be working. That is why I encourage more agencies to work together to build on what has been learnt and why I encourage more people to get results. But you are only going to get that by learning the lessons of the past. Reverend Dr David Gondarra, a Northern Territory elder, is reported in an article by Amanda Midlam on the On Line Opinion webpage as saying: The recent consultations report shows that Government has failed to take seriously our concerns and feelings. This report is simply a reflection of pre-determined policy decisions … He goes on to say: The Stronger Futures report has created a lot of anger and frustration due to the lack of process and the ignorant way in which the views of the people have been reported. We therefore reject this report. However, within the same article, an Amnesty International spokesperson is reported stating that Amnesty International has: … called on the Gillard government to move on from the mistakes of the past, warning its Stronger Futures legislation is just a re-badged NT intervention … Further: Amnesty International is concerned Labor hasn't done enough to remove the discriminatory aspects of the intervention in the new legislation. In the same vein, the Northern Territory elders and community representatives group claimed the consultation report 'is simply a reflection of pre-determined policy decisions'. They say, 'This is shown clearly by the absence of any commitment to bilingual learning programs as well as the proposal to introduce welfare cuts and fines to parents of non-attending school children.' Australian However, on the contrary, many Indigenous leaders, including Noel Pearson, Marcia Langton and Bess Price-a good friend of mine-have called for a 'move forward instead of backwards' building on the measures from the intervention, accusing critics of the intervention of 'imagining an ideal Aboriginal society without any of the dysfunction that is actually suffered on the ground'. The coalition amendments proposed by my friend and colleague the member for Menzies are designed to tweak and improve on the measures already in existence and being introduced by the Stronger Futures legislation. One such point is that relative to the power of the federal minister to modify, suspend or cancel liquor licences and permits-a power that essentially duplicates that of the Northern Territory minister and Northern Territory licensing commissioner. The coalition amendment in this area specifies that prior to issuing a determination to modify, suspend or cancel a liquor licence or permit the minister must first write to the Northern Territory minister and the Northern Territory Licensing Commission setting out the issue and the proposed action and that a written response be invited from the Northern Territory minister and the Northern Territory licensing commissioner within the specified consultation time frame, with appropriate comment or action. At this point, any decision by the federal minister must have regard to the comments and actions as advised by the Northern Territory minister and the Northern Territory licensing commissioner. The amendments recognise the right of the federal minister to make determinations where the Northern Territory government is unable to or fails to take appropriate action to address the harm caused by alcohol abuse. The amendment in this regard clarifies when the federal minister may act. The last thing we need is more buck-passing between the state and the Commonwealth. Territorians are very parochial about the Commonwealth telling them what they need to do. From my own experience it is very evident that the intervention, Closing the Gap or, as is being proposed, Stronger Futures for the Northern Territory are issues which will remain contentious regardless of stakeholder involvement. In talking with constituents and Aboriginal representatives, I find that many support the measures currently in place, contrary to what the member for Melbourne says. But, in fact, from my experience, many of the women particularly see the value of welfare quarantining, which enables them to know they have money available for the purchase of food, clothing and medications. It is not perfect but at least it is a step in the right direction. Recently I spoke to a group of Indigenous mothers in the Palmerston area of my electorate. Several women volunteered for income quarantining for no other reason than to ensure they had money to spend on children in their care each fortnight, to make sure they had food and clothing. Without intent to offend, the level of education across not only the Indigenous population within my electorate is cavernous. There are those that actively engage in education systems and encourage kids from preschool through to university and beyond. On the other side of the coin, there are those dysfunctional family units, a large percentage ravaged by alcohol and drug abuse, which fail their kids by not taking the appropriate responsibility, by not seeking out a better life for them or by not, in some cases, providing basic needs. Behavioural issues are largely as a result of alcohol and drug related activities. It is my observation that unfortunately the level of abuse increases with a falling level of education standard. This has a twofold effect. Not only does it require intervention in terms of the income quarantining in many instances, but from a generational perspective the risk of repeating and prolonging the circumstances which invoke such action remains. Introduction of the school enrolment and attendance measures, along with many local state and Territory programs set in place to work with and adjunct to this legislation, has broadened the initiatives in place for income management. As already indicated, the coalition amendments in this area are designed to tweak and improve on this already viable program. Hopefully the result will be more kids attending school. Within my electorate there are a number of Aboriginal communities, as I have said. As is the case across the Northern Territory and broader Australia, the residents within these communities are not static in number. Resident numbers ebb and flow with family comings and goings. Often visitors remain for long periods, and it seems to happen more when the wet season is upon us. I have been to the Bagot community a number of times. People there have told me that when visitors come it causes problems for the community, because they drink alcohol. It is an urban community and often the police do not come and police it, despite the fact that there is an alcohol prevention sign there. The police do not want to come and fine these people, who are already disadvantaged. This issue is putting pressure on the council. I encourage the community and the relevant agencies to work together to come to a solution. They need to work together to build on what we have already put in place. I think everybody wants to make sure that this situation gets better, but there is no fix. The more that we learn from pilots that we have undertaken in the past and other measures, the more we can build on them for the future. All stakeholders need to work together. This is not going to be fixed overnight; it is a long process. The statistics that we have seen are encouraging, giving us cause to be positive and to work together in this area.  to voice my support for the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. The Gillard Labor government, like the Rudd government of the 42nd Parliament, is committed to working alongside, for and with Indigenous communities to build a better future together. My first day at work in this parliament was the day the member for Griffith gave an apology to the stolen generation. It was an incredibly moving day. That was after parliament had started with the welcome to country outside the parliament for the first time in the history of Canberra. It was a great way for me to start my work in this parliament. The Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 has three main aims: tackling alcohol abuse, reforming land rights and promoting food security in the Top End. As the Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs that is currently conducting an inquiry into foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, I have gained already, with the hearings that we have had, an insight into how important it is to tackle alcohol abuse throughout Australia, particularly in those communities where it is a problem, and, unfortunately, that is often Indigenous communities. We should all be encouraged by Closing quick the gap-Prime Minister's report because Indigenous lives are slowly being changed and communities are slowly being transformed. As the Prime Minister said, the progress is gradual but it is progress nevertheless. They are slow and steady steps in the right direction that we need to make as a nation. We are increasing access to early childhood education for Indigenous fouryear-olds in remote communities and we are confident that we are on track to have the infant mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018. Anyone who has young children knows how these dry statistics take on a completely different meaning when one think of one's own children and what it would be like to have the sort of mortality rates in our suburban areas that are being experienced in some parts of Australia. Also, NAPLAN results show that we are making good progress in halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy, and retention rates to year 12 are now nudging 50 per cent-steps in the right direction. I remember when I was a union organiser working in private schools at Wadja Wadja High School in the Woorabinda community and seeing the work that went into those communities to make sure that kids stayed at a private school and an Aboriginal community college-and other Aboriginal schools around Queensland. I commend all the teachers and teachers aides who work in these schools. But there is still much to be done to improve education, employment and health outcomes for Indigenous Australians. There are still lessons to be learned and things we can do better, and that we must do better. The Labor government is committed to consulting fully with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory regarding the Northern Territory Emergency Response. The report into the Northern Territory intervention Stronger futures in the Northern Territory found that people continue to feel hurt at the way the Northern Territory Emergency Response was implemented, irrespective of the motivations for it. But the report also found that Indigenous people do want government to strengthen measures to boost school attendance, create employment opportunities-thus giving the dignity of work-reduce alcohol related violence and improve housing. This bill will help support Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and continue our efforts to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. It introduces measures to tackle alcohol abuse, ensure food security in remote communities and assist economic development in town camps and community living areas. The related bill, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011, will also make some amendments to improve the operation of restrictions on extremely violent or sexually explicit material. Alcohol abuse sadly remains one of the biggest challenges facing Indigenous communities. We know that in remote communities in the Northern Territory consumption of alcohol is 1.5 times the national level. Alcohol contributes to 30 per cent of domestic violence incidents at least, and alcohol related crime is four times the national level. This bill will enable an independent review of the effectiveness of various laws that are concerned with alcohol related harm. The joint CommonwealthNorthern Territory review is required to ensure that the laws are working together and achieving a safer and healthier community. The bill also empowers the minister to direct the Northern Territory government to appoint an assessor to investigate particular licensed premises when the minister has reasonable grounds to believe that the premises are linked to substantial related harm. The bill will also ensure that alcohol initially management plans put in place by local communities are more effective in reducing alcohol related harm. By working directly with communities and empowering them to develop their own plans, Indigenous communities are able to develop solutions that work for them and that are particular to their own needs. I have seen that already in the FASD inquiry where local people have come up with plans-some of them based on personalities-and in the local situations they have already achieved some success. I am confident that these measures will improve upon efforts to tackle alcohol abuse and harm in the Northern Territory. The Stronger futures in the Northern Territory report also found improvements in food security over the last four years with a healthier range of food available in remote community stores. This builds on that success. We want to further improve access to healthy food in remote communities. The bill removes the heavy-handed approach to licensing where any non-compliance would result in a licence being revoked. Instead, this bill will introduce a daily penalty of up to $2,200. This will encourage stores to improve their performance but will not close a store altogether, with sometimes disastrous consequences and flow-on negative impacts on a community. This bill also improves opportunities for private home ownership and economic development in Indigenous communities. The Northern Territory government has an opportunity to amend its legislation to enable Aboriginal landholders to use their land for a broader range of purposes. If the Northern Territory does not do this, the Commonwealth minister will have the power to amend Northern Territory legislation to enable the government to grant individual rights to land. Any economist or student of society would know the benefits that come from land being able to be passed down as it gains in value. It means that wealth can be passed down through generations. This will enable title holders to build their own homes and run businesses in town camps and community living areas, further empowering Indigenous communities. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 strengthens our efforts to improve school attendance. It enables the government to implement management in five new sites in disadvantaged communities in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland-in fact, just down the road from my electorate of Moreton. Income management has proven to be a valuable tool for government to use to help to nudge families back on track. Obviously, this is a tough and confronting area for governments to delve into. On the one hand, Australians have the right to spend their money however they so choose, as long as they are not breaking any laws. But on the other hand vulnerable Australians, particularly children, need to be able to live in houses where the rent is paid, where there is food on the table and where they have all those other fundamental rights that any decent society would agree are part of a minimum standard. When the individual rights and the group expectations are competing with each other, the government must act to find the right balance. In these communities, income management will apply to vulnerable families and individuals, including parents referred by child protection authorities, people assessed by Centrelink as being vulnerable to financial crisis or at risk of homelessness and people who volunteer for income management. This bill also includes measures to support parents in their efforts to ensure that their children attend school. People may have their income support payment suspended if they fail to enrol their child in school or make every effort to ensure that they attend regularly. The government will provide social work and other support services to assist families. However, if they do not comply with the attendance plan or access the help available then their income support payments will be suspended. Once a person engages with the school or complies with the income attendance plan then payments will be reinstated-a bit of a carrot and a little bit of stick. In a former life, before going to the dark side and becoming a lawyer, I was a teacher for 11 years. I know the opportunities that come from education. When I see the schoolchildren who come to Canberra to have a look at democracy in progress, I think of those remote Indigenous communities that do not have these opportunities that education brings. So many people, on this side of the House particularly, have only received their opportunity in life through education. As I said at the start of this speech, it has been four years since Kevin Rudd delivered the apology to the stolen generation. It is just about four years since my first speech. In my first speech, I talked about a lot of friends from my home town of St George. I talked about a lot of my Indigenous friends theresome of them people who I played football with-who had died. In that four years, the list of people from my hometown-relatively young people like me-who have died has got longer and longer, with people like Jockey Weatherall and Cecil Long dying. Jockey Weatherall died only last week. Cecil Long is part of the Long story of family tragedy, being the third of three brothers who I knew and played football with who have died. Obviously, much has to be done in the Northern Territory. Much has to be done around Australia. Much has to be done by this government to ensure that we get the balance right. It is a balancing act. It is tough. There are tough decisions for government to make and we are balancing those against tough personal decisions. People make individual decisions as to how they are going to act in their communities, but obviously government needs to get the settings right. I commend the bills to the House.",33
16,Dr STONE,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. These three bills are very important when it comes to support and well-being for both Indigenous and other disadvantaged groups, individuals and families across Australia. The three bills are all important bills that the coalition supports, although with some amendments. The first bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security Administrative Act 1999. It enables income management to be triggered by referrals from state and territory agencies. It also enables a minister to specify states, territories or areas in which the vulnerable long-term welfare payment and disengaged youth management measures will apply. It allows for continuing income management if there is a change in residence, so people will not be able to up and move to escape the measures that are meant to help them. It also gives the authority to permit a school attendance plan to be entered into with parents that may lead to the suspension of income support payments if the plan is not complied with. This sounds a very punitive measure but it is an important one and gives us a full set of tools to help young children have continuing and ongoing good quality education. However, no amount of education or attendance at school is going to help if that school has poor teaching or poor infrastructure or teachers at the school do not teach the children in a language that they can understand. I am very pleased to be part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which is currently looking at how we can make sure young Indigenous children can, when they attend school for the first time, learn in a traditional language or in Kriol. These children must be taught in an English as a second language environment so that they can also become fully competent in English. The second bill comprises three measures tackling alcohol abuse, land reform measures and food security measures. The third bill repeals the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 and makes amendments to relevant acts. It also makes amendments to existing principle legislation as part of the government's Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory program. I want to particularly focus on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. It enables targeted, place based income management. In determining how best to proceed with this bill, there were five locations chosen from around Australia where disadvantaged communities would trial a project that had a number of aspects and facets. One of those areas that have that pilot is the City of Greater Shepparton, which is a key part of my electorate in Murray. I have participated in the early planning for the trial introduction of Better Futures, Local Solutions: Place-based income management. I was concerned at the beginning, and I continue to be concerned, about how we are going to get an excellent outcome out of quarantining the welfare of some of our most disadvantaged individuals and young families. We are going to see this income management applying to vulnerable families and individuals from 1 July 2012. It will apply to parents referred for income management by the state child protection authorities. It will apply to people assessed by Centrelink social workers as being financially vulnerable-which could include people referred by housing authorities because they cannot pay their rent and they are in danger of becoming homeless-and it will apply to people who volunteer for income management. Income management can quarantine up to 70 per cent of their welfare payments. Clearly, this situation require those individuals and families to have a very strong sense or understanding of financial management and how to manage on a very tiny cash budget when previously they had a larger welfare payment to spend. This schedule makes minor legislative changes to allow these child protection vulnerable welfare payment recipient and voluntary income management measures to apply to these new populations. Why am I worried about these new measures in my city of Greater Shepparton? Greater Shepparton consists not only of the larger metropolitan area of Shepparton-Mooroopna but also of very tiny towns like Toolamba, Tatura, Dookie and others. For a start, we do not seem to have any real incentives built into the program to encourage teenage parents into education or training. For example, if you are a young parent-and I am talking about very young parents in some instances-with a young child, we are almost bereft of public transport in places like Toolamba, Tatura and Dookie. How do those young parents, who have to suddenly learn how to manage what is left of their welfare payments very differently, get to training when there is no public transport and no child care? Unfortunately, since this government has ceased to fund the occasional childcare program Take a Break, we do not have places for children whose mothers-it will typically be the mothersmust take some time to train at the Goulbourn Ovens TAFE, which is in Shepparton and is a 20or 40-minute drive away from where they live, usually in very cheap accommodation. That cheap accommodation is usually a very long way from public transport or from child care. There is no suggestion anywhere that those particular problems are being taken into account. There is also a lot of duplication. We will already have the state government program Best Start, which supports children from birth to eight years old. The Best Start program seems to be okay and seems to have all the elements that are desired, yet now we are going to have this government's Communities for Children, which is for the cohort of birth to 12 years of age. How are these two programs going to be coordinated? Are they simply going to compete for the kids or compete for the funding that is around? It seems absurd to me. I am also very worried about what happens if a young person cannot get to their classes as part of complying with their welfare quarantining. Are there no sanctions at all? When I ask these questions locally I am told, 'Well, I am sure there will be some way to manage that when the time comes.' The time is coming very quickly and we need to sort this out very fast indeed. There is also a very great difference between quarantining someone's welfare and giving them a BasicsCard to go to the one store in their town or community. In a very remote community you have only one place to go to buy your food, but in a place like Shepparton-Mooroopna there are literally scores of food-selling outlets. They range from big supermarkets, to supermarkets, to farmers markets where a lot of our local people now go. These farmers markets, where they can buy the cheapest, freshest food for cash, are only on weekends or every second weekend or so. Are these welfare quarantined individuals with their BasicsCard going to be able to take advantage of these farmers markets and buy fresh produce cheaply? Will they somehow be able to negotiate with the stallholder in advance and said, 'Look, I've got this piece of plastic from the Commonwealth; will you honour it?' This is a problem. I have been asking the coordinators at Centrelink how they are going to handle this. What have they planned and what are they doing, given that the commencement of this project is fast approaching? They tell me: 'Well, someone else is working on that. We think it will be okay, but of course this is new territory and we cannot be sure. We do not know how many stores are going to cooperate yet. We just think it will all be okay in the end.' very concerned about our young teenage parents with this BasicsCard. How are they going to manage the business of getting good value for money? I do not want them to be stigmatised either when they queue up in the checkout line with their BasicsCard, which will soon become known for what it really is and what it implies. I am also concerned about the planning and the very strong possibility of duplication. We have layer upon layer of advisory committees, reference panels and the like associated with this project in the City of Greater Shepparton. I am aware of at least three layers of advisory panels and NGOs who are already getting together, supplemented by new players. There are so many of these layers and they are so complex that there is now to be a very well paid facilitator-a coordinator-of these layers of advice and panels so that Centrelink small can move forward with this program. I would rather that very well paid facilitator was directly engaged with assisting the young people who will be seeing their welfare quarantined than supporting a brandnew bureaucratic structure of the same old people attending the same sorts of places and going through the same stale agendas month after month, talking to each other as they do at so many other venues. I wish that we could cut through all of that and focus very much on the individuals on the ground with something that is really going to work for them. Let me move on to talk about the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. Much of these bills is focused on alcohol abuse and the incredible destruction that alcohol makes happen in small and large communities of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Existing alcohol protections will be I am preserved in alcohol protected areas, with additional provisions that enable the geographic areas covered by these measures to evolve or change over time according to the needs of local people.",43
17,The SPEAKER,BILLS,"Order! It being 1.45, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, and the honourable member will have the opportunity of continuing her remarks. NA World War II Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:45): I wish to congratulate the member for Solomon, who continues to promote the interests of her constituents and the city of Darwin. The weekend of 11 and 12 February saw the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin in 1942. However, following the member for Solomon's motion which was unanimously passed by this House last November, this event is now recognised as a national day of significance. I was pleased to join the member for Solomon and other colleagues at the commemorative service, and I congratulate the Mayor of Darwin, Graeme Sawyer, and the hundreds of volunteers who organised such an impressive event. Not many people are aware that the Japanese dropped more bombs on the city of Darwin than they did in their attack on Pearl Harbor. Tragically, more than 250 people were killed and many more were injured. Darwin made a vital contribution to the defence of Australia during World War II. I congratulate all those involved in raising awareness of this significant day. Giblin, Mr Royce",46
18,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Royce Giblin, along with his playing partner, Peter Gibson, on their recent victory in the Riverside veterans four-ball best ball stableford golf tournament, in February. Royce has been a beacon of the Launceston community for many years. He ended his 35year career in the police working as a senior constable in Launceston, ignoring overtures for further promotions in order to remain as a hands-on police officer in the community. Since his retirement, Royce has taken on the role of assisting with the rehabilitation of a local man who was involved in a car accident and unfortunately now has a disability. Royce takes him to golf and really assists him. This shows that Royce's thirst for helping out in the community is still as strong as ever. This community mindedness can also be found in Royce's family, with his son Phil and daughter-in-law Raelene both becoming life members of Launceston Football Club. Raelene was also named AFL volunteer of the year. I would like to thank Royce and his family for the hard work they do in my wonderful community of Bass. I once again congratulate Royce on his recent win and wish him many more happy hours on the golf course. (Time expired) South West Sydney Community Alliance Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:48): I find myself compelled to draw the attention of the House to my disappointment in some comments made by an elected Labor councillor on the Liverpool City Council, who is also a former Greens candidate. The councillor has used the website of the South West Sydney Community Alliance, a website that in its current form is being used to campaign against the construction of two giant intermodal rail freight terminals in Moorebank. The website's domain, I understand, is owned by this councillor. He has used this website as a platform for extremist statements. I completely disassociate myself from the extremist statements and completely condemn the councillor concerned for making them. It is very concerning that Liverpool City Council have used ratepayers' funds to pay for posters and bumper stickers advertising this site, unaware it has been used to express these deranged conspiracy theories. Further, such extremist statements not only are irrelevant to the fight against the intermodal terminals but are counterproductive and undermine our cause. They are not befitting of a person holding an elected office in Australia. I hope that others involved in highlighting the folly of building two giant intermodal freight rail hubs in the middle of a residential area also condemn and distance themselves from these statements. Nonetheless, I will continue the fight against the intermodal terminals being built in this inappropriate location and I do so using logic, reason and scientific not irrelevant extremist statements. (Time expired) Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre",46
19,Mr NEUMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Friday I had the privilege of attending the Business Health Check two-day seminar run by the Business Enterprise Centre Ipswich Region in my electorate. I often say that, after the funding I secured for the upgraded Ipswich Motorway, the funding I secured in the 2007 election for the Ipswich Region Business Enterprise Centre is the most important finding for my community that I have secured. The $1.2 million we provided plus the extra $100,000 we provided for the small business advisory service have enabled hundreds and hundreds of businesses in Ipswich, Somerset and the western corridor to get assistance. From Goodna to Grandchester to Grantham, the Ipswich Region Business Enterprise Centre has provided assistance to flood-affected businesses, small communities, agribusinesses and farmers in the whole of the Ipswich and West Moreton region. I thank Tony Axford for the work they have done. It is great that they have also initiated the Indigenous business enterprise centre to assist our Indigenous brothers and sisters with business advice, mentoring, counselling and help. It is great that the Ipswich Region Business Enterprise Centre has been so forthcoming for and so committed to small business. Small business is the engine of my community. Five million Australians work in small business, and I worked in small business before I was elected in 2007. I know how important it is and I congratulate the BEC Ipswich Region for their wonderful work. Macedonia",47
20,Mr SIMPKINS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On will Wednesday, the parliament will be graced by facts, the presence of a delegation from the Republic of Macedonia. It is a great opportunity for Macedonian people from the electorate of Cowan and from many electorates across the country to welcome these representatives of the Macedonian parliament. The President of the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, His Excellency Mr Trajko Veljanoski, will be here. Accompanying him will be the MPs Mr Ilija Dimovski; Mr Milorad Dodevski; Mr Djevat Ademi; Mrs Cvetanka Ivanova; Mr Marjan Madjovski, Head of the Cabinet of the President; and Mr Ivan Cvetanovski, Associate on Support of the Activities of the President. It is, as I said before, a great opportunity for the Macedonian people within Australia. They have made a fabulous contribution, particularly within the electorate of Cowan. I have in excess of 1,000 Macedonians in my electorate and I am very keen to see the issues that concern them and the issues of concern to Macedonian people across the whole country raised in this parliament. It is a great opportunity with this delegation coming through on Wednesday. Blair Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program",47
21,Mr NEUMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Friday I also had the privilege of attending the Marburg State School. In my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland we have received $105 million for 64 local schools under Building the Education Revolution. In fact, many of those schools received benefit in such a way that they assisted the flood evacuation recovery. For instance, at places like Fernvale and Esk the halls acted as the flood evacuation centres for local communities. Without the building of those halls there would have been simply nowhere for local communities to go to as they had to rush away from flooding waters. For example, the Redbank Creek in Esk broke the banks and went through the township. In Fernvale the Brisbane River did likewise. But it is small country schools that have benefited so much, including Prenzlau State School, with $300,000. It was great to be there with Terry Hermann. The road off the Warrego Highway to Prenzlau State School is named after the Hermann family. The school was built in 1894. The new library will help the couple of dozen kids who go to that school. It is a farming community that has been settled there for many years. Terry said his great-grandfather would have loved to have been there but his grandfather attended the school. It is great that he could be there and provide assistance and it is for local school community. (Time expired) Student Services and Amenities Fee",48
22,Dr SOUTHCOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week represented orientation week for university students around Australia. I had the opportunity to go to Flinders University in the electorate of Boothby and attend orientation week there. While I was there I met with a number of students from Flinders University who are beginning their courses or continuing their courses. One of the things that came up commonly was a massive concern from students who are already struggling with budgets, with what they have to pay in rent and for their studies, about Labor's new tax of a student services and amenities fee. This is a fee of $263 per year. Universities have had the choice of whether or not to apply it, but this came up as a topic which students were very concerned about. What we see is the Labor Party increasing the pressure on the cost of living for all Australians. It is not just families who are feeling the impact through rising electricity prices, rising energy costs and the carbon tax to come later this year; also university students are feeling the pinch as the Labor Party have now put another tax on students: their student services and amenities fee of $263 a year. It was a great opportunity to be up at Flinders University. I also was able to have a tour of Flinders University Hall as well. Lyons Electorate: Agriculture",48
23,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise in this Year of the Farmer to thank the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig; the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Sid Sidebottom, the member for Braddon; and the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, great Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Dick Adams, the member for Lyons, who came into my electorate last week and visited the north-east region. This is an area of prime farmland with numerous dairying and cropping opportunities. The group toured the north-east and visited the Headquarters Dam, which has recently been finished, the Razz rhubarb farm and the Bridgestowe lavender farm. This is an area of great potential for Tasmania, largely due to four irrigation schemes that are being worked on in the area. One, the Headquarters Dam, is already finished and another is to be completed soon. The topic of discussion was the Scottsdale DSTO. There are four firms that have been shortlisted for that wonderful project and they, along with the CSIRO and the University of Tasmania, are working out how they can add value to the products of the north-east. I was particularly impressed by Jarrod Nichols, a real innovator in farming who provides rhubarb for the major supermarkets and who is a fantastic innovator in farming in the north-east of Tasmania. (Time expired)",48
24,Dr STONE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Everybody knows, particularly in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, that non-strategic water buyback is a killer. It makes our irrigation systems less efficient. It distorts the price water in the irrigators market. It drives money back to the banks, that is for sure-it is all about retiring debt. So we were pleased when the minister for water, Tony Burke, some little while ago said: 'I understand this. I'm going to put a moratorium on any further government tenders.' We were shocked therefore a few days ago to find that these tenders are back on the shelf-they are back in business. We are going to see the tenders of this government rolled out with our drought stressed, debt stressed irrigators now once again pushed by their bank lenders to put their water up for sale. When you sell your water you sell your productivity. When you sell your water you make your neighbours have to pay a lot more for their irrigation services because your irrigation system is less efficient. It is called the Swiss cheese effect. Minister Tony Burke heard about that right across the basin. His Murray-Darling Basin Authority chair and its committee understand this very well. The Tony Windsor led regional standing committee came out with, as a No. 1 policy recommendation, no more non-strategic buybacks. So why have we got this government reneging completely on the promises it made just months ago, putting a tender back into the system, putting enormous pressure back on our irrigation farmers, who cannot go on producing food like they should?

25,Mr MATHESON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS, I would like to congratulate some very Water talented athletes in Macarthur for their recent success representing my electorate at both the state and national levels. I recently recommended these athletes to the Australian Sports Commission to receive some funding for and I am pleased to say that they were all very successful. These athletes included Nicole Sandrone from Cobbitty for the jumping equitation championships; Shannon Huntly-Wei from St Helens Park for the national handball championships; Kurt Hacking-Gadsby from Campbelltown for the national trampoline championships; Lana Rogers from Harrington Park for the Australian surf lifesaving championships; Mitchell Dawson from Narellan Vale for the men's Australian gymnastics championships; Katelyn Mills from Mt Annan for the women's artistic gymnastics championships; Joshua Ashkar from Mt Annan for the Australian school swimming championships; Nickaela Malby from Douglas Park for the New South Wales showjumping championships; Anna Laman from Kentlyn for the Australian athletics and cross-country championships; Corey Rowland from Camden South for the Australian schools hockey championships; Taylor Thomson from Woodbine for the Australian hockey championships; Christopher Sandrone from Cobbitty for the New South Wales open go-karting titles; and the Junior Rhythmic Group for rhythmic gymnastics.,49

28,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that one-third of her parliamentary colleagues and a quarter of her cabinet colleagues have today expressed their lack of confidence in her, how can she claim to have a mandate to continue as Prime Minister?",50
29,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I always give him full marks for audacity, if not consistency. He comes into this parliament having survived his leadership issues by one vote. It is no wonder the Leader of the Opposition got some new suits after he became Leader of the Opposition. The rest of them were covered with blood!",50
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question.,50
31,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me be very clear with the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian people about the circumstances of today. As I have just explained to the Australian people, we met this morning and I have the overwhelming support of my colleagues. As a united team, we will be there providing the government this nation needs. We will be ensuring that we are managing the economy today in the interests of working people while we build the economy they will need tomorrow, so that they will have opportunities and prospects for themselves and for their children. At the same time, we will be providing the benefits that working families need. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, we will not be cowering in the face of the challenges of the future. We will be addressing those challenges and building a clean energy future, ensuring that we share the proceeds of the mining boom. To the Leader of the Opposition, who comes into this place to talk about trust and confidence, I say this. Australians can trust me to get the job done and they can have the confidence that, in the hardest of circumstances, I will win through in their interests, no matter how relentlessly negative the Leader of the Opposition is.",50
32,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister claim to be leading a united team when the former Prime Minister and the former foreign minister said that the Prime Minister had 'lost the trust of the Australian people' and 31 of her caucus colleagues backed the former Prime Minister?",50
33,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he comes into this parliament with half of his colleagues not supporting his leadership-they would have preferred Malcolm Turnbull.

38,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the Leader of the Opposition and to his colleagues I say this. I anticipate today that in question time the Leader of the Opposition will be focused on the Labor Party. I can assure him of this: we are focused on the nation's future. The Leader of the Opposition will never come in and ask a question about that because he has no policies, no plan, just negativity as his offering to the Australian people about the nation's future. We will stay on task. We are impatient to keep governing and making the decisions that this nation needs so that it has the future it deserves. Gillard Government",51
39,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. How will the government continue to get the things done that the nation needs for the future?,51
40,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that she is determined that for the community she serves in this parliament she provides the benefits they need today but she also is shaping the future that they will live tomorrow. I am not surprised that whenever the word 'future' is used in this parliament we job. have uproar and laughter from those opposite because they have nothing to say about the nation's future. Unlike the opposition, the approach we take is that there is not a day to lose to build the future this nation needs; there is not a day to lose to build a future in which we fairly share the benefits of the mining boom and this becomes a boom for the many, not for the few; there is not a day to waste to make sure we make the right decisions now so we have the economy we will need in the future, a clean energy economy, a high-skill economy, a high-wage economy, offering people the benefits of jobs and then a better job and then the opportunity to start their own small business if they choose to do so. Here we see that there is not a day to waste to keep improving Australia's schools. They do not want the Leader of the Opposition's cutbacks; they want a continuation of a reform agenda that will get their children a better education. There is not a day to waste in continuing to roll out our health reforms, which will mean that there will be more doctors, more nurses and more ability for people to see a doctor in an emergency department, on time, or to get their elective surgery when they need it. There is not a day to waste to make sure that our nation is not at a standstill whilst the rest of the world moves on. We live in a remarkable age of opportunity as the global economy changes and as our regional economy changes, and there is not a day to waste as we go about seizing the benefits of those changes. That is what we are determined to do. As a Labor government, whilst we build that prosperity we are determined to look after those who need our care the most, particularly Australians with disabilities through the building of a national disability insurance scheme. There is not a day to waste and we are getting on with that NA The SPEAKER (14:07): I would like to advise that the Federation Guard are at question time. I am told they are not in uniform but they are wearing brown shirts. On behalf of all honourable members. I would like to acknowledge their presence and thank them for the work they do on behalf of our nation. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Gillard Government Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:08): Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of this statement by the member for Griffith: It wasn't K. Rudd who made a pre-election commitment on a carbon tax. It wasn't K. Rudd who made a particular commitment to Mr Wilkie on the question of poker machines. It wasn't Rudd who had anything to do with the East Timor Solution or the Malaysia Solution. Isn't the member for Griffith right that, far from being the cause of a good government going bad, he is in fact a whistleblower on a bad government getting worse?",51
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the Prime Minister, I would like to point out that standing order 98(c) provides that a minister can only be questioned about matters of public affairs, administration or proceedings pending in the House, being matters for which the minister is responsible or with which the minister is officially connected. The practice of the House is that questions about political party leadership per se, about the statements and actions of the party members, officials and backbench members and about party meetings and processes have been ruled out of order. I direct members to House of Representatives Practice pages 538 and 539. There would be questions to the Prime Minister about the leadership and government as it effects its operations that would be in order. The Prime Minister could be questioned about the work of ministers in her administration and of cabinet, and ministers can be questioned about their work and their administration. As Speaker. I have no desire at all to restrict members in their ability to hold the government to account, but I am obliged to ensure that they do so in a way that is consistent with the standing orders and the practice of the House. I would counsel all honourable members to observe my remarks.",52
42,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Deputy Leader of the Opposition raises carbon pricing. Yes, I am in favour of putting a price on carbon and we achieved it last year against the opposition of those shouting out now. It is a bit interesting that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition K. asked this question, because she was in favour of pricing carbon until she decided that instead of being deputy leader to Malcolm Turnbull she would be deputy leader to the current Leader of the Opposition. She was in favour of pricing carbon until the minute she was against it. Let the record show the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a track record of working alongside the member for Wentworth in support of a price on carbon. This question is motivated by pure hypocrisy. On the question of problem gambling and making arrangements so that people are less likely to lose money that they cannot afford to lose and less likely to jeopardise their family's future, we faced a circumstance in which, because of the opposition of those who now seek to ask this question, there was not the support in this parliament for the scheme Mr Wilkie would have preferred. So instead we are bringing to the parliament the biggest package of reforms to address problem gambling the nation has ever seen. It remains to be whether or not the opposition will vote in favour of it or against it. On the question of asylum seekers, heavens above, the opposition were all in favour of stopping the boats until they decided their political interests meant there should be more boats. If the opposition ever decides to put the national interest in front their political interests, just let us know. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:12): Mr Speaker, my supplementary question is to the Prime Minister and arises from her answer to my previous question. I remind the Prime Minister of her statement that, 'The 2010 election was sabotaged.' Is the Prime Minister claiming that all the faults of this government can be attributed destabilisation by the member for Griffith and none to her own lack of judgment?",52
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The supplementary question is ruled out of order.  order: firstly, the Prime Minister is responsible for her own statements and, secondly, she is responsible for the conduct of her government. This goes directly to the attributing of blame for failures that have occurred under her government. Therefore she is responsible for answering the question.",53
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Sturt will resume his seat. I call the honourable member for MCEwen. Employment,53
45,Mr MITCHELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Treasurer. How has the government supported Australian jobs and delivered economic growth? How will it keep delivering for working people into the future?",53
46,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for MCEwen for that very important question. The reason so many of us on this side of the House went into public life in the first place is because we respect the dignity of work. We understand the importance of jobs-not just the number of jobs but the quality of jobs, the pay and working conditions that go with jobs and how of important they are to the peace of mind of working families right around this country. We understood at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession how important policies were to support economic growth and jobs. That is why in this country over the past four years 700,000-plus jobs have been created whilst around the world unemployment is at eight per cent and nine per cent. So the creation of jobs and support to for economic growth go right to the core of this government's economic agenda. We now have low unemployment. We have a huge pipeline of investment. Unemployment is at 5.1 per cent. We have an economy which has grown by seven per cent since the start of the global financial crisis, whereas around the world economies have not got back to where they were. The legacy of that for them is double-digit unemployment, with whole sections of communities simply destroyed by massive unemployment and business closures. On this side of the House, we understand that jobs must be our No.1 priority to support economic growth and to meet the challenges which are posed by growth in our region. We also understand that there are patchwork areas of our economy where people are doing it tough. That is why we must put in place a range of policies which will support growth right across our region, particularly in small business. That is why we want to use the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax to give a very big tax cut to 2.7 million small businesses right across our country to keep their doors open and to support employment-it is simply stunning that those opposite are opposing that tax cut for small business. It is why we want to invest in skills-$3 billion. It is why we are investing in infrastructure, particularly the NBN. It is why we are putting a price on carbon. Fundamentally, it is why we want to bring the budget back into surplus in 201213. Strict fiscal policy is the key to supporting employment. I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that he was committed to reducing expenditure. He has a $70 billion hole in his budget bottom line and he had the hide before question time to go before the journalists of Australia and somehow pretend that he was going to reduce public expenditure-with a $70 billion hole in his budget bottom line. We are committed to jobs. We are committed to strict fiscal management. We are committed to investing in the future. Member for Griffith  Opposition Business) (14:16): My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her statement: Kevin Rudd … always had very difficult and chaotic work patterns.",53
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will refer to the member for Griffith by his title.  member for Griffith: … always had very difficult and very chaotic future. work patternshis leadership was paralysed and chaotic, and he was always looking for the next picture opportunity. Why did the Prime Minister appoint the member for Griffith as Minister for Foreign Affairs if she held that view of him?",54
48,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The member for Griffith has served this nation as Minister for Foreign Affairs with distinction, following many of the initiatives in foreign policy that he entered into for this nation when Prime Minister. Amongst those major achievements include the creation of the G20-because of how important it was for our nation to be at the top table when the world came together to manage the global financial crisis-and include the work he did to see the creation of the East Asia Summit, so that we have in the one body all the right players around the one table that has a broad mandate, and enables us within our region to talk about security questions, political and strategic questions, as well as economic matters. These are important developments. Of course, as Minister for Foreign Affairs he has been advocating around the world our claim to be on the United Nations Security Council. He has also been centrally involved in events arising from what has happened in Egypt, Libya and Syria, as the world has come together both to make its voice heard of on those events and to provide practical support. That answers the member's question. He has served with distinction as foreign minister. In all of that time, as he so very served, of course the only thing that the opposition ever questioned him about in this parliament was when they were looking for cheap political advantage rather than engaging in the serious questions of foreign policy that are so important to our nation's  Opposition Business) (14:19): Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. If the Prime Minister thinks the minister is so good",54
49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! ,54
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable for Sturt does not have the call. As I indicated, during this trial period there could be two supplementary questions. If a proposed supplementary question is ruled out of order, you do not get another shot. If this trial works, I am disposed to expanding the number of supplementary questions, but we are during the trial period. Infrastructure Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (14:19): question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister outline how the government's record infrastructure investment is building the Australian economy and how will the government's long-term reform continue to build the nation for the future?",54
51,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:20): I thank very much the member for Petrie for her question. In recent weeks, I have yet again been in her electorate looking at the Moreton Bay rail link-an important infrastructure proposal which we are delivering in her seat. When we came to office, we inherited an infrastructure deficit. More than 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia said that a failure to invest in infrastructure and skills was holding back our economic capacity. We set about addressing it. That was the case even though those opposite, when in government, had a $334 billion windfall in the budget in terms of additional receipts from what was anticipated in the budget papers. We set about getting the policy framework right through establishing Infrastructure Australia. We then set about on the big investment decisions. We have doubled the roads budget. We have increased the rail budget by more than 10 times. We have committed more in urban public transport since 2007 than was invested by all previous governments from Federation right through to 2007. They are the commitments that we have made. But it has not just been in investment. We also understand that you have to get the regulatory environment right, which is why we have moved from 23 transport regulators down to three-single regulators in rail, heavy vehicle and maritime-providing a boost to the economy of $30 billion over 20 years. But there is much more to be done. We also have a plan, My and legislation will be introduced in coming weeks, to revitalise Australian shipping-an industry that is vital for our security, for our environment and for our economy. That industry was neglected and, indeed you can argue, consciously downtrodden by those opposite with a strategy to replace the Australian flag with flags of convenience on our coast, with all of the repercussions that that has. We on this side of the House will take action on these issues. We have also taken action on the issue of safe roads by making sure that those hard working truck drivers who keep the country going can drive safely without pressure being put on them. Those opposite are not even sure if they will say yes to that-a fundamental reform that is so important for the safety of all those who drive on our roads, not just truck drivers but all those who share the roads with them. We on this side of the House are determined to get the big issues right. We are determined to continue to advance the reform agenda that we have been putting in place since 2007 in spite of the relentless negativity of those opposite. Carbon Pricing Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (14:23): My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the finance minister right when she says the member for Griffith's suggestion of a review of the carbon tax could have a very negative effect, or is the resources minister right when he says: … there is a lot of concern in industry at the moment about the price we've locked in … whether we've locked in a price that's to our disadvantage as a nation.",55
52,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for her question. The government brought to this parliament legislation for carbon pricing at the right price in order to drive a transformation in our economy to a clean energy future. At that time, we understood the circumstances of industries that trade with the world and trade at a world price, which is why we have created a multi-billion dollar Jobs and Competitiveness Program to support those industries and to support those jobs. It should disappoint all Australians the opposition came into this parliament and not only voted against that, but they also voted against a $300 million support plan for the steel industry-that is, having gone round the country pretending that they are interested in blue-collar jobs, when it came to recording their vote in this parliament in favour of blue-collar jobs they refused to do so.",56
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the substance of the question.,56
54,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our carbon pricing legislation has got it right. Through that legislation we will continue to support jobs, particularly blue-collar jobs. We will implement that legislation alongside our other major programs and policies to support blue-collar jobs and to manufacturing. Unfortunately, the opposition has locked itself into cutting half a billion dollars out of that and then ending assistance to the car industry, putting at risk 46,000 blue-collar jobs. So I suggest to the member who asked this question she would be better off focusing her energy on working within her own political party to end this hypocrisy-they talk about blue-collar jobs but they never vote for them. Economic Competitiveness",56
55,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Industry and Innovation. The minister would be aware of the closure of Australia's biggest tomato farm, run by the Philip family, which saw the loss of 100 jobs, and of Coles's recent announcement that they will reduce the price of fruit and vegetables by 50 per cent. Australia is already a net importer of fruit and vegetables and within four years will be a net importer of all food. An estimated 150,000 small businesses and 100,000 farmers are under threat from Woolworths's that and Coles's 88 per cent market share compared to America's 23 per cent. Can the minister advise whether the government is going to act on this oligopoly, have another whitewash, or continue government as a spectator sport?",56
56,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Minister for Industry and Innovation) (14:26): I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I certainly understand the concerns that he has raised. The circumstances of the closure of the Philip family tomato farms are extremely unfortunate. The government will do all it can to help the employees who have been affected by it. Like the member for Kennedy, the support government, of course, has been following very closely for some time now the developments in our supermarket sector in Australia and the competitive issues that are there. The government is extremely aware of concerns about the behaviour of some of the major players in the retail sector. It is the role of the independent commission and consumer watchdog, the ACCC, to monitor and ensure a competitive market. The ACCC has appropriate powers to undertake that task and the Chairman of the ACCC has made clear in a number of statements that the ACCC is focusing on conduct by the supermarkets and has been urging players to give him the evidence he needs to take the issues forward. He has said the following about this issue: We've been urging suppliers to give us some evidence to take things forward (in a prosecution) but we've been having trouble getting that. Too many of them are scared. At the moment all we've got is third-party hearsay. He said the ACCC 'urged suppliers to talk with the ACCC about these issues'.",56
57,Mr Katter,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On a point of order: there are no breaches of the Trade Practices Act. I do not allege that. What I am saying is that they have got 88 per cent of the market. They do not have to breach the act. Mr Randall interjecting,57
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. I do not need the assistance of the member for Canning instructing me to clear the gallery.,57
59,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand the member for Kennedy's concerns about this issue. We have to allow the Chairman of the ACCC the opportunity to do his job. I am sure that if the Chairman of the ACCC believes that he and the ACCC need further powers to deal with some of these competition issues in relation to the retail sector, he will come forward to the government and indicate that that is the case. At a broader level in the economy, the government are taking a number of steps to try to alleviate the pressure on small businesses in particular. endeavouring to distribute the benefits of the resources boom to assist small business through two key things. One of them is to reduce company tax and the other is to introduce an instant asset write-off of up to $6,500 for as many assets as small businesses can purchase within a financial year. We are doing constructive things to support jobs and small business in this economy, and all of it is opposed by the coalition.",57
60,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. It is a structural issue. They have 88 per cent of the market. They are not in breach of the act. A lot of people would say they are, but I do not believe they are in breach of the act. Will the minister please say what he is doing about the fact that they have 88 per cent of the market? In America it is 23 per cent and they are squealing. (Time expired)",57
61,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:31): I thank the member for Kennedy for his continuing questions in relation to the issue, because it is extremely important. The government are completely mindful of the situation in the retail sector and the competition issues that exist. It is properly the domain of the ACCC to deal with this issue. The ACCC chairman is cognisant of the issue and has indicated that on the public record. Should he need further powers, the government are certain that he will come forward and indicate that that is the case, and we would properly consider such a submission. Employment",57
62,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. How is the We are government supporting Australian industry and jobs today and delivering for working people into the future?,57
63,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:32): I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I understand it is his birthday today, so I acknowledge that. On this side of the House, we manage the economy to benefit the working people of this country and to grow jobs. Labor governments know how best to manage the economy for jobs growth. Australia does have low unemployment at 5.1 per cent. Real wages in this country have continued to grow. By contrast, unemployment in the United States is above eight per cent and wage growth is stagnant. Our economic strength has been achieved while also delivering on Labor's values of fairness and equity. We removed Work Choices to improve fairness in Australian workplaces. We have introduced paid parental leave. We have doubled investment in school education. We have upgraded facilities at schools around the country. We have created 130,000 new training places. We are investing more than $36 billion in transport infrastructure projects around the country. This side of the parliament is making an historic investment in the National Broadband Network, which will drive productivity improvements, improve living standards and create new business opportunities for businesses all around the country. This side of the parliament understands the importance of introducing a carbon price so that we can separate our economic growth from growth in pollution. On this issue, anyone who argues that we as a nation can do nothing about climate change is betraying our future-our environmental future and our economic future. We are investing in the skills and training to give Australians a fair share of the mining boom. We are helping small business. Every single thing that the government is doing on the economy is opposed by the coalition. Falsehoods are constantly told. Let us not forget that not many months ago the Leader of the Opposition claimed the coal industry would be destroyed by a carbon price",57
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will become directly relevant or will resume his seat. The minister has the call but he must be directly relevant to the question before the chamber.,58
65,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is directly relevant because it is about jobs and industry. The fact of the matter is that, since the real government introduced our carbon price plans and legislated our clean energy package, almost $20 billion of investment has been announced in the coal industry, and the Leader of the Opposition said the industry would be destroyed. There are falsehoods told. On this side of the parliament, we are managing the economy for the working people of this country. (Time expired)",58
66,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Can the minister explain how the government will support thousands of workers at Holden's Elizabeth plant?",58
67,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:35): This is an extremely important issue, so I thank the member for Wakefield for his supplementary question. Here again the government is managing the government to support jobs, and the motor-vehiclemanufacturing sector of this country is extremely important to our economy. Take, for example, the fact that 15 per cent of the research and development expenditure in our manufacturing sector is in the car industry alone. The car industry directly employs 46,000 people; another 200,000-odd people indirectly depend upon the industry. It is extremely important that that industry, which is at the high-value-added end of our manufacturing, achieves government support. On the other side of parliament we have the contrary story. The opposition would take",58

69,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of the revelation by the former foreign minister that: … decisions which were taken, in my absence often, and then announced and implemented, often without my knowledge, in the case of various decisions like the Malaysia solution for example, and then off they went only to discover they didn't work. Will the Prime Minister now end the denial and end the chaos on our borders that the failure of cabinet to work together has helped to create by unreservedly restoring the proven border protection policies of the coalition that her government abolished?",59
70,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member, who knows a great deal about this: I ask why it is that, if he is genuinely interested in dealing with border security and stopping the boats, as he claims, when the government made a good faith offer to implement the solution that the opposition says was its preferred solutionthat is, a detention centre on Nauru-and when the government made a good faith offer to do that in parallel with implementing our arrangement with Malaysia, the opposition instead decided that it would prefer to see more boats? The reason for that is absolutely clear. The opposition has taken a calculated, cynical decision that it is in its political interests to see more boats, no matter what the risks to human lives and safety. Mr Ewen Jones interjecting",59
71,Mr Speaker,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I fail to see how smearing the opposition could be directly relevant to the question that she was asked.,59
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will be directly relevant.,59
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was very directly asked about implementing the policies of the opposition, and I am being very directly relevant to that. We entered into a good faith set of discussions to come to an understanding across this parliament on an issue of importance to the nation. Mr Ewen Jones interjecting",59
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Herbert will remove himself under the provisions of standing order 94(a). The member for Herbert then left the chamber.,59
75,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition walked away because it decided it would rather see more boats and more risks to lives than work with the government towards a solution. I say to the member who asked the question: as he well knows, the stated policy of the opposition now about turning back boats is one that was not implemented by the Howard government in its later years and is one that would put at risk the lives of men and women who work in our Australian Defence Force-people who have committed their lives to serving our nation. It would put their lives at risk. I say to the member who asked the question, and I say it very proudly indeed: we will never join with the opposition in risking the lives of ADF personnel with such a policy. We will never do that. In answer to the member's question: we will never do what you ask. We will never risk those lives in the way that you want to for your cheap politics. Economy",59
76,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. How is the government supporting working people by delivering economic policies that invest in their future?,60
77,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:40): I thank the member for Blair for his question. He is interested in the future for his constituents Ipswich. He knows the courtesy of a Labor government: 43½ thousand of his voters who are working at the moment will get an increase in superannuation. He also knows that economic change in Australia is inevitable. Unlike the flat earth society opposite, we do not argue that change can never happen. We do not mislead the Australian electorate and say to people, 'You don't have to change; you can stay as you are.' What he also knows is that only the Labor government are the people who are committed to helping people get through change. We are doing it in three ways. We are doing it through making sure people have jobs and fair conditions at work, we are doing it by making sure that we can help families make ends meet and we are also doing it by ensuring a good future for people in the areas of both social justice and their retirement. In terms of ensuring fairness, our credentials are second to none, because we repealed Work Choices and got the Fair Work Act. We stand for having modern awards and ensuring that whilst business can prosper people do not get ripped off in the workplace. In terms of jobs our credentials are, again, out there. Whilst this year will be a difficult year for employment in Australia as we weather the economic storms of Europe, there is no doubt that our unemployment numbers, most recently at 5.1 per cent, are the envy of the Western world. How did the opposition react when we heard that good economic news? They had that spanked-bottom look on their faces! We talk about skills. We are the government that is spending more on skills than any other government ever before. It is on our watch that we have seen more apprentices being trained and more people getting the training they need so they can in adjust and find new jobs as the new economy rises. We are also helping families make ends meet. That is why we want to make sure that the corporate tax rate is reduced from 30 per cent to 29 per cent. That is why, on 1 July this year, as the carbon price is introduced, we will see the tax-free threshold go up to $18,000. Who would have believed it was possible to lift the threshold that high? Only a Labor government believes that. That is what we have managed to accomplish. I also said that we are helping people into the future by making sure that we have a fair raft of social justice measures. That is how we help deliver a strong economy, by making sure no-one gets left behind. Only one political party in Australia is supporting an increase in superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Only one side of Australian politics is abolishing the 15 per cent tax paid on superannuation under $37,000 and only one party in Australia is fair dinkum about the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Gillard Government",60
78,Mr CHRISTENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her written agreement with the member for Denison that underpinned her ability to form a minority government last year, her pledge before the 2010 election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and her agreement with the member for Griffith not to challenge him, the night before he was dumped as leader-all of which were broken. I ask the Prime Minister: is there any promise you are not prepared to break?",60

81,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," A little bit earlier in question time. I said that what the opposition would do today is concentrate on the Labor Party and what we would do is concentrate on the nation's future. So I say to the member who asked this question that he clearly has no interest at all in tackling climate change or seizing a clean energy future for our country. He is prepared to back the Leader of the Opposition as they wander around the nation on the one hand saying, 'Let's stand still; let's do nothing,' and then on the other hand saying, 'Let's have our own scheme and charge each family $1,300 for the scheme we have designed, which we know will not work.' Whereas the truth-and everybody in this parliament actually knows it-is that they will neverMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I request that the Prime Minister be directly relevant in answering her question. The question was: are there any promises that she will not break?",61
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume her seat. The Prime Minister will focus on the specifics of the question asked by the honourable member for Dawson. The Prime Minister has the call.,61
83,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There were three policy issues raised in the question. I know, of course, that the opposition has got no interest in policies, no interest in the nation's future-just says no to everything. But when I am asked about three policies I am going to answer on the three policies. Unlike the opposition, we are focused on the nation's future. Unlike the opposition, we will not wander around pretending that it is good enough to stand still. We will not wander around pretending that there is a way of addressing climate change efficiently that does not involve putting a price on carbonthat is, we will be clear and accurate with the Australian people, the way the member for Wentworth was when he was Leader of the Opposition, the way former Prime Minister John Howard was when he took an emissions trading scheme to the 2007 election. The member also asks about other policy questions. If he wants to address problem gambling then he will vote with the government on the biggest package of reforms ever to be brought to this nation's parliament to address problem gambling. If he genuinely cares, if this is anything other than cheap politics, then he will be honour bound to do that having raised the issue. More generally, I say this to those members opposite as they continue their negativity, their denial of the nation's needs and of building the nation's future. Whilst they stay stuck in that cheap negativity we will be getting on with the job: not a day to lose to build the prosperous future that our nation wants; not a day to lose to make sure that children have the best education, that we have the best health care, that we have a national disability insurance scheme; and not a day to lose as we address the pressing challenges as our economy restructures, as our regional economy restructures. We understand that those opposite will carp and whinge and moan and say no. We will just get on with the job.",61

89,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS," I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediatelyThat the Prime Minister explain to the House the extraordinary public revelations of the dysfunction, division and chaos at the centre this government over the last 18 months will with today's bloodletting. Further, how the government will now address the real problems facing the Australian people, namely: (1) cost of living pressures exacerbated by the carbon tax; (2) the border protection chaos caused by the government ending policies that worked; and (3) pressure on jobs that government policies are just making worse. Mr Speaker, standing orders must be suspended because it is absolutely crystal clear to the Australian people that we have a divided, dishonest and incompetent government. Today, one-third of the caucus and one-quarter of the cabinet agreed with the coalition's assessment of this government. We all know that the Prime Minister and her backers are saying that, somehow, the result today was good news for the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister claim to have the confidence of this House when 31 members of the caucus voted for someone whom the member for Bendigo last week called a psychopath? How can that be good news for this Prime Minister? This is why standing orders must be suspended. Fundamentally, this Prime Minister has a trust problem, and that is the most important issue that should be before this House-the trust problem that this Prime Minister has, which was on display yet again just a half an hour before question time. We all know that last week the Prime Minister ferociously attacked the then foreign minister. She said: 'The government that Kevin Rudd had led had entered a period of paralysis. Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister always had very difficult and very chaotic work patterns. Government, by contrast, requires consistency, purpose, method, discipline, how inclusion, consultation, which the member for Griffith did not have.' So here we have, of last week, the Prime Minister's candid end assessment of the member for Griffith, and what does she say today? She says: 'We must honour his many achievements. Kevin Rudd led this nation through the global financial crisis. He delivered the apology to the stolen generations. He has been an amazing advocate of Australia's interest on the world stage, and he has made so many other remarkable achievements.' He has made so many other remarkable achievements, except that he was the greatest prima donna the Labor Party has ever known, because that is what she said last Thursday. Standing orders must be suspended because this Prime Minister has a trust problem and a truth problem. This Prime Minister cannot even maintain a consistent position from Thursday to Monday. That is the problem with this Prime Minister. She did not tell the truth to the former Prime Minister in June of last year, she did not the truth to the Australian people before the election about the carbon tax, she did not the truth to the member for Denison about poker machine changes and she cannot even tell the truth today. That is why standing orders must be suspended. That is the most important matter before this House. Over the years I have had a lot of disagreements with the member for Griffith, but he was right when he said last week that the Prime Minister 'has lost the trust of the Australian people'. But it is not just that Prime Minister has lost the trust of the Australian people-the Prime Minister has not delivered good government to the Australian people. Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, nailed that last week when he said: It wasn't K Rudd who made a pre-election commitment on a carbon tax. It wasn't K Rudd who made a particular commitment to Mr Wilkie on the question of poker machines. It wasn't K Rudd who had anything to do with the East Timor solution or the Malaysia solution. These were initiatives and decisions taken uniquely by prime minister. Standing orders must be suspended because this is a government with a fundamental problem identified by the former Prime Minister and the former foreign minister. There is the faceless men problem, there is the trust problem and there is the problem of a Prime Minister who has no core beliefs. Do not think that the faceless men are going to go away-oh no! We know what the faceless men are doing. They are at work today, and they will be at work in the future, because they just cannot help themselves. And that is not me speaking, that is the minister for resources-someone who has no confidence in this Prime Minister, someone who has no confidence in a government run by this Prime Minister and someone who has told the truth. I congratulate him for telling tell the truth, because there is a truth deficit disorder in the modern Labor Party and notell one suffers from that dreadful political syndrome more than this Prime Minister.

91,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"It is no secret that I am not the greatest admirer of the Australian Labor Party, but I pity a once great party that the has been brought low by such unworthy people. There was a party that once worked, in the immortal words of Ben Chifley, 'for the betterment of mankind'. What has it been reduced to? It has been reduced to a party that is simply a vehicle for the ego and the ambition of this unworthy Prime Minister. I say to the Australian people that we are so much better than this. I say to the Australian people that we can have better government. I say to the Australian people that better days are coming, because we are a the great country being let down by a seriously bad government. Nothing at all is going to change as a result of today's vote. We will still have the carbon tax, which will clobber the jobs and the standard of living of every Australian family. We will still have the appalling chaos on our borders created entirely by the decisions of this government and maintained by the extraordinary stubbornness of this Prime Minister, who does not have the decency or the humility to admit that there are policies that worked. And we will still have a Prime Minister who is far more focused on her job than she is on protecting the jobs of Australian people. Everything this Prime Minister said todayand this is why standing orders must be suspended-is about protecting her job. Everything that this Prime Minister has said or done in this House betrays the fact that this Prime Minister fundamentally lacks the magnanimity necessary to hold the great office of Prime Minister. There is a better way, but only the coalition can deliver to this country the stable government that it deserves. Only the coalition can give this country the hope, reward and opportunity that the Australian people need and deserve. Only the coalition can give us a strong economy because we will get government spending down and productivity up. If you get government spending down you take the pressure off interest rates and you allow taxes to be responsibly reduced. We will get productivity up because we are not run by faceless men-the same faceless men who dictate the policy of this government when it comes to workplace relations. Mr Byrne interjecting",63

I say to the member for Griffith that if he really does believe in people power then that is what he should want-an election. He should want an election because the prime ministership of this country should never again be the plaything of the faceless men; it should always be in the gift of the Australian people, and none but the Australian people should choose.

It is important that standing orders are suspended so that the Prime Minister can explain why she sent out her lieutenants to describe a former Prime Minister of this nation and a former foreign minister of this nation as 'a psychopath with a huge ego', as 'deeply flawed' and having 'great weaknesses', as someone 'disloyal to the labour movement', as a person 'whose behaviour became increasingly erratic' and as someone who 'showed contempt for cabinet, contempt for the parliament and contempt for the Australian public'.",64
95,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This motion is for a suspension of standing orders. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was quite prepared to move multiple points of order the last time that I spoke on one of these suspensions. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to come back to the question.",64
96,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House is entirely correct. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will focus on the motion moved by her leader. Ms JULIE BISHOP: The suspension must be allowed so that the Prime Minister can explain why her lieutenants called the foreign minister somebody with chaotic work patterns who sabotaged the 2010 campaign. The Prime Minister appointed this-on her assessment; on Labor's assessment-'deeply flawed individual with a personality disorder' as foreign minister. Labor say that he was fit to be the foreign minister of this country. On that basis,64

Ms JULIE BISHOP: Standing orders must be suspended so that the Prime Minister can explain how the extraordinary public revelations of the dysfunction, division and chaos at the centre of the government over the last 18 months will end with today's bloodletting. On Labor's own assessment of their former leader and of their current leader, their choice today was between a psychopath and a sociopath, with the Labor Party in continuous group therapy for the three years. It is important that we suspend standing orders because some of these comments were made by the Prime Minister, who saw fit to conduct a campaign of vilification from the prime ministerial office, another example of the squalid culture of the Prime Minister's office that gave rise to the riots on Australia Day. That is why standing orders must be",65

He specifically said that my ruling was outrageous and he is lucky that he has not been named. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. I have withdrawn the call from her.

105,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The reason that the last Deputy Leader of the Opposition was required to resume her seat was because she was not being relevant to the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition.,65

107,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The question is that the motion be agreed to. The Prime Minister has the call.,66
108,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS,"I welcome this debate, because it is about the priorities of the Australian nation. The priorities of the Australian people should be debated in this House-their focus on jobs; on making lives for their families; on the benefits that their families need so that they can support themselves; on a great education for their children; on their young people being able to get apprenticeships or university places; on health and on making sure that they can go to an emergency department, see a doctor when they need to and get elective surgery; and on making sure that our nation has a stronger and fairer future. And those things are the focus of the government. What should be the subject of debate in this parliament? We can have the squalor of the opposition's approach or we can focus on managing the economy in the interests of working people. We can focus on the more than 700,000 jobs already created under this Labor government. We can focus on an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent when around the world nations suffer unemployment rates of double that. We can focus on what is needed in 2012 to support Australian jobs in manufacturing. I would happily have a debate about our plan for manufacturing versus the half-a-billiondollar cut and the end of assistance to the car industry being advocated by those opposite. I would happily debate our plans to keep tens of thousands of Australians in work as opposed to the plans of the opposition to end those jobs. That is the proper business of this parliament. In this suspension, what the opposition seeks to do is carve out parliamentary time for its squalor rather than for the purpose of talking about Australian jobs. At the same time, we have the opposition saying, 'Let's devote parliamentary time to the pursuit of our naked political interest, not to important issues like how we seize a clean energy future.' They are embarrassed to be reminded, time after time, of their contradictions and hypocrisy on pricing carbon. Former Prime Minister Howard is repudiated by this shambolic opposition, former Prime Minister Howard is dispensed with as if he had never said that there should be an emissions trading scheme. The opposition do not want to have that debate because they do not want the Australian people to understand that their plan is about costing Australian families $1,300 each and that their plan is about taking tax cuts and pension increases and family payment increases away from working families. They do not want that debated in this parliament so they continue these cheap tricks. They do not want debated in this parliament our plans for health reform versus their plans for health cutbacks. This Labor government has delivered an historic health reform agreement and in 2012 it is being rolled out around the nation, meaning that there are more doctors and more nurses and more healthcare services available. They never want to debate health, because they have got plans for cutbacks now, just as the Leader of the Opposition had plans for cutbacks when he was a long-serving minister for health in the Howard government. They do not want that debated; they just want to focus on the cheap politics. They do not want debated what is happening in Australian schools, because they do not want Australians to know that they have plans to cut back money going to disadvantaged schools, they have plans to cut back money going into improving teacher quality and they have plans to cut back money going into the infrastructure that kids need to learn in the 21st century, like computers in schools. They never bring on a debate about those issues-that is, quality education from this Labor government versus their plans for cutbacks in schools. Nor do they want to debate our plans to roll out the National Broadband Network, or the achievement by this Labor government of the structural separation of Telstra, because they do not want Australians to know that they are committed to pulling the broadband out of the ground, making sure that this nation falls behind world standards, and to losing all the jobs come with it. Despite the bravado of the Leader of the Opposition at the start of the parliamentary year, the last thing they want is a debate about the economy in 2012. The last thing they want to do is debate the government's plan for a new skills agenda-an agenda for Australians to have the high-skills high-wage jobs of the future-or the government's plan for a budget surplus, because they are hoping that no-one notices the fact that until they $70 billion of services for working families they cannot even get the budget to the starting line. They do not want to be debating the government's programs and plans for managing this structural change in our economy, change that is putting pressure on some sectors but is full of opportunity for the future. They do not want Australians to understand the new benefits that this Asian century can bring to our economy, which will come as our region grows and prospers. We can prosper with it. Instead, they would rather focus on their endless game-playing and their endless politics. That is because they are focused on cheap politics, whilst we are focused on the future. In the Leader of the Opposition's own motion he points to three issues. Cost of living-let us have a debate about their Coles and Woolies tax to fund their ridiculous paid parental leave scheme, which as usual is destined to give the biggest benefits to those at the top. They have never found a billionaire they did not want to shovel money at. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned border protection in his motion-let us debate that and the plans the opposition has to put Australian lives on the line and to put Australian lives in danger. The opposition would rather profit politically than protect the men and women who serve in the Australian Defence Force. The Leader of the Opposition has also talked about jobs. The last thing he really wants to do is have a debate in this parliament about jobs, standing proudly as he does for the end of steelworking jobs, standing proudly as he does for the end of car industry jobs, standing proudly as he does for denying Australians the jobs and opportunities of the future, because he has got no plans to build the future we need. The House should not agree to this cut motion. It should not follow the Leader of the Opposition down the road of negativity. Australians expect us as a government and as a parliament to have them at centre stage: their needs, their dreams, their prospects and their future. That is our focus as a government as we are impatient to get on with the work that will deliver to those working people today and build them the future that they want. The House should reject out of hand this further squalor from the opposition for what it is.",66
109,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:12): I also rise to speak against this motion to suspend standing and sessional orders.

Congratulations go to the Australian editor, Kirk Baxter, who has won the editing Oscar for his work on the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. He was up against some heavy competition because Hugo and The Artist were both considered the favourites. Also, for those who may recall, this is the second Oscar Kirk Baxter has won, because he and his colleague Angus Wall won it last year for their work on The Social Network. This highlights the depth of talent in the Australian film industry. It is not just the people in front of the camera who are winning awards but those responsible for the production, direction and editing. Mr Baxter is one of two Australians nominated for this year's Oscars. I also acknowledge Grant Hill, who is the producer of the Best Picture candidate, The Tree of Life. We wait to hear the outcome of that award. NA Fair Work (Job Security and Fairer Bargaining) Amendment Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bandt.",71
124,Mr BANDT,BILLS," This bill introduces a set of amendments to the Fair Work Act addressing a number of problems that have arisen, being the subject of much public discussion over recent months. These amendments will make it more likely that disputes will be resolved and will require Fair Work Australia to give greater attention to the core issues of workloads, job security and work-life balance. The bill will also remove the incentives we have seen all too apparently that exist for powerful employers to use legal tactics as a way of avoiding good faith and bona fide negotiation in the resolution of disputes by negotiation. Members will recall that in October last year Qantas clearly demonstrated the power imbalance that still exists between everyday working Australians on the one hand and large corporations on the other. Qantas decided to take extreme action and ground the airline. No prior notice was given and under the current rules no prior notice was needed. A large corporation flexed its muscles, caused widespread disruption and got exactly what it wanted. Effectively Qantas held a gun to its own head, blamed the unions and then waited for Fair Work Australia to intervene and terminate all industrial action. That might have been legal but it was not right. Unfortunately, the actions of Qantas may have inspired other companies to use similar tactics. In December the shipping company POAGS locked out their workforce in Freemantle and Bunbury. As my colleague Scott Ludlam said, the workers had been targeted after using work bans to protest about safety concerns and POAGS dragging out the agreement negotiations for 12 months. A number of these amendments are aimed at addressing the situation where powerful employers escalate industrial disputes in an aim to get some perceived tactical advantage. As a first measure, the bill will require companies to give three days notice prior to a lockout or any change in normal operations in preparation of a lockout. This is not onerous. It simply imposes the same time limit on companies that already applies to workers. Secondly, and critically, the bill will require Fair Work Australia to consider whether employer response action is proportionate in the circumstances or whether the action has been taken to make an application more likely to succeed. If either of these applies, then Fair Work Australia can only suspend industrial action rather than terminate. This would ensure that companies cannot bypass the bargaining process through a Qantas style approach. It would minimise the likelihood of such tactics repeating and put the pressure back on parties to come to an agreement. Thirdly, Fair Work Australia would also be given better tools to deal with serious industrial action. At present, Fair Work Australia can only suspend or terminate either everything or nothing at all. This is the approach that Fair Work Australia has determined is the only option open to it under current law, and I refer to the decision of National Tertiary Education Industry Union v University of South Australia [2010] FWAFB 1014, especially at paragraph 11. The amendment that is contained in this bill would redress that situation. It would make it clear that Fair Work Australia can terminate that part of ongoing industrial action that poses the relevant threat under the section. It can also suspend that part. It can allow the part that poses no threat to continue. As such, Fair Work Australia will be able to ensure a tailored response while making sure that the public interest continues to be protected. One of the issues that was at stake during the Qantas dispute was the job security of employees. Given that about 60 per cent of employees in the modern workforce are engaged in insecure work, it is hardly surprising that employees are concerned about the security of their employment. The less job security people have, the less choice also they have. We should be able to choose whether to have a mortgage or to rent, but so often for so many everyday Australians that choice is forced on them by the unreliable nature of their employment. This bill will make it explicit that job security is a permitted matter for the purposes of enterprise agreements. It will also make it clear that workloads will be a permitted matter for enterprise agreements. These matters will also become objects of the Fair Work Act and factors that Fair Work Australia takes into account when making any workplace determination. Unfortunately, it seems that rights at work are under attack not just from large corporations such as Qantas, POAGS or Schweppes. In Victoria we have witnessed the ongoing saga of the nurses dispute, where the critically important issue of nurse to patient ratios is unresolved. The nurses and employers are bargaining under a federal system because there is no state system anymore. The dispute remains unresolved because the Victorian government has deliberately refused to bargain because it believes it will get a better outcome before legally hamstrung Fair Work Australia. As a result, the dispute has been strung out over 106 days, to the point where many nurses are now considering resigning because they do not know what else to do and there is nowhere they can turn to get the whole of their dispute resolved. Items 11 and 14 of this bill address a significant problem with the operation of the act. At the moment, bargaining representatives may be bargaining about legitimate matters, yet not all of those matters may be capable of being resolved by way of an industrial action related workplace determination. As a result, it may be in the interests of one of the parties to have disputes resolved by way of workplace determination instead of negotiation. This can lead to a prolonging of disputes and can encourage parties to take tactical steps in anticipation of achieving a workplace determination. It also works against the objects of the act, which prioritise dispute resolution through enterprise bargaining. One example is bargaining in state governments or state public sector agencies where the bargaining representative of the employees is pursuing what would ordinarily be understood to be a permitted matter in an enterprise agreement, such as a claim about the number or identity of staff to be employed, yet the employer asserts that such a matter cannot be included in a workplace determination because of constitutional limitations. In such an instance, the employer may prefer the matter to be resolved by workplace determination and may take steps it considers make it more likely to achieve that outcome. Other examples may arise in the future should the jurisprudence ever evolve such that certain subject matters, although otherwise permitted matters for enterprise agreements, will never, as a a question of principle, be included in workplace determinations. In such instances, whichever party considers it would benefit from such a limitation may take steps to achieve a workplace determination instead of reaching a full resolution of outstanding matters by agreement with the other party. The new sections 423(6A) and 424(1A) very would encourage parties to resolve all the matters in dispute between them. It would require Fair Work Australia to be satisfied that, to the extent any matters in dispute could not be resolved by way of workplace determination, there must be an agreed and binding method of resolving these outstanding matters. The object of these new sections is to ensure that all legitimate matters in dispute between the parties are resolved fully and finally with a priority given to resolution by agreement provided that industrial action may be suspended if Fair Work Australia considers it appropriate to do so. This sections are of general application and will apply to all applications for termination of industrial action. To the extent that they apply to state governments or state agencies to whom certain constitutional limitations apply, these provisions will help resolve disputes fully and finally, something that is additionally important in those instances where there may be no other mechanism of finally and fully resolving those disputes under a relevant state law. I refer here to Re Australian Education Union and Australian Nursing Federation; Ex parte Victoria (1995) HCA 71 paragraphs 80 to 81. Fair Work Australia retains its powers to suspend but not terminate industrial action. Further, if the only reason that matters in dispute cannot be finally and fully resolved is one bargaining representative's failure to consent to an acceptable process of resolution, then that party's industrial action can be suspended. In other words, one cannot rely on one's own refusal to consent to an acceptable process of full and final dispute resolution as an excuse to continue industrial action that Fair Work Australia would otherwise consider ought not take place. I greatly respect the work nurses do and this bill respects the work that nurses do. I urge the parliament to respect the work that nurses do and pass the bill. The bill will also insert a provision that requires enterprise agreements to have a dispute resolution provision that allows Fair Work Australia to arbitrate where all other measures have failed. I note this approach was endorsed by Labor at its national conference last year. It is a sensible approach and I hope that leads them to support this bill. Lastly, the objects of the act will be amended to ensure that better work-life balance is taken into account by Fair Work Australia, that the question of workloads is taken into account and that we also end the anomalous situation where the Reserve Bank is required to take into account the promotion of full employment in Australia but Fair Work Australia is not. I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",71
125,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Fair Work Australia",74
126,Mr ABBOTT,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) the Fair Work Australia investigation into the Health Services Union and Member for Dobell commenced in 2009; (b) the investigation started with the Industrial Registrar in January 2009 and was taken over by Fair Work Australia when it commenced operation in June 2009; (c) Fair Work Australia representatives said the investigation would be completed by the end of 2011, with Fair Work Australia Director Terry Nassios telling a Senate Estimates committee in that May 2011 that the investigation should be completed by 'the latter half of this year' and Bernadette ONEILL, the Acting General Manager, saying in October 2011 that ' Mr Nassios has advised me that he still expects to complete his investigations by the end of this year'; (d) the investigation remains ongoing despite an employee of the Australian Government Solicitor, Craig Rawson, being provided with a letter containing 'proposed findings' in December 2010; and (e) the investigation into the Health Services Union and the Member for Dobell has taken more than three years and is yet to be completed; and (2) calls on the Government to provide an assurance that there has been no political interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation into the Health Services Union and the Member for Dobell. Back in January of 2009, more than three years ago, a very important investigation was begun into serious misuse of the moneys of the 70,000 lowly paid members of the Health Services Union. This is a very serious matter because union members have an absolute right to expect that their money will be used for the purposes of the union and for the purposes of advancing their industrial interests, and will not be misused for personal purposes, for political purposes and for family purposes of union officials. And there is strong evidence, much of which is in the public arena, that hundreds of thousands of dollars of union members' dues have been used to fund political campaigns of the now member for Dobell, formerly the general secretary of the union, and used to benefit the families of senior officials of the union. And, I regret to say, there is strong evidence, much of which is in the media, that members' dues were used to procure prostitution services for then officials of the union. This is an absolute disgrace. If union members and the Australian public more generally are to have any confidence in the administration of justice, in particular if they are to have any confidence in the just operation of Australia's industrial system, matters of this seriousness must be swiftly investigated and justice must be swiftly done. But that has not happened. The investigation began in January 2009. Towards the end of last year, when the investigation had already been going on for well over 2½ years, an assurance was given by a Fair Work Australia director that the investigation should be completed by the latter half of last year. The acting general manager gave an assurance in writing in October of last year that the investigation was expected to be completed by the end of 2011. Further, back in December 2010, an employee of the Australian Government Solicitor was provided with an official letter containing proposed findings in this investigation. So back in December 2010 proposed findings were available. Twice last year Fair Work Australia gave assurances that the matter would be completed by the end of the year and still there is no conclusion to this saga. This gives rise to a very strong suspicion of, at the very least, an institutional go-slow, but possibly political interference in the operation of what should be an organ of justice. I do not lightly question the integrity and professionalism of any official body. As a former minister for workplace relations, I worked with the former Industrial Relations Commission and in those days it was a body that dispensed impartial justice. I do not say that the body has been necessarily corrupted since then, but I do say this is a terrible look. It is a terrible look because since the current government took over, almost all of the senior appointments to Fair Work Australia have been former union officials. We know that there is an incestuous relationship between the trade union movement of this country and members of the current government. Just about all the senior members of the current government are former union officials. It is a big union family which has links through the union movement from Fair Work Australia to the government and that would be threatened should Fair Work Australia's investigation be brought to a swift conclusion and charges laid. I do not question the professionalism of Fair Work Australia, but I urge Fair Work Australia, in the interests of its own good name, to not further delay this vital investigation. There is another important factor that needs to be considered-that is, the extensive contact that has taken place between ministers in this government and Fair Work Australia. When a member of the opposition front bench contacted a minister in the New South Wales government about investigations into the member for Dobell, ministers opposite lined up, one after the other, to denounce political interference, even though a member of the opposition front bench by definition is not in government. Yet what we now know is that on at least seven occasions there was direct contact between ministers in government, including none other than the Prime Minister, and Fair Work Australia over this matter. There was a phone call between Fair Work Australia and the Prime Minister's chief of staff, first denied and then admitted. There were numerous emails and phone contacts between the former minister for workplace relations and Fair Work Australia, and there has been at least one phone conversation between the current minister for workplace relations and Fair Work Australia on this matter. We do not know for sure that there has been collusion between the government and Fair Work Australia over the investigation itself, but there certainly has been collusion over the media management of it. We know that because emails released under FOI prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. This motion is important because it is about maintaining the integrity of our institutions and it is about maintaining honesty in government, something which this Prime Minister seems to find so incredibly difficult. This Prime Minister needs to explain all of the contacts between her and her office, and her ministers and their offices, and Fair Work Australia. She needs to detail the precise content of all of those contacts. And she needs to explain why it is political interference for an opposition frontbencher to talk about an investigation but it is somehow entirely benign for ministers to heavy officials of Fair Work Australia. The Prime Minister also needs to explain just how the interests of justice, as opposed to the political survival of this government, are furthered by the unconscionable time that this investigation has taken-it is now in its fourth year, yet far more complex investigations have been completed in far less time. The Fitzgerald royal commission this into illegalities in Queensland took less than three years. The Wood royal commission into corruption in the New South Wales Police Force took less than three years. The Cole royal commission into the construction industry took less than 18 months. The Watergate investigation took less than 18 months. The Empire State Building was built in one year and 45 days-far, far quicker than this investigation! And do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, it has already cost more than $1 million? Members opposite might be interested to know that, when there was a problem with expenses in the House of Commons, revelations were uncovered in May 2009, charges were laid in February 2010 and convictions, including prison sentences, were brought down by January 2011. Instead of swift justice we have had, I fear, a corruption of the process of justice. That is why the Prime Minister has to explain. That is why this motion should be supported.",74
127,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded? Ms Ley: I second the motion.,76
128,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS," In a month's time. I will have been in this place for some 16 years. One thing I learnt in my very earliest days here was that, when the leader of your party is on his or her feet, it is a good idea to get yourself into the chamber to listen to what he or she might have to say-and, of course, it is one of the roles of the whip to make sure people are aware that he or she is on his or her feet, and people usually dutifully race into support their leader. But I was intrigued by what took place here this afternoon, and I think it reflects feeling of many who sit on the opposition back benches towards the Leader of the Opposition's tactics with this motion, and indeed whether he is right to be playing this political game with what is very much an independent inquiry. One minute into his speech, seven members of the opposition were in here to support their leader",76
129,Mr Secker,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is in no way relevant to the motion before the House; it is just a mischief.",77
130,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Barker will resume his seat.,77
131,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"The member for Barker should not be concerned, because it gets better: within two minutes there were nine members, within four there were 16, within five there were 27, within six it built to 30 and at about the 31st minute it reached its crescendo at 31!",77
132,Mr Morrison,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I ask you to bring the member for Hunter back to the motion. I know the member for Hunter is good at counting numbers and relaying them here in this place, but I do not think it is relevant to the motion.",77
133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I thank the member for Cook. The member for Hunter is reminded of the motion before the House.,77
134,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"I will move on, except to say that theirs is a parliamentary party of some 71 members-and there was a crescendo of 31. So where were these other members? I would like to think some of them were out there thinking about the things we have been thinking about as a parliamentary party.",77
135,Mr Schultz,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",77
136,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I remind the the member for Hume that he is interjecting from outside of his place and he does not have the call. The member for Hunter has the call.,77
137,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"Somewhere tonight, if not everywhere in the eurozone, members of parliaments, their officials, their departmental heads and their advisers will be thinking about where to jump next in dealing with their economic crises-and something similar will no doubt be taking place in the bit of United States, who look upon our economy with in wonderment and with envy. And here in Australia, those of us on this side",77
138,Mr Morrison,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Hunter, I think, is defying you. He is clearly not being relevant to the question. If he does not have anything relevant to say on this matter then he should just sit down.",77
139,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for Cook will resume his seat. I again remind the member for Hunter of the motion before the House. I can repeat it for him if he likes, but I am sure he has a copy of it.",77
140,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will get off the important issues facing the country and get back to the muckraking",77
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order! The motion before the House relates to Fair Work Australia.,77
142,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"I will address it very directly, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let's go through it then. Mr Abbott, with great fanfare, although with little support from his own back bench, wants the House to note",77
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order! The member for Hunter will refer to members by their titles.,77
144,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition wants the House to note: … the Fair Work Australia investigationI won't read the whole thing… commenced in 2009",78
145,Unknown,BILLS,Opposition members interjecting,78
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,Order! The member for Hunter has the call.,78
147,Mr FITZGIBBON,BILLS,"Yes, it did-we have no problem with that; that is fine. The motion continues: (b) the investigation started with the Industrial RegistrarYes, that is fine; it seems to be a matter of fact to me… (c) Fair Work Australia representatives said the investigation would be completed by the end of 2011Okay, these are generally statements of fact… (d) the investigation remains ongoingA bit of a statement of the obvious, I would have thoughtdespite an employee of the Australian Government Solicitor, Craig Rawson, being provided with a letter containing 'proposed findings' in December 2010That is a fairly big point… (e) the investigation into the Health Services Union and the Member for Dobell has taken more than three years and is yet to be completed. That is a statement of fact, so what are we debating here this afternoon? Are we having a debate or is this a misuse of parliamentary procedure to launch an attack on an individual who I would have thought all members in this place would agree is entitled to procedural fairness and natural justice? I would have hoped that every member of this place accepts those principles as the golden thread which holds our legal system in this country together. If no-one on that side agrees, certainly some of their senior colleagues agree. For example, former Prime Minister John Howard in this place in 2007 with respect to an earlier investigation said: … a lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for. It's a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course and then if it is appropriate I will have something to say. That was a very sensible contribution by the former Prime Minister, the former member for Bennelong. All the issues raised by the Leader of the Opposition in his motion were dealt with very considerably and in great detail in Senate estimates just in the last sitting week. I do concede that the Leader of the Opposition lodged his motion prior to those Senate estimates processes. That is understandable. He was not to be aware that they were forthcoming. But he might have considered, given what was said in Senate estimates a fortnight ago, withdrawing the motion. That would have been the sensible thing to do. On that, I refer the House to just one of the statements made by Bernadette ONEILL during estimates. She is the general manager of Fair Work Australia. She said: I am aware of the allegations that there has been some political interference in the investigations and take them very seriously. I have absolutely no reason to conclude that there has been any such interference in the investigations. We have a senior official, an independent arbiter, before Senate estimates providing us with that statement. She is a respected official. Notwithstanding that, the Leader of the Opposition, seeking to make political capital, comes in here and directly challenges what she has had to say. I say to the House that that is inappropriate. I am a person who knows a little bit about trial by media. I will not say much more about that. I will let Justice Lucy MCCallum of the New South Wales Supreme Court speak for herself. She said, 'People should never assume, surprisingly, that everything they read in the paper is correct.' Most of what the Leader of the Opposition raised today was taken straight out of the countries' news sheets. He made no attempt to make any reference to what was a fairly full conversation in Senate estimates just over a week ago. Rather, he relied almost entirely on allegations and accusations, as he himself described them, rather than sticking to the facts. I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition and to every member in this place to be very careful because if Mr Thomson is cleared in these inquiries-and that is obviously a possibility-he will not have been the first person to fall victim to rumour and innuendo and various media reports. The person who next becomes a victim of that might be someone sitting on the other side. Who knows? It could even be the Leader of the Opposition himself. So the Leader of the Opposition has to be careful not to get too carried away. I know he is a little bit excited because from time to time since the last election he has had visions of himself sitting in the Prime Minister's chair during question time. But I have some news for him: the sort of tactics that he has embraced and adopted today here in the House are not conducive to his aspirations and will not help him get there. For the sake of our democracy and procedural fairness, he should take a new course. Debate adjourned. NA Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",78
148,Dr STONE,BILLS," In continuation, let me say that there are very important measures in the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill and in the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional provisions) Bill. They deal in particular with the issue of alcohol related harm to Aborigines in communities in the Northern Territory. We all know that there are some very heavy drinkers in the Northern Territory, and not just Indigenous people. We also know there are a lot of Indigenous communities that are strictly dry; there is no alcohol allowed. Despite that great diversity, it is important that we try to have appropriate Commonwealth and Northern Territory alcohol licensing laws which are aimed at reducing alcohol related harm to Indigenous peoples. There is a terrible consequence, for example, when pregnant women drink alcohol, whether they are Indigenous or not. We know that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder can be a consequence of women drinking when pregnant, and there are significant numbers of Indigenous children who are now at risk or who have in fact become victims of FASD. I want to commend communities such as the women of the Fitzroy Crossing area in Western Australia, who have tackled the issue of alcohol themselves and have, through local empowerment and local education, tackled the heavy drinking that was once of almost historic proportions in their community. Now they are tackling the issue of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and I commend that community. I also need to stress that there needs to be cooperation and coordination between the Territory and Commonwealth laws in relation to all alcohol selling and allowing of consumption of alcohol. It is important that the current alcohol restrictions in Aboriginal communities are appropriate and that they are reviewed from time to time. Of course the main focus should be the strengthening of alcohol self-management plans to bring about local solutions, focused on harm minimisation, for Aboriginal communities. I mention again places like Fitzroy Crossing, in Western Australia, that are great role models for self empowerment for making real gains. This legislation also includes land reform measures that enable: … the Commonwealth to make amendments to Northern Territory legislation relating to community living areas and town camps to facilitate voluntary long term leasing, including for the granting of individual rights or interests and the promotion of economic development. This is an issue which the coalition tackled quite some time ago. We know that communalism is a very important traditional way of life for Indigenous peoples, but it has disadvantages in the 21st century. Often a young couple or, indeed, a long-established family needs to have some capacity for long term leasing of their homes. They need to have security of tenure and they need to be able to gain bank loans using assets that they might have in community settings. This is an important area of work. These measures will enable: … opportunities for private home ownership in town camps and more flexible long term leasing including for business activity in community living areas. We have to normalise life for Indigenous peoples who aspire to the same economic opportunities as others in this country. Finally, these bills have food security measures which try to improve access to fresh, healthy food through remote community stores. I am shocked whenever I go to remote communities and see what is on the store shelves. Often there is only processed food that is usually well past its shelf life and is at exorbitant prices. I look around the communities and see young children suffering the consequences of poor nutrition, children who have not seen fresh fruit and vegetables in a very long time. Anything we can do to improve food security measures for these Indigenous communities we must pursue. So while we need to amend these bills to make them better I do support their overall thrust. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (16:09): In introducing this package of bills to the House, the then Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs spoke of the government's vision and objectives that are driving us in our plan to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. She said: A stronger future, grounded in a stronger relationship between government and Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. A relationship built on respect for Australia's first peoples, for their custodianship of the land, for their culture and for their ongoing contributions to our shared nation. This is a respect that is about much more than sentiment. It is about the approach we take to our work, and the approach we take to working together. This is the approach we took to consultations after we first came into government. These conversations revealed the depth of hurt felt by Aboriginal people by the sudden and rushed implementation of the Northern Territory Emergency Response. And informed our amendments, including the reinstatement of the Racial Discrimination the Northern Territory. I can find no finer words with which to enter this debate on this important package of legislation. I am very pleased to speak today on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and associated bills. Together, these bills form a part of the government's next steps in the Northern Territory, undertaken in partnership with Aboriginal people and the Northern Territory government. The Gillard government is working with Indigenous people to improve services in areas such as health, education and housing, as part of an unprecedented effort to improve life expectancy and opportunities for Indigenous people. Ending this unacceptable disadvantage will take time. It will also require a sustained effort by all governments and by businesses, not-for-profit organisations, Indigenous Australians and the wider community. The Closing the Gap report tabled in this place by the Prime Minister recently shows that the foundations are now in place to build lasting changes right across the country. Progress made so far, as outlined in the report, includes the fact that we are on track to meet the under-five mortality target, with a continued decline in mortality rates for Indigenous children-falling by 48 per cent from 1991 to 2010 across the three jurisdictions in which long-term comparisons are possible. That is something I am sure all members in this place would rejoice in. Overall Indigenous mortality rates have declined by 36 per cent from 1991 to 2010 in, again, the three jurisdictions for which reliable data are available for this period. Indigenous children are doing better at school, with strong improvements in NAPLAN results for Indigenous students in seven of the eight areas in which we can assess progress at the national level. Again, I Act in am sure that these are improvements all members in this House would rejoice in. The introduction of these bills follows extensive consultations, as the minister set out in her second reading speech, with the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory on how the Australian and Northern Territory governments might work with Aboriginal people to expand their opportunities and build stronger futures for themselves and their children. In the consultations, Aboriginal people said that getting more children to school, increasing the number of Aboriginal people in local jobs, improving housing and reducing alcohol related harm were the communities' top priorities. The Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory package of bills is one element of the government's response and continued commitment to meeting these top priorities. The Stronger Futures Bill provides that the Northern Territory Emergency Response alcohol restrictions will be continued and strengthened. It also provides that alcohol management plans established by local communities be directed at minimising alcohol related harm. The bill also provides for the Commonwealth to require the Northern Territory Licensing Commission to provide reports to the Commonwealth minister on levels of alcohol related harm and the impact of policy measures in the Territory. Getting this information ensures we are able to make the right policy decisions in the future. The bill also provides for a joint Commonwealth and Northern Territory review to be conducted in two years from commencement of the Stronger Futures legislation. The review will examine the impact of the Stronger Futures and Territory strategies to address harm. This will allow both governments to continue working together to make real progress. The member for Murray spoke about her experiences in relation to some of the stores in the area covered by this legislation. It goes to the issue of food security. A consistent message in the consultations with the minister and the government and in evaluations was that the remote community stores have improved over the past four years. They are now offering a healthier range of food and are generally better managed. We will continue to improve licensing arrangements for community stores by replacing the current system, in which the only remedy for non-compliance is licence revocation. We will introduce, through measures in this bill, daily penalties for non-compliance of up to $2,200 to encourage stores to improve their performance and improve it quickly. Licensing will be more clearly focused on supporting food security in remote communities. In the future a community store will be required to have a licence to operate if it is an important source of food, drink or grocery items for Aboriginal communities. The Australian government has made a clear commitment to negotiating voluntary long-term leases in the area of housing and land reform and will not be extending the compulsory five-year leases acquired under the original NTER legislation. The Australian and Northern Territory governments will continue to negotiate leases with Aboriginal landholders that will enable the Northern Territory government to manage housing in remote communities. The aim is to enable the Aboriginal landholders of town camps and community living areas to have the opportunity to make use of their land for a broader range of purposes, including economic development and private alcohol related home ownership. We are also taking steps, through the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill, to make improvements to the Australian government's measure on improving school enrolment and attendance through welfare reform. The social security bill will amend the income management legislation to allow referrals by recognised state or territory authorities to trigger income management. In the Northern Territory people could be referred for income management by the Northern Territory Alcohol and Other Drugs Tribunal. The social security law amendments will apply to all people on income support in the relevant areas on a non-discriminatory basis. Income management is a key part of the government's commitment to ensuring that welfare payments are spent in the best interests of children. It provides a tool to stabilise people's circumstances, easing immediate financial stress while limiting expenditure of income support payments on excluded items, including alcohol, tobacco, pornography, and gambling goods and activities. The social security bill also enables the introduction of targeted income management in five disadvantaged communities across Australia, including Playford in South Australia, Bankstown in my own state of New South Wales, Shepparton in Victoria, and Rockhampton and Logan in Queensland. In these communities from 1 July this year income management will apply to vulnerable families and individuals, including parents referred for income management by a state or territory child protection authority; people assessed by Centrelink social workers as being vulnerable to financial crisis-which could include people referred by housing authorities-who are at risk of homelessness due to rental arrears; or people who themselves volunteer for management. New support services will also be available to help families on income management get their lives back on track. These include money management skills training to help people better manage the family budget and new Communities for Children services, including in my own electorate in Throsby, which will support parents and their children through playgroups, parenting education classes, mentoring and support groups, and early learning programs. Each of these measures will take effect from 1 July this year. In concluding I will say a few words about school attendance and school attendance patterns, as outlined in schedule 2 of the social security bill. The government's school enrolment and attendance measure, SEAM, supports parents in their responsibility to ensure that their children go to school. All the best teachers and all the best curriculums in the world are of no use unless children are actually attending their local school. So, under the measure, people may have their income support payments suspended if they fail to enrol their child at school or fail to make every effort to ensure that they attend regularly. Indications to date are that SEAM and the accompanying social work support provided by the government are having a positive impact on enrolment and attendance. This bill enables some local tailoring of measures too so that the operation of SEAM can be integrated with the Northern Territory government's Every Child, Every Day initiative to support greater improvement in school attendance, and this package of measures will take effect from 1 July this year. This is a comprehensive package of bills as part of the government's ongoing commitment to working together with income communities in the remote parts of the Northern Territory as well as with other vulnerable communities throughout the country to ensure that we are doing our best to provide income support, life opportunities and quality education for each and every Australian child whether they are living in a remote community in the Northern Territory or in the community of Playford in South Australia or in one of the other areas targeted in this package of bills. Income support will be provided to families who are without jobs or who are relying on welfare support, but at the same time we will be delivering what we now call 'tough love'. That is to ensure that the adults in those families to whom the government is providing income support are doing everything within their power to ensure that their kids go to school and that their kids have every opportunity in lifeopportunities that perhaps their parents did not have-to get a fine education and to ensure that they are able to participate in the workforce and in the wider community. This is an important package of bills. I hope it enjoys bipartisan support. I know the report that was delivered by the Prime Minister in this chamber two weeks ago on the closing the gap statistics is something that would be welcomed not only by all right-thinking people in this place but by the community at large. Yes, progress has been made, but there is still much more to be these done. I commend this legislation to the House. It is another step in the right direction in closing the gap.",79
149,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," I rise to address the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and associated bills. I find myself in the strange position of supporting a bill which subsumes individual responsibility and moves it to the public. It is something of which I would normally be extremely wary but, in this case, I find myself with little option but to support it. I would be the first to say I am not a supporter of the nanny state, where the state progressively removes an individual's responsibilities to make decisions in what the state presumes is their best interests. There are scores of examples where government imposes itself in this manner on the general public, in areas like compulsory superannuation, seatbelts, arrangements-which are very onerous on business and in some cases discourage them from employing workers-and smoking laws. That is not to say that any one of these laws in isolation is a bad thing; it is just an area where government has taken individual responsibility away. Even the messages of incentives/penalties that government and bodies of government send people regarding personal health carethings like obesity, alcohol consumption and tobacco use-assume that it is not really the fault of the individual. In the case of obesity or alcohol abuse it is the fast food sellers or the alcohol advertisers who are at fault. We are not very honest with people when we fail to tell them if they are overweight, if they drink too much or if they smoke too much that it is in the individual's power to address the problem. Unfortunately, this comes through much of the legislation that we do in the public healthcare or the public benefit sector. As I have said, this is not an area that I would normally be drawn to. One of my favourites, as an example of where we fall down in terms of the individual's responsibility, is breakfast programs in schools. I would be the last to say that if are coming to school hungry that we should not do something about it, but the downside of that is that as soon as we provide this assistance to the children we are absolving parents of their essential responsibility, which is to feed their children before they go to school. I know of a small middle-class country town where the local school had two or three children coming to school who were hungry, and the school felt it had to do something. It addressed the problem and put in a breakfast program but before long it had 20 or 30 children coming to school for the breakfast program. You have to try to strike a balance between the public good, the OH&S child's good and the individual's responsibility. That is not to say that any of these programs are necessarily good or bad, but we need to consider this when we make decisions-as we are with these bills-about absolving individuals of their responsibility and trying to put state pressure on them to achieve social outcomes. For me, the threshold is where the individual's actions impact on others, particularly children. Today, we are debating that area where we are using the strength of government to manipulate people's welfare income to achieve outcomes for their children that they may not otherwise necessarily take. The Howard government's intervention in the Northern Territory has always had its detractors, and normally it is couched in terms of offending human rights. This has always been a poor criticism. The weakness of the intervention was that it further removed individual responsibilities and the ability of individuals to manage their own lives. So while we take this short-term action we must have a clear eye to the future about how we empower people to take back control of their lives. The intervention's genesis lay in the appalling levels of abuse and neglect within kids the remote Indigenous communities revealed in the Little children are sacred report by Rex Wild and Patricia Anderson, released in June 2007, where it established that the inability of individuals, parents and communities to exercise their individual responsibilities was seriously impacting on innocent parties-that is, the children. While significant sectors of the Indigenous community and the community generally remain opposed to the intervention, on balance I believe it has been positive. It was essential to take some control of a situation that was out of control. Until now, these programs have been aimed at Indigenous communities-firstly in the Northern Territory and then to trial sites in Western Australia. Parts of the program, namely, the income management procedures, are to be rolled out in five new communities in mainstream Australia. One of these is in South Australia in the Playford City Council area, within the federal electorate of Wakefield. It is about time. One of the chief criticisms of the intervention has been that was essentially racist. There is no reason for it to be so. If the programs are good and the right thing to do then, surely, where the same triggers exist-I mean anywhere; not just in the Northern Territory and not just in the of Playford-the same measure should be appropriate. There are also provisions to extend and refine the Northern Territory programs and include the School Enrolment and Attendance Measure, or SEAM. I support these moves too. But my question to the government is: if now, after 4½ years of operation, the programs are to be extended and refined, if the assessment is that the programs are of net benefit to the communities and if the Northern Territory intervention has been a success, then why have the programs not been rolled out just over the border into the APY Lands of northern South Australia? For all intents and purposes, these communities are one and the same people who live in the southern sectors of the Northern Territory. You are well aware, I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that the northern lands of South Australia are in my electorate. It is confronting, every time. I go there, to see the disadvantage that these people operate within and how difficult it is to get kids into the schooling system. I accept that there has been another raft of public moneys going into improving housing. Certainly, the schools are at a very good level when you look at their amenities. Their health centres are also very good. And yet in so many ways we seem to be going backwards. School attendance in these communities is one of the great concerns that we have. We have the difficulty of children not rolling up on time in the morning or not rolling up on a specific day but we also have another great problem in these communities: the influence it and impact that cultural practices such as sorry days are having on communities. If a community was having a period of sorrow 100 years or 200 years ago, that period would only have been for a limited amount city of time because the body would have had to be disposed with. Now we can have bodies stuck down in Adelaide for weeks at a time, with communities in sorry camps. We have children hundreds of kilometres away from their homes in sorry camps. Traditionally, anything over 20 kilometres or 30 kilometres would have been out of that community's reach. With the way that they live their lives now, sorry days are having a much greater impact now than they would have had 100 years or 200 years ago. That is one of the reasons that school attendances are so bad throughout the lands. It is not necessarily that the kids are not rolling up on any specific day, although I know that we have issues with that as well. Some compulsion from the Commonwealth such that to get welfare payments your children should attend school is well overdue. The acceptance of income management is varied. I know many are implacably opposed. I met with the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples a few weeks ago and they are opposed. However, as the member for Grey I regularly visit remote Indigenous communities and as part of that work have met in the past with representatives of the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women's Council, which covers communities encompassing 350,000 square kilometres in Central Australia and straddling three states. I well remember the points that they made to me. Essentially, they said: 'We didn't want income management; we were totally opposed. But now we don't want you to take it away.' That is because it has empowered women to stand up for themselves and their families. One of the great strengths and weaknesses of Aboriginal society is their tradition of sharing whatever they have. However, as community structures have broken down in these remote communities, the tradition of sharing has become simply agreeing to demands from dysfunctional members of the communities to supply them with food and money for drugs and alcohol. When I met with them, the women told me this: 'Now when people come to the door and demand food we can say, 'You cannot be hungry because you have the same food as me.' That is because part of their welfare cheques under income management cannot be spent on alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or other non-essential items. It must be spent on the essentials: food and shelter. While, as I said earlier, I am very reluctant to endorse laws that take away personal responsibility, unfortunately there is a tipping point at which it affects others in the communitynamely, the children-and at that point you have to take a stand and be counted. My observations in the communities where this resistance is strongest is that the male population is much more strongly opposed to income management than the female population. I point out that these are still very much male dominated societies and the males with influence in the society have a fear of the unknown. I endorse the government's moves in this area. I hope that they are going to make a difference. Of those of us who are in these communities and face these issues on a regular basis, none are foolish enough to say that this is the answer and that it will fix the problem. It is not that simple. If the problem was that easily fixed, it would have been fixed 40 or 50 years ago. We hope that this policy will make a difference. In the medium term and the longer term, if it does provide the circuit breaker, we also have to find mechanisms to re-empower people to take control of their own lives, get back on track and make the decisions for themselves to give them the lives that the rest of Australia basically take for granted. As I said, this is not just an Indigenous issue. I am pleased to see this roll out in another five communities within Australia. If those circumstances exist there, so should the solutions.",83
150,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. At the beginning of this speech, I pay tribute to the Hon. Jenny Macklin. She is an extraordinary parliamentarian and a wonderful minister. I have had the privilege of working with her as chair of the caucus social policy committee for the past four years. She is the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform. She has a wonderful heart and a tremendous work ethic. I pay tribute to her for the extensive consultation that she has undertaken in relation to this matter. This legislation comes as a result of the incredible hard work that she has put into consult with men, women and communities across the length and breadth of this country. I support this legislation because I believe that it will make a difference in the lives of people in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory and in communities across the country. Indeed, one of the areas of income management happens to be in your electorate, Deputy Speaker Livermore, the federal seat of Capricornia. I will speak about that later. The legislation lays out the approach that we are going to take in relation to the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. We are committed to closing the gap. We have a history of taking action and implementing reforms. I noticed the Prime Minister's recent speech on the annual report on where we are up to in terms of closing the gap. We have in place some very strong aspirations and we have backed that up with serious commitment and serious funding, and we are making a difference. We are delivering real and measureable outcomes in these Indigenous communities across the country, not just in the Northern Territory. More than 90,000 additional jobs have been won by Indigenous Australians over recent years. Indigenous unemployment has fallen from 31 per cent to 16.6 per cent. Infant mortality rates in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have fallen by 36 per cent. Indigenous workers across the country are taking action in Northern Territory and Queensland in the fight against chronic disease such as heart conditions, diabetes, foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and mental illness and against other problems in these communities. We have seen an improvement in retention rates for Indigenous young people completing year 12. It is too low at 47 per cent, but it has increased from the 30 per cent that it was in the early 1990s. It is not good enough yet, but steps are being taken. We are making a difference, we are making gains, but it is not easy after many years of disadvantage and difficulties. There is no doubt whatsoever that there is a long way to go, but legislation like this will make a difference. With the support of Labor and coalition governments across the length and breadth of the country, and with the goodwill of Indigenous and other communities, we can make a difference. We are looking to improve housing with about 4,700 new or refurbished homes across Indigenous communities across the country since 2009. We are looking at hundreds and hundreds of refurbished homes in the Northern Territory-about 1,400 by June 2013. This is the largest ever remote housing investment in the Northern Territory's history. We are making a difference because we believe in helping. On this side of politics we believe that helping our brothers and sisters is not an optional extra, it is not an aspiration, it is not a handout-it is a help up. We want to make sure that we can deliver real gains in that regard. We are determined to close the gap in relation to Indigenous disadvantage. The object of the stronger futures legislation is to make sure we build safer communities in the Northern Territory. We want to make sure that children go to school. We want to make sure that housing is decent and affordable. We want to make sure that alcoholism is not a scourge on these communities in the future. Too often, men and women have continued to drink alcohol to excess. Women often drink during pregnancy, resulting in FASD difficulties for their children. There is too much domestic violence in these communities, too much criminality, too much conflict, too much dispute and too many marriage and relationship breakdowns. There is simply not enough goodwill evidenced in the past by governments of both persuasions-not enough commitment of funding, not enough determination to tackle these issues. The legislation before the House, particularly stronger futures legislation, deals with real, practical measures to tackle alcohol abuse, with making sure that we have more nutritious food and better food security in these remote communities and with assisting economic development in the town camps and community-living areas in the Northern Territory. In the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill we have five new sites announced, including Logan, which is adjacent to my home city of Ipswich, and Rockhampton in Queensland. We will see amendments made that involve income management. That can be triggered by referrals from state and Territory organisations. I can imagine these organisations are very keen to be helping people who are vulnerable, who are suffering from social and economic disadvantage and who are in need of a helping hand to manage their financial affairs. There are school attendance plans under the social security legislation. I was interested to note that government's Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure, known as SEAM, which other speakers have referred to, was mentioned recently in a press release by the Hon. Jenny Macklin, the Federal Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, as well as by the Hon. Peter Garrett, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. They mentioned the 2010 evaluation of SEAM report and made the point that, under SEAM, parents who do not respond to attempts to ensure their children are enrolled in and attend school have their income support payments suspended. This has been trialled in 14 communities in the Northern Territory and 30 schools in Queensland. It is important that children turn up to class. It is important that children are literate and numerate. It is the important to their educational outcomes and to their future financial security that that is the case. Children who do not complete school end up regularly engaging in miscreant behaviour. That is why the report Doing time-time for doing of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, of which I am the chair, noted so many Indigenous juveniles and young adults involved in the criminal justice systems around the country. The tragedy is that Indigenous juveniles are 28 times more likely to be in detention than non-Indigenous juveniles. Indigenous juveniles make up more than half of the detainee population on an average day. Indigenous young adults are 15 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous young adults. If you are an Indigenous woman you are 35 times more likely to be hospitalised by partner abuse than a non-Indigenous women. There are real problems in these communities. This is not some esoteric, theoretical problem; these are the real problems in families and in individual and community life in our country. It is in our backyard, it is in our neighbourhood, it is in our community-and we cannot ignore it. That is why in the report that the Hon. Peter Garrett and the Hon. Jenny Macklin mentioned the point is made that SEAM was successful in ensuring that all children of school age, who were involved in the trial, were enrolled in school and alternative education programs in 2010. There was an increase in participation: SEAM students increased their participation from 74.4 per cent to 79.9 per cent in the Northern can Territory and from 84.7 per cent to 88.7 per cent in Queensland, my home state. There were other indications that the SEAM program is quite clearly working. The report also found that after social workers from Centrelink contacted families students were less likely to miss school-that is, less to be engaged in truancy. We create good social norms and build safer communities by building up families. Family is the bedrock of our community, and that is important. That is why so many of these reforms are so critical to families. Alcoholism is a really bad thing. About one in 10 Australians suffer from alcohol abuse. Anyone who has experienced alcoholism in their family, as I have, has seen the impact on family life, on a person's capacity to complete school and on relationships. It results in ostracism for many people. It results in financial deprivation. It often results in abuse-psychological and emotional-in family life. It results in real disadvantage for young people. Alcoholism is a really bad problem and the Northern Territory, on all the evidence, is a problem area. I was interested to see in some reports that were coming out of the Northern Territory that in the Northern Territory alcohol consumption is far greater than elsewhere. The Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011-alcohol proposals regulation impact statement/post implementation review made it really clear that the problem of alcohol consumption in the Northern Territory has not gone away and in fact is very much there. According to that report, in 2007 it was estimated that per cent of non-Indigenous adults in NT had consumed alcohol in the previous 12 months, compared to 84.6 per cent of the rest of Australians. But it was worse when it came to Indigenous people. It really is a problem. I commend everyone to have a look at that report, because you will be absolutely stunned at the impact of alcohol consumption on people's lives and upon the problems that are clearly there in the Northern Territory. The World Health Organisation makes it plain that harmful use of alcohol is a global likely problem which impacts not just on individuals and families but on the social development of whole communities. The whole of the Northern Territory has been afflicted by these problems. The problem is the pattern of drinking and the volume of drinking. The volume of drinking in the Northern Territory amongst Indigenous people is very, very high. The problem is also the pattern, where a father gets hold of the money and then consumes alcohol, passes it on and gets the partner or wife involved, regardless of whether she is pregnant or otherwise. This can result, of course, in a child suffering from foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and other kinds of problems. I am pleased that, arising out of the Doing time report, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs is looking into foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. I happen to be on that committee, and we have had a number of hearings, particularly in North Queensland. You can see the impact of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder on the lives of those people. There are a lot of things we can do in terms of prevention, assistance, income management, advice, counsel, education and mentoring. I mentioned education before, because education is really important for our 88.7 young people and for people in the Northern Territory. I am going this Friday to some seminars with an Indigenous lawyers association in Brisbane. I am very interested to see how they are going. Josh Creamer is a very well known Indigenous barrister in Brisbane. I talk to Josh and I know him through a mutual friend, Sharon Murakami. They are having a meeting to talk about how they can provide friendship and fellowship to one another. There are very few Indigenous people-not enough-in professions around the country. I want to have a situation where an Indigenous young person from a remote community can have the opportunity, as Josh has had in his area, to work and practice as a barrister. Mentors like that can make a difference, but education is the key. Making sure that kids get to school is absolutely crucial. I want to talk briefly about income management and why I think it is important. It has been successful elsewhere. We have seen this in Western Australia since late 2008, but we have also seen the importance of contact through Centrelink. Centrelink really important organisation throughout the country, as I saw after the floods in my electorate. In the future, in places like Rockhampton, Logan and, I hope, my area of Ipswich, we will see the referral of parents who just cannot cope, who are vulnerable to financial crisis, to Centrelink for income management. We want to make sure that the people who volunteer for income management, people who are struggling, can get the help they need. We want to make sure that children get every opportunity. The legislation before this House deals with the Northern Territory. It deals with a lot of things. It deals with housing, food, land tenure, alcohol problems and education. This is a whole-of-government approach. I will finish where I started, by commending Jenny Macklin, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. She is a great public servant to this community, and this legislation is testimony to her commitment to Indigenous people around the country.",86
151,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," I rise to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011. This is important legislation because it concerns the most disadvantaged people in our society of Australia, and that is remote Indigenous Australians, particularly those in the Northern Territory. I have said before in this chamber that, if we come to this place with the aim of doing good work for the nation, we must keep the plight of Indigenous Australians high on the agenda. This legislation does that and it allows us to discuss not only the particular measures being put forward here but, more broadly, the issues which are confronting remote is a Indigenous Australians. There are three particular measures contained within the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill. The first and the most important one is a provision, in essence, to strengthen the alcohol measures, particularly by giving the federal minister additional powers over alcohol abuse in the remote communities of the Northern Territory. Anybody who has visited the remote communities of Australia, be they in the Northern Territory or elsewhere, will know that alcohol is absolutely the poison that runs through these places. It is debilitating to these communities. It destroys families. It creates violence. It prevents children from going to school. It is completely and utterly destructive to these communities. Alcohol consumption is also the highest predictor of Aboriginal people going to prison. The speaker before me mentioned some statistics, and I will mention some more. Within Cape York, a community which I know well-and I am sure the situation would be similar in the Northern Territorybetween 50 and 80 per cent of people above the age of 16 drink at hazardous levels, according to the WHO definition of hazardous. It is a remarkable figure and it is a figure which the World Health Organisation has seen nowhere else on the planet. In fact, it is four times higher than next highest figure, which is for South Africa. That is in the Cape York communities data taken from several years ago and documented in the justice study in Cape York. I am sure it is replicated in other wet communities across remote Indigenous Australia. This is an absolutely important and essential issue which we must tackle directly as a problem. It is not good enough for people to say that this is just an indirect consequence of racism or an indirect consequence of dispossession. I do not believe that. I believe that people might start drinking in part due to that, but over time it has become an issue in itself. It is now such a vast issue in these places that we must tackle it directly, head-on- not as a symptom but as a problem in its own right. Noel Pearson has been talking about this and has raised this issue for many years, and he is a former boss of mine. He says there is a very definite correlation between access to grog and the level of harm, and the less access to grog, the less harm. There is an absolute correlation between the two, he says, and I have seen that for myself as well. You go to places where they have got on top of the grog, you go to the dry communities, and they are fundamentally different from those places where the alcohol still runs through the community like a river. So we must start looking at the supply, and the alcohol management plans are an important part of restricting supply of alcohol. Before the human rights lobby jumps up and down and says, 'What about the right to drink?', I say, 'What about the rights of the children in those communities and what about the rights of the sober grandparents who are frequently holding the places together?' That is who we should be thinking about when we are thinking about this legislation before us and we are thinking the about additional measures to strengthen these communities. We must cut the supply of alcohol, and this bill before us will assist in putting in place strong alcohol management plans to address it. At the same time we must address the cash side of the equation. It is one thing if you have your own job, you are earning your own money and you want to go and spend it on booze. Go for your life. But frequently it is the broader Australian community, through our taxes, who are funding the alcohol habits occurring in these places, and that is something we need to be more persistent and more aggressive about. I do not think any Australian citizen expects their tax dollars to be going towards subsidising someone's alcohol problem and causing the social breakdown of communities. Some sensible measures have started to be put in place, measures such as income management, which is starting to be rolled out in many places. I think that is a good thing, and it can be rolled out further where there are significant problems such as alcohol and other abuses. I move now to the second measure, having briefly addressed the issues in relation to alcohol abuse. The second measure in this bill concerns land reform. In essence, this allows for longer term leases so that people can have, hopefully, home ownership and it allows for longer term leases so that businesses can set up premises with the security of knowing that they will not be ejected from their premises at any time soon. Again, this particular measure is a good measure and it is in the right direction. But these measures have been painfully slow to come into being across remote Indigenous Australia. We have been talking about home ownership now for probably a decade-in this parliament through the parliamentarians who were here before I was elected and certainly through the leadership of people like Noel Pearson, Warren Mundine, Wesley Aird and others who have been strongly advocating for home ownership opportunities in the remote communities. Home ownership is important not just because it would facilitate people achieving something which they want-to own their own property-but because it actually empowers individuals. It gives responsibility back to people so that they can take care of their own housing. That is something which is missing in the remote communities. In most remote communities people are disempowered and have very little opportunity to make their own choices in relation to housing. If they want to build a new room, they cannot just go and do that. They have to go to their local council and lobby and hopefully there will be some government funds to enable them to get a bigger house. This is fundamentally an issue about individual responsibility and about empowering individuals to take care of their own housing needs. Better tenure is also vitally important for business development because, as most people in this chamber will know, you will not get business development and you will not get sustained economic growth anywhere in the world unless you have security of property and security of contract. They are two preconditions for sustainable economic growth. And in the remote communities presently across the Northern Territory and indeed across Australia there is very little security of tenure to allow businesses to start and to allow businesses to thrive. This measure will go some way towards addressing that and I hope that means we will soon be able to have good security of tenure so that businesses can thrive in these remote locations. This takes me to the third provision, which relates to food security. In some respects this measure perplexes me and frustrates me-that we in this parliament have to be debating provisions about food security and about opening food stores in places far removed from where we are in the nation's capital, thousands of kilometres away from the remote communities. It relates to the land security issue. If there were land security and places where private enterprises could open up easily and meet the demand which exists, we would not have to be having this debate and this conversation over this particular measure. Then you would get a local entrepreneur who might say, 'I just might open up a small food store and service the local 1,000 members of this community.' That is how it should occur. We do not stand here debating the local community stores in downtown Canberra or in downtown Knox, where I am from. Nor should we be debating the community stores in downtown Wadeye or Aurukun. Unfortunately still, while land security issues are not fixed, we have to address this and, because of that, I reluctantly support the measure in front of me. In the last few minutes remaining I will touch on some broader issues. Even with these measures in front of us I do not believe we are addressing the fundamental problem confronting remote Indigenous communities-that is, that we have a policy of subsidised disengagement. For 40 years we have had an implicit Indigenous policy in this nation of subsidised disengagement where, in essence, we pay people and support them to live in a place of their choice regardless of the economic viability of that location. We need to move away from that to a position firmly based on economic engagement in the real economy, where people are fully educated to be mobile and to exploit the opportunities which present themselves right across Australia. That is the main game, in my view, which we as a country still fail to be serious about. We to be serious about tackling head-on welfare dependency and subsidised disengagement. No group of people on the planet will prosper in a welfare economy. It does not matter who you are, what your cultural background is, or what your skin colour is. No group of people anywhere on the planet has prospered in a welfare economy. Indigenous people are no exception, yet we still have policies which create incentives people to remain in remote communities rather than to be mobile, accepting jobs located elsewhere across Australia. This is not a foreign concept to many remote Indigenous Australians. Speak to the older Indigenous Australians and they will tell you that 30 or 40 years ago they worked in Rockhampton, Mount Isa, up in Cape York or over in the Northern Territory. They followed the jobs, but that is not happening any more in part because our welfare system has a 90-minute rule which says that people do not have to look for a job if it is more than 90 minutes from where they reside. That means people in remote communities do not have to look for a job. So you have fully able-bodied people graduating from high school who go straight onto welfare queues. After two or three years on welfare, they will be further weakened and debilitated. At the very least, the able-bodied people who graduate from school should have to leave their communities to get a job. We do not do a service to those individuals, to their families or to the Australian community by continuing with the policy of welfare dependence in remote locations. I strongly support the alcohol measures in this bill and I support the measures targeted at providing greater security of tenure. But, most importantly, we still need to address welfare dependency, which is rife.",90
152,Mr HAASE,BILLS," It gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak to the need Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The first item I would like to address is the statement from my colleague the member for Aston. I agree with 99.9 per cent of everything he said, apart from the oft repeated phrase that no-one in any culture makes a future out of welfare. I can assure him that in the seat of Durack there are many environments where individuals make a great deal of money out of welfare. They are all for responsible for taking money out of Indigenous pockets and putting it into white pockets. They rub their hands together with glee every time there is another welfare policy devised by federal government. We have ample evidence to suggest that only a minimal number of projects-out of the many which have been amply funded by the federal taxpayer-have made a substantial difference to the ongoing welfare and future direction of Indigenous people across Australia. That is the issue we need to address in our debate in this place. Listeners and viewers would be well aware that in opposition we have very little control over the policies proposed by the government. This proposition alone simply gives further carriage and guarantee to propositions put together by the Howard government. Had many of those propositions not been watered down so severely in the early days, I suggest we may have been a little further down the road of progress, a little further down the road of giving back self-esteem to Indigenous people in engaging with Western society and moving forward removed from the necessity of the welfare paddock. Jackie Dann from the West Kimberley in a paper years ago said, 'Release us from the welfare paddock. You are destroying our culture, you are destroying us as individuals.' So true were his statements, but so little has changed if we speak of the period since the late 60s. Yes, we have addressed infant mortality in a very powerful way. Yes, we have addressed life expectancy in a substantial way. But if you go to the readily found examples you will find no great improvement in housing, no great improvement in school accommodation, no great improvement on education attained when concluding formal education and no reduction in incarceration. We have too much knowledge of the failure of individual Indigenous people and their collective communities and to date we have too little evidence of high achievement, except in some outstanding cases for individuals. It is that collective that we in this place are responsible for assisting and directing. Much has been said recently about closing the gap, but is there among departmental personnel who reside in Canberra a great wealth of knowledge about and commitment to that very decision to close the gap? I ask very rational question: what motivation is there for a department exclusively responsible for the well-being of Indigenous people to solve all the problems associated with the welfare of Indigenous people? I believe that people with foresight, vision and a sound mind might look to a future where government departments all over this nation specifically responsible for Indigenous affairs and their advancement install a sunset clause on the very existence of their agencies with a guarantee that those employees would move to other departments, without being disadvantaged, at a particular point in timea particularly point in time not measured by achievement but by a fixed date in the future. Everyone would be pressured to work to a conclusion that was satisfactory because they would know that the task was to be finished. It is a rather severe point that I make until such time as there is a major shake-up of existing Indigenous policy in the areas of housing, welfare, education, health et cetera, what are we going to find that will act as a catalyst for change? Many interested in the subject will know the intervention across Northern Australia was such a catalyst. It was a very necessary change that was brought about by a shocking report that revealed abuse of the youngest and most vulnerable in Indigenous communities. That was in part a catalyst, but it is quite obviously not enough because not enough change has taken place. Is it the fault of those employees of departments who are responsible for making contact and are very concerned that they need to cement those relationships face to face with a friendly embrace? Is it the fault of the individuals at a higher level for delegating the employees to particular tasks? Is it the responsibility of yet higher authorities for developing these onesize-fits-all solutions? I suggest it is a combination of many of those aspects, but a basically we have a condition that I call box ticking. Many people that are removed from the day-today shock and horror of Indigenous communities find it very easy to scurry into these communities, consult briefly, tick some boxes and go back to comfortable suburbia. It does Indigenous people no good. It does our reputation as legislators no good. It does nothing to improve the status and reputation of so many government agencies. In my electorate of Durack, where approximately 14 per cent of the population are Indigenous, I see replication of agency visits on a day-today basis. A stream of white Falcons or Holdens make a beeline to communities. They all consult; they all tick the box; and they all leave again.",93
153,Mr Laming,BILLS,Seagulls.,94
154,Mr HAASE,BILLS,"My colleague reminds me but, the ones that fly in on a regular basis are more aptly referred to as seagulls. Indigenous people are sick and tired of them. They are sick and tired of being told that task is easy-nominate, volunteer, participate-and then, because that particular program fails, the individuals involved are criticised for being worthless. The tolerance of members of remote Indigenous communities wears thin. They have been tested, trained, put over the hurdles, cajoled and accused time and time again. The last time that we saw a quantum leap in the advancement and well-being of Indigenous people after the arrival of the First Fleet was probably the arrival of the missionaries across remote Australia. At that point in time education was given. Guidance that was believed to be necessary for assimilation was given. The outcomes of course were much less than the expectations of those missionaries involved, but their intent was great and good and their commitment was great and good. The criticism that they have had heaped upon them since those day is in the main unjustified. I know that in my original patch of Kalgoorlie in the Eastern Goldfields all the successfully employed and deployed Indigenous people had a solid grounding of education in mission schools-Mount Margaret, Warakurna, Warburton. Further north into the Kimberley there were remarkable institutions such as Balgo, Beagle Bay, Forrest River, Kalumburu. They were establishments that taught. They did not strive for an 18-month or two-year cultural experience to enjoy the romance of it all and then go back home and dine out on it for the next 20 years, which is so often the case today. They were actually committed to the task. They then were often pilloried for their involvement in conditions that were considered unacceptable to the delicate nature of urban dwellers. Today, we are faced with a debate on legislation that is once again going to regulate the behaviour of Indigenous communities. As I said, in the the main it is regulation that was introduced by the Howard government as a matter of necessity. It was necessary then, it is necessary now and it should be embraced. Any opportunity to impose more rigour on that legislation should be taken, because as legislators we cannot afford to simply wish to avoid offence. There has been far too much of that on the part of legislators in the past. My Indigenous friends across the Durack electorate understand discipline. They understand the necessity for rigour. They understand the necessity for their children and grandchildren to get an education. I am speaking in the main of those people who got their education at the hands of the missionaries and got jobs on pastoral stations. Those people absolutely deplore the current situation where sit-down money is paid. There is no rigour in expectations of the performance of Indigenous individuals or collective communities. There is very little respect for the concept of of mutual obligation. There is almost an epidemic condition where people say, 'We may be expected by departments on high to make a performance at such and such a level, but past experience tells us that we will never be expected to reach that level so why should it bother.' That condition and that experience do not teach discipline. It does not teach the individual that they will stand out in a group by putting their shoulder to the wheel and going the extra yard, and being rewarded for it. They will more likely remember the experience of sticking their head up and being noticed, and possibly having their head knocked off, figuratively speaking, because they took the initiative to do something. All of our policies to date have been more about ticking boxes, presuming that those who are ignorant of the real conditions will accept our platitudes, our cheque-writing and our visitation as something that will seriously contribute to the betterment of Indigenous people. The reality is that it not be further from the truth. What we need is a number of people who are truly committed to getting a job done, a number of people whose continued employment will depend on their performance rather than their processing of numbers. We need a group of people who understand rigour and the necessity for it to realise great outcomes for communities. We need a group of people who understand that without rigour Indigenous people will have no respect whatsoever for the agents of change that are visiting their communities. Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, I know that you know I speak from experience and I speak from the heart, but it is an ongoing and long-term project to educate all the members of this House as to what really should be done and what really is expected in remote Indigenous communities across Australia. The most important ingredient I believe is rigour. That rigour must be found in all dealings we have with those communities. The first step in the development of a human being is education. If we do not get that education right and if we do not make that process attractive for the families of Indigenous children, they will never be engaged in the process of insisting that their children attend school. This legislation will make some small contribution if applied with rigour to ensure that that is the outcome and individuals get their lives back.",94
155,Mr LAMING,BILLS," In wrapping up this debate, I note that it has been disjointed because we are debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 and the cognate bills, Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011 and Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011, together. For those who are listening to this debate and find us hopping could from income management in urban Australia to alcohol management in the Northern Territory, the best way I can summarise where we are at is that we have had both an apology and a commitment bilaterally from both sides of this chamber to closing the gap. But, today, this government has brought to this House a series of bills that do little more than duplicate or timidly expand what already exists in the area of alcohol and income management. In Stronger Futures, the Commonwealth government is duplicating the abilities of the Northern Territory government to make certain determinations around alcohol management. All things considered, that is a fairly timid move into this greatly distressing area. Worldwide, right across humanity, we know that around five litres of pure alcohol per person aged over the age 15 is drunk, and in the Northern Territory it is three times that amount-50 per cent higher than it is for the rest of Australia, more than three standard drinks per person, whether they are drinkers or not, over the age of 15. These are greatly concerning figures that well-meaning groups like the People's Alcohol Action Coalition have emphasised must be addressed through supply reduction. You simply cannot wait for demand changes to take root in the context of complete dysfunction. Having been warned of this and the important steps that were taken with the Northern Territory intervention, it is ironic that today we are debating transitional and consequential provisions that will end those five-year periods for the Northern Territory intervention and replace them with alcohol plans that, for the most part, are agreed by both sides of this chamber. My great concern is that, with these reforms that run for another 10 years with review at seven and then ultimately reporting at eight years, we will find little difference on the ground at end of that period. That is why we need to be very frustrated about what is being debated here today. What has been put before the chamber will make almost no difference to what happens in Alice Springs. It will allow the federal government, if it chooses, to ask an independent assessor to identify whether there are breaches of the Northern Territory act. It will allow the federal government to introduce regulations that will become an amendment to a piece of Northern Territory legislation, in the hope that the Northern Territory does not remove those amendments in their own parliament. In the grand context of alcohol abuse and in the context of child abuse and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, this legislation does not take us even a few millimetres closer to a solution. To use that metaphor of the duck gliding across the water but paddling underneath, on this side of the House we have the inverted duck: lots of flapping above the water but no propulsion under the water. No, because this is a government appealing to both sides of the street. We have many people in the House today; we have many of them down from the Northern Territory deeply aggrieved by the Northern Territory intervention and, still to this day, deeply wounded by the lack of consultation. This government has now had five years to do the consultation, but that has not occurred. Sure, there have been chartered flights up, with ministers dropping into talk and sympathise about the intervention, but there has been little more than that. On the same side of this debate, this is a government that wants to travel around the rest of Australia and flex its muscle to show how much it has done in welfare reform. So, if you are looking for those little clues, where you talk tough to the rest of Australia the and are then very apologetic to those in the Centre who complain, then look no further than this social security amendment. The Northern Territory emergency intervention, flawed as it was in its lack of consultation, rolled out clear indications about reductions in trauma and improvements in school attendance. We have had, thanks to Noel Pearson, the interventions in Cape York that have shown distinct improvements in attendance at school and reduction in presentations to magistrates. We have seen in Cape York, after Family Responsibilities Commission hearings, 50 per cent of people having their income quarantined only to move through the quarantine and come out the other side adhering to the positive social norms that we desire to cultivate all around Australia. These are self-imposed, selfagreed social norms like sending your kids to school, not harming them, paying your rent and staying out of court. They are simple things that most parts of the world can agree on, but we have not gone beyond Cape York at this stage. Under this government we had a two-year trial in two Western Australian locations: one in the Kimberley and one in Perth. That trial was evaluated by ORIMA, who found virtually no fault in the application of voluntary income management and income management under conditions where childwelfare is at stake. It is almost a no-brainer. As controversial it might have been 10 years ago, even the government's own assessment and evaluation says that it works. So what does the pea-hearted mob on the other side of the chamber do? They design another two-year trial with exactly the same intervention; having just had the trial evaluated and found to be effective! They are rolling it out in five tiny communities around Australia-that is what we are debating today-which make up less than one per cent of the population. It will not include anyone in the Prime Minister's electorate, anyone in the health minister's electorate, anyone in the previous health minister's electorate or anyone in the Treasurer's electorate. No, this trial involves just five urban communities. Sure, these communities are vulnerable, but what are they going to do there? They are going to allow social workers to determine if someone is vulnerable and, if so, they will be offered the opportunity to have their income managed. We may be dealing with a couple of hundred people in those areas. There is nothing left that is complicated or controversial about this anymore. We have had years to evaluate this. But this timid step, which is barely forward, just shows a government that is unable to really grasp the issue of welfare reform. In fact, they are being left behind by the community. If you ask them, most of the community would say, 'If you're abusing kids, probably the first thing you should do is quarantine some income, manage it with the assistance of a social worker, and make sure the child does not miss out.' How does this party over here, with its heritage of looking after low-income earners and highly vulnerable in Australia and our community, rest and reconcile that with this piece of legislation that just creeps along with another two years of pilot programs? What would anyone say to the other 99 per cent of Australia, where there is no income quarantined, about people who are either abusing or threatening their kids through poor use of income and government welfare? It is utterly appalling that this is rolling out nationwide. It is appalling that the rest of Australia is denied that basic service of voluntary income management, particularly for those that have child welfare notifications that come from state governments. This is beyond being even remotely interesting for researchers now. The proof is in. The government funded research, the government funded evaluations and the time of this chamber, on I admit a day of great distraction, is being consumed moving a bill to allow another two years of pilot programs. The time for pilot programs must surely be coming to an end. Five locations in five tiny suburbs, under these provisions, is nowhere near what is required in a context where it has been evaluated, re-evaluated and reevaluated again. I admit that the BasicsCard has had some teething problems in the Northern Territory. It is effectively a value-storing card that is PIN-protected and from which you can only use between 50 and 70 per cent of your income on essential services. But we have reached a point now where there is enough diversity and enough providers that in most parts of Northern Territory there is no problem with the BasicsCard or a need to continue evaluating it. We are moving to the point now where we need greater debate about whether all welfare recipients, in fact all people who are on DSP, on Newstart or on various forms of parenting payment, should be subjected to 50 to 70 per cent income management to ensure that they are spending that welfare wisely. After all, it is government money, and is therefore for the provision of services to family and their children. But, no, what we are debating today is another pilot program. In the Northern Territory, there are some sensible changes, which will allow the not minister to make exceptions where alcohol is being carried over waterways, particularly for commercial or tourism purposes, and that makes good sense. I know also that the Australian Hotels Association's Northern Territory branch have articulated their utterly reasonable concerns about which level of government they answer to. I concede that they would have a concern that the federal government might be acting blindly without understanding the conditions on the ground. But I think the amendments that have been proposed by the member for Menzies are common sense. They propose that the first intervention for the federal government would be writing to the Territory equivalent responsible for NT liquor licensing, indicating their desire to have that particular area independently assessed. That makes good sense. It reduces, to some extent, the duplication that we are so concerned about on this side. In the Northern Territory at the moment they are simplifying what is going on. Woolworths and Coles have agreed to remove some of their cheapest versions of alcohol. That is right, the flavoured metho is no longer on the shelves in Alice Springs. That has to be a good thing. But, regrettably, there are still licensed premises that sell the cheapest forms of fortified and non-fortified cask wine. We are talking about alcohol priced in the vicinity of less than $1 per standard drink. Most recommendations have shown that if we can raise the minimum for a standard alcoholic unit to $1.20 we are some way towards reducing availability. We also have the great difficulty that hotels in Alice Springs trade seven days a week-whereas at least we know that shopping centres often are not trading on a Sunday-which means seven-day availability. Centrelink payments can be on any day of the week and that means there is no 'thirsty Thursday' anymore of the kind we used to experience in Tennant Creek. The arrangement was that on the day welfare was provided they would close the licensed premises. It gave mums and primary caregivers a chance to buy food on that day and not have much of it humbugged away into alcohol purchase and consumption. The great concern we have at the moment is that absolutely there is the supply, possession and consumption of alcohol to the degree that will always need alcohol management plans and at times federal prescribing of areas to have alcohol restrictions. There is no debate about that. The only concern is whether this federal government will work with and give notification to the Territory government. I do hope the minister who has entered the chamber now will consider that well-reasoned amendment, because it simply requires a letter to the NT minister to indicate that the federal government wishes to have an independent assessment, and for a vendor or a business to be given notice and a reasonable chance to respond. And of course there should be a chance for the Northern Territory government to respond if they think that there are financial or other reasons that make it difficult for them to comply or concur. In conclusion, what we have here is a timid step forward in the great fight against alcohol consumption in Central Australia. We know how important it is, as the member for Aston articulately put it-and the member for Durack has said it is well, as did the members for Murray and Hasluck. Without being trite, there has been a series of speeches given on this side of the House that I thought were insightful. I thought they showed a clear understanding of how things work in Indigenous communities. But all that we have had from the government, from the great party looking after the vulnerable and the poor, were these fairly ordinary superficial responses that this is part of the government agenda to move things along. Mark my words-with this legislation rolled out, I challenge the government to say whether there will be any change in five years. Is there any change in simply replicating the powers of the NT government in Canberra? Little. This government has failed to actually stand up to the forces that are making alcohol widely available in areas like Alice Springs. They have failed to set up the training arrangements that obligate young working-age Aboriginal Australians to undertake training, and to take jobs when they are suitable. They have failed to engage the people in town camps around Alice Springs, who remain wholly and solely, in many cases, utterly dysfunctional and dependent upon alcohol provision. It gives me the sense that it is a government that has just run out of ideas. History shall record that this government, when given the chance, could think of nothing more than duplicating the powers of another jurisdiction. This is a government so timid in their moves towards welfare reform that we have had not one trial in the NT, two in Cape York and three in WA fully evaluated at government expense-yet they have announced another five trial sites. This is a government where the warm embrace of welfare reform is nothing more than cold and chilling. Welfare reform threatens the key constituencies of this government and that is why they will do everything they can to make it look like they are flapping wildlybut moving ahead they will not be. No, they will simply announce trial after trial and make glib announcements and give press conferences about the hard work they are doing. But I can assure those at every level in the government that years from now this slow progress will have done nothing for families who struggle with alcohol consumption, for families who struggle with the implications of that, and for the children who need our protection. This government could do far worse than take on some of our recommendations and move far faster than they have",96
156,Mr KATTER,BILLS," This bill is an admission of defeat. Clearly, it admission of defeat, and all the government can do is just try to suppress the symptoms. That is what is happening here. Unfortunately and sadly, I have had to preside over a town, my own home town of Mount Isa, where we have had 25 suicidesand I think that 21 or 22 of those were first Australians. In the forum that we had-and we thank the Prime Minister very much for sending up the relevant minister-the locals said that whenever they have a person at risk all they have to talk to are some whitefellas who are entirely foreign to them in every way. They are not people the locals are going to open up to or feel comfortable with. They are not people from the local community. A huge amount of money is going to these people, money that really should be going to the local people. They are not trained, because I do not think that it is an area in which you can be trained. It is an area in which, if you have an ability to relate, it can be of some advantage. I was quite staggered when I heard about the last two suicides as they were very much middle-class people. They were not people who had come in from the community areas, driven out by the liquor laws into the very bad rabbit warren areas in all of our towns and cities in North Queensland. I asked a person about the problem, a man whom I greatly respect-and I do not know whether I should mention his name, but I will-Chris Squelsh, who works in this area in North Queensland. Chris said, 'If you are a young mother and you get a knock on the door from the police saying that your son has been accused of throwing rocks through windows'-and Chris was not referring to any mother but just quoting numerous cases that he had had over the last two or three years-'or if you are a young mother and you have QBuild knocking on your door because is an you have not paid your rent and giving you one week before they throw you out into the street and your children are crying as they have no food because your husband took all the money and blew it on grog, gambling and everything else, or if you are a young mother and the children's services'-and this is very relevant to this bill-'turn up and say that they are taking the children off you because they are not being properly looked after, what would you do in that situation?' Chris said, 'What would you do when your husband is bringing all his drunken friends over for a party at the house with all the ills that follow on? Would you be out of your mind with terror?' This bill gives power to further terrorise these poor people. Are we addressing the problems that exist there? If I had the power, I could fix this thing up in 10 seconds in town. It is simply a matter of separating the 15 people living in a house with everyone getting on each other's nerves and a complete lack of anywhere to sleep even within the house of a night, no air-conditioning and absolutely unbearable heat because the house they built was enormously inappropriate. All of the land around Mount Isa is pastoral lease land. The government can resume it at any time they feel like and divide it up into one-hectare blocks or smaller. There is no curbing and channelling or sewage required or anything. We are talking about maybe $20,000 at the outside. Then they can build their own houses with CDEP money. Sometimes I feel that I must be a very ineffective person because I have come in here and logically, again and again, put up simply what the people asked for. I was a minister in Queensland. I cannot claim any credit for this. Let me be very specific. Greg Wallace at Napranum said, 'We will get people to work for the dole.' Extraordinarily, he got people to voluntarily work for the dole. He got on 60 minutes, such was the reaction. It is the only time that 60 minutes did two programs on the one issue within two weeks. Noel Pearson's brother Gerhardt-and I should not identify him that way because he is a person in his own right-as CEO of Hope Vale rang me up and said, 'Why can't we use CDEP money to build houses?' Gerry Hand said, 'That is a great idea.' I am not here to denigrate the minister, but I put this idea to the minister again and again. When I put it to Gerry Hand, within two weeks we had the CDEP money mobilised to build the houses. Gerry said, 'What a great idea,' and I cannot help but add that he said, 'That is a brilliant idea; it could not have come from you.' I said: 'No, it did not. It came from a bloke called Gerhardt Pearson, CEO at Hope Vale.' But that was not the end of the story. I that name with great pride my late and great friend Lester Rosendale, one of the most prominent people in Aboriginal affairs in Australia. One of my staff got a job with him because she also had very great respect for Lester Rosendale. Lester and Eric Law, who was effectively head of the department that I was responsible for, got an agreement that all houses would be built by exclusively local Indigenous labour. I was very angry because it was a fait accompli. I was not even consulted. These two senior public servants just took it in their own heads to go off and do it. One was a Hope Vale boy and another one a Cherbourg boy, but both were very senior-ranking public servants. I as the minister was very angry that I had not even been consulted. I said, 'What are you going to do: ask people who cannot even read or write to build their own houses?' They went ahead with it. They ignored me and boxed me into a corner and we built the houses. That is still not the end of the story. Donnie Fraser, the Mayor of Doomadgee, rang me up and said,' Why can't we build our own blocks?' I had a terrible fight with him which he won. I said, 'All right, 'I will put one or two in as a pilot,' and they were tremendously successful. When we were up at TI a few days ago they said, 'Why can't we access the blocks from the block-making machine at Bamaga?' I said: 'I don't know if it is still going. I think I put it there and was an awfully long time ago!' But then they produced their own blocks. We only had enough money to build 600 houses, but as a result we ended up building over 2,000 houses from not paying a king's ransom to white contractors. I am not denigrating white contractors-some of them are good mates of mine-but they have to pay people to come in, they have to pay their board and accommodation and, because they are away from home, the people have to be paid a fortune in travel costs. It is week on, week off in half these cases. They are going backwards and forwards all the time at enormous cost. If you do not work with local labour, you double the cost simply because you are flying people into build the homes. People will take great pride in their homes. Mossman Gorge is still one of the leading tourist attractions in North Queensland. When I went there every single home had graffiti and worse on the sides and the windows smashed. Some of them were fibrolite and you could look straight in because the fibrolite had been broken as well. The grass was waist high. When they started building their own homes there was not a single mark of graffiti, and they tell me there is still not a single mark of graffiti. All of the lawns are mown down to almost manicure status. They went out and got their own tourist operation. Again, I emphasise that I had nothing to do with it. I say to the minister for the 400th time and I tell the House for the 400th time that there are two simple things that you can do. The people of Australia gave you the power in 1966. And if there were any doubt the High Court gave it to you again in the case of Mabo, Passey and Rice and the Queensland government. They gave you the power to issue title deeds. I went up there to do a bit of campaigning and, most of all, I desperately needed to that know what the position on title deeds was in the Torres Strait. I did not speak-it is pretty rare for me not to get a word in-because people were jumping for the microphone to say they needed title deeds. We did not initiate the discussions; at the two public meetings they initiated the discussions. One meeting was called by the trade union, but they all came along and talked about title deeds. This is so simple. If you issued title deeds at Yarrabah they could borrow money and build their own homes. After all, it is the Yarrabah people's land. People say it is not as simple as that. I found it was as simple as that. I simply sat down. Lester Rosendale had already done it at Hope Vale, and I simply copied what Lester had done at Hope Vale. They said that the only title deeds there, the only privately owned land that is not owned by people of European descent, are because of title deeds issued in that brief period. Everyone thought I would be there forever and these laws would be there forever. Everyone was on island time and they did not do what they should have done, which was to get in and take up the title deeds when they were on offer. Some of them did and that is what they were talking about the other day. Having returned from the Torres Strait, I cannot speak today without saying-and I have to choose my words very carefullythere is a race of people there that have diabetes in epidemic proportions. I have had discussions with Professor Wronski about this as he was the first person to tell me about it. I went there as minister until 1990 and every meal I had was locally produced: fruit, vegetables, dugong, turtle or fish, with fish being the predominant one. They have fish traps there et cetera. When I went there for closing the gap, I could not work out if the minister goes up there. People were screaming out in rage about closing the gap; the gap is widening into a gulf. We went there on a closing-the-gap delegation-what a joke. I felt so ashamed and embarrassed to return there. Not a single thing has been implemented or done to overcome the problem. Joey Masbi from York Island screamed out and his brother or cousin Thomas who runs the bus said: 'Joey is dead right. AQIS is starving us.' By AQIS he means the Fisheries Management Authority and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority which are enforcing things to please the Greens and get the support of the Greens. It would be nice if Minister Macklin would listen to what I am saying, but I do suppose she listens to any of the first Australian people either.",100
157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Kennedy is reflecting upon the minister. I call him to account.,103
158,Mr KATTER,BILLS,The minister is not interested in listening to these people who are dying of diabetes because they have no fresh fruit and vegetables. There is no employment there. You will not let them build their own houses. You will not give them the title deeds so they can do it for themselves. (Time expired),103
159,Ms MACKLIN,BILLS,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (17:49): I thank all the contributors to this debate. We are looking three bills: the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill 2011, the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2011 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. The bills together form part of the government's next steps to tackle what are unacceptable levels of disadvantage still being experienced by far too many Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. We are determined to take these steps with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and, of course, with the Northern Territory government. It is all about making sure that we can build a stronger future for Aboriginal people and with Aboriginal people in the Territory. It is also very clearly about making sure that Aboriginal people can live more independent lives, lives in safer communities without violence and the terrible effects of alcohol abuse, where children are healthy and eat healthy food, where children go to school every day, where parents go to work and not where families can live in decent housing. I think all of us know that the gap is the widest in the Northern Territory. All of the data and all of the research tell us that. That is why this legislation is in front of the House today in the way that it is. We know that if we are to achieve real change for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, it is going to take a long period of intensive work and significant investment. The situation does still remain critical. The measures in these bills tackle substantive problems and barriers. Some of the measures are very strong. The measures are designed to be fair. A lot of people have been consulted before decisions which will affect and them have been made. It is very clear that if we are to work together in the way that we have outlined in the introduction of these at bills, in the debate today and in the way in which we want to work together, none of us can walk away. All of us know that have to continue to work very hard to turn what are very difficult and critical situations around. I will shortly be moving some minor amendments to the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Bill to clarify the intention of the bill. These amendments will clarify that part 4 of the new act, relating to food security, has effect notwithstanding one existing Commonwealth Competition and Consumer Act 2010rather than despite Commonwealth laws generally. I thank the opposition for their support today and indicate that we will be supporting the amendments that I understand they will be moving.",103

168,Mr COMBET,BILLS,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:03): I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will introduce a number of measures that will strengthen and streamline the Higher Education Support Act 2003 resulting in more effective and efficient administration of the Australian and government's student income-contingent loan programs in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors, namely, FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. The bill provides for the use and disclosure of information by Commonwealth officers gained through the administration of FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP for certain purposes including to the newly established national regulators in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors, namely the Australian Skills Quality Authority and the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency operating under the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 and the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 respectively. This will support consistent decision making across Commonwealth regulatory frameworks. The bill will also improve the Commonwealth's ability to manage risk to the administration of public moneys and better protect students in the vocational education and training sector strengthening the compliance provisions for approved VET providers. As provider approvals are issued in perpetuity, the bill makes it explicit that an approved VET provider must notify the minister of events that affect its ability to comply with the requirements to continue to maintain its approved provider status. Further, the bill includes a transparent provision to make it clear that the secretary may vary or revoke a determination that an advance payment is to be made to a VET provider if the secretary is aware that the provider may not comply with the requirements under the act or may not be financially viable. In deciding to vary or revoke, matters which the secretary may take into consideration have been provided for, such as the nature of non-compliance, the provider's history of compliance and the impact of the provider's non-compliance on its ability to deliver quality education and training. The bill will also improve the administrative arrangements for application times for higher education providers and VET providers. This amendment will clarify that the minister's authority to decide an application for approval exists beyond the time periods specified under the act. And, finally, the bill provides for clearer, simpler and improved administrative arrangements for the assessment of an individual's higher education loan program debt. In doing so, the bill enables improved congruity between the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and taxation legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",105
169,Ms LEY,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Other Measures) Bill 2011. by The coalition is committed to ensuring that Australian education is world class. Be it our university sector or our vocational education sector, we are determined that we shall be recognised globally as a standard bearer. We need a system defined by its academic quality, flexibility and ability to promote productivity. The coalition supported both the establishment of TEQSA, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, and also a national VET regulator to provide for a more systematic process of registration and auditing for vocational education and training, commonly known as VET. It was the creation of these two agencies that in part led to one of the key aims of this bill. Part 3 of the bill outlines the use and disclosure of information collected from providers during their application process. This will enable the sharing of this information with the national regulatory agencies. Without doubt, the vocational sector had been plagued by a number of serious regulatory problems, resulting in the need for a real overhaul. We acknowledge that the system required a more stringent, consistent model of regulation and we supported the implementation of this model, albeit highlighting that the national VET regulator does not offer a truly national system of regulation as it currently stands because Western Australia and Victoria have chosen to remain outside the system. This bill specifically provides for greater compliance provisions for VET providers. Higher education does not just provide us with a home-grown workforce, it is also a vital export. Therefore it is critical that we ensure the end product is of as high a standard as possible. We want to be considered as a world leader and in order for this to occur we need a sound framework. That being said, we need a transparent, accountable system of regulation. But the coalition will not condone a system that is plagued by red tape. We need to audit smarter, not harder. The former coalition government introduced income contingent loans to the VET sector in 2007. This helped extend education opportunities to those who had never previously believed a higher education was within their grasp. VET FEE-HELP enables all Australians to benefit from training, giving people a better employment future. Schedule 2 of the bill clarifies that Higher Education Support Act is to this extent a tax law, for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act, ensuring that the responsibility for the collection of the debt incurred via VET FEE-HELP or FEEHELP rests with the taxation commissioner. This bill seeks to amend the provisions concerning the permissible time frame the minister has in order to approve a request to become a higher education or VET provider. Currently, the minister has 90 days in which to approve the application from the receipt of the application. This bill will ensure that even if this time frame is not met, the minister may still approve the provider. The coalition does, however, caution the minister that a blow-out in time for approvals will not be acceptable. Part 4 ensures that the secretary can revoke or alter a determination that an advance can be made to a provider. Again, the circumstances under which this may occur are outlined and provide that serious cases of misconduct can result in action from the Commonwealth. Part 2 of the bill introduces subclauses 25 (2) and (3), outlining the circumstances in which a provider must provide written information to the minister when they believe they are in breach of their contractual requirements. Certainly, to some this may appear to be bit of a nanny state clause; however, on the understanding that in the first instance the department will work with the provider to rectify any problems, the coalition, whilst having some concerns, recognises that this mirrors a clause in the National VET Regulator Bill and we will not be opposing this measure. As a country we need to ensure that we are positioning ourselves in the best possible space to deliver high-quality, industry-driven training. Vocational training has such a critical role to play here in helping us meet the the future workforce challenges in both existing industries such as mining and in new economies yet to be explored. Whilst these are good measures, regrettably we do find ourselves facing some significant challenges in the VET sphere. The national partnership agreement as reannounced by the Prime Minister earlier this year has been the subject of much speculation. Ultimately, this was little more than a re-announcement of a plan for a new national partnership agreement. The 'national entitlement for a training place' is indeed nothing new. Labor committed to this in the 2010-11 budget, and I draw the responsible minister's attention to the Skills for Sustainable Growth fact sheet, What is the national entitlement to a quality training place? The word 'quality' appears to have vanished, but there is little else of difference nearly two years on. Given this government's significant botching of the Productivity Places Program, it could be time that they conceded they do not have the skills or the know-how to implement VET programs. They got so desperate with the Productivity Places Program that they were forced to handball them off to the states, then surreptitiously siphon off the money to other programs that they hoped to brand more favourably. This could well be why, as I understand it, states are a little reluctant to sign on the dotted this time around. However, despite the numerous problems that have been the making of the federal government in this space, we do have thousands of committed providers who are endeavouring to do their best to provide a quality education both for local and international students. The coalition is committed to assisting these providers to operate within a framework that ensures a quality education within sensible business parameters for these training businesses. We clearly have a way to go to in order to ensure that Australia is a preferred choice for international students seeking the best quality education, and for Australian students wanting a globally competitive advantage. But we in the coalition are committed to this goal and we do trust that this bill, properly administered in a policy sense, will help to realise this ambition. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (18:13): I rise today to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Ensuring that our workforce has the necessary skills and education in the contemporary Australian job market is vital to the health of Australia's economy and competitiveness in the global community. The Gillard government is reforming our vocational education and training system to give Australians skills for life-skills to get a new start, a better job and a higher pay packet. Since coming into office, Labor has made a record investment in training to build a highly skilled workforce, to boost productivity and to increase participation. We want Australians to have access to the high-skill, high-paid jobs of tomorrow. In the current economic environment, we have an urgent need to lift skill levels and workforce participation in Australia to allow industry line and individual Australians the capacity to respond flexibly to current economic developments. We live in a global world and we need to be competitive. That means we need people with more skills and higher level skills. By 2015 Australia will need an additional 2.4 million workers with qualifications at a Certificate III level and higher to meet the needs of the economy. Labor recognises that now is the time for VET reform. We have committed $1.75 billion over five years for a new skills reform national partnership agreement with the states. This is in addition to the $1.4 billion the Commonwealth provides annually to states and territories to fund their VET system. These reforms are aimed at making training more accessible, of a higher quality and more transparent to consumers. This bill will introduce measures that will strengthen and streamline the government's student income contingent loan programs in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors-namely, FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. Through these schemes the government will provide a loan for all or part of a student's tuition fees and pay these fees directly to the approved education provider. Students in diploma and advanced diploma courses will no longer have to pay their course fees upfront. They will have access to an income contingent loan, similar to the HELP system in higher education. This will boost participation rates in higher level VET courses and provide the highly skilled workers that industry needs. Importantly, this bill will improve the Commonwealth's ability to manage risks to the administration of public moneys and better protect students in the vocational education and training sector strengthening the compliance provisions for approved VET providers. Further, the bill includes a transparent provision to make it clear that the secretary may vary or revoke a determination that an advance payment is to be made to a VET provider if the secretary is aware that the provider may not comply with the requirements under the act or may not be financially viable. Matters that the secretary may take into consideration on the decision on whether or not to revoke may include the nature of non-compliance, the provider's history of compliance and the impact of non-compliance on delivering quality education and training. When it comes to better quality training, the government is also pursuing reforms to ensure that students are receiving highquality training that meets the needs of industry. We need to ensure that employers can trust in the quality of our VET system. These reforms will build on the new regulatory requirements that this government has already put in place for the establishment of the National VET Regulator, which is now operating in five jurisdictions. TAFEs are also an integral part of the reforms. TAFEs play an important role in serving the training needs of industry. Labor recognises their importance to local communities in their delivery of high-level training and workforce development for industries and improved skill and job opportunities for disadvantaged learners and communities. In recognition of their role, this government has invested heavily in the infrastructure of our TAFEs as part of the $4.5 billion commitment in tertiary infrastructure from the Education Investment Fund. That investment has seen many facilities updated for the first time in 40 or more years, including automotive workshops and building trades centres. by Further, the government is providing greater responsiveness to industry needs. To lift national productivity, Commonwealth and state and territory governments need to work closely with industry and employers to ensure the VET sector can respond quickly and efficiently to deliver the right skills, at the right time, to meet industry needs. This bill provides for clearer, simpler and improved administrative arrangements for the assessment of an individual's Higher Education Loan Program debt. In doing so, the bill enables better consistency between the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and tax legislation. In the electorate of Petrie, our VET providers are committed to providing support and opportunities to their students and, with the introduction of this bill, I am confident that Labor have demonstrated once again that we are the party of jobs, skills and workforce participation by expanding opportunities for individuals to access further education. On top of the many significant reforms and investments into higher education and skills that I have already mentioned, the Gillard government have a strong history of achieving in this area. Labor have made skills and training the centrepiece of this year's budget. We announced a $3 billion investment in skills and training to address the skills shortages being experienced by industry. We have put more young people into training. Apprenticeship and traineeship numbers have soared over recent years-up from 410,000 in September 2006 to around 459,000 in March 2011, the highest level ever recorded. We made a record government investment of more than $11.1 billion in total skills funding between 2008 and 2011-an increase of almost 55 per cent compared to the $7.2 billion under the former government between 2005 and 2008. We have boosted the number of VET students to more than ever before. Students undertaking vocational education and training studies with public support rose by eight per cent, up from 1.67 million in 2007 to 1.8 million in 2010. We have ensured a record number of apprenticeships and traineeships. In June 2011 there were more than 462,000 people undertaking apprenticeships and traineeships, up 14 per cent from 404,600 in December 2007. Labor has given more people the opportunity to gain qualifications than ever before. Nearly 400,000 people gained VET qualifications in 2009, up 23 per cent from 319,200 in 2007. Nearly 290,000 people gained higher level qualifications in 2009, up from 228,500 in 2007, a rise of 27 per cent. In 2010, almost 140,000 students who already had degreelevel qualifications studied VET, up 38 per cent from 101,400 in 2007. We have made training more accessible. In 2010, there were more than 26,000 VET FEE-HELP assisted students. This is an increase of nearly 400 per cent, or almost 5,300 students, compared to 2009. We have given better access to education for diverse groups. In 2010, there were 83,000 VET students who identified as being Indigenous, an increase of 17 per cent from 2007; 110,000 who identified as having a disability, an increase of eight per cent; 271,000 from non-English-speaking backgrounds, a 17.6 per cent increase. Finally, we have ensured 150,000 regional and remote students in 2009 completed VET qualifications, a 23 per cent increase from 2007. The Gillard Labor government is committed to education. Whether it is early childhood education, primary and secondary schooling, VET qualifications or higher education, this government is committed to delivering on education and skills for the future. Today we are debating another piece of legislation that sees Labor delivering on its commitment to developing skills to lift the nation's productivity. I know the people in my electorate are committed to skills improvement and want to see this government invest in apprenticeships and traineeships into the future. That is why it is my pleasure to commend this bill to the House. Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (18:23): I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This bill aims to provide administrative efficiencies in relation to the FEE-HELP and VET FEEHELP assistance schemes for vocational students. These include requiring VET providers to notify the minister if they will not be able to meet quality and accountability requirements, allowing for certain information to be used and disclosed if authorised, and allowing for the secretary to revoke a determination made to pay an advance to a VET provider. The bill also allows the minister responsible for deciding whether an institution can become a higher education provider to make that decision after the time frame of 90 days within which the decision is currently required. The coalition agrees with many of the intended outcomes of this bill that relate to and strengthening the compliance framework for VET providers. We have seen rorters take advantage of this sector. This bill aims to ensure that these things cannot happen again and that the sector can instead maintain consistently high standards of education. But there are also severe penalties for overreacting and burdening institutions with red tape. With a strong construction industry in Townsville and my electorate's position on the edge of the North-West Queensland Minerals Province, vocational education is extremely important to my constituents. Bob MCAulay has just stepped in as Director of the Barrier Reef Institute of TAFE in Townsville, temporarily replacing current Director, Robyn Dyer. As Bob has said to me, 74 per cent of jobs in the Far North region are jobs that have benefited from vocational education and training. There can be no question of the importance of these institutions to economic growth in our region. In mentioning the VET FEE-HELP loan opportunity, Bob recognised the importance of it, not for the institutions for the students. The cost of any education not cheap, and without a system like this in place students would have to either go without or try and find the money to pay upfront. I agree with Bob that the extension of the HECS-HELP mechanism to the VET sector is fair for vocational students. Bob also spoke to me of the extensive and burdensome regulation that they are faced with at TAFE. He said it is so excessive that he cannot imagine any organisation being able to get away with providing a substandard education. While we all appreciate the need to ensure that a highquality education is provided by all institutions, overburdening them with more and more requirements will serve only to hamper service delivery in this sector. That is what we are talking about here: the delivery of a quality, affordable, directed vocational education and training service. My concern in this area is also with the bureaucracy that comes from the constant imposition of new regulations by this government. Every bit of new red tape takes more people away from what they are supposed to do, what they want to do and what they are good at doing-in this case teaching-in order to sign forms, tick boxes, and write letters. It must also be paid for by the taxpayer or the recipient of the service. This government has never seen a new set of regulations upon which it could not expand-such behaviour comes at a cost. To provide a good education to trades students requires someone who can not just do the job well, but teach it well. That is a specific combination of skill sets. If you introduce these new requirements you take these people away from jobs we need them doing. Given the importance of trades, not just to Townsville but to the North Queensland region, I am a big supporter of vocational education. I believe that governments at all but levels should help out VET institutions and is students wherever possible. We are suffering a skills shortage at present across the country. We are certainly feeling the pain of this in Townsville. Townsville businesses are employing apprentices, only to have them poached by mining and processing companies for a far higher wage than a small business can adequately compete with. There are serious skills shortages, and that is something this government needs to address. VET exists not just to supply staff to the mining sector but also to ensure there are enough trades specialists for all the other businesses upon which we rely. Vocational education is the vehicle for this. We need to encourage high school students to go into this area, we need to make it more affordable, we need to ensure that there are plenty of places available and we need to work with institutions to make sure the best vocational education possible is provided to as many students as we can. Instead, we have this bill, which gives no assurance that VET institutions not meeting the requirements will be given help to improve rather than immediately being stripped of their credentials and left to try and sort themselves out. The Howard government had the vision to introduce income contingent loans to the VET sector. I support this government's furthering of this measure, but it is disappointing to see it in this legislation allowing the minister to approve applications to become a higher education provider after the 90-day time frame. We can't tick off on these training opportunities fast enough and yet the government is going to allow excuses to blow out the time frames for approvals. There is a cost in getting to the necessary standard, and you still have to get through a 90-day trial period. We either commit to it or we do not. We also need to look at exact areas of skills shortage and consider ways to encourage students into these vocations. We need more people in certain trades, so we should be rewarding the students that are choosing to go into these areas. I do not oppose this bill. Vocational training is needed more than ever to allow Townsville and North Queensland to continue to grow and prosper, and I want to see that happen while ensuring that the standard of education is not put at risk. But caution this government on the risk of overburdening the sector with regulation that will see the VET sector hampered and sent backwards. If I could just touch on Tec-NQ-the Australian technical college Townsville campus, which the Howard government started. It was one of the most successful technical colleges in the country. It brought high school students in and, by the time they graduated with a high school certificate, they were two years into their trade. It delivered education and produced tradesmen. After the 2007 election, the Rudd government made them spend $50,000 of their own money to change their name to Tec-NQ and then withdrew their funding. As I said in speaking on a previous bill, we set these things up and we ask people to commit and then, at the very last moment-perhaps with a change of government-we change everything and withdraw support. Tec-NQ is still in existence but it has had to move away from its original core duty of providing high school education and a trade base for high school students, to becoming an RTO-a registered training organisation. That to me is a waste of funds. We have seen the government duplicate what Tec-NQ has in its trades training centre, producing a different outcome for a different set of people, and it is in the middle of nowhere, where no high school student can get to it. Those are the sorts of things this government and all governments must look at. It is too easy to sit there and ask people to change their name and then to withdraw funding and support and expect everyone to pick up from there. I was on Palm Island last week and I saw it there. People are asked to commit wholly and solely to programs, 100 per cent, and then three months in we run out of funding. It is not just this government's fault or any government's fault, but we ask I people to keep on turning up and to keep on committing and sooner or later they stop and then we call them lazy. That is wrong, and that is what is wrong with all these programs that are coming out. I do not oppose this bill. I support people having to pay for education. I think it is worthwhile. Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell) (18:33): I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEEHELP and Other Measures) Bill. This bill will introduce measures that will strengthen and streamline the administration of the Australian government's student incomecontingent loan program in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors, namely FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. FEE-HELP and VET FEEHELP are available through approved higher education and vocational education and training providers respectively to assist eligible students with their tuition fees. Through these schemes the government provides a loan for all or part of a student's tuition fees and pays these tuition fees directly to the approved education provider. This assistance helps students to take up higher education and higher level VET qualifications by reducing the upfront financial barriers associated with study. The bill will support the new Commonwealth regulatory frameworks for the higher education and VET sectors. Provisions in the bill will allow for the transfer of information to the newly established national regulators in the higher education and vocational education and training sectors: the Australian Skills Authority and the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, operating under the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 and the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 respectively. The bill will improve the Commonwealth's ability to manage risk to public moneys and better protects the interests of students in the vocational education and training sector. The bill makes it explicit that an approved VET provider must comply with the notice of events requirements that affect its ability to comply with the requirements to continue to maintain its approved provider status. The bill includes the capacity to withhold payment to a provider where there is concern over its compliance with requirements under the act. The bill will also result in improvements to administrative arrangements which help the application process times under FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. Higher education, be it in the university sector or the VET sector, is very important to this government and it has run through the four years of programs that this government has put before parliament. It is part of the Labor ethos that we believe that providing opportunities and access to education, at all levels, is fundamentally about making sure that everyone in our society gets a fair go, and it is the way in which we can make sure that people get appropriate training that will enable them to access jobs and opportunities. This is particularly so in an electorate like mine, where we have a very low number of people with higher education qualifications and traditionally a lot of people who have not completed school. We also have some of the highest unemployment rates in New South Wales, usually being three or four per cent higher than the state average. Quality Opportunities to give kids and older Australians access to study are vitally important. It is something that the Labor Party has always stood for, and it has always brought forth programs in this area. This bill is part of the whole suite of reforms that are so important to making sure people get access to the right sort of education to match the jobs that are out there at the moment. One of the things that is often said to me by local employers is that, while there is high unemployment in our area, we cannot always get kids with the right sorts of skills needed to fill the jobs. Bizarrely for an area in which 30 per cent of the workforce commute to Sydney, we see a lot of the good jobs filled by people who commute from Sydney up to the Central Coast, because we are not providing local people with the skills necessary for the new jobs in the new economy. It is really important that the measures in this bill, which underlie this government's approach to education, are carried through to implementation. With the introduction of the National Broadband Network, we in the Central Coast are on the cusp of a whole series of opportunities that, for the first time, the Central Coast will have. We need to be making sure that we skill our workforce appropriately so that they are able to fill the jobs that are going to develop from the new technology, the speed of the technologies and the opportunity for business to suddenly be in areas where there is cheaper land, though not necessarily as close to the capital cities as before. That is a very important issue. I had the pleasure last week of visiting the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle. This is a terrific campus in that it is a multifaceted campus. It has TAFE, university and community colleges all on the one campus, all integrated and providing a whole range of educational options for kids from the Central Coast. Over 90 per cent of the people who go to the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle are from the Central Coast. Traditionally, what used to happen was that our young people would have to travel to Sydney or to Newcastle to get the sort of training they can now get at this university campus. Invariably, that saw people drop out of education because it was too hard to commute and so forth. Now we have this campus there, and this government is fully supporting and resourcing this important campus to make sure that it provides a vital role for the Central Coast. I have done it before in this place and it is again worth placing on record the thanks that the people of the Central Coast have for my Labor predecessor, Mr Michael Lee, who was the member for Dobell for 17 years. Without him we would not even have this campus at the Central Coast. There was none there before, and he was able to secure the campus there, which is now, I am told, one of the most successful campuses of the University of Newcastle. It has over 4,000 students and is growing all the time, which fits given that we are a growing area. Last week I was able to be at the university to officially open the $3.2 million redevelopment of the university's library-a state-of-the-art library, but one that is open to the whole university. It operates 24 hours a day. It has a coffee bar so that people can come and stay there. It is a far cry from when I went to university where you scurried into a library, grabbed some books and got out of there as quickly as possible. The sorts of libraries we are building in institutions now are open, welcoming and designed so that people will stay there, study there and socialise there. This library that we opened last week was a fantastic addition to the university, and I was very pleased, in my role as local member, to be able to open it. But we have spent more than that on this university, and that is only right given the importance of the university to the Central Coast. In the last two years we have spent $20 million on facilities there. We redeveloped the science buildings and the exercise sports and science areas so that they are state of the art. We rebuilt and built some new buildings for education and nursing. These were the most significant expansions of the university since it first came into being when Michael Lee was the member there. It is also worth noting that my neighbour the member for Robertson, before she came to this place, was a lecturer at this university and lectured in education. We both have a great affinity for this fantastic facility that is in Dobell. It is one that is increasingly providing at all levels a way for people on the Central Coast to get an education. It has a fantastic link program for kids who do not have the marks to get into university, where they are able to go to this university, study for a year and then get credits for a degree. In areas where there is not a culture of learning and where there is not a culture of going to university, these types of programs are absolutely essential. They fill a niche and make sure that people who would simply not have the opportunity to go and study are now doing that and therefore qualifications that mean they are able to get the high-paying jobs-the good jobs-that are being developed in the new economy rather than, as has traditionally happened, compete for the ever-shrinking area of unskilled work that is there. Mr Deputy Speaker Symon, I know that you are very familiar with trade training in schools as well. We have some wonderful examples of that on the Central Coast, with schools cooperating and having multicampus trade training centres that provide this sort of trade training at schools. During the previous member's contribution he spoke about the Australian Technical College. The money that was going to go to the Australian Technical College in my electorate has been very well spent by being divided up and shared by three campuses of high schools on the Central Coast. That money has been put to great use. It has been part of an integrated approach to education, to making sure that kids in my area in particular get those opportunities. Lastly, the bill itself provides for clearer, simpler and improved administrative arrangements for the assessment of an individual's Higher Education Loan Program debt. In doing so, the bill enables better consistency between the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and the taxation legislation. It is part of a suite of bills that we have put to this parliament continually over the four years about our commitment to education at all levels, making sure that it is at the forefront of Labor's agenda for reform. I commend this bill to the House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (18:44): I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Since my election as the member for MCPherson, I have spoken on numerous higher education getting bills in relation to both tertiary education and vocational education and training. Over this time, I have continually reaffirmed that I see the higher education industry as a key component of the economy of my electorate of MCPherson, of the wider Gold Coast and of Australia. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill today and on the higher education sector. This bill aims to strengthen the compliance regime for the VET sector through a number of changes, thereby reinforcing amendments to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 that were made by the parliament last year. Firstly, under the current act a VET provider must notify the relevant minister of events that may significantly that provider's capacity to meet the quality and accountability requirements. This bill will change the act so that providers will also be obliged to notify the relevant minister in any event where there may be grounds to repeal that VET provider's approval. In reference to these changes, I hope-like my colleagues on this side of the House-that the department will work cooperatively with providers to address any issues of non-compliance rather than take a heavy-handed approach with those who report any discrepancies. Secondly, the act as it currently stands requires the minister to make a determination on applications to become a higher education or VET provider within 30 days of the receipt of that application, although under the amendments the minister will still be able to determine an application even if the time-frame for such a decision is not complied with. This ability to decide outside the legislative time frame is also set to apply to the 60-day period from when further information is requested by the minister. My concern is that such changes have the potential to see approval times for applications blow out. The changes that I have just discussed will mean that the 90-day or 60-day time frame that the minister is currently required to adhere to will become obsolete as the minister's power to determine an application will not be affected if the time frame passes. I hope that the 90-day and 60day time frames will be strictly adhered to and that the new provisions will only be used in extenuating and special circumstances. Ideally, it should not be necessary to extend the time frames at all. Thirdly, the bill introduces a number of changes, including that Commonwealth officers will have the ability to use information that has been collected as part of a provider's application for approval during the course of their employment and that such information can be provided to regulatory agencies so that they can perform their respective functions. The VET sector is ever expanding and I and the coalition understand that government regulation needs to keep up with what is occurring in the sector. However, we need to maintain a fine balance between protecting the integrity of the VET sector and not burdening institutions with overregulation. There is sufficient evidence to support the view that overregulation stifles flexibility in business and creates a web of bureaucracy that many individuals and businesses find difficult to navigate. This bill is another in a large list of other legislative changes to the higher education sector, especially in the vocational education and training sector. At the end of 2011, the House passed the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment Bill 2011, which amended the regulatory framework for the new National Vocational Education and Training Regulator that was created earlier last year. One of the main purposes of this framework was to introduce a national system for VET regulation to protect students undertaking courses and to protect the reputation of the sector. But the national system is not yet national at all, as the Queensland parliament has still not passed the necessary legislation and neither has the South Australian parliament. Education is the fourth largest export product in Australia and consequentially an important part of the national economy, with the sector making a contribution of $5.9 billion in 2009-10. The Gold Coast Institute of TAFE alone created an economic turnover of $188 million and $109 million in gross domestic product for the Gold Coast. If this is the contribution of one VET institution, one can only imagine the contribution that each organisation makes to their local area. The VET sector also provides many Australians with jobs, from the educators passing on the necessary skills and training to students to those running the institutions and ensuring their success. The coalition recognises the importance that the VET sector plays in maintaining the health and productivity of many of our industries. That is why in 2007 the Howard government introduced income contingent loans for the VET sector, reflecting the importance and value the coalition places on valuing a VET qualification as a tertiary qualification. The introduction of income contingent loans such as VET FEE-HELP ensured that students who wanted to undertake vocational education or training could do so knowing that they had the financial assistance to get them through. I would like to remind the House that on the Gold Coast alone there are over 160 registered training organisations. According to the most recent available census data, from 2006, there were over 2,200 people undertaking vocational education or training in my electorate of MCPherson alone, with the number of students being evenly spread between males and females, which is very positive. In 2010, the total number of VET students for the Gold Coast as a whole was over 28,100, up from the 2006 total of 24,030 students. These numbers show that our local VET sector is strong and expanding, with more and more students viewing vocational education and training as a stepping stone to a long and successful career. On the Gold Coast, the usually dominant tourism and construction industries are partly dependent on the health of the VET sector, as is the manufacturing industry. However, the Labor government is setting VET students up to fail once they complete their training, with falling job prospects on the Gold Coast and in Queensland in both the construction and tourism industries. The Gold Coast construction industry has been hit hard in recent years. In the November 2011 quarter there were over 37,000 people employed in the construction industry on the Gold Coast, constituting 12 per cent of the total number of employed persons. This is down 8.3 per cent from the 2010 total of 41,100 people. The Urban Development Institute of Australia has recently claimed that revenues for the construction industry have fallen 33 per cent or about $1.2 billion. The highest point of employment in the construction industry over the last five came in 2007, when the Howard government left office. Since late 2007, when Labor formed government, employment in the construction industry on the Gold Coast has failed to rise back to that point. The construction industry was the secondlargest contributor to Queensland gross state product in 2008. Now it is the fourth-largest contributor, with its economic value having fallen by 13 per cent. You need only look around the southern Gold Coast to see that the construction industry is moving at a snail's pace. So what prospects do new, freshly trained VET graduates have in an industry which is faltering? Although these facts would indicate that something needs to be done to spur the industry on, the government has instead set out to abolish one of the main contributors to the stability of the industry. I have spoken recently in this place against the government's plans to remove the independent Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. Today, I reiterate my disappointment that an organisation which is responsible for a 10 per cent increase in productivity, an economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year, reduced inflation of about 1.2 per cent and a 1.5 per cent increase in gross domestic product is being abolished at a time when the construction industry is doing it tough. The VET sector also contributes to the success of the tourism and hospitality industry on the Gold Coast. Tourism on the Gold Coast and in Queensland has traditionally been strong. However in recent years, with the global financial crisis and the high Australian dollar, the tourism trade has entered a lull period. Looking at data released by Tourism Queensland for December last year, there has been a five per cent annual decrease in the number of overseas tourists arriving in Queensland, years whilst the national average has neither increased nor decreased. But the bad news does not stop there. The Gold Coast saw a three per cent reduction in visitors for the year ending in September 2011, as well as a five per cent reduction in the number of nights stayed. These trends have dramatic consequences for local tourism operators. When you add the additional costs that are set to be imposed by the carbon tax, we will then have a situation where costs will eventually overtake the revenue being collected, leading to employees being let go, business closures and a lack of opportunities for VET graduates in the industry. Ultimately what is happening in the Gold Coast construction and tourism industries will have an effect on local VET graduates looking for employment after they complete their studies. If the industry is unable to provide jobs for future VET graduates, we are setting those graduates up for unemployment or, more worryingly, underemployment. This is not acceptable. Although the long-term unemployment rate for the southern Gold Coast currently stands at 5.4 per cent, the monthly average for January this year is 6.2 per cent, up 1.9 per cent from December last year and up 0.1 per cent from the same time last year. Vocational education and training can provide many people with an avenue to get out of unemployment or underemployment by offering them the opportunity to learn new skills, develop new techniques and acquire new knowledge. Although we can provide the opportunity for people to study by offering programs such as VET FEEHELP, we also need to make sure that we do not inhibit growth in key industries that are reliant on VET graduates. The Gold Coast is growing as a destination for both tertiary and vocational education. We have four universities and 160 registered training organisations, all offering a large variety of courses and avenues of study to domestic and overseas students. We have the infrastructure to accommodate a large student population, with accommodation, hospitals and shopping centres, and public transport available to these locations. The higher education industry on the Gold Coast helps businesses in these sectors to stay in business through students moving to the Gold Coast and spending money on transport, food and recreation. By maintaining the stability and health of the VET sector, we can ensure that there is a ready and able workforce for the key industries that keep this country going. It is important that the reputation and competitiveness of the VET sector and of the wider higher education industry are maintained at a domestic level as well as internationally. It is not merely the economy that benefits from a healthy higher education industry but also local businesses and local communities. The coalition supports measures that aim to maintain the high quality of education that we export to the world and that students expect. We cannot allow the quality and the reputation of our higher education system to slip, otherwise we risk losing the business of international students as well as the workforce this country will need in the years ahead. I will continue to work with the local VET providers to ensure that their students have the best possible chance of competing in the workforce and to ensure that the Gold Coast can continue to grow a healthy and prosperous higher education industry.",106
170,Ms LIVERMORE,BILLS," I rise to join my colleagues in speaking on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Other Measures) Bill 2011. Like all members in the debate so far, I support the propositions put forward by the government in this bill. Each and every week in here, Mr Deputy Speaker Symon-and I know that you support all these measures and speak on them very regularly-the government continue to build on our reforms in higher education and our existing investments in the vocational education and training and university sectors. There is a long list of very significant reforms. There increased investment in youth allowance, allowing thousands of additional low-income students to receive support for the first time, a change that has already seen larger numbers of rural and regional students, particularly, going to university than ever before. This helps the government to meet the very bold targets that it has set for this nation in terms of increasing the rate of participation in higher education. Another incredibly significant reform which we debated in this House, and which has taken effect for the first time this year, was the move to demand-driven funding of universities. That involved removing the cap on student numbers to ensure that our universities can grow and diversify according to student demand for courses. There will be a Commonwealth government funded place for every Australian student who is offered a position at one of our universities-truly a defining reform in our higher education system. The other reform worth singling out is the delivery of a framework for better support and services for university students right across the country, reversing the damage that had been done to universities, particularly regional universities like Central Queensland University in my electorate, where students rely so strongly on the services and support provided by the university. Thankfully we have been able to overcome the ideological obsession of the opposition about voluntary student unionism to return those services and activities to university campuses across the country. Our reform commitment also goes to the vocational education sector, where training is provided to fill the skills shortages in industry today as well as to equip people to move into the growth industries of the future. While we debate this bill, work is is progressing on building trades training centres in schools right around Australia, a very important part of introducing young people to the trades and careers that they might want to pursue and getting them started on acquiring nationally recognised competencies and qualifications. So far in my electorate, a number of schools have already completed their trades training centres. I am thinking particularly of Rockhampton High School, which was first off the blocks and was successful in the very first round of the trades training centre funding program, a testament to the commitment that that school has and the priority that it gives to vocational education and training. It now boasts a world-class engineering facility preparing young people at Rockhampton High School to fill the many positions in the resources and energy and agriculture sectors in our region. St Brendan's and St Ursula's down at Yeppoon combined to establish trades training centres for the automotive trades and hospitality. Schools in the Central Highlands, in the western part of my electorate, and in Mackay, in the northern part of my electorate, have chosen to come together and pool their funding as a cluster of schools and are well on the way to making their trades training centres a reality and providing opportunities for students in their region, who are well and truly guaranteed places in industry if they are able to secure the appropriate qualifications. The Cathedral College in Rockhampton has already indicated to me that it also intends to apply in the future. That is a sign of the importance that schools attach to trades training centres, which allow their students to have access to a range of pathways and give them the opportunity to secure their future in the trades and in so many other occupations that now require recognised qualifications. Our commitment is very real. There are millions and millions of dollars represented just in that list from my electorate. Our commitment is real and it is backed up by funding. It is already making a difference to people who want to skill themselves for job opportunities and for industries wanting to develop a highly skilled and productive workforce. We know that our ability to supply a skilled workforce and build productivity depends on a high-performing VET sector and one with a reputation for quality and integrity. VET providers have an obligation to meet high standards for their students and to be accountable to the government. For those reasons, this bill strengthens the government's oversight of the sector. The bill seeks to amend various aspects of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, particularly as it relates to the government's Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP. Specifically the measures in the bill seek to strengthen and streamline the administration of the FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loans schemes. Those HELP loans are loans from the government that eligible students can access to help them pay upfront tuition fees for their chosen course of study. It is important to note that the money unlocked through the loans scheme is actually directed to providers of VET qualifications, so the integrity and viability of those providers is essential. This bill is about safeguarding and strengthening the integrity of the VET sector. One measure in the bill will allow Commonwealth officers to use and disclose information gained through administration of FEE-HELP and VET FEEHELP for certain purposes. Importantly, that includes sharing this information with the newly established national regulatorsnamely, the Australian Skills Quality Authority and the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. The bill also improves the Commonwealth's ability to manage risk to public moneys. As I said, the loans we are talking about here are Commonwealth money paid to providers in order to assist the access of students to VET courses. It will also better protect the interests of students in the vocational education and training sector. To do that, we will strengthen the compliance provisions for approved VET providers. The bill makes it explicit that an approved VET provider must comply with the notice of events requirements that affect its ability to comply with the requirements to continue to maintain its approved provider status. The bill also includes a capacity to withhold payments to a provider where there is concern over its compliance with requirements under the act. The bill will result in improvements to administrative arrangements which will improve application process times under FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP-something that will be welcomed by providers. It is pretty clear from this list that these are common sense amendments designed to strengthen accountability in the sector and to ensure that students, and industry that relies on the flow of students coming out of the VET sector with appropriate qualifications, can have confidence in what the sector is producing in terms of graduates from those VET providers. At the outset I gave very concrete examples of the government's commitment to vocational education and training, the recognising as we do that it is essential for the future productivity of our economy, and of course for the quality of life for people in Australia, to be able to reach their full potential and to participate fully in our growing economy. The priority that we give to vocational education and training was underlined further by the Prime Minister when she delivered a major speech on 1 February, this month. In that speech she signalled that the government is preparing to go even further in terms of reform in the VET sector. The points that she raised in that speech included the extension of HECS-style income contingent loans to vocational education and training courses, those of a higher level, things like diplomas or advanced diploma level. That would abolish upfront fees. It would mean that people wanting to take advantage of building skills in those courses would no longer face upfront fees. The other very important reform that she flagged in that speech was that for other courses students would have a fee subsidy paid by the government of up to $7,800. That would be help for those in entry-level courses across the spectrum, health and hospitality, business and communication, right across the spectrum where we want people to be upskilling and really starting on the path of obtaining skills and looking to where they can continue to develop those skills, gain those qualifications and play an ever - growing role in building our economy and filling the shortages that are there in highly skilled positions. The policy that is being developed, and which will be released in greater detail fairly shortly, will also extend demand-driven funding for VET courses. So it is really following through on the agenda that was foreshadowed in the Bradley review of having a much more seamless integration of the treatment of the university sector and the VET sector and bringing the financial assistance for students and the way that VET providers are able to offer Commonwealth funded places to however many students are seeking and they deem eligible for their courses. It really brings the VET sector into line with the reforms in the higher education sector and I think is a very important step forward. One of the other things the government has identified as vital as we continue on this agenda of upskilling Australians and giving them the opportunity to reach their full potential and participate fully in our economy, is the question of articulation of courses and having seamless pathways from vocational education and training qualifications right through to degree and higher degree courses at universities. The Standing Council on Tertiary Education Skills and Employment has made removing barriers to those articulation pathways a priority. Their priority is to look at ways we can remove barriers to those articulation pathways between qualifications in the VET sector and the higher ed sector. I am pleased to say that in my local region our university, Central Queensland University, is getting ahead of the game in that respect. They are already well underway in exploring the possibility of a merger between Central Queensland University and the Central Queensland Institute of TAFE to become Queensland's first dual-sector University. I am very proud and pleased to say that the federal government is supporting that initiative 100 per cent. We have committed $73.8 million of funding to allow that initiative to become a reality. I will have a bit more to say about that later on in the House tonight because we are seeking the support of the various parties contesting the Queensland state election at the moment for a similar commitment. I commend the bill to the House.",118
171,Ms GAMBARO,BILLS," I rise this evening to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (VET FEEHELP and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to do two things. Firstly, it strengthens the compliance regime for approved VET providers and, secondly, it increases the availability of HECS income contingent loans to VET students. Focusing on the first aspect of this bill, there have been recent developments within the VET and higher education sphere which have prompted this update in the legislation. This bill seeks to strengthen the compliance regime for approved VET providers. This is part of an ongoing push to ensure the highest possible standards are maintained in the industry. These measures will ensure positive outcomes for many providers in the electorate of Brisbane. I want to talk about some of the wonderful VET providers-there are many hundreds I could name-particularly TAFE facilities in my electorate. I especially acknowledge the Gateway TAFE and the Ithaca TAFE who do an absolutely sterling job educating students in skills they will require for their futures. The greater the skills a nation has and the greater the capacity of human capital, the greater the productivity. The electorate of Brisbane covers many suburbs, including the CBD, which has some of the high-quality five-star hotels, including the Sofitel, the Stamford, the Hilton, the Marriott, and many high-quality restaurants, coffee shops and cafes. Also many mining industries are headquartered in the Brisbane CBD and the construction industry is a very important and vital industry. There are a number of private providers. I acknowledge the wonderful work of the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, a thoroughly professional body. They are to be commended for the great work they do with 1,000 private organisations which deliver a huge range of higher education, vocational education, training and English language courses. I have had the great privilege of visiting a number of them in the electorate of Brisbane. I put on the record the great work being done by Kay Ganley, and Michael Hall who has succeeded her, and all of the team at ACPET. They do great work representing VET providers who form part of their membership. In particular I acknowledge the great international work that Kay and other agencies do in the electorate of Brisbane, not only in providing this wonderful service to domestic consumers of the VET sector, but also in raising the standard and increasing the export of our wonderful service industries. Education is a huge part of our service export industry. The substantial aspect of this bill is the extension of the HECS FEE-HELP income contingent loan for VET students. VET is an important part of Australia's higher education system. It is fair to say that predominantly in Australia we have placed more emphasis on our university based degrees and qualifications. The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, talked about a seamless transition. Certainly there has been a transition from the VET sector into the university sector and there has been a transition where people with university degrees want to fine-tune particular skills by going back into the VET sector. It is a twoway movement. We need to have a much more flexible system than we have had in the past. I have had the wonderful opportunity and great privilege of a teaching role at the Queensland University of Technology. I fully appreciate the role our higher education institutions play in the future direction of our society. The VET sector certainly is an important part of that sector. With our mining industries screaming out for skilled workers, the role of vocational education has become really important in recent years. The VET sector has predominantly offered the training required for the trades that are needed in our regional economies. The proposal contained in the bill put forward by the Prime Minister requires a sign-on from the states. The Commonwealth wants these changes in place by July 2012-at the commencement of the next five-year Commonwealth-state funding agreement. The proposal would see the states emulate the system currently in place in Victoria where income contingent loans are offered on a widespread basis to VET students. More than 22,000 Victorian students have taken up these loans. The loan scheme will be an extension of VET FEE-HELP, administered by the Commonwealth, and it may have similar settings, possibly including a 20 per cent loan fee, quite unlike the HECS system. The policy would also see the abolition of upfront fees for many students, which is very welcome. In addition, students would be guaranteed a place in a training course. The federal government would also guarantee foundation and entry-level courses for technical and service sector careers in areas such as health, business, hospitality, communications, construction, transport and other areas through a government-subsidised training place worth up to $7,800. Eligibility for these places has not yet been determined and there has been criticism levelled at the Victorian prototype model where students' eligibility is based on them not having completed a higher level qualification in the past. These measures appear not to have been specifically costed. However, they are the $1.75 billion committed to VET in the 2011-12 budget. VET FEE-HELP is currently available to assist eligible students studying for higher level vocational education and training qualifications to pay their tuition fees. Higher level VET qualifications are at the diploma level and above, as VET FEE-HELP is not available for certificate level courses. These proposals will ultimately increase the take-up of VET courses, add much needed skills to the economy and encourage many young Australians in particular to add to their skills and knowledge. The other great thing about encouraging investment in vocational education is that it allows people who might want to go in a different direction, who want to change their current circumstances or who aspire to get ahead and earn more income for their families to enrol in our VET system and make that career change. It is good to invest in training. It is good for productivity. It is good for the country. It is good to encourage people to take up these paths of education. However, you must provide incentives for doing that and a good economy and full employment is part of ensuring success for the vocational training sector. In conclusion, this bill will encourage the take-up of VET education through the extension of VET FEE-HELP. The coalition supports these outcomes. Given this government's form, we have our concerns regarding the implementation and some administrative aspects of what is being proposed, but in general we are supportive and I commend the bill to the House.",121
172,Mr COMBET,BILLS,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (19:23): I think a number of very constructive contributions have been made in relation to the Higher Education Support part of Amendment (VET FEE-HELP and Other Measures) Bill 2011 and I do not think any substantive matters have arisen to which I should respond. I simply conclude the second reading debate by commending the bill to the House, particularly for its purpose of improving the quality framework of the government's income contingent loans program. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",123
173,Mr COMBET,BILLS,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (19:24): by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (19:25): I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Antidumping Improvements) Bill (No.2) 2011. I would like to begin by indicating that the opposition will be giving its support to the government on this legislation. For the record I would like to quickly restate some of what I said in my second reading speech from August 2011 on a forerunner version of this bill. The coalition is pleased to see the government accepting the need for change to Australia's anti-dumping system, for which key stakeholders have been calling for some time. It is good that something is finally being done about such problems. We are glad that the government has eventually responded to combined pressure from the coalition, Senator Xenophon, industry groups, individual businesses and trade unions to make changes such as those in this bill, including the introduction of a new appeals process to replace the existing appeals mechanism, establishment of the International Trade Remedies Forum and the creation of new guidelines for extensions to be allowed in certain circumstances. In principle these are all sensible and practical changes. That said, I am unsure of exactly how long the process of delivering all of the government's 20-odd mooted changes is going to take, especially given that in the course of more than six months this is now the second tranche of legislation containing a combined total of seven of the changes. As a side note and in perfectly good faith I would like to ask those opposite if they could indicate in one of their contributions in this debate exactly how many further tranches they expect there to be regarding the foreshadowed changes to the anti-dumping regime and also by what date they expect the last of the various bills into which they have codified the changes of June last year to come before the parliament. It is not just the opposition that needs to know these matters; industry needs to know the time frame as well. At this point in time the answers to those questions are unclear and I assume they are unclear to everyone following this debate. At the very least, those of us on this side of the House would be grateful for clarification of whether the government still envisages that all of its measures will be implemented before the end of the financial year. As for the specific changes that are being legislated through this bill, we support the establishment of the International Trade Remedies Forum. Indeed, the coalition has said for a long time that industry must be given a much greater voice in articulating improvements to the system and, more to the point, that its voice should be far more clearly heard. I am going to reserve my full judgment on the success of the practical operation of the forum until we are bit further down the track. If we take the government at face value on this and accept that its genuine intention is to bring together representatives from local industries, importers and unions and give them a better say in identifying problems and suggesting future improvements to our national anti-dumping system, then it is certainly a step in the right direction. However, I would like to add that it is not exactly ideal that government convened the opening meetings of the forum, got the administrative niceties out of the way and began the discussions only to then uproot the process with a ministerial reshuffle that transferred the relevant frontbenchers to a different part of the ministry and effectively forced everyone to start the process all over again. As I understand from a few quarters, that is what seems to have happened, not to mention that the Labor Party has obviously been plagued by even more intense internecine warfare since then, one of the results of which will be that everyone now has to endure yet another ministerial reshuffle. As well, we approve the amendments being made to the rules and the guidelines surrounding extensions to investigation time lines. I want to add, though, that it is vital that the government devotes great care to how and how frequently these extensions are granted. Many parties in anti-dumping cases over the years have been intensely frustrated at the sheer amount of time it takes to resolve some cases, all the while incurring substantial financial costs-which is to say nothing of the damage in that relevant market. If the extensions allow for better and more accurate decision making then that is obviously a good thing. But if a large number and a wider range of extensions are in and of themselves potentially going to lead to unnecessary blow-outs in the time frames of investigations and/or be used as a cover to avoid expediting decisions where they should be made more quickly then that would represent seriously undesirable development. I also want to stress much the same point in relation to the changes being introduced through this bill to the appeals process. In a general sense, we are supportive of the changes the government have outlined. I recognise and appreciate that one of the the things that the government are trying to do here is raise the threshold for appeals to be instigated in the first place. In expanding the scope of the appeal hearings and increasing the number of people responsible for overseeing them, I want to sound a cautionary note again that the government will need to maintain a close watching brief to ensure this does not have the opposite effect to the one intended. There is wide recognition that there are a number of flaws in Australia's current anti-dumping regime and that, unlike the systems in force in many other countries, it often works to the disadvantage of local industries and business. On the basis that the intent of this bill is to make some sensible administrative changes and on the assumption that the government will implement them effectively-a big assumption considering governance in the last couple of years-then the coalition is happy to support its passage. But-and this is a significant 'but'-I really cannot let this occasion pass without expressing my disdain at the actions of the government in relentlessly using the issue of anti-dumping as the pretext for another unsavoury and desperate set of attacks on the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally during recent months, especially after the public release of our anti-dumping policy in November last year. Like everyone else, I recognise why the government think launching crazed attacks on the opposition might be its best form of defence at the moment, because the last thing they want is to be reminded of their own atrocious failings and dysfunction. In the area of industry policy more specifically, they are desperate to make their absolutely miserable record and appalling disregard for Australian manufacturing vanish from view as swiftly as possible. It is obvious that there is significant internal division within the government on the subject of manufacturing. It is no surprise in the circumstances to see backbenchers in manufacturing seats like Wakefield and Corangamite backing the member for Griffith as a better choice of leader than the member for Lalor. It is also no surprise in the circumstances to see policymaking increasingly more about shrill statements than sensible manufacturing policy. It is why we have seen the ludicrous political rhetoric lately from the Labor Party on the subject of the car industry and the serial hypocrisy and arrogance of people like the Prime Minister, Senator Carr and the member for Corangamite, Mr Cheeseman, who prey on the fears and anxieties of car workers in Geelong before elections by spreading all manner of misinformation about the coalition's policies and then break billions of dollars worth of promises after those elections. That hypocrisy is breathtaking. I still have a couple of copies of the edition of the Geelong Advertiser from mid2010 that had Senator Carr and the member for Corangamite shamefully telling the community there how the coalition was supposedly going to cripple Ford and cripple Geelong with the proposed cut to the Green Car Innovation Fund. What happened? Overall, the Labor Party cut more than three times the amount of the saving that we suggested. Our suggest cut was $217 million. Labor ended up cutting the scheme by $885 million. There has still been no apology, no contrition and no fessing up to the squalid deception and dirty tricks.",124
174,Mr Dreyfus,BILLS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Indi should address her remarks to something that is remotely relevant to the bill before the House.",126
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The parliamentary secretary has a point. I invite the member for Indi to return her remarks to the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill. Mrs MIRABELLA: Antidumping is critical to the manufacturing sector that is facing all sorts of challenges, including that of sovereign risk due to broken promises. In that environment, it is important to canvass the issue of broken promises and how that impacts on the future viability of the manufacturing sector, and what role anti-dumping can play. We have seen 130,000 workers in Australian manufacturing lose their jobs since mid2008. There are other industries in manufacturing-many SMEs in food processing, steel, glass, plastics and chemicals-who are already surviving on wafer-thin margins even before the government clubs them with ridiculous measures like the carbon tax. They are very concerned about anti-dumping. We have had extensive discussions with them and they are very keen to see the government's policy rolled out before they pass final judgment. The government have an obligation to explain their policies and explain how and why, if policies are so good for manufacturing, they have presided over such a sustained burning of jobs in the manufacturing sector. In the area of anti-dumping specifically, I have not yet seen the latest iteration of Labor's talking points, but no doubt the member for Fraser will help us out and fulfil his trademark role in his party by parroting them dutifully, word for word, a bit later in this debate. The latest lot included things along the lines that, apparently, the coalition's position was in 'fundamental breach of WTO obligations'. I think we were probably responsible for all manner of other things. Insofar as I can make any sense of this ranting and raving, most of Labor's criticism has been directed at us because what we said in our policy was that we were determined, where possible, to make better use of preliminary affirmative determinationsand, where appropriate, we would be active in applying them from the 60-day stage of investigations. This was enough for Ministers O'Connor and Emerson to foam at the mouth about how allegedly irresponsible we were and how none of this was allowed under the WTO. In reality, what they were angry about was not that anything we were suggesting was not compliant with WTO rules; what bothered them, what really got under their skin, was that the changes we had proposed would go a long way towards creating a fundamental shift in thinking and emphasis in the way that Australia administers its national anti-dumping arrangements-real reform, not tinkering around the edges. I am afraid that the government have been humiliated by their own words because, as it turns out, in their own policy document, printed in June 2011, they said the following: By day 60 (the earliest WTO consistent date a PAD can be considered) the Branch will usually have verified the domestic industry's data, and will have received data from the exporters. It goes on to say: If the data submitted by the exporters shows evidence of dumping or subsidisation, this may sufficient evidence on which to base a PAD prior to verification. Ironically enough, that material has also been subsequently reprinted in the explanatory memorandum for this bill. So, at the same time the Labor Party is admitting to the parliament that preliminary affirmative determinations are expressly allowed at the 60-day stage and beyond, it is trying to hoodwink the public about the coalition's policy and pretending otherwise. Of course, these kinds of double standards have been witnessed over and over again from this government-and it will no doubt continue to happen over and over again, particularly now that the member for Lalor has survived today as the leader of the Labor Party. I am hopeful that, with a new Minister for Home Affairs, we will see a far more constructive and reasonable approach, in the area of anti-dumping at the very least. I do not have high expectations-I am just choosing this one area of policy to see whether perhaps we could get some greater consistency and honesty in the area of policymaking. But, for goodness sake, the rest of the members on the other side are meant to be part of a government-and it is long past time the Labor Party stopped making up nonsense, breaking promises, breaking faith with the Australian people and trying to blame the opposition for its own internal dysfunctional and disgraceful failings.",126
176,Mr ADAMS,BILLS," The previous speaker got a lot of things wrong, including issues relating to the car industry. I do not think she has a clue about the industry policy of this country, let alone what anti-dumping means and what the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2011 is trying to achieve. I want to deal with dumping: where a company exports its goods to Australia at a be price below that which it charges in its own market or which is below the cost of producing them. That is what we are talking about. We have to deal with that and we have to protect the standards in our own country, and that is what anti-dumping is about-it is not about stopping competition. This great country of Australia is a great trading nation, and we always have to protect trade as a major factor in our economy, but we do not have to accept our industries being dumped on by people who produce things and export them to our country below the price they cost to make. Where dumping materially injures an Australian business producing similar goods, additional Customs duties can be applied as remedy to that problem. Australia's economy is strong, but some industries are very vulnerable to dumping and we always have to be aware of that, and this bill is endeavouring to find ways to help those industries. The World Trade Organisation recognises the damage that unfair trading practices can cause and has established a system in which countries can respond to and remedy such practices. Australian manufacturers and primary producers, especially businesses, are finding that the expense and complexities of taking anti-dumping action can be prohibitive. I have spoken to many over the time. I have been in this House, and they say that getting a law firm to do the work is expensive-I am not saying our law firms overcharge, but there is a lot of work involved in building the arguments. You can also get a consultant to do it, and they can charge a fair bit as well, but building the case, building the evidence to be able to stimulate a case, is a most prohibitive process for our small businesses. This suite of improvements will help keep our economy strong and provide greater certainty for manufacturers and primary producers, and of course their workers and families and the communities in which they live and work. This bill also provides a legislative basis for the International Trade Remedies Forum, which I think will meet for the first time in August this year. So that is an international forum that has been established. Better support can be provided to our industries and workforce with a modern, rigorous and better resourced anti-dumping regime. I think there are many areas of Australia calling for this. We have had a number of examples in the past where dumping has occurred in Australia to the detriment of our industries. If there is a more a rigorous appeals process, it will mean that we can make the playing field a little more even for some of those industries which are under pressure. Australia has had an anti-dumping system in one form or another, I understand, for over 100 years. So we have certainly been aware of the problem and we have had systems to try to counter it. The anti-dumping system in its current form is governed by two key World Trade Organisation agreements: the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI small of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, also known as the anti-dumping agreement; and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, also known as the countervailing measures agreement. The WTO agreements do not prohibit dumping or all forms of subsidies. Instead, the agreements govern the use of trade remedies where dumped and/or subsidised goods cause or threaten to cause injury to domestic producers-and fair enough. The objective of the anti-dumping and countervailing system is to address the negative impact of unfair trading and activities by overseas companies on Australian industries. However, there is a tension between preventing unfair trade on the one hand and encouraging the benefits of effective competition on the other, as there always is. This is about endeavouring to get that process right. Of course, as this bill is trying to meet, there are always changing circumstances, especially when you are dealing with world trade circumstances. Australian manufacturers and producers operate in a global economy and benefit from international supply chains and access to foreign markets. Where would we as a nation be if we did not trade? We would be one-fifth of the size we are today. The benefits of such competition may be felt by consumers and purchasers of inputs, which benefit from cheaper prices and greater choice. That can translate into improved profits and profitability. We must always remember that we are a trading nation. However, Australians can also be negatively impacted by international competition. In some cases this will be the result of fair competition from a more effective producer, somebody who has an advantage over us and the way we produce. It will be up to marketing and processes how you deal with that as an Australian company. But at other times it will come from unfair competition resulting from dumping or subsidisation. Sometimes this unfair competition can have a material impact on the industry's performance and may threaten its long-term viability. Resulting problems include reduced competition in the market and reduced choice for consumers and purchasers. So there are a lot of things around dumping and anti-dumping that always needs to be looked at and watched. On a domestic level, this behaviour is addressed through competition regulation, including the misuse of market power provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. Such provisions aim to address the misuse of market power by looking for evidence of abuse of market power and the intent to eliminate, damage, prevent or competitors. The formulation applied in the current anti-dumping law looks at damage caused to the complainant. While the test does not explicitly take into account the wider economic impacts of measures, the minister has the discretion to take these impacts into account. The main challenge for anti-dumping regulation is the distinction between unfair trade and normal competitive activity. That is always the test in making sure we get the balance right. In its recent review of the current system, the Productivity Commission concluded that Australia should retain an anti-dumping and countervailing system. However, it considered greater checks and balances needed to be included in the form of a bounded public interest test to ensure that competitive conduct was not captured by the system. In the administrative processes in this country people seem to be well aware of what we have to try to do with anti-dumping. The commission also suggested a number of administrative changes to balance cost, administrative ease, timing and transparency. For example, it noted that, under current arrangements, reviews have the same time frames as investigations when they could be completed within a shorter time frame. They also observed that reviews are undertaken infrequently. The commission also noted that the current duty collection scheme could be considered all over the place, inefficient and potentially inflexible, as duties are collected even if goods are exported above the floor price. Finally, the commission was concerned that duty assessments did not reset the level of measures applying to future imports. TEMCO in Tasmania are having some difficulties with the price of the Australian dollar. They are a major manufacturer in Tasmania on the mouth of the Tamar River, and a considerable proportion of their deter workforce live within the electorate of Lyons. With its cement and ferroalloys, that comes to my mind as a company that could be impacted by dumping because global conditions such as the high dollar and cheaper labour elsewhere allows industries to consider shifting to other parts of the world where they sometimes have less stringent environmental conditions and fewer safety standards to comply with. We should always discourage these things. They do not necessarily lead to dumping, but we have noticed that they do not allow our industries to compete equally. We should be wary of this possibility with companies that go offshore and we should always have a look at what they want to put back into our country. This legislation is important for our industries and for the manufacturing base of Australia. I commend the bill to the House",127
177,Mr BUCHHOLZ,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill (No. 2) 2011. This bill introduces three sets of changes to Australia's anti-dumping system and attempts to address some of the numerous concerns among stakeholders with regard to the current generally unworkable anti-dumping arrangements. Essentially, the purpose of an anti-dumping system is to allow countries to take action against foreign businesses that seek to export their product into a market at a price lower than that charged in their home market or lower than the price of production. Dumping is little more than a clinical and calculated attempt to exploit Australia's commitment to free trade by artificially distorting the domestic market. It is therefore only right and proper that we have in place measures to stamp it out. However, there are a number of technical impediments to assessing Australia's anti-dumping system, as well as difficulties with the administration of the system. In recent times there has been a great deal of frustration about the tardiness of investigations and the significant cost imposed on businesses who wish to raise cases for consideration. Bizarrely, the current system frequently imposes a greater burden of proof on local industries than on foreign competitors. As it currently stands, the system is too expensive, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, too slow and too lopsided. Some anti-dumping cases can drag on for years, at the end of which time the damage may already have been done. When rulings are made they frequently occur too late to reverse the harm that has been caused, not only to the firms that have been directly affected, but also to the wider parts of their supply chain. The legislation under discussion today contains provisions for several things: a new appeals process, the establishment of a trades remedy forum comprising government, local industry, importers and unions, and new guidelines to allow investigations to be extended under certain circumstances. By and large, we believe that these changes will help address some of the faults in the system. However, given that one of the main problems with the current arrangements relates to the time lines of investigations, care will need to be taken to ensure that new provisions for extensions do not result in unnecessary delays in decision making. The coalition is also concerned about Labor's reluctance to provide more resources to Customs. Initially, the government said it would increase staff in the relevant sections of Customs, from 31 to 45. However, we have subsequently discovered that these additional staff are not based on new investment-quite the opposite. Once again, we see the government saying one thing and then doing another. The Achilles heel of the government at the moment is: 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. These additional staff will be moved, through a redeployment of resources, from other areas of Customs. This is an extraordinary decision that will no doubt put additional pressure on the Customs service, which already has plenty on its plate due to the government's ongoing ineptitude in the area of border protection. We have seen similar situations in ASIO, with staff being dragged away from their core duties to conduct background checks on the never-ending parade of illegal arrivals. Some of you blokes opposite need to remember that you can only cut the pie into a certain number of pieces before it turns into crumbs. The coalition's preference, and indeed our policy, is for a genuine increase in the branch's resources. We believe that it would allow for stronger interpretations of evidence and prosecutions of anti-dumping cases. It would also bring our system into line with those operating in the USA and a number of EU states. The government speaks about the protection of jobs in manufacturing. I suggest that this bill goes to protecting some of those Australian jobs from anti-dumping. The coalition's anti-dumping policy, released in November last year, is based on increasing the quality of investigations, lowering the cost to participants and providing more scope for penalties to apply to parties who refuse to cooperate with the authorities. I mentioned earlier the perverse situation we have where the burden of proof rests more heavily on local businesses than on foreign competitors. The coalition's policy would address this by providing the authorities with the opportunity to make use of the preliminary affirmative determinations. For two months into an investigation preliminary affirmative determinations create a shift in the burden of proof, requiring the foreign producer rather than the Australian company that believes it is being damaged by dumping to prove its conduct has not hurt the Australian industry. One industry that comes to mind with regard to anti-dumping is the steel industry. A good colleague of mine, who is one of Australia's largest privately owned steel merchants, got caught up with 18 million tonnes of steel being dropped on the docks from a Chinese manufacturer. Thank heavens that the provisions were in place whereby BlueScope was able to put an interim action on that dumping action. It stopped the stock getting to the marketplace and destroying the steel industry overnight. Interims are provisions in the act that provide for product on the dock to be quarantined and an evaluation to be made of the difference between the price it has landed for and the so-called production price. Where an Australian company believes that there is a case for anti-dumping in its sector, that money can be quarantined until a determination can be made by the relevant authorities. Under the coalition's plan, greater financial resources and specialist anti-dumping investigators would ensure decisions are made in a timely fashion, providing greater certainty to all involved. Not surprisingly, Labor jumped on our proposal and accused us of being in breach of WTO agreements. It should come as no surprise that these allegations were completely false. Not only were the preliminary affirmative decisions consistent with the WTO's provisions, they are consistent with what Labor was actually advocating just a few months before. I imagine that must have been quite embarrassing. Debate interrupted. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Orange Juice Concentrate Imports",130
178,Mr SECKER,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Australia currently permits the import of orange juice concentrate from Brazil; (b) the United States has moved to ban imports of Brazilian orange juice concentrate due of the fungicide Carbendazim being found in some juice concentrates from Brazil; (c) in January 2010, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) suspended some agricultural production uses of Carbendazim, including use on all citrus fruits; (d) in 2011 the APVMA completed its preliminary review finding of Carbendazim which has proposed removing many uses of this chemical; and (e) the APVMA has proposed a change to remove the Maximum Residue Limits in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code that permits Carbendazim residues in some foods, including citrus products; and (2) calls on the Government to instruct the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to increase the testing on imported juice concentrate to ensure Carbendazim is not present at levels which risk public health. This issue came to light after Coca-Cola, that well-known firm that owns the juice manufacturer Minute Maid in the United States, alerted the US Food and Drug Administration that it had detected low levels of Carbendazim in its own orange juice. The US Food and Drug Administration was told by the manufacturer that some Brazilian growers had sprayed trees with the chemical. Carbendazim is a fungicide registered in Australia for the control of a wide range of fungal diseases such as mould, black spot, mildew, scorch, rot and blight in a variety of crops. As a farmer myself, I understand these issues. Carbendazim is currently permitted for use on roses-which we do not normally eat-bananas, strawberries, ginger seed pieces, sugar cane setts pre-planting, pasture, red clover and subterranean clover, chickpeas, faba beans, lentils, vetch and macadamias, and in timber preservation. Under individual permit, Carbendazim may also be used on onion bulbs post harvest for seed production only, on pyrethrum-nonto traces food crop-on mung beans, and on mushrooms, once only per crop when preparing casing material from peat. Although Carbendazim is permitted for these purposes, its actual use is believed to be quite limited. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, the APVMA, commenced a review in 2007-five years ago-following advice from the Office of Chemical Safety and Environmental Health that exposure to Carbendazim and its parent compounds could cause developmental abnormalities in experimental animals and hence might pose a potential public and occupational health and safety risk to people. That is what the motion before the House is all about. The APVMA addressed potential human health concerns by suspending the label approvals of Carbendazim products and issuing new instructions for use. It is obvious that there were some very serious concerns about this chemical. These new instructions provided revised safety directions for use of the product and a birth defects warning statement, to be attached to the container. In Australia as of 25 January 2010, over two years ago, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority restricted the horticultural and turf uses of Carbendazim, based on data indicating that maximum residue limits for some food crops, and potential public exposure to treated turf, may not meet new health standards. New label instructions removed all uses, including post-harvest dipping, of Carbendazim on grapes; cucurbits, including melons; citrus fruit; custard apples; mango, pome fruit; stone fruit, including cherries; and turf. The APVMA also extended health warnings on Carbendazim product labels to include birth defects and male infertility in laboratory animals. In the US the US Food and Drug Administration has temporarily banned Brazilian orange imports due to health concerns. Carbendazim is already a banned substance in the US. Carbendazim is legal in Brazil, where it has been used for more than two decades to fight blossom blight and black spot, a type of mould that grows on orange trees. Christian Lohbauer, spokesman for CitrusBR, the association that represents Brazil's four main orange juice producers, said Brazilian orange juice is routinely tested for this fungicide but has never been stopped by US customs over this issue. Mr Lohbauer says that any shipment of orange juice will test positive and he does not know what they will decide is the maximum level. That is just not acceptable to Australia. Their interest now is that juice keeps entering the United States, and of course Australia. The US Food and Drug Administration released a statement saying that it is sampling all import shipments of orange juice and will deny entry to shipments that test positive for Carbendazim. Up to 35 parts per billion were found in juice arriving in the US where it is banned. Carbendazim is currently only approved in the United States as a fungicide to treat non-food items such paints, textiles and ornamental trees. But another legal fungicide, thiophanate-methyl, can break down into Carbendazim after it is applied. It is important to note that Australia imports 32,000 tonnes of frozen concentrate orange juice annually, two-thirds of which comes from Brazil. It is my understanding that juice labelled 'made in Australia' could be a product that is more than 70 per cent Brazilian concentrate. According to Food Standards Australia New Zealand, the acceptable level for Carbendazim residue in Australian juices is 10 parts per millionabove the amounts discovered in the US. As outlined in the motion, APVMA has proposed a change to remove the maximum residue limits in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code that permits Carbendazim residues in some foods, including citrus products. During a Senate estimates hearing last week, the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand Chief Executive Officer, Steve MCCutcheon, said that the APVMA had decided last November to amend the maximum residue limit for Carbendazim to zero. However, the recommendation was then watered down to have the limit to five parts per million. This issue is very relevant within my electorate. The Riverland is one of the four major citrus growing areas in Australia. The South Australian Citrus Board has called on the government to impose an interim ban on imports of orange juice concentrate from Brazil because of the contamination concerns. The Citrus Board Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Green, believes imports should be halted until imports are properly checked. Mr Green said to ABC Riverland on 19 January, 'I understand that AQIS does the testing here in Australia and it's at a five per cent type level, so something in addition to that would be important.' That comes back to the second part of my motion which calls for a greater testing. The Chairman of the Citrus Growers of South Australia, Mark Chown, also told ABC Riverland that juice already on sale needs to be tested. Consumers need certainty, as do the growers. The Riverland region has experienced ongoing drought and many growers have had to re-invent themselves to survive. I wrote to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Joe Ludwig, about this issue but I am yet to receive a response. In my letter I expressed the concerns of growers and the industry, and I expressed the need for increased testing by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I ask the minister to listen to the concerns of the citrus industry, and I call on the government to support my motion. (Time expired)",131
179,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded?,134
180,Mr FORREST,BILLS," I second the motion and reserve my right to speak. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (20:11): I am pleased to speak tonight on the motion that the member for Barker brings to the chamber. The motion calls on the government to instruct the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to increase the testing on imported orange juice concentrate to ensure that the fungicide Carbendazim is not present at levels which would risk public health. I understand the member's concerns, representing as he does the Riverland area of South Australia in his electorate of Barker. I also understand that Australian citrus producers, including those in the Riverland, provide a quality product and that the importation of orange juice concentrate is seen by some as a threat to the local industry. I see many parallels with the fate faced by many manufacturers in my own electorate of Throsby where we do not grow too many oranges. We do consume a fair bit of orange juice but we do not grow too many oranges. I understand that the Australian citrus producers, including those of the Riverland, produce a quality product and that the importation of orange juice, particularly orange juice which is infected or contaminated by the fungicide which is identified in this motion, not only threatens the product but it threatens the quality and the confidence of the entire market for orange juice. The Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicines Authority, APVMA, responsible for the regulation of chemicals that are used on food crops and animals, and the Food Standards Australia New Zealand, FSANZ, is responsible for ensuring safety in the food supply. These organisations are responsible for determining a safe residue level of Carbendazim in foods that Australians will consume. I have been advised that FSANZ is not currently aware of any test results in which Carbendazim levels in orange juice have been above this safe level, with the highest to date being 0.8 parts per million-well below the current limit. While it is true that the United States has moved to ban imports of Brazilian orange juice concentrates due to traces of Carbendazim, we also understand that the United States is a net exporter of citrus juice with the states of Florida and California producing more than 11 million tonnes of orange juice each year. Australia is clearly not in the same position.",134
181,Mr Adams,BILLS,"Orange County. Mr STEPHEN JONES: Orange County indeed. Our domestic market is only able to support around 45 per cent of the needs of the orange juice industry, with a national orange fruit juice production at approximately 438,000 tonnes annually. That is a market that I am advised is actually increasing, not decreasing. I can definitely say that this government, and I in particular as the member for Throsby, strongly support local manufacturing, including food manufacturing. Indeed, tomorrow I will be hosting a group of workers at a function in the House who represent workers in the food manufacturing industry and who are concerned about this issue, their ongoing competitiveness and the future of food manufacturing in this country.We know that food and beverage production is a major is industry sector for the Australian economy in terms of both its financial contribution and the jobs associated with it. Food and beverage processing is Australia's largest manufacturing industry-and this is not well known-with sales exceeding A$70 billion each and every year, accounting for around 18 per cent of manufacturing employment. When people think of the manufacturing industry, they think of the automotive industry and the steel and other heavy manufacturing industries but they do not think of food. They do not think of the food that they may put on their pantry shelves or the things that they buy at the grocery store each and every week. But it is the largest employer, accounting for over 18 per cent of manufacturing employment. The Gillard government has a strong commitment to food safety and a commitment to ensuring consumers have the best possible information about the food that they eat. This is why the government commissioned and supported the Blewett review into food labelling and why it has supported the implementation of the majority of its recommendations. Also, in January 2010, the government acted on the advice of an APVMA review into the use of the fungicide and suspended preand postharvest uses of Carbendazim by Australian primary producers on a range of products including citrus fruits, oranges among them. This review is still an ongoing process, as is the APVMA's consultation with FSANZ on this matter. These processes are of upmost importance to the government. FSANZ's current advice is that a 70kilogram adult-somebody about my sizewould need to drink 140 litres of orange juice per day to consume an unsafe amount of the fungicide Carbendazim. As fond as I am of orange juice, I can tell this House without any fear of misleading it that never have I consumed 140 litres of orange juice per day, so I am fairly confident that I have not tripped the magic level-the dangerous level-of consumption of orange juice such to consume so much of the fungicide Carbendazim to have reached the national maximum residue limit. The best science that is available at the moment says I and those who consume a moderate amount-far less than 140 litres a day-are not in the danger zone. That is not to say that we should not as a government be providing all the resources tins of that are necessary to the regulatory authorities to ensure that we have the best science available to us. If as is suggested by the member for Barker in his motion the current science, which says that 140 litres of orange juice per day is the unsafe level, is not correct then we should be reviewing that. I support the sentiment reflected in the motion by the member for Barker for us to ensure that those levels are reviewed. Let the policy follow the science. If the science tells us that we have it wrong then I will be first to stand in this place to ensure that we get this right in the interests of consumer safety but also in the interests of local food manufacturers and not allowing an unfair advantage to accrue to Brazilian producers or, for that matter, to producers from any other country anywhere else in the world. We do not want unsafe products to be put on the shelves of our supermarkets, putting the health and safety of Australian consumers at risk. I once again thank the member for Barker for bringing this important matter before the House.",134
182,Mr FORREST,BILLS," I rise in support of this resolution, not just because I am the representative of an extensive citrus region in Sunraysia and the whole of the Murray valley all the way down to Koondrook but because for some time now I have been very concerned that Biosecurity Australia and its policing agency, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, seem to be preoccupied with controlling the quality of our exports. That is a noble objective and one which I support. Australia has a really excellent reputation around the world for producing clean and lean and green. My citrus growers are very proud of that record. The member for Throsby made some good points. But I wonder if he has confidence in them. That is what this resolution is about. I quote point 2 of the resolution: …calls on the Government to instruct the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to increase the testing on imported juice concentrate to ensure Carbendazim is not present at levels which risk public health. That is the point that the member for Barker and I are making. We do not have confidence. The Americans, who have a much more extensive testing program of orange juice concentrate than we have in Australia, have reacted. Given the risk that Carbendazim poses to human health, I would have thought that the government would have made this a priority and instructed AQIS to increase the percentage of imported orange juice concentrate that they test. It is not good enough, given the risk to public health. There have been extensive health warnings made about this product. We are talking about birth defects, genetic defects and male infertility-this last has been proven in laboratory animals. We need to be absolutely confident. We have seen some tragedies in human history in recent time, such as with thalidomide. We should not take a risk. This resolution strongly urges the government to instruct AQIS to do their job with the products that are coming into Australia. It is just not good enough to assume that the level of risk is not high. It is extremely high. I urge the member for Throsby to use his influence, in addition to the contribution he has made to this debate, to ensure that point (2) of this resolution is observed and adhered to. In January 2010 the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority restricted the horticultural and turf uses of Carbendazim-there is a risk in the use of turf, which is not consumed by humansbased on new data indicating that maximum residue limits for some food crops and potential public exposure to treated turf might not meet new health standards. Turf is not consumed by humans, but it is just that someone might lie on it or touch it or be involved in laying it in a new garden. Surely alarm bells should be ringing. This is a fungicide to be very wary of if it is sufficient to cause that reaction. As a result, we are now seeing new label instructions removing all uses including post-harvest dipping of Carbendazim for grapes, melons, citrus fruit, custard apples, mangoes, stone fruit, cherries and turf-which is not even consumed by humans. Many of these products, except for the tropical ones, are produced in my electorate-melons, citrus fruit and stone fruit definitely are. All these things have not been done for nothing. There is tremendous suspicion about this fungicide. Point (2) of this resolution should be supported by government members so that we can be confident and sure. I ask government members to give it their support.",135
183,Mr ADAMS,BILLS," I am pleased to be here to speak to this motion to increase the testing on imported orange juice concentrate. Carbendazim is a fungicide used in many countries to control diseases in some crops, including fruit trees. The honourable member who just spoke, the member for Mallee, raised a lot of concerns. Presently, two groups in Australia are currently in collaboration on this topic-the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, which is responsible for the regulation of chemicals used on food crops in Australia, and Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of our food supplies and deciding safe residue levels of Carbendazim in foods that Australians consume. The food industry is a big manufacturing sector in Australia, and we export food as well. Many chemicals are used to get these products to the consumer. As we get greener and cleaner there is an increasing awareness of fresh fruit and vegetables, and this includes orange juice. At present, Australians are consuming much more juice than we are producing-I think we are producing only something like 45 per cent of the orange juice consumed by Australian consumers. I take it on board that the United States has banned the use of this product, but their exports are in competition with Brazil's. That is not an unusual process. I agree with the motion, with certain conditions. My principle is that we have Australian standards, which our farmers and manufacturers are bound by, and imported goods should meet those standards. We should set those rules. Australia currently has in place a maximum residue limit which allows the presence of 10 parts per million of Carbendazim in citrus products. That is the science that is being used in Australia. If changes then I would be the first to say, 'Make sure we do it; make sure that we are on top of it,' but we must make these decisions in relation to science. It has already been stated in the House that an adult weighing 70 kilos would need to drink 140 litres of orange juice in one day to consume 10 parts per million of Carbendazim and a child would need to drink 40 litres of orange juice a day to receive the same 10 parts per million. Despite the information showing it is relatively safe from a health perspective one would always endeavour to err on the side of caution. I understand that there is an ongoing review process and consultation between the FSANZ and the APVMA, and they will continue to consult on this. They have now asked to extend the consultation for another 12 months. In that time they will continue to monitor the situation and will then report. We are very strong on food safety, and so we should be. I know the member for Barker is very strong in representing his area in putting this motion forward. I congratulate him on doing it.",136
184,Ms MARINO,BILLS," Australian farmers produce some of the highest quality and safest food in the world. Agricultural production in this country drives $155 billion a year in economic production, over 12 per cent of GDP, generating around 1.6 million Australian jobs and $32 billion a year in farm exports. Around the world, Australianproduced food is regarded as safe-clean and green-and it is essential that we maintain that reputation. However, this reputation is put at risk by Labor's incompetent neglect of our national biosecurity. There is no doubt that the clean, diseasefree status of Australian food produce is paramount. Australia was once a biosecurity that island fortress, but in recent years our biosecurity and quarantine programs have been cut back and undermined by this government. The government's commitment to biosecurity is a national disgrace. Labor's 2009 federal budget slashed $35.8 million from the quarantine and biosecurity budgets, leading to the loss of 125 jobs, and reduced inspections of arriving passengers and cargo. The sum of $58 million was also slashed from the Customs budget, leading to 4.7 million fewer air cargo consignments being inspected each year and 2,150 fewer vessels being boarded on arrival. This neglect set the trend that Labor has continued into the current budget. In 2011, another $32.8 million was cut from the operational budget of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, reducing the capacity of the department to deliver services to Australian agriculture. The Beale quarantine and biosecurity review that was commissioned by Labor called for hundreds of millions to be spent on AQIS and quarantine annually to provide proper, real protection to our nation's borders. Instead heeding this report, the government has failed to act, except to spend 2½ years since its release running AQIS down and stripping out its assets. Many countries around the world provide advantages for their industries that include low input and labour costs and low levels of necessary compliance with government regulations. This government is complicit in providing this advantage to overseas producers by refusing to enforce adequate border biosecurity. Carbendazim is a fungicide registered in Australia for the control of a wide range of fungal diseases such as mould, black spot, mildew, scorch, rot and blight crops. It has been known to cause birth defects and irreversible male infertility in laboratory animals. New research has found exposure to high levels of the chemical causes infertility in some male mice, prompting the APVMA to both restrict its use and extend the health warnings on labels. In January 2010 Carbendazim was banned from preand post-harvest uses on grapes, cucurbits, citrus fruit including oranges, custard apples, mangoes, all pome fruit, stone fruit and all uses on turf. This chemical has become an issue in Australia after reports from the United States that authorities had suspended some imports after trace amounts of Carbendazim had been found in orange juice imported from Brazil. Whilst the levels detected were low in comparison to international standards, there remains the fact that other countries can still use a product banned for a similar use in Australia. It is also a fact that the Labor government's neglect of biosecurity means that there is an increased chance that the product is entering Australia in imported fruit products. This not only creates an unlevel playing field; it also raises questions of about the safety of some imported agricultural products. The motion by the member for Barker requires the House to note that: (a) Australia currently permits the import of orange juice concentrate from Brazil; (b) the United States has moved to ban imports of Brazilian orange juice concentrate due to traces of the fungicide Carbendazim being found in some juice concentrates from Brazil; (c) in January 2010, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) suspended some agricultural production uses of Carbendazim, including use on all citrus fruits; (d) in 2011 the APVMA completed its preliminary review finding of Carbendazim which has proposed removing many uses of this in a variety of chemical; and (e) the APVMA has proposed a change to remove the Maximum Residue Limits in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code that permits … (Time expired)",137
185,Ms GRIERSON,BILLS," I rise to speak on the member for Barker's private member's motion on the importation of orange juice concentrate and the use of Carbendazim. It is clear that all the speakers are genuinely concerned about any potential risk to Australians from the pesticides used on imported consumables. We have very high standards in this country and we need to look at how we deal with any such risk in Australia. In January this year it was reported that the US Food and Drug Administration had temporarily banned Brazilian orange imports due to the discovery of low levels of the pesticide Carbendazim. The United States Environmental Protection Agency are yet to establish an acceptable standard for that pesticide within their imported goods. Back here in Australia, in 2007, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority received advice from the Department of Health and Ageing's Office of Chemical Safety and Environmental Health division that exposure to the pesticide may have associated health risks. Some of the speakers have outlined those. In January 2010 the authority suspended the pesticide's use within our domestic citrus industry. Unlike the US, however, Australia currently has in place a maximum residue limit that allows for the presence of Carbendazim within imported citrus products at 10 parts per million. The levels found within our imported orange juice are well below this level at around 0.1 parts per million. Food Standards Australia New Zealand is yet to raise any concern regarding the presence of the pesticide in orange juice that Australians consume. It has in fact indicated that an adult would have to drink 140 litres of orange juice in a single day in order to exceed the safety limit. We love our orange juice in Newcastle and around Australia, but it is a fair bet that nobody will be drinking 140 litres of orange juice in one day anytime soon. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority are in consultation with Food Standards Australia New Zealand in order to develop advice regarding a suitable limit for Carbendazim within our food that allows for trade to continue. Some may ask why we import orange juice at all. The fact remains, according to Fruit Juice Australia, a division of the Australian Beverages Council, that Australia's orange crop is approximately 200,000 tonnes short of what would be required to meet the market demand and produce 100 per cent homegrown orange juice. This is due to a range of factors, including seasonal variability. Australia's juice-manufacturing industry is therefore highly dependent upon importing frozen orange juice concentrate from countries such as Brazil. Australia currently imports 32,000 tonnes of frozen concentrate, two-thirds of which comes from Brazil. As a net exporter of citrus juice, the US is in a position to take measures such as banning the import of Brazilian orange juice concentrate; on the other hand, being able to domestically supply only 45 per cent of the orange juice industry's needs, Australia cannot. In August 2004, one of the world's eight bulk juice terminals, located in my electorate of Newcastle, received its first cargo shipment of frozen orange juice concentrate. At that time it was anticipated to handle approximately one-third of our nation's orange juice imports. In its first year of operation, 9,572 kilolitres of frozen orange the juice concentrate were imported from Brazil to be stored in Newcastle's Carrington facility-the equivalent of almost four Olympic sized swimming pools. Every three to four months, a shipment of frozen orange juice concentrate from Brazil arrives by ship into Newcastle port and the concentrate is stored in tanks at Carrington. Newcastle port operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, managing almost 4,000 ship movements each year, employing almost 2,000 people. Along with Newcastle's unrivalled coalexporting facilities, the import of frozen orange juice concentrate is one of the diverse port activities that employs locals in my electorate of Newcastle. The member's motion highlights the importance of having adequate testing in place to ensure public health and safety, and I am confident that the appropriate measures are currently in place and that Food Standards Australia New Zealand are putting the interests of the public's health at the forefront of their decisions. It is also worthy of mention that countries like Brazil are making great strides in bringing their standards higher. We encourage that and support that, and at this time we do not want to compromise on that important trade between the two nations. It is good to speak on the motion. It is good to make sure that people are not alarmed unnecessarily and it is good to know that the Australian government are dealing with this issue.",138
186,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," There is much validity in calling on the Labor government to instruct the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to increase the testing of imported juice concentrate to ensure Carbendazim is not present at levels which place public health at risk. It is expected that the chemical may be banned for use in oranges in Australia-it is currently suspended-but still available for other crops such as almonds. Labor is not putting due process in place in regard to inspections and must become more diligent about testing. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor slashed cargo-screening resources at ports and airports by $58.1 million. This led to 4.7 million fewer air cargo consignments being inspected each year and 2,150 fewer vessels being boarded on arrival. Food Standards Australia New Zealand has backflipped on its decision to ban the import of Carbendazim laced Brazilian orange juice concentrate. This organisation must gets its act together and send a clear message to the public. Carbendazim is a fungicide used in many countries to control fungal diseases in some crops, including fruit trees. Food Standards Australia New Zealand originally announced it would ban the import of juice concentrate where trace elements of Carbendazim were present. However, it has since reversed that decision, understandably angering Riverina Citrus in my electorate. What sort of message does this send to the average shopper looking to buy fruit juice? Riverina Citrus had previously called on Australian authorities to act to protect consumers following the discovery of the fungicide in Brazilian juice products imported into the United States, and it publicly stated support when FSANZ put the ban in place. Concerns have been raised in Australia after reports from the United States that authorities had suspended some imports after trace amounts of Carbendazim had been found in orange juice imported from Brazil. The levels detected in the US are well below the internationally accepted level for Carbendazim permitted in oranges and significantly below the US human health and safety level. Even though the levels detected to date are very low and considered safe, the US is testing for Carbendazim because the chemical is not allowed to be used on orange crops in the US. A strong biosecurity and quarantine system is critical to Australia's rural and regional industries, jobs and consumers and our natural heritage. The 2008 $1.7 million Beale review into Australia's quarantine and biosecurity systems found that our border defences are significantly under-resourced, putting Australia's economy, people and environment at significant risk. Consumers are unsure what they are buying, and this should be paramount. We should be mindful of what consumers are buying and mindful of the fact that they need to be safe and secure in the knowledge that what they are buying does not contain this trace element. According to the Land newspaper, people who are buying Australian juice labelled as 'Australian Made' could be drinking a product consisting of 70 to 80 per cent Brazilian concentrate. Studies have found that Carbendazim could cause infertility and testicular damage. Carbendazim was withdrawn from use in the Australian industry more than two years ago. It is important that Australian law protects Australia from pests and diseases carried by overseas animals, plants and products and ensures that imported product meets stringent health standards. The Labor government's under-resourcing is putting this at risk. In July last year the ban on imported apples was lifted, and the Australian apple industry has been left in jeopardy through the flooding of local markets with products from overseas that potentially do not adequately address the health risk. Foreign apples should only be allowed if they are free from pests and diseases, especially fire blight. That decision has the potential to cripple areas such as Batlow and Tumut, in my electorate of Riverina, the economies of which rely heavily on apples. This decision with the juice concentrate of oranges is just the same as that example. It is neither right nor fair from a government that says it has regional Australia's interests at heart. But it is not just apples where Labor has weakened the biosecurity and quarantine measures. The Asian bee has threatened the industry over the past 20 years and now threatens to affect everyone in the honey industry and everyone in Australia. Frank Battistel, the Riverina Citrus chairman, summed it up when he said: We wonder when someone is actually going to stand up for the Australian people-growers and consumers-and how it is that the big money of the processing industry can again win out over what is fair, what is right and what the public are demanding.",140
187,Ms PARKE,BILLS," I am pleased to speak to this motion, brought by the member for Barker. As the daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of fruit growers, I understand very well both the importance of strong and effective regulation when it comes to the importation of fruit and fruit products and the importance of quarantine and food standard regulations which err on the side of proper protectionthe importation of apples from fire blight affected countries springs to mind-while nevertheless not unreasonably impeding free and fair trade between countries. Australia is a very substantial net exporter of food and so of course we rely on the fair and reasonable assessment and regulation of our food products in other countries in order to maintain and expand our food markets. I know that Australian producers happily accept the legitimate scrutiny of our agricultural products. They do so with little fear because the quality and standards of our food production are generally exceptional, but, where unreasonable barriers are put on the export of Australian food, there are very serious and damaging consequences. It makes sense that we set our import restrictions with this in mind. The existing maximum residue limit, MRL, of Carbendazim, the active ingredient in a fungicide used to treat citrus trees, is 10 parts per million, and the highest recorded presence of Carbendazim is only 0.1 part per million. That is the case even though we import more than 50 per cent of the Australian orange juice industry's requirement for concentrate. Australia's MRL is the same that applies in Canada and it is set at a level where a 70kilogram adult would need to drink 140 litres of affected orange juice before there would be any health effect. That of course does not mean that the current MRL is sacrosanct or beyond review, and indeed I understand that the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, APVMA, following a review that commenced in 2007, did signal at the end of last year its intention to remove the MRL for Carbendazim residue in citrus fruits. But members and the wider public need to understand that the APVMA position is triggered by its consideration of the occupational health and safety aspects of the use of Carbendazim in the Australian domestic production process and not by any consideration of the health effects of consuming tiny amounts of that chemical. It is precisely because the APVMA determination has not been triggered by reference to the health effect of Carbendazim in food that Food Standards Australia New Zealand has asked that this proposed change to the MRL be subject to a further 12-month consultation period. All this indicates that the regulation of Carbendazim as a potential contaminant is well in hand under Australia's framework of food standards and pesticide regulation. The involvement of AQIS in this task will continue to be shaped by appropriate advice and will occur in addition to the inspection and testing processes already in place through state and territory governments and industry monitoring. It is salient, I think, also note for the benefit of the member for Barker that the reconsideration of how we limit the presence of Carbendazim is occurring under this government and that the MRL was not considered or reviewed at any stage while the coalition was in government. I will finish by saying that I welcome the findings and analysis of the recent Blewett Review of Food Labelling Law and Policy and that I look forward to seeing the implementation of the majority of its recommendations. This is an area in which there is room for much greater transparency, with all the benefits this will deliver for Australian consumers, families and even food producers. I have spoken previously about the fact that stronger requirements when it comes to the health and animal welfare claims of food labels will mean that consumers can buy food with greater confidence and greater discretion and that producers who choose the highest standards of animal welfare in their production of food like eggs and pork will then have the higher product value of that choice protected by labelling laws that prevent the cynical misuse of labels like 'free range'. In any case, I thank the member for Barker for bringing the motion we have discussed tonight. I do not believe there is any significant issue with the safe and rigorous regulation of Carbendazim in Australia. I am confident that our regulatory authorities are giving proper consideration to this issue. Debate adjourned. Thich, Most Venerable Phuoc Hue, OAM",141
188,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS," I move: That this House (1) express its deep regret at the death on 28 to January 2012 of the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue OAM, the Spiritual Leader of the Phuoc Hue Buddhist Monastery and leader of the Vietnamese Buddhist community in Australia; (2) places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and (3) tenders its profound sympathy to the Vietnamese Buddhist community in its bereavement. I have had the privilege of knowing the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue for much of the time he has had here in Australia-that is, for some 25 years. I was privileged to represent the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, at the memorial ceremony held on Wednesday, 8 February 2012. I also was at the Phuoc Hue Temple on the occasion of the Tet celebrations-that is, the Vietnamese new year. At midnight on the evening of 22 January I was with my colleague the member for Fowler, who also happened to be present. It was where I learnt that the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was in hospital, and I was saddened to hear it. Thich Phuoc Hue was born in 1921-I am told by Quang Luu, who has written about him for the Sydney Morning Herald-near Saigon in Vietnam, although his birthday is formally recorded as 1922. He began studying at the age of 13 and was ordained a novice at 16. He was later ordained as a Buddhist monk at the age of 20. During his early career he was in charge of the Buddhist secondary school in An Giang province and the Director of Studies at the Buddhist Studies Institute in Saigon. This is recorded on his CV because he was seen as a very senior leader in the southern Vietnamese community and had played a significant role in the Vietnamese sangha, which resulted in the formation of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. He held many positions of responsibility on the central executive, including Commissioner for Sangha Affairs. After the fall of Saigon, when his church was banned in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, he moved to Hong Kong. He left in 1979 and arrived in Australia, having been sponsored by Australian Vietnamese in 1980. There were some 5,000 or so Vietnamese at that time, but by 1981 41,000 Vietnamese residents in Australia sponsored him as the first monk here in Australia. He led Buddhist ceremonies at the Thai temple in Stanmore and aspired to build Vietnamese Buddhism. He established a temple in Fairfield in 1980, and the Phuoc Hue Temple was completed in 1991 at a cost of $3 million. That occurred over a three-year period. He was involved in fundraising and community leadership in this period and he played a similar role in the construction of the Quang Minh Temple in Sunshine in Victoria. In April 1981 he was elected as the first President of the Vietnamese Buddhist Federation at the inaugural conference in that year and was re-elected subsequently. He was the longest serving president of the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation. He was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia in 1995 in recognition of his contributions to Buddhism in this country. He was involved in the setting up of the as Yellow Lotus printing house for the publication of Buddhist books. The Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, visited the Phuoc Hue Temple in 1994 to meet Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu leaders along with Buddhists. He had a very significant international profile. He was a high-ranking member of the World Buddhist Sangha Council and the World Fellowship of Buddhists. He led the organising committee for the First Executive Conference of the Seventh World Buddhist Sangha Council Congress. He delivered a message of peaceful cooperation at the first International Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation in Yogyakarta, sponsored by Alexander Downer when he Australia's foreign minister. He visited refugee camps. He assisted poor Vietnamese inside Vietnam with both gifts and support for cataract operations. He supported temple building and the establishment of Buddhist organisations in the United States, New Buddhist Zealand and New Caledonia. His outstanding achievements were gained through his devotion, his intellectual energy and his wisdom. These were exceptional qualities and it made me proud to be a friend of his. I was not alone in this admiration. The fact that so many of my colleagues will support this resolution tonight is evidence of that. I note there was a message of condolence on the passing of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue by Cardinal George Pell. He penned these few lines to convey his most sincere condolences: The Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney joins with the senior Venerable Thich Phuoc Tan, OAM and other senior monks, nuns and lay practitioners who mourn deeply the passing of this exemplary spiritual leader and scholar. On occasions of significant ecumenical and interreligious activities, the strong support of The Late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue, OAM and his community was keenly felt and much appreciated. He went on to write: The Late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue, OAM will remain an inspiration not only the Australian Vietnamese Buddhist Community but to many other Australians as well, recalling his contribution to the life our country with gratitude. You may suspect that I have known the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue over many years. I greatly admired his leadership and the contribution he made to this nation. I think he was exemplary in terms of all of those values that we think are so important in our multicultural society. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue advocated harmony amongst nations as well as amongst people. A few years ago ill health forced him to step down from the presidency of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation. He was succeeded by the Venerable Thich Phuoc Tan, who came to Australia as a Vietnamese refugee in the early 1980s and is now the abbot of the Quang Minh Temple in Melbourne. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue has achieved a great deal in his efforts to rebuild Vietnamese Buddhism as part of the fabric of and as a contributor to multicultural Australia. In writing about him, his good friend Tuong Quang Luu had this to say: There remained, however, one piece of unfinished business. His aspiration to set up a Vietnamese Buddhist Studies Institute in Australia was unfulfilled at the time of his death. I hope that others may see in that a significant challenge for the future. I hope it can be recognised in the context of the outstanding leadership that the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue has displayed over the 90 years of his life. I think Australia is an exemplar to the rest of the world through what it has been able to achieve in its tolerance of people who come and settle and are proud to make Australia their home. When you have somebody like the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue, who has achieved so much in his lifetime, you cannot help but admire what we are able to achieve in Australia and give credit to those who have come from across the seas to make Australia their home and have contributed so significantly. I was proud to number the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue amongst my friends and I am proud of what he has been able to do for Vietnamese Buddhism in Australia. I am certainly proud to be able to move this resolution and I think it is a credit that we in the Australian parliament can acknowledge the contribution of such a significant Australian.",142
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded? Mr Craig Kelly: I second the motion.,144
190,Mr HAYES,BILLS," I thank the member for Berowra for bringing this matter before the House and I acknowledge his genuine and long standing commitment to the Buddhist community. The 28th of January this year was a very sad day for Australians but most particularly for the Australian Buddhist community. It marked the passing of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue OAM, who was more than just a religious leader; he was an inspiration to the community and a major contributor to the development of a multicultural society, particularly in south-west Sydney, an area I am particularly proud of. I have had the opportunity of attending a number of events at the Phuoc Hue Temple since I became the member for Fowler. The Phuoc Hue Temple in Wetherill Park is one of the leading temples in Australia, largely due to the work of the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue and his drive and persistence, and it stands very proudly in Wetherill Park. As the member for Berowra indicated, he and I attended the temple January to celebrate Vietnamese new year, and that is where I learnt that the late Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was ill. As the first Vietnamese resident monk in Australia, the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue's guidance, kindness and leadership shone like a beacon to many Vietnamese families who were trying to cope with the loss and grief inflicted by the Vietnam War. Although I did not have many opportunities to talk with the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue, I did meet him last year and I hold him in great admiration and respect. I acknowledge his legacy of good work. I would like to reflect on the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue's life. As one of the most influential Buddhist leaders in Vietnam, where he was born and educated, and in Australia-his adopted country-I am sure you would agree that accomplishments are nothing short of extraordinary. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue learnt about Buddhism in a local temple just outside Saigon. He renounced life at 13. At 16, he became a novice priest and by 20 he was ordained. In Vietnam, the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was also credited with the establishment of several pagodas in the Mekong Delta and in some provinces around Saigon. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue arrived in Australia in 1980. He was sponsored from Hong Kong and became the first Vietnamese resident monk in this country. He aspired to rebuild Vietnamese Buddhism not only to serve the religious needs of Vietnamese Australians-mostly refugees-but also to make a genuine contribution to multiculturalism in Australia. On 1 November 1980, he opened the Vietnamese Buddhist hall of prayer in on 22 Fairfield. With the support of the Vietnamese-Australian community and the Most New South Wales government, the hall of prayer grew to become the Phuoc Hue Temple, which stands proudly in Wetherill Park. In April 1981, he was elected the first president of the Vietnamese Buddhist Federation at the inaugural Buddhist conference in Sydney. In 1987, he was re-elected president of the newly restructured national organisation known as the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation in Australia and New Zealand. He was the congregation's longest serving president until he resigned in 2008 because of ill health. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was also one of the longest serving presidents of the Buddhist Federation of Australia. In 2009, he stepped down from the federation's presidency for the same health reasons. Internationally, he was a high ranking his member and elder of the World Buddhist Sangha Council and the World Fellowship of Buddhists. In 1984, the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue hosted an Australian religious elders meeting at the Phuoc Hue monastery, which was chaired by His Royal Highness Prince Charles, representing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. In his capacity as a senior executive of the World Buddhist Sangha Council, in 2001 the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue and the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation met in Sydney and organised the first executive conference of the seventh World Buddhist Sangha Council Congress and the third world general conference of the World Buddhist Sangha Council Committee-essentially for people of all backgrounds to learn about Buddhism. This was a genuine attempt to promote tolerance and understanding by reaching out to the Australian community at large. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue also advocated harmony among nations, which he expressed as the president of the Buddhist Federation of Australia at its first International Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation in Yogyakarta in 2004. In recent years, the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue worked with institutions such as the Art Gallery of NSW, the University of Western Sydney, Victoria University, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the World Conference on Religions for Peace and the New South Wales and Victorian governments with the specific aim of promoting peace, harmony, mutual tolerance, multiculturalism and interfaith cooperation to the wider community. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was also the most senior Buddhist leader in Australia committed to working not only for the Buddhist community in Australia but also for the development of peace, harmony and well-being of all people regardless of faith and ethnic backgrounds. His contribution and hard work were duly recognised and in 1995 he was awarded the medal of the Order of Australia for his services to the community. The Phuoc Hue temple is more than just a sacred place, particularly for Buddhist people; it is also place of compassion and a place of giving. It is also an iconic feature in the fabric of multiculturalism as it stands in Western Sydney. It shows what can occur when there is commitment and goodwill. Over the years, the Phuoc Hue temple, under the guidance of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue, actively fundraised for both Australian and Youth international charities. Money has been raised for Westmead Children's Hospital and the Queensland flood relief, just to name two. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue achieved amazing thing is in his lifetime. Although his passing is a sad loss to the community, his legacy remains in the hearts and minds of so many and his achievements of a lifetime of good and noble work will not go unremarked. His teaching, guidance and leadership brought direction and comfort to the Vietnamese community, giving them strength to make the most of their opportunities and lives in Australia. His work has also created genuine appreciation for the good work and contributions the Vietnamese community as a whole has made to the Australian way of life in their very short history since coming here following the fall of Saigon. The passing of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue is not only a sad loss to the Vietnamese Buddhist community, but it is also a heartfelt loss to Australian society, particularly to those of us who genuinely believe in the tenets of multiculturalism. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was a great man and a holy man. I offer my most sincere condolences to all the followers of the Vietnamese Buddhist faith. I say to Thich Phuoc Hue's successor, Thich Phuoc Tan, that I will certainly be there at the temple whenever my assistance is needed, as is known by Thich Phuoc Dat, the manager of the Phuoc Hue temple. No speech can a properly sum up the contributions that the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue has made. He will no doubt be remembered as an extraordinary man who has left an extraordinary legacy to his community and to the wider Australian community. In closing, I particularly thank Tanya Huynh and her family for all their efforts in 12 months to bring me into broader contact with the Vietnamese Buddhist community of south-west Sydney. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (21:10): I rise tonight to support the motion moved by the member for Berowra, that this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 28 January 2012 of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue OAM, the spiritual leader of the Thich Phuoc Hue Buddhist monastery and the leader of the Vietnamese Buddhist community in Australia. This House should also place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tender its profound sympathy to the Vietnamese Buddhist community in their bereavement. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue's is an inspiring story of his challenges and achievements in war-torn Vietnam and then in peacetime Australia. Born Tran Van Canh in 1922 in the small farming village of My Thuy in Gia Dinh province near Saigon in what was then French Indochina, he would become one of the most influential Buddhist leaders, not just in Australia but internationally. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue learnt about Buddhism at a local temple and at the age of 13 he began his education and training. By 16 he had become a novice priest and by 20 he was ordained. His talents were spotted in the early 1960s and he was taken to Saigon to join a leadership group of the national Buddhist clergy. He became a commissioner on the executive committee of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. However, following the fall of Saigon, when the South Vietnamese army surrendered on 30 April 1975, the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam was threatened and later banned by the communist authorities. In 1979 he decided to leave his homeland due to religious oppression by the communists and ended up the last as a refugee in a Hong Kong camp. We take religious freedom for granted in Australia and we should note that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam remains a one-party state, where religious leaders who protest at the regime's control of religions are arrested and imprisoned. The current head of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam has been jailed several times over the last 25 years; and today remains under house arrest. Back in Australia, the Most Venerable arrived in 1980 from Hong Kong and became the first Vietnamese resident monk in Australia. He aspired to rebuild Vietnamese Buddhism in Australia, not only to serve the religious needs of the Vietnamese Australian believers, but also to contribute to our multicultural society. This was a consistent theme in the life of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue. He had an innate ability to draw together people from different backgrounds and cultures, promoting harmony and social cohesiveness. Undoubtedly this is why he found his second home in Australia. In April 1981 he was elected the first president of the Vietnamese Buddhist Federation at the inaugural Buddhist conference in Sydney. In 1987 he was re-elected president of the newly restructured national organisation known as the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation in Australia and New Zealand. He was the congregation's longest serving president until his resignation in 2008 because of ill health. Internationally he was a high-ranking member and elder of the World Sangha Council and the World Fellowship of Buddhists. Through his drive and persistence, he built, or was instrumental in the building of, Vietnamese temples in Sydney, Melbourne, other capital cities of Australia, and in New Zealand. He was the founding abbot of the Phuoc Hue monastery in Sydney, which has become the central focal point for the Vietnamese Buddhist community in Australia and is a place for reflection, worship and contemplation. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was awarded a medal of the Order of Australia on Australia Day 1995. He passed away peacefully on Saturday, 28 January 2012 in Sydney. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was a strong advocate for peace, social harmony and inclusiveness. achievements are evidenced by the success of the Vietnamese community in Australia, despite their difficult and challenging beginnings. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue OAM will be remembered for his many years of dedicated service to the local community and his outstanding achievements, which were gained through his devotion, intellectual energy and wisdom. He has left an outstanding example of selflessness which was admired by both the Buddhist community and the general community at large and he has provided an invaluable example for people of all religions to learn from. I extend my deepest sympathies to the Australian Vietnamese Buddhist community at his passing.",144
191,Mr DANBY,BILLS," First of all, I would like to pay tribute moving speeches by the members for Berowra and Fowler, amongst others, for the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue, probably the most influential Buddhist leader this country has seen. He came originally from Vietnam and had a tremendous influence on his new country of resettlement, Australia. Unlike other people who have contributed to this debate, I have almost no Vietnamese Australians in my electorate, but I have had an interest since university in the Indochinese refugee movement, as it was known then, and I supported Indochinese migrants and refugees coming to Australia in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Tran Van Canh, as he was then known, was born in a farming village in the My Thuy province, near Saigon, in 1921. He was ordained as a Buddhist priest at the age of 20, became a teacher of novices and laypeople and, in his early 40s, he was taken to Saigon to join the leadership of the national Buddhist clergy. That is an indication of the potential his religion saw in him. His The 1960s and 1970s, as we all know from the footage of those times, were troubling for Vietnam. Buddhism was under attack by the communist authorities. Thich Phuoc Hue had to leave his home, firstly as a refugee in Hong Kong and then as a sponsored migrant to Australia in 1980. He became the first resident monk of Vietnamese background in Australia. There was certainly a great need for him because, in the five years between 1976 and 1981, the Vietnamese population in Australia grew from 2,500 to more than 41,000. It is now 158,000. In 1980, he opened his first Buddhist prayer hall in Fairfield. This grew into what has been described as the Phuoc Hue Temple in Wetherill Park. He did a whole number of things to educate his community about Buddhism in Australia, to the which I will go through in more detail. I wanted to particularly focus on something I find absolutely fascinating about what has happened in Vietnam since the fall of Saigon in contrast to here in Australia amongst Vietnamese people. The 2006 census in Australia indicated that 59 per cent of Australian residents born in Vietnam were Buddhist and 26 per cent were Christian. This compares with only nine per cent of people living in Vietnam identifying as Buddhist. What that indicates to me is that the life mission of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was very successful and that the Vietnamese people in Australia had access to their own religion and because of his great intellectual and religious contribution they were able to express their own religion, which, as we know, including great leaders of Buddhism, is suppressed in Vietnam. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was an internationally respected dharma master and one of the few Australians to be mentioned in The Seeker's Glossary of Buddhism. His obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald was fittingly titled 'Leader advocated social harmony'. His memory lives through the multicultural and interfaith connections he sought so assiduously and which have been spoken about so knowledgeably by the previous speakers. The Buddhist temple has many functions-a shelter for society, a meeting place for people of goodwill and a spiritual refuge. In Vietnam and in so many other Asian countries-and now here in many places in Australia-the temple stresses the faith not only as the path to enlightenment but as the core of the Buddhist people's spiritual and cultural life. Vietnamese Australians have contributed so much to Australia, and the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was essential in shaping those contributions. He reminds me very much of the legendary rabbi of the postwar generation Rabbi Chaim Gutnik, who revived belief in the Jewish refugees who came to Australia in their own background and faith. I think that Australia was a better place for him and his activities-religious, cultural and interfaith. We thank him and we will miss him.",148
192,Mr MATHESON,BILLS," It is with great sadness that I rise to speak tonight to support the father of the House, the member for Berowra, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, in his motion to celebrate the life of the late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue OAM, who passed away on 28 January 2012. His passing represents a great loss not just to the Vietnamese Buddhist community but to the Australian nation as a whole. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue's legacy will live on through his many achievements. He will be warmly remembered by the Vietnamese community as one of the pioneers of Vietnamese Buddhism in Australia. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue had a long and distinguished career as an educator and spiritual leader both here in Australia and in his homeland, Vietnam. In Vietnam, he was a highly respected Buddhist leader, holding many important positions, including Director of Studies at the Buddhist Studies Institute and Secretary of the Southern Vietnam Delegation to the National Conference of the Vietnamese Sangha. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue also held influential positions within the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, including Commissioner for Sangha Affairs. The UBCV was later banned by the Vietnamese communist government. After leaving communist rule in Vietnam, the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue spent many years in a refugee camp in Hong Kong. He did not let his surroundings hinder his passion for education and his faith. By 1980, his migration to Australia was sponsored by a group of Vietnamese-Australian Buddhists. He became the first resident Vietnamese Buddhist monk in Australia. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to this group. Few would have imagined the great work that the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue would achieve in his lifetime. In Australia, the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue transformed the Vietnamese Buddhist community, uniting them with a common vision of rebuilding Vietnamese Buddhism in Australia and promoting peace and social harmony. Before his prestigious career in Australia as one of the nation's most influential Buddhist leaders, the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue faced many trials and tribulations, meeting each one with a keen and determined mind and a positive heart. It is a lesson that our communities benefit from and a lesson that I hope we will never forget. We should all follow the example set by the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue and see each challenge before us as an opportunity to learn, to develop our spirit and mind and to reach out to those around us. The late Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue had a profound impact on the Buddhist communities in Western Sydney and across Australia. He was a strong advocate for peace, social harmony and inclusiveness and was the spiritual leader of the Phuoc Hue Buddhist Temple in Wetherill Park, which bears his name. He was the driving force behind this beautiful temple, which was completed in 1991. He had a strong vision to rebuild Vietnamese Buddhism in Australia, not just for the benefit of the Vietnamese community but to contribute to multiculturalism in Australia. The spread of Buddhism has also touched my electorate of Macarthur with the much visited Da Bao Monastery in Wedderburn, just south of Campbelltown. This monastery provides the Buddhist community in Macarthur with a beautiful place of worship and meditation and hosts a number of festivities and celebrations throughout the year. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue's vision of rebuilding was not limited to the many beautiful temples and monasteries we see across our electorates today. He was also firmly committed to rebuilding the lives of the many Vietnamese refugees who came to Australia seeking refuge from the war that ravaged their homeland. He helped them make a new life for themselves and helped to build the Vietnamese community into what it is today-a respected, peaceful, productive, and vibrant part of the Australian social fabric. As the first president of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation in Australia and New Zealand, the UVBC, he had a long and enviable list of accomplishments, both in Australia and internationally. Some of these include the selection by His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Phuoc Hue Temple as a neutral place to hold discussions with Australia's religious leaders from the Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and Buddhist faiths in 1994. In 1995, the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in recognition of his contributions to the Vietnamese Buddhist community. On an international scale, the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was a highranking member and elder of the World Buddhist Sangha Council. In 2001, he led the organising committee for the First Executive Conference of the Seventh World Buddhist Sangha Council and Congress as well as for the Third World General Conference of the World Buddhist Sangha Council Youth Committee in Sydney. He was also a strong advocate for international peace and cooperation. In his capacity as President of the Buddhist Federation of Australia, he addressed the first international Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation in 2004 with a strong message of peace and cooperation between nations and people of different faiths. The Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was a humble and honourable man. He achieved many great works in his lifetime and touched hundreds and thousands of lives. Although he is no longer with us, his memory and his legacy will burn brightly for generations to come. It is an honour and a privilege to be here today with the father of the House to celebrate the life of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue OAM. Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (21:24): I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of this motion by the member for Berowra concerning the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue OAM. I associate myself not only with the former words of profound sympathy to the community and deep regret at his passing but also with the theme that went through the contribution of the member for Berowra. Here in the national parliament of Australia we are celebrating the life of a person who was born in 1921 in a village near Saigon, who fled his country, who was a refugee in Hong Kong in 1979 and who was then sponsored into this country to become the first resident monk of Vietnamese background in Australia. We are celebrating his contribution to this country, what he accomplished and the fact that this can happen in Australia. At the age of 13 he renounced the life of other people, becoming ordained as priest seven years later. Along the road he built up an organisation, a series of institutions were so important to the community. It is interesting to note that, when he referred to comparisons between Vietnam and Australia, I thought the member for Melbourne Ports was going to go on a different theme. In the 1980s in New South Wales a large amount of excess land was owned by the Department of Main Roads, the Water Board, the railway department et cetera. In that day and age state governments actually contributed this land to pioneering ethnic communities that did not have property or institutions and did not have a way to obtain such properties. That land, like other land in that region, donated to the Buddhist faith, just as around the corner, also on donated land, is an mosque owned by the Turkish community. It is a reality of this country that we can celebrate the long and distinguished life of a person who not only came from another country and was able to help meet the spiritual needs of his fellows in this country but, with government assistance, could form institutions that were so crucial to them. It has been remarked upon and it is worth noting that, from 2,400 people in 1976, the number of Vietnamese speakers in this country has grown to 174,000. Back then, of course, it was crucial that they had a monk who could give them counselling and leadership. As others have noted, he played a wider role. It is no accident that Prince Charles went to the Phuoc Hue Temple and rang the bell on a visit that encompassed not only the Buddhist community but other religions. That was typical of the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue's contribution in this country. It is also not surprising that the Dalai Lama visited the temple twice. It is also worth noting that his efforts went not only to the temple at Wetherill Park but to premises in Sunshine and that he played an instrumental role in establishing a variety of organisations in this country, including the that Vietnam Buddhist Association of Australia and New Zealand and the Buddhist Church of Vietnam Reunification Australia-New Zealand, and a range of school and religious buildings in Vietnam. Last Friday, the member for Berowra and I were present at a hearing of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into the question of human rights. It is no accident that the Unified Buddhist Congregation, of which the Most Venerable Thich Phuoc Hue was a member, was there giving evidence about religious freedom in Vietnam. Quang Luu, was who was mentioned by the member for Berowra, was there in another capacity. We are celebrating not only the individual and the leadership he provided the community but the fact that in this country people with this kind of integrity and ability are there providing evidence before committees in this country and making sure that we as a country learn more about other societies and are aware of what is happening. I take great pleasure in being part of this motion by the member for Berowra. Debate adjourned. NA The SPEAKER (21:29): propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. DonateLife Week 2012",149
193,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to speak on the important matter of organ and tissue donation in Australia. Last week Australians celebrated DonateLife Week 2012. The awareness campaign's sole purpose is to raise the profile of organ and tissue donation in the community, and that is why I rise tonight-to do my part in promoting this very worthy cause. Sadly, Australia's donation rates still lag behind the majority of developed countries, ranked only 24th globally in 2010 by the Council of Europe. While any increase in the rate of organ donation in Australia is welcome news, the fact remains that Australia's donation rate is still less than that of leading countries, like Spain. There are only 14.9 organ donors each year for every million people living in Australia. Compare this with Spain, where the rate is 35 per million. We can and must do betterlives literally depend on it. That is why today organ and tissue donation is a vital conversation that Australians need to have with their loved ones and friends. The fact is that in Australia organ and tissue donation cannot not occur without the direct consent of family members. This is still the case when the individual in question has registered with the Australian Organ Donor Registry. Many of those on organ transplant waiting lists face the prospect of dying unless they are able to receive a donated organ in time. As at 4 January 2012, there were 1,628 people on organ transplant lists in Australia. It is a sad but nonetheless true fact that the number of organ donations in Australia cannot currently meet the demand for organs. Tragically, more than one Australian dies every week waiting for Order! I an organ transplant. The fact is that these lives can be saved-each person who becomes a donor can significantly improve the quality of life or indeed save the life of up to 10 people. The theme of DonateLife Week is very appropriately 'discover, decide and discuss', and it is imperative for Australians to embrace these ideas as we work together to increase donation rates. In my first term I was very pleased to be a part of the Howard government, which commissioned the National Clinical Taskforce on Organ and Tissue Donation in order to seek evidence based advice on ways to improve the rate of organ, eye and tissue donation for transplantation in Australia. In its final report, the task force attributed Australia's inability to increase organ donation to a number of factors, chief of which was the fragmented nature of the half organ donation and transplantation sector. As such, the task force recommended the establishment of a national coordination and transplantation authority. When these recommendations were finally acted on, the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority was set up in 2009 under the Rudd government's $151 million reform-a world's best practice approach to organ and tissue donation for transplantation-but it has had somewhat of a lethargic start at meeting its self-imposed targets, with donation regrettably failing to rise significantly. One of the suggested reasons for our lower than expected organ donation rates is a family's lack of awareness of their loved ones' wishes. Our shadow parliamentary secretary for primary health care, Dr Andrew Southcott, has agreed with me that the most common reason cited by families when declining to donate a relative's organs is that they did not know what their wishes were. I would encourage all Australians to have the organ donation discussion with their family and loved ones. The coalition has always been in favour of improving Australia's organ donation rates, but we need to ensure that this is done in the most efficient and effective way possible. Some people might have conditions that prevent them from becoming an organ donor, but almost everyone can be a tissue donor and it is never too late to sign up. With Australians 10 times more likely to require an organ or tissue transplant than to become a donor, it is in all of our interests and to sign up now. In conclusion, I leave you with something I once read on a bumper sticker while waiting in traffic: 'Don't take your organs with you when you go-heaven knows we need them here.' Colvin, Ms Marie",152
194,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," Last week renowned war correspondent Marie Colvin was killed in the Syrian city of Homs. She was killed covering the attacks of the Assad regime on its own people. Throughout her career, Marie Colvin had covered conflicts in the Balkans, Chechnya and Zimbabwe. She had covered the revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. In 2001, covering the conflict between government forces and the rebel Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, Marie Colvin was struck by shrapnel and lost her left eye. She wore a black eye patch, which became her trademark. After the loss of her eye she wrote about why she covered wars, putting herself in danger. She said that it is important to tell people what is really happening and about humanity in extremes, pushed to the unendurable. She said: My job is to bear witness. I have never been interested in knowing what make of plane had just bombed a village or whether the artillery that fired at it was 120 mm or 155 mm. In November 2010 she said at a service for war journalists: Covering a war means going to places torn by chaos, destruction, and death, and trying to bear witness. It means trying to find the truth in a sandstorm of propaganda when armies, tribes or terrorists clash. And yes, it means taking risks, not just for yourself but often for the people who work closely with you. … … … … We always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story. What is bravery, to sign up and what is bravado? In 1999 in East Timor Marie Colvin was credited with saving the lives of hundreds of women and children when she stayed in a UN compound in Dili besieged by Indonesian backed forces. Refusing to leave, reporting their plight almost hourly to the world, she managed to secure the safety of the East Timorese and was publicly rewarded when they were evacuated safely four days later. Colleague and Guardian journalist Roy Greenslade said, 'She was the bravest woman I have ever known.' Anthony Loyd of the Times, reflecting on the kind of person Marie Colvin was, wrote: Driven? Certainly. Eccentric? Very. But conceited? Never. Her humility made her a rare bird in an aviary renowned for its preening. He wrote: On her death, she was the undisputed standardbearer of our values, a woman whose courage and endeavour singularly advanced the capability of others by providing the benchmark for what we should aspire to. Her humour survived intact. Before leaving for Sri Lanka two years ago she said to him: If you see a bit of eye lying in the jungle, pick up. It could be mine! In response to an erroneous comment on a website congratulating her for returning from Homs safely she wrote: I think reports of my survival exaggerated. One of Marie Colvin's last correspondent reports was this: In Baba Amr. Sickening, cannot understand how the world can stand by … Watched a baby die today. Shrapnel, doctors could do nothing. His little tummy just heaved and heaved until he stopped. Feeling helpless … Will keep trying to get out the information I spoke in the adjournment debate last June on the issue of Syria. The member for North Sydney spoke in the same debate. I do not think either of us expected we would be here this year still speaking about the bloodshed in Syria. More than 5,000 people have now lost their lives. About 18,000 are estimated to be still held in arbitrary detention. Despite the fact that the UN General Assembly has overwhelmingly supported a resolution on the situation in Syria, such a resolution has been blocked in the Security Council. Those states who oppose the resolution-Russia and China-now have a responsibility to make plain what their alternative plans are for ending the bloodshed in Homs, Hama, Damascus and across Syria. Mr Assad has lost all legitimacy. It is critical that we support the Arab League plan, that we galvanise and coordinate international support for the people of Syria and that we strengthen the voice of the international community for an end to the bloodshed. Australia strongly supports the efforts of the Arab League. We have imposed financial sanctions designed to hold those who have engaged in human rights abuses accountable. We now urge the UN Security Council to support the people of Syria. This cannot go on. We must have a it global effort to get rid of the Assad regime, which lost all legitimacy when it began deploying arms against its own people and which now must go. Dairy Industry may be Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (21:40): It appears that the market is failing Western Australian dairy farmers. Last week, 150,000 litres of milk was trucked into the state from South Australia. As a dairy farmer, I know that WA dairy farmers are certainly not being offered South Australian prices plus the cost of cartage for their milk. And now WA consumers face the very real prospect of running out of fresh milk as a result of the supermarket price wars and the pressure their market share places on milk manufacturers and producers. In fact, extreme market pressure is being applied to manufacturers and producers through a combination of low prices and house brand labels. Coles and Woolworths are laughing all the way to the bank as they increase their control and absolute dominance over total food sales in Australia! I am also told that to meet supermarket contracts in South Australia, milk is being trucked-you want to call it leapfroggedfrom Victoria. I have got no doubt that processors are taking money out of their margins to pay the cartage to meet their supermarket contracts at a direct cost to the ultimate price takers, the dairy farmers who produce fresh milk, perhaps the most perishable product in the agricultural sector-a supply chain vulnerability totally overlooked by the ACCC and this Labor government. There has been no response to the Economics References Committee Milking for all it is worth report that looked at matters in the dairy industry. I wonder whether Coles and Woolworths will pay more for milk refrigeration and the increased cost of diesel-trucking the milk from state to state-when the carbon tax hits. I wonder if there will be extra in those contracts. This is an email I received from dairy industry service provider Dean Maughan: WA consumers will be running out of fresh milk. Hard working and highly efficient farmers can't pay their bills and are as disheartened as I have seen them. The export of WA heifers is an all time high as farmers sell heifers to pay basic bills. The solution to our future milk supply is being sold to China. Please do not believe that the importation of milk in WA is a short term, one off thing. If it is happening now, it will be much worse next year and for a longer period of time. This is because the livestock have been and continue to be sold to pay basic bills. Without more livestock, there not be more milk Farmers are not feeding their cows correctly now because of a lack of money. Keep in mind that the demand for fresh milk in WA is growing due to population increase at this time of declining supply. The actual supply of milk is down by 16 million litres in seven months in WA. Do not forget that milk is an essential food, particularly for babies and children. As Australians, we need a geographically diverse dairy industry in this country-a country of climatic extremes with the sevenplus years of drought in Victoria, followed by severe floods. A geographically diverse dairy industry manages these risks to fresh milk production. Approximately 96 per cent of the Western Australian dairy industry is located in the south-west region of WA-the majority are in my electorate. Our farmers, I am proud to say, are amongst the world's most efficient producers of high quality milk. However, many Australian dairy farmers are losing money and many others are making the equivalent of the dole. Yet, we are expecting people to work under these conditions and provide us with an essential food that is the best quality in the world. One couple wrote to me and said, in part: If you have any further doubts about the debilitating financial position we are currently experiencing as a direct result of farm gate milk prices, please feel free to contact our local Commonwealth bank manager who will be happy to give you a full indication of the financial pressures of local dairy farmers. They concluded by saying: I thank you for your time and trust that this matter will no longer be ignored, as dairy farmers are relying on your assistance to bring about some drastic changes to the industry so we can continue to provide fresh local milk to Western Australian families. How is the market failing milk producers? will Currently there is a shortage and milk processors in WA cannot get enough fresh milk to meet their contract quotas. Basic economics acknowledges that if the free market was working properly this should mean a price rise to producers to stimulate growth in production. Has this occurred? No. The price being offered to producers for their milk is not sufficient to drive increased production. It is not sufficient to raise capital and to grow earnings because it is not sufficient to grow milk volumes. Western Australian milk processors are not raising the price they pay farmers to stimulate milk production as the free market should dictate. Instead, they have been trucking in milk from the eastern states. This is because the supermarket duopoly in Australia dictates the price of milk to processors, who are left with no capacity to pay Australian dairy farmers adequately for their product. This is driving good farmers out of the industry. (Time expired) Tasmania: Tourism",153
195,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise in the House today to speak on my vision for tourism in my electorate of Bass and the opportunities of the region. Tasmania is generally thought of as an eco-destination, but I see it as much more than that. Launceston was established in 1806 by free settlers. The area has fine Victorian buildings from the 1870s and 1880s and elegant contemporary architecture. We have many unique attractions, such as the Cataract Gorge, a natural wonder only a 15-minute walk from the city. There is also the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, the Inveresk precinct. The James Boag and Son brewery is just a block away from the CBD and a short drive out of the city you can glide through the treetops at Hollybank, one of Tasmania's newest tourism ventures. Cool climate wines and fine dining are important fixtures of the Northern Tasmania experience and Launceston is the perfect base from which to explore the surrounding region. We are becoming a food bowl, with great local produce and keen innovators looking for ways to grow and expand their businesses. The Gillard Labor government has encouraged this through generous funding for irrigation projects around the state in conjunction with the state government. I am pleased to note that in February Stillwater restaurant in Launceston was voted by Australian Traveller as one of the top five destination restaurants in Australia. Me Wah in Launceston is also well renowned, winning many prestigious state and national awards. Travelling around the region, the Tamar River flows north from Launceston to George Town with lavender plantationswhich I visited just last week with the minister for agriculture, Senator Ludwig, the member for Braddon and the member for Lyons-vineyards, berry farms and orchards available to the public. I encourage visitors to do a Tamar River cruise to see the area by water. North-east of Launceston is Scottsdale, with its Forestry EcoCentre and art galleries. I also recommend visitors travel to Bridport for fishing and the world-class golf. If you have not been to Barnbougle Dunes or Lost Farm you have not been to the best courses in Australia. When it comes to sporting events, we are home of the Tassie Hawks, a footy team that play at my club's old ground, Aurora Stadium. They are a great boost to our economy. Many tourists also visit for the Targa Tasmania event, which is a tarmac rally with competitive stages on closed roads for the best touring, sports and GT cars in the world. Launceston plays host to Targa Tasmania and this year will be the base for the first five nights. Festivale took place during February. This is one of the premier food and wine events in Australia. It is a celebration of the great produce and arts that Tasmania creates. The organisers do a fantastic job, and I offer them my best wishes for the future of the event. The Tasmanian Breath of Fresh Air Film Festival, directed by Owen Tilbury, is also a standout attraction. The first Tasmanian Breath of Fresh Air Film Festival was held in 2010, an initiative of the Launceston Film Society, Australia's largest film society. Cataract Gorge is a must for tourists. Here you will find walking and hiking trails, the world's longest single span chairlift, a swimming pool, restaurants, kiosks, peacocks and wildlife in the gardens, a suspension bridge, an interpretation centre and lookouts with spectacular views. Another great place to visit is the Tin Centre at Derby. The centre tells the story of tin and why it was of such vital importance not only to our region but to the world. The Australian government TQUAL or tourism grants create another great incentive for tourism operators to invest in regional Australia. One such grant will help Velo Wines at Legana in the Tamar Valley construct a restaurant, further improving that facility. The Australian government is committed to maximising tourism's net economic contribution to Australia. There are truly magnificent places in Tasmania, places that will take your breath away. I encourage all mainlanders and people from overseas to look at the island down under for their next holiday and encourage entrepreneurs to invest in our region. (Time expired) Regional Health Services",155
196,Mr SECKER,ADJOURNMENT," Last week I took part in a great regional health forum in Mount Gambier. It was hosted by my South Australian colleague Senator David Fawcett and coalition regional health spokesman Andrew Laming, the member for Bowman. It is great to see him here in the chamber. I am proud to say that I was the first Australian member of parliament to procure funding to help establish a doctors surgery Meningie. That was some 11 or 12 years ago. We now have an Australia-wide program to upgrade doctors surgeries, which we did not 11 or 12 years ago. Governments have widely accepted the need to make it easier for doctors to relocate to and practice in regional areas. The overwhelming theme during the Mount Gambier forum was the struggle by communities to meet the ever-growing demand for health services. government, unfortunately, is doing nothing to help regional areas like Mount Gambier cope with the growing demand. Labor promised GP super clinics but the program has been plagued by problems, including construction delays and funding disputes as well as widespread criticism that it would damage existing local general practices. I have always supported helping existing practices to expand; I have supported extra funding for many clinics in Barker. Just last year in August, I added my support to the Keith and District Medical Centre in their application for funding for an after-hours service to provide Keith and surrounding districts with adequate after-hours care for patients. In December I supported the Port Macdonnell community health service in its pursuit to upgrade the current consulting room, office/reception and toilets, and to improve the administration and operation of the service by constructing an extension to support additional general and specialised medical and health service providers to that facility and by constructing another secure extension to house the local pharmacy. Port Macdonnell is quite a small village, so it is very important that we can provide those services. In May I added my support to the application by the Bridge Clinic to upgrade in their emergency management and triage, ambulance undercover facility, mental health and chronic disease units, nurses stations and waiting room: all very important things for the local community. In May I also added my support to the Ferrers Medical Clinic in Mount Gambier to further develop their practice including additional consulting/treatment rooms, together with a conference/audio visual room, students room and library. I could go on, but I think the This House gets the idea that I have always been an advocate for helping existing practices to expand their services. I have already had success in Meningie, Kingston and Naracoorte and Yankalilla, and certainly Barker hopes for those further upgrades that I have supported. This government's fixation on centralisation of control to Adelaide and Canberra has led to growing bureaucratic inefficiencies in service delivery. I agree with Senator Fawcett and the member for Bowman when they state: 'Abolishing local hospital boards and regional divisions of general practice has not worked well in these communities at all.' As someone who has served on hospital boards twice in my life, for four years, I understand the absolute importance of keeping them, not only in regional Australia but also across the nation. That is coalition policy. I believe the people who know best how to run a hospital are those people who are directly involved, not a bureaucrat in Canberra. Often those serving on the hospital board are also those who are part of the community. Certainly in the smaller regional areas the board members are almost definitely people who have been involved in the community and the hospital for some time. One just has to look at the Keith and District Hospital, a hospital I speak of frequently in this place. Its board is made up of extremely hard-working people who have other jobs but who devote a lot of time volunteering in the hospital and in their local communities. I must commend them on their efforts because, against all odds, the hospital still has its doors open. I enough of local hospital boards and I have watched in anguish as this government has torn down that structure and favoured a big bureaucratic system. It does not work in regional areas. Melbourne Ports Electorate",157
197,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT," On Saturday night, despite all of the political events that were happening inside government, I had the pleasure of being the guest of honour at the 20th anniversary dinner of the Australian Institute of Polish Affairs at the beautiful Windsor Hotel in Melbourne. I would like to congratulate that wonderful organisation with its mission of introducing serious people from Poland to Australia, and Australians to Poles. The roles of a former president of the institute, Mr Eherenkreutz, and the head of SBS, Mr Zubrizki, are very well known to people here. If I could hear myself above the speakers across the other side of the aisle, I would also be able to recall that Professor Ruth Pearce, the Australian Ambassador to Poland, and Andrzej Jaroszynski, the very cosmopolitan Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to Australia, were also present, as was the president, my friend Professor Jan Pakulski, and very dear personal friends Adam and Margaret Warzel. I have been involved with the Polish community for more than 20 years. As my friend Adam Warzel recounted, we were first involved in a concert to support a Solidarity bard, Jacek Kaczmarski, in Melbourne 26 years ago. Later, I offered the Polish community help with the visit of the great Polish journalist Leopold Unger. When I looked at the wonderful publication by the Australian Institute of Polish Affairs celebrating its 20 years, I was amazed at the number of leading Poles who had been to Australia and at the number of events that I cannot speak highly had attended. The great journalist Jan Nowak, the famous Polish activist Adam Michnik, and of course that great emissary and great professor Jan Karski, who had visited the ghettos and death camps in Poland and who met all of the wartime leaders-President Roosevelt, the American Supreme Court Judge Felix Frankfurter, even the British foreign secretary-and had tried, to his great detriment, to convey what was happening inside Europe, but he was not able to convince them. Jan Karski is one of the greatest speakers I have ever heard. I will never forget the night he addressed a local hall in Elsternwick in Melbourne. The Australian Institute of Polish Affairs has brought to Australia people like Professor Timothy Garton Ash; prime ministers and foreign ministers of Poland; Professor Michael Heller, the Templeton prize winner; and Adam Rotfeld, the former Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs. The work that the institute does is to its great credit. Mr Speaker, I have a long-standing interest in Poland, as you may know, because my father was born in Poland in what the Germans call Poznan, the town of Torun, the spa town in what is now Poland. It was a great honour to be at the dinner given by the Australian Institute of Polish Affairs, which has done so much to encourage PolishAustralian relations. I think we do not reciprocate this enough on the Australian side. The Polish economy is such a great success and is one of the few economies in the world that resisted the global financial crisis. Only Australia, South Korea, Poland and Israel have officially grown since the GFC. I know that in some of the lessinformed sectors in Australia the archaic perception of Eastern European Poland has not caught up with the reality of the fastgrowing dynamic economy that is Poland. On Friday, unfortunately at a hearing of the foreign affairs committee, we heard another rather pathetic response by a leading banker in Australia who said that he did not know anything about Poland's economic dynamism and did not want to know. A miraculous political and economic transformation has taken place in Poland since the fall of communism. It is no longer East-European in its national outlook. It is the central European hub of the EU. Unlike its Soviet bloc neighbours, Poland has taken incredible reforms to liberalise its economy. As we now know from recent events, there has been no banking collapse in Poland. They built an independent currency and had constitutional debt limits. Poland is the only EU member that has avoided recession and, unlike the Greeks, I am sure that the Poles are very glad that they stuck with the zloty. Poland has, of course, at its head the wonderful foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, and I congratulate the Institute of Polish Affairs on trying to reach out to Australia, something that unfortunately this country and this government, and even this foreign ministry, the Department of Foreign Affairs, does not do enough to recognise. (Time expired) Gold Coast Compound Lighthouse Calvary Care Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (22:01): I take this opportunity today to recognise the efforts of two wonderful organisations within my electorate that I have the honour to visit on a regular basis. The first provides a safe and fun environment for our local youth, whilst the other supports needy families, providing a trolley full of groceries for just $20. Upper Coomera is one of the fastestgrowing areas in my electorate and also in the Gold Coast. It amazes me every time to go down there to see the new houses, the new developments, the new centres and all the building activity and development going on in that area. This area attracts a lot of families and, whilst developers and the local council do their best to design playgrounds, parks and other facilities, this area generally lacks the sporting facilities that are required for the numerous young people in our community. As we all know, keeping our young people active is of critical importance as boredom can lead to antisocial behaviour which may lead to incidence of vandalism or graffiti. The Gold Coast Compound is an indoor recreation facility for skateboarders, scooter riders and BMX riders. It also caters for musicians, artists and for school excursions for kids interested in those things. The compound provides a community facility in which to perform, develop and enhance talents and skills in order to help young people achieve their goals and dreams. Additionally, GC Compound, as it is more affectionately known, provides a safe, controlled environment with positive role models for young kids. I recently had the privilege to attend the GC Compound Challenge 2012 scooter event and was able to donate a trophy for the best and fairest rider on the evening. It was a great experience being there to witness all the hard work and determination of all those young competitors, and some of the tricks that they were able to do with scooters were truly mind-boggling. I would like to formally acknowledge the efforts of Tom Herzog, the Director of GC Compound, for his efforts and I look forward to providing my continued support to the GC Compound for the fabulous work they do in the Upper Coomera community, but also in the broader community as people from far afield travel down there to use their facilities. The second organisation I wish to recognise tonight is Lighthouse Calvary Care. Some of our members here may remember a story which broke on national television late last year on the Channel 7 Sunrise program where a Logan food bank was robbed and vandalised. At the time Lighthouse Calvary Care had been stockpiling food and gifts ahead of one of their biggest community events in the area, the Lang Christmas Dinner, which is put on for more than 200 local needy families who, without the support and invitation to such an event, would have a much poorer Christmas experience. Thankfully the response to the story on the Channel 7 Sunrise program from the members of the wider community was overwhelming. Ron and Debbie Hill, who run Lighthouse Calvary Care, were astounded at the generosity of the community. Whilst the robbery interrupted their planning, the dinner was a huge success. Ron and Debbie Hill, the founders of Lighthouse Calvary Care, are dedicated to helping families in need. They have been working in the local area for nine years to support those struggling emotionally, socially and financially. What originally started out handing out bread donated by local bakeries on a Saturday morning has resulted in a registered charity which provides over 1,500 trolleys of groceries every week at the cost of only $20.00. Some weekends, I head down to their headquarters and assist with the packing of trolleys, and each weekend there are more people coming from far and wide in desperate need of this service. I am very thankful for the wonderful work that Ron, Debbie, their staff and volunteers at Lighthouse Calvary Care do supporting the people in our community. I have made it my business to support community organisations like the GC Compound and Lighthouse Calvary Care as they are pillars of strength in our local community and are part of the fabric of the Forde community that makes it such a great place to live, a place where you can experience a true sense of what community spirit is all about. (Time expired) Fowler Electorate: Vietnamese and Chinese New Year",158
198,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," It is well believed that multiculturalism is one of Australia's greatest strengths. My electorate of Fowler is the most multicultural electorate in the whole of Australia and has thus given me the opportunity this year to enjoy more than one new year celebration. This year 23 January saw the celebration of the Chinese and Vietnamese New Year, the Year of the Dragon. Since more than 30 per cent of my electorate speak either Vietnamese or Chinese at home, you can imagine the size of the new year festivities in my area. The celebrations began in Cabramatta with the Lunar New Year Festival held over 14 and 15 January and ending at the beginning of February. As a new member I wanted to do more than just read about the customs and traditions so I began my actions over the following days to immerse myself in the Asian culture. As I did last year, I visited 10 temples with Vietnamese and Chinese people as it is believed that this brings prosperity. also attended mass with Father Paul Van Chi and Vietnamese Catholics at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church. They gave me the opportunity to speak on that occasion on human rights. On Saturday, 29 January, I had the pleasure of attending and representing the Prime Minister at the Vietnamese Community of Australia New South Wales chapter's opening ceremony at the annual Tet festival. My congratulations go to President Mr Thanh Nguyen as well as Internal Vice President Dr Tien Nguyen and External Vice-President Mr Toan Nguyen on the fantastic festival showcasing Vietnamese traditions and culture. I also took three of my grandchildren to the Tet festival. They were quite excited to be taken there wearing traditional Vietnamese ao dai outfits for girls and boys which my wife had recently bought for them in Cabramatta. I strongly believe the success of the event was due to the hard work of the VCA committee-who, I might add, are all volunteers. I congratulate Mr Thanh Nguyen on his re-election and look forward to continuing to work with him to serve our community in the south-west of Sydney. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Dr Tien Nguyen, a local doctor who practises in Cabramatta, as he has been chosen as a People of Australia Ambassador. Dr Tien's service to the community over the past couple of decades has been extraordinary. During the opening ceremony for the Tet festival I spoke about a famous Vietnamese saying which a dear friend of mine, Dr Lieu Vinh Binh, had told me. The saying can be translated loosely as, 'When you eat the fruit you should have regard for those who planted the tree.' I reflected on the contribution the Vietnamese community I have made over the past 36 years since the fall of Saigon. For a fairly newly arrived community, I am impressed with their achievement and humbled by their contributions. It was only 12 months ago that the Vietnamese community came together to raise funds for the Queensland flood appeal. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised by my community of Vietnamese Australians in the span of a couple of weeks. Over the following few weeks I also had the pleasure of attending various Chinese New Year festivals. One was the Australian Chinese Teo-Chew Association. I extend my thanks to Chairman Frank Chou OAM as well as to the President and executive management committee member Hung Lee for their great work not only in what they do for the association but in what they do for the community in general. I believe that the Vietnamese and Chinese New Year festivals are a time when they are able to showcase their traditions and their culture in a way that augments the diversity of our country. These festivals indicate those things that we hold dear. I feel extremely fortunate to be able to represent such a multicultural community in this parliament. I thank all the leaders for their attention to tolerance, inclusion and understanding as well as their commitment to sharing their culture and traditions with the broader community. In closing, I would like to wish everyone in this Year of the Dragon every happiness, success and prosperity. Gilmore Electorate: Road Infrastructure Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (22:11): The New South Wales government recently announced a combined funding grant of $300,000 to enable a study to be done on the route options for the continuation of the Main Road 92 project. Goulburn, Palerang, Shoalhaven, Upper Lachlan and Yass Valley councils have put $100,000 towards this study, while the New South Wales government will make up the rest. Stage 1 of the road was completed in 2008, but the upgrade terminates at Nerriga. Two options are on the table. Option A, which has always been the preferred option of the Shoalhaven City Council, has the road continuing on through Tarago and then on to the Federal Highway and out at Gunning. Option B has the road continuing along the existing Braidwood Road corridor, spilling out on the Kings Highway just west of Braidwood. Shoalhaven council, a strong advocate for the road, recently applied for federal RDA funding to upgrade the bridge at the Oallan Ford. This crossing has to be upgraded to lend viability for the extension of roadworks along Main Road 92 that will enable it to carry heavy vehicles. Considerable effort was made to impress upon the minister how vital this road is for the economic well-being of the future of the Shoalhaven. Surely, if any case for a direct investment with real returns could be made, this was it. However, we were unsuccessful. Instead $1.67 million went to the adjoining Labor electorate for Four Winds festival at Bermagui. No doubt the residents of Bermagui were rightly delighted, but I for one could not see how this investment represents a superior case to that put by the Shoalhaven. It was the Howard government which recognised the value such a road link would deliver to energise the flagging economies of the South Coast, long neglected by successive Labor governments. Some of us here would well remember John Sharp, a former transport minister in the coalition government. We in the Shoalhaven will always be indebted to him for giving us the funding for this road. It was the Howard government that backed the call with hard cash and drove the project: $34 million from the government and $34 million finally from the state. The whole project would never have happened if the Shoalhaven City Council had not put $12 million on the table to start it. The fact of the matter is the Carr Labor government was a reluctant player and made no secret of the fact that it was more concerned with proliferating national parks. That it took 10 years to construct the road, even after funding was made available, with a cost overrun to the New South Wales government of some $15 million, stands as testimony to the charge that it dragged its feet. Imagine my surprise when the road was finished and the official opening took place. Who arrived enthusiastically to grab the glory and the photo op when the road was finished? None other than the state Labor member for Kiama, whose seat was not even in the area where the road was built, and the current federal member for Eden-Monaro, who had only just been elected. The fact that I did not even get an invitation until this government was eventually embarrassed into extending me an invitation was not lost on the the residents of Nerriga. They knew exactly how this road came about. So they took it upon themselves to have their own, unofficial opening at which I was the official dignitary together with the former Mayor of Shoalhaven, Councillor Greg Watson, a major player in Main Road 92. To say I was humbled by the experience would be an understatement. I can confidently say that the final completion of Main Road 92 is one of our region's top priorities. This recent funding for a scoping study, generously provided, recognises the need to keep things moving. I am forever hopeful this federal government will put its money where its mouth is when says it supports regional areas and join the New South Wales government and stakeholder councils to see through to the end Main Road 92. If Labor is fair dinkum when it says it supports regional Australia then I call on every candidate who is putting up their hand for Labor preselection in Gilmore to promise unreservedly to make Main Road 92 their No. 1 priority if elected. I also thank my state colleague Shelley Hancock, Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, for her efforts in obtaining the state funding of $200,000. To have the 54-kilometre road finally sealed will be of enormous benefit to all regional councils. Schools",160
199,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT," The American education reformer Horace Mann once said the public school 'is the greatest discovery ever made by man'. My electorate contains many large schools like Raceview, Silkstone and Brassall state schools, all of which received $3 million in the Building Education Revolution. But in my electorate I am proud to have delivered unprecedented funding to the small rural schools in rural Ipswich and the Somerset. In these rural communities west and north-west of Ipswich these small schools were much neglected by the previous, coalition government. Flagpoles were what they thought the schools needed. The heart of these communities is the rural school. It is a place not just for education but for friendship and fellowship. It is a place that connects people. It is a place that offers country kids the joy of learning and a window to the world. It provides an equality of opportunity that would not have happened but for the funding of good facilities in small country schools. With 64 schools in my electorate of Blair receiving it approximately $107 million for state-of-thewith art libraries, school halls, science and language centres, performing arts facilities, classrooms and special needs facilities, my electorate has really received a lot of assistance from this federal Labor government. And these facilities would not have existed but for this federal Labor government. In this Year of the Farmer I am particularly proud to have opened many new facilities in our much neglected small country schools. Those opposite declare that they represent the interests of rural and regional Australia, but it took a federal Labor government to bring these small schools into the 21st century. Just in the last week I opened a new library that cost $250,000, a $50,000 outdoor learning area and other improvements at Prenzlau State School, a school established in 1894. This funding will serve this community and its 24 students well into the future. This is a school that has been serving the community for a very long time. It is a school where the P&C president, Mr Terry the Herrmann, recounts that his family were among the first intake of students. I also opened the Marburg State School's multipurpose hall and other improvements worth $300,000. This school has three times the enrolments that it once had-about 62 students. That is only a fairly recent increase. Like Prenzlau, it has a proud heritage, having been established in 1879. Its long history of educating rural students goes back to times when it developed a forest plot. The school planted 275 trees, proving these rural schools ahead of their time. They taught about agriculture and horticulture. Today they would be called carbon farmers. Last year we saw a number of historic schools open new facilities. Clarendon State School got what it calls the Clarendome. This small school has about 60 students and is in the lower part of the Somerset region. It has what I think is probably one of the best ovals and sports facilities you could ever see, funded by this federal Labor government. They greatly appreciate it because it has become the heart: other small country schools use their facilities to come together for sporting activities and the kids get the opportunity to play sport on a collective and team basis. The Patrick Estate State School is also an 86-year-old school, near Lowood, and it received $300,000 for an outdoor living area. The facility is fondly named the Fishy Shed, in honour of Shirley Fisher, who is a former student and was a teacher aide 21 years. The facility services 51 students, double the number since last year. That shed was the basis from which the school was rebuilt after the devastation of the floods in January 2011. It is the same with the Harlin State School, where the new library is the place where the whole community meets. That 103-year-old school had 36 students last year and it now has 42. I could go on and on about how this federal Labor government has made a difference in rural and regional Queensland. To the eternal shame of those opposite, they have opposed every last dollar and every last cent into these schools. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Health Services",163
200,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT," I want to talk about the ongoing fight for better health services in the electorate of Flinders, in particular in the precincts of Hastings, Rosebud and the southern peninsula, and Phillip Island and the Bass Coast. We have made progress in all three areas in recent times, even though there have been some challenges and setbacks. Most recently, in the Hastings area, we have seen the town hit by the recent closure of the Hastings Medical Centre. The town as a consequence only has one clinic, known as the Hastings Clinic. Against that background, what we have set out to do is to work firstly with Peninsula Health, which has purpose-built medical rooms at the Hastings Community Health Centre from which it currently operates paediatric and antenatal clinics. Peninsula Health is working towards securing GPs to operate from these medical rooms and we are hopeful of an announcement soon. I would respectfully say to the board of Peninsular Health: 'Let not the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Do not seek too high a rent which would prevent doctors coming in and, firstly, participating and, secondly, offering for bulk-billing services.' If these rooms are vacant, it is far better to have somebody in what is currently a great but, tragically, empty facility with regard to the GP rooms. The second thing that is being done in relation to Hastings is that Neale Burgess, the state member for Hastings, and I are already in discussions with the Crib Point Medical Centre and there is work afoot to try to attract those doctors to open a second facility, this time in Hastings. They have been part of a broad-ranging program in Tooradin, Baxter, Crib Point and soon in Rosebud. That group of doctors will have established clinics in all four towns, so a fifth clinic in Hastings would be a real breakthrough. In the same vein, the Crib Point Medical Centre itself currently has surplus capacity. So I urge Hastings residents to make use of the Crib Point Medical Centre as an interim measure while we look to advance the Hastings Community Health Centre or to set up an additional clinic in Hastings involving and associated with those who have set up the Tooradin, Baxter, Crib Point and soon-to-be Rosebud clinics. This brings me to Rosebud. In Rosebud I am delighted that a new medical clinic, the Advantage Medical Centre, is about to open its doors. I will support any new clinic which comes to the area, and this is the latest. tremendous boost for the town. It gives local residents greater choice and flexibility and, along with a project which the member for Bowman helped inspect recently when he was in Flinders representing the Leader of the Opposition, it offers a great step forward. That project is the acquisition of a CAT scan for the public health services, which in turn will help lift the standing, the status and the longevity of the Rosebud Hospital. The hospital itself is not under threat but its services have diminished, and to offer a CAT scan facility has a double impact. It offers the CAT scan advantages but it also allows greater training and therefore greater attraction of young medical professionals. It is about attracting, retaining and developing staff. That is why it is such an important step forward. This brings me to the third area within the electorate of Flinders, which is the Bass Coast. I am particularly delighted that the Bass Coast Community Health Service is establishing aged care nurse practitioner clinics in Corinella, Grantville and San Remo. A nurse practitioner is a registered nurse who functions in an advanced and extended clinical role, and who plays a critical role where a doctor is not directly available. They are very important to local communities and can make a huge difference in some of these small towns. And the next step is a very important one. That is to bring together the funds from the Warley Hospital trust with federal funding and to work with the Bass Coast Community Health Service to secure expanded medical services for Phillip Island-a community health hub which, hopefully, will offer many of the features of a hospital and which will offer the community what it has lost. It will redress the balance which was taken away by this government. (Time expired) It is a Canberra Electorate: Trades Training",164
201,Ms BRODTMANN,ADJOURNMENT," Nearly two weeks ago the Prime Minister and the Minister for School Education, Peter Garrett, received a rock star reception when she officially opened the trade training centre at St Mary MACKillop in Isabella Plains in my electorate. The trade training centre is the first of four in the Catholic school system in the ACT. The other three are at St Clare's College in Griffith in my electorate, and at Merici and St Francis Xavier colleges in the electorate of Fraser. The opening had been months in the planning and was a major productionalmost an MGM production-thanks to the event organisation skills of the wonderful team at St Mary MACKillop College. While I am grateful to the entire school community, and those of the schools in the area and region, I would particularly like to thank the principal, Michael Lee, and Sandra Darley, Garry Seary, Karen Hundy, Cindy Dean, Aiden Brunskil, Tony Lazzarato, Kim Maloney and Janelle Maas-all from St Mary MACKillop College-Mark Hogan, from the Catholic Education Office, and Father John Armstrong, parish priest from Corpus Christi-the former Holy Family parish-who did the blessing. He stepped in at the last minute because the Monsignor unfortunately had an accident. I would like to thank all of them for making the day such a success. The Prime Minister and the minister were greeted by a procession of students at every turn from local schools: St Francis of Assisi, St Anthony's, St Clare of Assisi, Holy Family and the lovely parish of St Gregory's at Queanbeyan. Tyler Friend and Ashley Evans, the school chief captains, did a wonderful job of escorting the Prime Minister 'hither and yon'. Liam Pitt provided the acknowledgement of country and Liam Brown, the Indigenous Support Officer, performed on the didgeridoo. Maria Suraci, who has the voice of an angel, sang an evocative version of the national anthem, and little Joseph Sergi from St Gregory's in Queanbeyan had everyone in stitches with his speech and his reference to Joseph, Mary and baby Jesus as the first working family. In honour of the Prime Minister's Welsh heritage, the choir sang the Sunset Prayer of Reverend Eli Jenkins from Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas. It was a very, very moving rendition of that beautiful piece. As if that were not enough, the Prime Minister and Minister Garrett then went on a tour of the new trade training centre. The centre, which was built thanks to a $5.7 million investment across the four schools, trains students in hospitality and construction. The Prime Minister and Minister Garrett mingled with students and guests and shared a brief afternoon tea in Cafe Bella, which had been upgraded last year as part of the construction of the trade training centre. We also had the opportunity to experience and indulge in the wonderful food that was prepared in the new industrial kitchen that has been built as part of this trade training centre. The students did a beautiful spread and many of them are mini master chefs. We all ate way too much for an afternoon tea. The Prime Minister and Minister Garrett also had the opportunity to speak with students who were developing basic woodwork skills and building a house on site.",165
202,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member will refer to the minister by his title.,166
203,Ms BRODTMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker. All of the students praised the centre and the training they were receiving. Some wanted to go on to study a trade as a result. Others thought it gave them a skill to help them through uni. All of them spoke about the world of new career options opened up by the centre. I am looking forward to attending the official opening of the St Clare's College centre, which is currently under construction. I was at St Clare's recently to present my School Legends awards to some of the recipients there, and saw the progress to date. At the moment, it is just a big pit in the ground, but I am very much looking forward to watching it grow over the coming year and attending the official opening some time later in the year or early next year. I am also looking forward to the official opening of the Tuggeranong Sustainable Living Trade Training centres, which are being built at Erindale College, Lake Tuggeranong College, Calwell High School, Caroline Chisholm High School, Lanyon High School, Wanniassa Senior School, and Namadgi School thanks to an $8.1 million investment from the Gillard government. Canberra has a significant skills shortage. In fact it is acute according to the Canberra Business Council, particularly in trades. This skills shortage has the potential to impact on our future growth and prosperity. That is why the investment in these centres is so important. They go a long way towards addressing the trades skills shortage here in Canberra, while giving students hands-on training to prepare them for the workforce. They are a very welcome addition to the vocational education landscape here, and provide a range of career and money-making options so that our students can realise their full potential, reduce our skills shortage and contribute to the future prosperity of the ACT.

This Labor Australians by threatening our economic stability understand what this country needs. It is The aspirations and goals of so many Australians government's self-serving survivalist nature. the very people this government should represent, own agenda, to focus internally on its own forgotten Australians-those hard working government spends most of its time The point is this: since this Labor government real household wealth have declined. Australians years ago-working to own their own homes and they aspire to-but this Labor government have pressure on Australians achieving their aspirations. hard working Australians harder, not easier. forgotten Australians, they would know that in our lives make it harder, not easier to get ahead. Let me put this into context how this Labor the four biggest budget deficits in Australian billion surplus into $167 billion of accumulated 22.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 26.2 massive $133 billion of debt, equating to child-a debt burden that will be carried across Labor government has turned a $20 billion surplus a $20 million a day interest bill-a bill that Labor's addiction to wasteful spending is Australian business. It is adding pressure independent of Reserve Bank decisions. Debt, Labor Party. As I have said in this place before, Labor budget surplus handed down. The Labor deficit. Compare this with the 10 coalition statistics is clear: the Labor Party is under government spending. It is this addiction that our country's history. It is in Labor's DNA deficits just as much as it is in the coalition's money. Just like all addicts, this Labor government addiction. In a direct hit on the Australian attempting to disguise its addiction by penalising Australians have been hit with 19 new and increased Labor government is making the aspirations costs of living are increasing for everyday less affordable. Interest rates are going up. are understood and respected by the key government is betraying a generation of and way of life, and miserably failing to for this reason that I rise to speak today. are under threat due to this Labor Instead of a respect for the forgotten Australians, this government has chosen to pursue its political survival instead of listening to the Australians simply trying to get ahead. This listening to pollsters and spin doctors. took power in 2007 home affordability and are not working any less than they were four maintain their lifestyles, the very things that continually taken moves that have put real They have consistently made the lives of If this Labor government were listening to those higher taxes and greater government intervention government has lost its way. It has delivered history. This government has turned a $20 deficits, by taking government spending from per cent of GDP. It has managed to stack up a $6,000 for every Australian man, woman and generations. Australians have watched as this into $100 million a day in borrowings with is having lasting damage on our fiscal position. having a broad implications for Australians and to interest rates, which have begun to rise deficits and borrowing are nothing new for the in my lifetime there has not been a single Party is heading towards its 10th consecutive surpluses out of 12 budgets. The truth of these the influence of a long-term addiction to wasteful has caused the four biggest budget deficits into waste taxpayers' money and produce budget DNA to be prudent when spending taxpayers' is making its best efforts to disguise its people and the Australian way of life Labor is the taxpayer. Over the past four years, taxes. What that says to me is that this of Australians less achievable in 19 ways. The Australians in 19 new ways. Home ownership is Real wages have declined. Real household wealth has declined. Net job availability has declined paint a good picture for the future of Australia. There is a better way. We once again need cut wasteful spending and reduce the tax government that is guided by a belief that they only have the people's money held in trust. to achieve their aspirations, we again need always better than a handout. We need a government always better than subsidy. We need a government should have freedom of choice and we need penalising it. We need a government that recognises problem, that all too often it is the problem. does them better. These are the fundamental principles that principles that the Labor Party will never understand. know how to spend your money better than anyone government know better than you. They will more of your money. Let us look at Labor's and mismanagement from a government that refuses and executed programs. Over the past four years, boxes at $700-something that could have been than half the price. We have seen a billion dollars dollars to pull them out again. We have seen taxpayers' money. All of this waste and mismanagement leaves our country. This government speculate that year. Even if we are to believe this speculation, past record, even if we could count on this repayment, off the debt. That is like having a $20,000 credit in a year. At that rate, by the time Australia 110 years old. That will see Australians of working lives repaying this Labor debt, Australians are aware that we must take personal Australians also rely on us as legislators to make Australians do not expect or want governments more difficult. Yet this Labor government have reckless decisions and mismanagement It is clear that this Labor government is out it once claimed to represent. The last thing their hard earned dollars will be used to fund and overly bureaucratic government. The locals their government takes pressure off budgets, economy that has increasing job opportunities, as they have to, and that their government values and productivity has stagnated. This does not a government that will scrap unnecessary taxes, burden on business. Once again we need a governments do not have any money of their own; If Australians are to have every opportunity a government that understands that a hand-up is that understands that opportunity is that understands that all Australians a government that rewards hard work instead of that it may not have a solution to every We need a government that does fewer things but will always guide us as Liberals. These are the While we will always believe that you else, the Labor Party will believe that the always be driven by a desire to spend more and record. We have seen a constant example of waste to rein in its expenses on poorly planned we have seen a program giving away set-top purchased and installed commercially for less to install Pink Batts and then another billion school hall rip-offs, with a blatant disregard for Australians asking what the future holds for they will repay $1.5 billion off their debt next which seems highly unlikely based on their at this rate it will take 89 years to pay card bill and paying $223 off the credit card is once again in the black, I will be, potentially, our generation destined to spend their entire which was incurred in just four years. responsibility for our financial future, but this task as easy and as practical as possible. to be acting in ways that will make this task left our generation to carry the burden of their across the course of our working lives. of touch with the aspirations of the people that that the people of my community expect is that the waste and mismanagement of an inefficient in my community have a fair expectation that that their government facilitates a prosperous that their government lives within its means, their money and delivers better services and infrastructure. Our country will face challenges debt burden of Labor. Our generation will see we will inevitably have a much greater burden base. We will face the challenges of a post these challenges from a position of strength. we now have. To meet these challenges we economy and we need to see more Australians see the fundamental philosophical divide in our tax a nation into prosperity, we as Liberals forefather of the Liberal tradition in this reduction party.' Menzies understood then, as would be the best of all incentives to As I said in my first speech in this place, it opportunity. We are the party based on encouragement up rather than on a hand down. It is because fight for lower taxes, smaller and more efficient choose. It is these principles and this core fundamental difference between the coalition government will cut the waste and mismanagement; Australia. Under a coalition government we will see development and a modern enterprise economy engagement. Under a coalition government the and the country will stop borrowing $100 million on interest rates, helping Australian small businesses and rising operating costs for businesses. maximise every available opportunity to plan strong prosperous economy is to get spending means less borrowing, lower pressure The two sides of politics could not be further the major political parties are moving closer There is only one side of politics with a strong nation of limitless opportunities, but we also need to prepare for the future. May I, once again, look to Menzies. When campaign, he said: We need to return to politics as a clash of principles only of warring personalities. The modern Labor Party is nothing more than party devoid of any principles, driven only the chamber are prepared to debate principles. the Liberal tradition, stand for lower taxes, Menzies was correct when he said 'We are contrast to the 19 new or increased taxes of in the future. Our generation will carry the the challenges of an ageing population whereby on government, drawing from a smaller tax mining boom economy. We as a nation must meet We must take advantage of the opportunities that need to grow the productive capacity of the earning higher real wages. It is here that we nation. While Labor still believe that they can know the exact opposite to be true. As the great country, Sir Robert Menzies, said, 'We are a tax the coalition does today, that 'real tax reductions increase effort, earnings and production'. is the Liberal side of politics that is the side of rather than on subsidy and on a hand of these philosophical beliefs that we will always government and the individual's right to belief held by the coalition which underline the and this Labor government.

We will put downward pressure and families, easing the cost of living We in the coalition believe that we need to for our future. We believe that the key to a down so that we can get productivity up. That on interest rates and less tax. apart. Popular media all too often claim that together. This could not be further from the truth. plan for Australia's future.

We on this side of We on this side of the chamber, continuing in smaller government and an individual's choice. a tax reduction party,' which stands in stark this Labor government. It is our commitment to these principles that saw the previous coalition real wages, a 100 per cent increase in the million new jobs. Higher productivity cannot from government interference. Higher productivity hard working Australians. It occurs when businesses free from red tape. The coalition will achieve businesses, helping small businesses with interest rates and operating costs. A coalition tape expenses by requiring government departments regulations and quantify the cost of their Australia, a plan that will see a stronger productivity up.

230,Mr BROADBENT,BILLS," Today an historic event in the life of the parliament in the lead up to that there were conversations which were the front and back benches of the the hearts and minds of the Australian people that may have been opportune for the member light at the end of the tunnel, that the combined Labor Party was looking at a review Having said that, it was a hope not only and the electorate of Gippsland, where we are coal opportunity and all of the issues that surround at as a nation, and which the world is also change of leadership was to happen in this House carbon tax if I became Prime Minister of this that some consensus of common Like all members of parliament I get argument, and that is for us to deal with as any issue to try to come up with what is best opportunities. What I saw in this possible review gone down at the moment with regard to the counts. The main one is that at this time, when manufacturing is under pressure because of the ideas and the research and the development may go onto the market across the world born have a pressure on them now because of the difficult for them. Of course, in my simple thinking if you then us more disadvantaged, you are going to come government deliver a 20 per cent increase in net wealth for each Australian and more than two be mandated by government. It does not come is born out of creativity and ingenuity of are part of a strong economy and are set higher productivity by cutting red tape for small their books by putting downward pressure on government will save $1 billion a year in redand agencies to set targets to reduce regulations. The coalition has a strong plan for economy by getting government spending down and and repay the debt, easing the pressure on to once again become tangible realities. As the our greatest responsibility in this place is to not harder. The coalition will once again restore I cannot help but note that there has been in that a Prime Minister has been challenged, and between the challenger and his constituency, Labor Party and, to a further extent, a jump to through the press corps and any other medium to get a message across. In doing so I saw a wisdom of the parliamentary party of the of the carbon tax through the challenger. for Australia but for my electorate of MCMillan sitting on perhaps thousands of years of brown the emissions controls that we need to look looking at. In the consideration that perhaps a today, one leader said, 'I would review the country again.' For me, that was a ray of hopesense might come into the debate. bombarded from both sides of the emissions we sift through the information we are given on for the nation, the Australian people and future was a clear intention that the road we have carbon tax is wrong for the nation on many the dollar is at the heights that it is, our that. Growth opportunities for small businessthat have gone into possible new products that out of Australian ideas and opportunitieshigh Australian dollar. That makes it more invade that situation with a tax that will make to a place where the rest of the world must be looking at us and saying, 'Why, when you supposedly you imposing a tax in front of what the world going to do to your own economy, nationally?' You have the protagonist in the former Prime why did we have the tax in the first place? We did not have the tax in the first place because was not the reason we had the tax. We had the an election campaign only 18 months ago, government I lead.' Why did she say that when Labor Party at that time was, 'The carbon tax brutal and forthright in that election campaign. through that same press gallery, through television message across, 'There will be no carbon tax get a carbon tax? On the other side, Mr Abbott be a carbon tax. But the truth was that both carbon tax, even though they had said previously trading scheme. I spoke to an elderly lady the other day something about our emissions.' There is concern get the story. But for the next 30 years we are with as a nation.

There is concern within do not say you are going to do something and to do something and then do it, because that business. Two: now that we have got the tax, by a future leader of the Labor Party that it order to bring it in line with the rest of the would be $5. But, hang on, you have not got the people of Australia, and they still want money for it. We heard from the two previous speakers communities. That is not what I am on about. parliamentary wisdom said that we should detrimental to the nation? But, long term, the that we have to do something about our emissions. Australian people gave us a hung parliament. government. Out of 150 members in the House, the Labor government. The deal was: you will member for Melbourne's vote. So I say to the people of Australia and nation at the moment, if you are feeling under have all these things going for you, are is doing without consideration of what it is Minister saying, 'Look, there's an issue here.' So either of the major parties desired it. That Prime Minister of the day, Ms Gillard, before say, 'There will be no carbon tax under a the broad consensus of the leadership of the is not for this country at this time'? She was She said to the Australian people many times and however else she wanted to get that under a government that I lead.' So why did we said that as sure as light follows day there will parties were saying that there would not be a that we would move towards an emissions who said, 'Russell, we really should be doing in the community about our emissions. We reliant on coal. So we have some issues to deal the Australian people honestly that there will lead. So why did we get a carbon tax?

We see on the needs of the people of Australia, not themselves over the leadership of their political the trust of the Australian people. We see a dinkum by most Australians. They have seen would be no carbon tax under a government government made to the member for Denison promised east Timor solution. On all of these articulated by the Prime Minister-an actual with the member for Denison, promising that forming a government, would support mandatory what happened? As soon as it suited this Prime were left with just another example of We also see that the Australian people cannot with money. Before us today we have appropriation today will be the endless waste and mismanagement this government tries to fix something it seems new scheme to save us money, we seem to plans to save the planet, we find that our jobs moving offshore. Of course this is just a political clinging to power just a little longer. But, dysfunction and mismanagement is having a real paid jobs are more difficult to find because interest rates are higher than they need to actions of this government through new taxes that, the impact of the carbon tax is yet to be realised. To give you an example of how out of touch that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries $100 million through these bills, recently encouraged the department to change its mission 'fisheries' and 'forestry'. Is there anything removed the words 'agriculture', 'fisheries' electorate do not care how the department carbon tax and some degree of confidence that work that they do.

It certainly has been interesting to a government tearing itself apart-not focused focused on our future, but busy fighting amongst party. We see a Prime Minister who has lost Prime Minister whose word is not considered fair the promise the Prime Minister made that there she led. They saw the promise that the in relation to gambling reform.

We are going airlines and we are going to actively to our local carriers. Many airlines around the world will be flying carbon tax free. Their is a tax that is bad for our country and that Let me quote the words of Professor Garnaut in Professor Garnaut said: These higher prices will require households to the same goods and services purchased before the households' real incomes and purchasing power. I could not agree with him more. He has really real incomes and purchasing power. Thank Independents for supporting this carbon tax, What does the government say? They say: better off.' The Prime Minister says, 'Trust member for Denison I would not be trusting better off. If I were the average Australian would be 20c a week better off. If I were a my business I would be very concerned about a government that said we were going to have a $37 billion.

My electorate is in suburban electorate, 15 or so kilometres out from the families, hard-working people and small business which confront them, I believe, also are very Australian community. There are three issues me which I would like to touch on today: manufacturing. The first, cost-of-living pressures, constantly raised with me when I am out equally would have this issue raised with them. cost overruns. We do not know what risks we have it is a pretty fair bet that we cannot trust this it is of great concern. Yes, we want high-speed way and we want it done within a reasonable is not reasonable, is not sustainable and is is not targeting the worse areas first, and that is sense to look at those areas where broadband is But what do we do?

It is of This government cannot be trusted. This should be offered an election so that they can of its faults-too many to mention here in the speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012 are in front of us. I would like to use the national issues which are confronting my Melbourne. It is very much a middle-income centre of Melbourne. It is made up of middleclass people-aspirational people. So the issues likely to be issues that confront the broader particularly which they have been raising with cost-of-living pressures, job security and would be one of the issues which gets in the community, and I am sure other members It gets raised in the churches, it gets raised at school fetes, it gets raised when you are at reason is that people know that the cost-of-living rising more rapidly than their wages or pensions. the necessary items which you and I and every groceries, electricity, water, medical expenses up well in excess of wages or The difficulties which constituents of mine statistics. When you look at the official statistics you see that they have gone up already by water bills have gone up by 46 per cent since per cent since 2008-an enormous increase in impacts on your household budget. It is something winter and particularly in a cooler climate heater on. If you are a pensioner, you are your heater on. Gas prices have gone up 30 up 20 per cent since 2008. I think you are Oakeshott: the official statistics directly back ground are telling me and telling There are many reasons why prices go up there are supply and demand issues which impact significant impact on prices through its policy policy settings have been set in the wrong direction up unnecessarily. That is unforgivable. Yes, of supply and demand pressures, but, when the that is what is unforgivable. I want to talk about a few areas where this macro level, because at the macro level government has now for four years in a row-$37 $50 billion the year before; the three biggest upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure that I have of the government. Its fiscal policy pressure on interest rates. My second criticism is at the individual level. government is having an impact on prices going electricity prices is something that is hurting pensioners and other people on low incomes doing? To start with, some of its renewable designed, are putting up electricity prices. On us in this chamber know. From the government's additional 10 per cent to the price of electricity. you it is a 20 per cent increase. There will be alone in subsequent years when the carbon tax will continue to go up through a measure of the footy or cricket clubs on the weekends. The pressures on basic household goods are These are not discretionary items; these are family has to rely upon: petrol, food and and the like. These are the things that are going the official CPI indexation rate. articulate to me are backed up by the official of some of these basic household necessities an extraordinary amount. For example, people's 2008. Their electricity bills have gone up by 50 electricity bills, which, of course, directly that you cannot not use, particularly in like Melbourne, where you do need to have your often in your house all day and you need to have per cent since 2008; medical expenses have gone starting to get the picture, Deputy Speaker up what constituents and local residents on the other members in this chamber. in excess of the CPI or of our wages. Of course, prices. But a government can also have a settings. My critique is that this government's and so they are deliberately putting prices of course, prices will increase over time because government itself is causing prices to go up, government has done that. Let me start with the if you run large budget deficits, which this billion this year, $50-odd billion, a further budget deficits in Australian history-that puts on interest rates. That is the first criticism puts upward pressure on all prices and upward When you look at individual items, again the up. Let me start again with electricity. High everybody, and it is particularly hurting or low fixed incomes. What is the government energy policies, which have been poorly top of that is what is coming on 1 July, as all of own figures, the carbon tax will add an If you ask the electricity sector, they will tell a 10 per cent increase in the first year alone, let is legislated to increase. So electricity prices the government. That is my critique. Let me look at gas prices. Again, with the carbon tax, gas the first year alone and will continue to go up. Let us look at child care, another item that two parents at work or if you are a single parent child care. What has the government done in was cap the rebate so that many families are hitting my view, the worse thing they have done is change it was one staff member to five children, they this year, it must be one staff member to four children. As you can appreciate, in a childcare centre if you force a childcare centre to go from increasing your operational costs by about childcare prices. You could say that that is improving ask what the government has to do with this says four to one is better than five to one; and own right whether they want four to one or they can go along to that and it will be a cheaper am sure there would be a childcare centre I mention one childcare centre in my community. chamber, Mrs Kulkarni, has written to me saying the fees for her this year. She asked: Why are we being penalised for working hard and ratios will not make a life-changing impact on my he starts school. All of us were very But, no, the government here in Canberra knows eastern Melbourne! That is what I find egregious. service and we have childcare centres happy does the government do? It has to get its fingers for the childcare centre and not good enough for a result the prices will go up by 21 per Parents will pull their kids out and parents problem that is contributing to a lack of productivity, design like this from an overbearing government Health care is the next item on my list. insurance rebate will cause an increase in all an estimated 10 per cent across the board, people will pull out and go to the already taxpayer overall it will be more expensive. I adds to the cost-of-living pressures of everyday Australia. It is not just the policy designs that have number of targeted tax increases which have cigarettes, motor cars and alcohol. prices are forecast to increase by nine per cent in is not a discretionary expenditure. If there are who works, you need to put your child into relation to child care? The first thing they did that cap. But that is not the worse thing. In the childcare staff-to-child ratios. Whereas changed it and mandated that, from 1 January your staffing is your major operational cost so, five to one to four to one, you are in essence 20 per cent. That flows directly through to the quality of the childcare centre. But I when: (a) there is no categorical research that (b) why can't parents themselves decide in their five to one? If they are happy with five to one, childcare centre. If they want four to one, I where there is a four to one ratio. A woman I have mentioned before in this that there has been a 21 per cent increase in paying our taxes? The changes in staff-to-children two-year-old now or over the next three years until happy with the care being provided before. what is best for my constituents in outer We have residents who are happy with the with the service they are providing. But what in there and say, 'Oh, no, it's not good enough the parents; it's got to be four to one,' and as cent. Thanks very much! What will happen then? will not be able to work. We have a participation which is a problem. It is poor policy which is also contributing to price increases. We debated this last week. Changes to the health health insurance premiums, which will go up by according to Deloitte. That will mean that some overburdened public hospital system, and for the fail to see how that is good public policy. It just families in my electorate and, indeed, across led to price increases; there have also been a put up prices for everybody on things like Prices have been forced up for residents. The carbon tax will add an additional $400 will not be added to the cost of a Hyundai, to the cost of a Holden, a Toyota or a Ford, Australia. It is unbelievable. Do you think that weather be different because we are adding No, it will not. All it will do is make those jobs in the Australian motor car industry. Not only have we had taxes increased but many people had their family tax benefits electorate alone were impacted by that. Even income, independent business owners-have provided a little bit of tax relief for those At the macro level we have a poor policy have poor policy design in a number of areas-which have had benefits removed. All of those things everyday Australians both in my electorate and government. Sure, there are supply and demand put in place poor policies, increased taxes or control of their budget, which is In the last couple of minutes I have available manufacturing.

The first Elizabeth is an iconic South Australian industry recent times, there has been considerable Australia-rightly so, because the two are linked. people are working it is a sign of a strong security for Australian families. Long-term to Australian families but to whole The notion that we are debating goes to the thousands of people not only in South Australia Motors Holden's operations in Australia were a cascading effect through other employment that that includes Aboriginal and Torres I have to say-by Noel Pearson, who does say that removed and an antiracial discrimination clause is Islander people will go backwards.

In public debate about the economy and jobs in A strong economy means more jobs, and if economy. A strong economy and jobs mean jobs and economic security are important not only communities and the country as a whole. heart of jobs and economic security for tens of but right around the country. If General to cease or even be scaled back there would be sectors and, in turn, through communities across the country. The Gillard government well understands well understands that. The only political party coalition, both here in federal politics and parties do not understand the importance of the nation as a whole. That is why earlier Kim Carr and South Australian Premier Jay speak to executives of GM and Ford in order operations in Australia. Senator Carr and Premier Weatherill should my motion. They should be commended because message to all about the importance of the industry sector and it is important to the lives depend on it. Their visit to Detroit and the work in that industry gave them hope for the the automotive sector is finding it very difficult political leadership was needed, securing the industry was such a time. I commend Senator time to go and speak directly with the heads argue that we should stop supporting the auto of its importance to our economy, to the creation that industry. The GMH plant at Elizabeth effectively critical to the economy of Adelaide's northern earlier, the plant employs about 2,500 employees. recall that only a few years ago the figure was has generated hundreds of millions of dollars industries in Edinburgh Parks, located components on a just-in-time production system. happened during the time that I was mayor of it was not only to GMH but to the region as reliant on those businesses that have established multihundred-million dollar investment, which Each of those businesses there not only industries around the country. So the importance just the region within which they are located. have said, run into tens of thousands. But there lost, as we have seen in other communities around Riverina would understand the impact of what because, apart from the jobs being lost, what costs-people defaulting on their mortgages, certainly happen in the region that I represent its operations. When members opposite criticise the government consider what the alternative social costs would collapses. Even doing a very basic calculation that. The South Australian government that does not seem to understand that is the at state level in South Australia. These coalition the automotive industry to South Australia and to this year the Minister for Manufacturing Senator Weatherill travelled to Detroit in the USA to to secure a long-term future for GM and Ford be commended for doing so, and that is part of their trip to the USA sent a very clear car industry to Australia. It is important as an of tens of thousands of people who directly USA sent a very clear message to the people that future, knowing full well that around the world right now. If ever there was a time when long-term future of the Australian automotive Carr and Premier Weatherill for making the of the automotive sector in the USA. Those who industry take a simplistic, narrow-minded view of jobs and to the lives of workers within started off in 1958, and it has been region for nearly 50 years now.

In the last decade alone, it of investment in the new automotive supply adjacent to the GMH plant and providing GMH I am very familiar with that because it the city of Salisbury and I know how important a whole and to so many other industries that are themselves at Edinburgh Parks. It truly is a today generates and creates thousands of jobs. today support the automotive industry but of those industries extends much further than The direct and indirect jobs created would, as I is a broader effect on the region when jobs are the country. I am sure that the member for happens to communities when jobs are lost we also then start seeing are higher social health costs rising and the like. That would if GMH was not there or started to scale down assistance to the automotive industry, be if we do not support that industry and it of income tax lost in one year alone if the plant were to close, you would soon find that government would probably be far, far greater That is without looking at unemployment payments, industry, and that is simply from that plant find alternative work in the long term, but that happen, they will need reskilling, because very highly skilled employees but they are skilling was part and parcel of their training GMH. It would be an absolute shame I have talked about the indirect job losses closing because the automotive industry in and advanced manufacturing expertise. The plant flow through to other industries. That implications and I just want to quickly talk about plant closes, the exports from that plant close. also decrease, and that means more imports. imports. That affects our balance of trade and impacts. The automotive industry in this country around 200,000 or more indirectly. Then if you that are somewhat associated with the automotive reliant on it. When we talk about support by this country, it is important that we put it happening in other countries. I am sure my has spoken on this issue on many occasions, will from the figures that I have seen that when putting on the table in terms of taxpayers' Australia-and we compare that with what is per person in the USA-we start to understand unreasonable. Furthermore, whatever the government three or four to one. So, again, what it is The last point I want to make refers to the position on it. The automotive industry does five-year forward plan program in place. They five years time in order to make the necessary say that they are going to cut $500 million automotive sector in this country is to create uncertainty for the industry. Let me assure members of the coalition communities that I speak to understand that, understand that and, certainly, the workers condemned for creating the uncertainty they living in the region I represent and which their intention to cut $500 million from government this country.

Yes, it is true that some employees might will not happen straight away. Even if it does the employees we have at GMH at Elizabeth are skilled for the job that they were doing. Their over the years as part of their employment with to lose those skills altogether. that would also flow as a result of the GMH plant this country underpins much of our engineering skills and know-how that emanate from the GMH would all be lost. But, of course, there are other a couple of them. One of them is this: if that The sales of Australian made cars in Australia So we reduce our exports and we increase our then there is a flow-on effect in other economic employs some 46,000 people directly and put on top of that all the manufacturing jobs industry, it is a huge base that is entirely the government for the automotive industry in into perspective by comparing it with what is colleague here the member for Wakefield, who talk about that comparison. It is clear to me we put on the table what this government is dollars-which equates to around $18 per person in happening overseas-with figures of up to $265 that the money that is being requested is not puts on the table is usually matched really doing is bringing money into this country. condemnation of the coalition for their particular not operate on a year-to-year basis. They need a need to know today what is going to happen in changes and investment. For the coalition to out of the government's support program for the uncertainty for the whole of the community and that the people I speak to understand that.

The coalition should be have in the minds and the lives of those families the member for Wakefield represents because of assistance to the automotive industry in",246

The indirect benefits that GMH brings to enormous. It is one of the most trusted Australians can drive a product built right standards and Australian workers, instils a deep us.

They need jobs, direct and indirect, of thousands of Makin, who said that when jobs are lost there unfortunately, end up defaulting on mortgages. Minister describes them, passes them off unfortunate thing to say. I believe the member for Makin when he says of Australia's engineering and manufacturing pointed out, quite correctly, fewer homemade correctly pointed out, our balance-of-trade figures. But one of the greatest threats looming large the carbon tax. To take effect from 1 July, including the automotive industry. It will send neither can afford nor need a carbon tax. The European economies in meltdown and the uncertainty it is simply unfathomable why carbon tax, which will hurt Australian families, which will hurt car makers such as GMH at Elizabeth.

That is want to send it on a slow boat to China. we keep building cars in this country, and that is cut, which is just the beginning because as of a billion dollar cut. It is a billion dollar cut to Make no mistake about it, that is their policy. and that is what they will do if they are the mover of this motion that the General South Australian industry directly employing contribution the General Motors Holden economy and the broader Australian I depart from simply acknowledging those facts into draw the mover of the motion's attention to absolutely ignored by this government. I think we need to consider that other industry in automotive, because the problems What are these problems? One of them particularly the impending carbon tax, which exposed and energy intensive, like the car increased costs and loss of competitiveness. Then the Australian workforce. There are high productivity has made up for that.

This governments of different political persuasions. as the completion date and therefore, with this is the year when the money has to start to governments. As shown in Senate estimates works by 2016, $7 billion is going to be needed and federal governments. There is currently a funding dispute government seems to be requesting an 80-20 government is requesting a fifty-fifty split way, at my end and for most residents on the funding to be secured by whatever means possible been seen too many times previously from both turn into broken promises pretty quickly. To put it into context, this is a road that It is a dangerous stretch of road. It has between depending on what part of the highway you are between Sydney and Brisbane, and so the conflict transport is a pretty dangerous mix. To date, with two horrific bus crashes, around 50 per years we have had about 50 per cent of the highway which both the state and federal governments 50 per cent done in just four years. But that can to keep both committed to that promise. Post has the opportunity to consult with the suggested by Mr Keilar. I hope they do. further discussions with Australia Post with a at Robina Village. I have already briefly visited shopping centre.

My office contact details have also their customers and local residents, who also to ensure that local Robina residents and to a delivery centre and post office boxes. I decisions that Australia Post is making-many businesses-have on our local community, and I with Australia Post in conjunction with the Pacific Highway to talk about the importance of the Pacific and of the four-year forward estimates to of the dual carriageway works on it between has been promised by both federal and state Both have committed to 2016 being possible budgets working on four-year forward estimates, show. This is a big challenge, I respect, for both last week, to complete the Pacific Highway from the combined efforts of both the state going on between the two parties. The state split on that $7 billion, whereas the federal on that funding over the next four years. Either North Coast, we want the job done.

It is therefore a huge challenge, have committed to, to get the remaining 45 to is the promise made by both, and I will do what I I note some of the politics of the moment want to see resolved. I have some quotes from for Cowper who, on 26 October 2009, when he government, said the following: The federal government has let the New South contribution of some $500 million up to 2014. This We should be demanding dollar-for-dollar funding increasing the federal contribution to the road time-frame. That was the member for Cowper's position today has changed. He seems to be now indicating, South Wales government, that he is an advocate government picks up 80 per cent of the tab That is in complete contrast Likewise, a very strong public advocate for north of my electorate, Andrew Fraser, on 21 The Pacific Highway is a state road that effectively government should pour the money in. Again, three years later I would hope that unfortunately, I think the position has changed 80-20 split rather than an acknowledgement that be funded by the state government on a 50-50 basis.

Sadly, that over the last week, but it was an important that over the next four years in a construction issue, therefore, is for the Commonwealth resolve this dispute as to whether it is an Certainly the federal government will push for this place, even from the National Party, they But in the end, from my perspective and on I think this is something that is of little interest more about just getting the job done. There was a horrific truck accident over on the side of the highway at Urunga and died some drivers who were five times over the limit off the road and killing the boy. These stories must be the funding in the state and federal promise by the two in an effort to protect budgets around the funding dispute, which we certainly members of this chamber, such as the member was in opposition and not trying to defend a Wales government off the hook in only requiring a compares to a federal contribution of $3.1 billion. from the New South Wales state government and project if it is to be completed within a realistic only three years ago, which I understand as of because there is a change in the New for the 80-20 model where the federal and New South Wales picks up only 20 per cent. to what he said three years ago. the Pacific Highway upgrade in a state seat just October 2009 said, when he was in opposition: causes the loss of one life a week. The state is what Mr Fraser continues to think. However, and again I think he is now an advocate for the it is a state road that at the very least should is the backbone of life on the North Coast of that this is a project that continues to various politicians of all political persuasions at least two dates that were promised and disappointing for the North Coast communities thankfully, a work schedule was released by the was lost a bit in the machinations of this place release of a work schedule which did demonstrate sense the 2016 deadline can be met.
